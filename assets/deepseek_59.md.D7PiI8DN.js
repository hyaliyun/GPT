It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons.

The people who were studied were between the age of 18 and 24 when the research began. The researchers who carried out the study say they consider the people fat if they are in the top of 5% of the measurement in which weight is linked to height. For example, fat women in the study were about 160 centimeters tall and weighed about 90 kilograms. Fat men in the study were about 175 centimeters tall and weighed 100 kilograms. The researchers say that more than 1,000,000 Americans are that big. The researchers found that fat young women were from wealthy families. The fat women also were 20% less likely to get married and they earned an average of about 6,700 a year less than other women. The study showed less effects on fat men. They earned an average of about 3,000 a year less than other men. Fat men also were 11% less likely to get married. Question: The researchers consider the people fat if _ .

William Ben Hogan (August 13, 1912 - July 25, 1997) was an American professional golfer who is generally considered to be one of the greatest players in the history of the game. He was born within six months of Sam Snead and Byron Nelson, who were two other acknowledged golf greats of the 20th century. Hogan is notable for his profound influence on golf swing theory and his legendary ball-striking ability. His nine career professional major championships tie him with Gary Player for fourth all-time, trailing only Jack Nicklaus (18), Tiger Woods (14) and Walter Hagen (11). Hogan was born in Stephenville, Texas, the third and youngest child of Chester and Clara (Williams) Hogan. His father was a blacksmith and the family lived ten miles southwest in Dublin until 1921, when they moved 70 miles (112 km) northeast to Fort Worth. When Hogan was nine years old in 1922, his father Chester committed suicide with a self-inflicted gunshot at the family home. By some accounts, Chester committed suicide in front of him, which some (including Hogan biographer James Dodson) have cited as the cause of his introverted personality in later years. The family incurred financial difficulties after his father's suicide, and the children took jobs to help their seamstress mother make ends meet. Older brother Royal quit school at age 14 to deliver office supplies by bicycle, and nine-year-old Ben sold newspapers after school at the nearby train station. A tip from a friend led him to caddying at the age of 11 at Glen Garden Country Club, a nine-hole course seven miles (11 km) to the south. One of his fellow caddies at Glen Garden was Byron Nelson, later a tour rival. The two would tie for the lead at the annual Christmas caddie tournament in December 1927, when both were 15. Nelson sank a 30-foot putt to tie on the ninth and final hole. Instead of sudden death, they played another nine holes; Nelson sank another substantial putt on the final green to win by a stroke. The following spring, Nelson was granted the only junior membership offered by the members of Glen Garden. Club rules did not allow caddies age 16 and older, so after August 1928, Hogan took his game to three scrubby daily-fee courses: Katy Lake, Worth Hills, and Z-Boaz.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What grinds rocks over time?\\" is \\"wind.\\" This natural phenomenon is responsible for a type of weathering known as abrasion. Wind abrasion involves the grinding of rocks over long periods of time due to the movement of particles, such as sand or small rocks, against the rock surface. These particles are carried by the wind and collide with the rocks, causing their gradual wearing down. This process, combined with other weathering processes caused by wind, contributes to the overall deterioration and reshaping of the Earth's landscape. Wind is not the only force responsible for weathering; chemical, biological, and other physical forces can also cause rock to break down over time.

Article: In October, Ubayd Steed, a sixth grader in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, was taking a math test when he noticed a classmate looking at his paper. \\" I quickly turned my paper over,\\" he said. Later that day, Ubayd met the cheater and told him not to do it again. Unfortunately, Ubayd' s experience is not unusual. Whether it's kids copying class -mates' answers during tests or friends sharing homework, cheating happens in schools every day. Experts say the behavior starts in the lower grades. Surveys show that one in three elementary students admits to cheating. Jacob Harder, a fourth grader in Ware, Massachusetts, has had classmates ask to copy his homework. \\"I wouldn't want to just tell them the answers,\\" he says. So instead, he explains the task and encourages his classmates to do it themselves. But many kids find it hard to say no. \\"l hear from kids all the time, ' I can' t say no to a friend,'\\" says Eric Anderman, a professor at The Ohio State University who studies cheating in school. He says it' s important to say no from the start. \\"Then you _ , and the other kid gets the message,\\" he says. Plus, he points out, \\"a real friend is not going to disown you because he or she couldn't copy your math homework.\\" The kids doing the copying may feel they need to cheat to be accepted by other kids. And some students may cheat simply because others do. \\"If you' re in an atmosphere where cheating is common, you may think that if you don' t cheat, you' re at a disadvantage,\\" says Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. But Josephson says students shouldn't think that way. \\"There are a lot of things kids do,\\" he says. \\"You have to decide what kind of person you' re going to be.\\" When school becomes too challenging, Anderman suggests going to the teacher rather than relying on the work of others. \\"It' s good to ask for help,\\" he says.

Context: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses.

Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him.

Despite being a busy Friday night, our reservation was promptly honored, and we were escorted to our table, which was beautifully set up for our special occasion. The atmosphere of the restaurant was cozy and inviting, with soft lighting that heightened the sophisticated ambiance. Soft instrumental tunes played in the background, enhancing the overall dining experience and creating the perfect setting in which to savor the delicacies that awaited us.

They have successfully married flavors from diverse culinary traditions, offering an impressive array of dishes incorporating Asian, European, and South American cuisines. Our knowledgeable and friendly waiter expertly guided us through the menu and offered thoughtful suggestions based on our preferences and dietary restrictions. For starters, we shared the \\"Taste of Fusion\\" sampler, which was a stunning array of bite-sized delights, including crispy and tender coconut shrimp, juicy lamb ceviche crostini, and mouthwatering vegetable tempura. Each dish was artfully presented, with attention to detail that elevated the experience to a new level.

The flavors were perfectly balanced, and the portion sizes were generous without being overbearing. During our meal, the staff maintained an optimal level of attentiveness, ensuring that our water glasses were always filled, and our dishes were cleared promptly. Our waiter checked in on us just the right number of times, making sure we were enjoying our experience while being considerate of our privacy and conversation. To wrap up the evening, we indulged in a delectable assortment of desserts. The chocolate lava cake, in particular, was a decadent treat with a velvety-smooth texture, and it flowed like molten lava as we dove into it with our spoons. Alongside our desserts, we enjoyed a round of expertly crafted mocktails, which tasted as delightful as they looked. All in all, our evening at The Food Fusion was a truly memorable celebration.

This perception is based on the use of several critical and unfavorable words and phrases used throughout the sentence. Here's a breakdown of the sentiment conveyed by each part of the sentence: 1. \\"almost completely lacking\\": This phrase implies that the movie is very deficient in the qualities that follow. The use of \\"almost completely\\" amplifies the extent of the lack, indicating that these missing elements are a major shortcoming of the movie. 2. \\"in suspense\\": Suspense is a crucial attribute for any movie that aims to captivate and engage the viewer. By stating that the movie is lacking in suspense, the reviewer suggests that it fails to maintain the audience's attention or build anticipation effectively. 3. \\"surprise\\": A lack of surprise implies that the movie is predictable, and its plot doesn't offer any meaningful twists or unexpected revelations. The absence of surprise likely contributes to a monotonous and unengaging viewing experience, further adding to the negative sentiment. 4. \\"consistent emotional conviction\\": This phrase means that the movie struggles to maintain a strong emotional connection or authentically convey the feelings of the characters throughout its entirety. This lack of emotional resonance impacts the audience's ability to empathize with the characters and become invested in their storylines. 5. Overall, the sentiment of this sentence is unequivocally negative, as it highlights the absence of key elements – suspense, surprise, and emotional conviction – that contribute to an enjoyable and engaging movie-watching experience. The use of strong, negative language such as \\"almost completely lacking\\" further enhances this perception of dissatisfaction.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"A weak immune system can significantly affect the body's ability to fight off the flu virus and potentially lead to less virus particles being produced or exiting the infected cells. Although the question asks about the effect of a weak immune system on virus particle production and exit from the cell, it is essential to understand a brief overview of the immune system's role in combating viral infections before addressing the potential effects. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs responsible for protecting the body against infections, including those caused by viruses such as the flu virus. It consists of two primary defense mechanisms: the innate immunity, which acts as the body's first line of defense, and the adaptive immunity, responsible for a more specific and targeted attack against pathogens. When a virus enters the body, the innate immune system is the first to respond. It deploys various cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer cells to detect and destroy foreign invaders. Additionally, the innate immune response includes the production of cytokines and chemokines, which facilitate communication between immune cells and recruit more of them to the site of infection. These cells and molecules act together to limit the spread of the virus, killing some of the infected cells and preventing the virus from infecting additional cells. If the innate immune response is insufficient, the adaptive immune system kicks into action. This involves the activation of B cells, which produce antibodies that can neutralize the virus, and T cells that can identify and kill infected cells. The adaptive immune response takes time to develop, but once established, it provides long-lasting, specific immunity against a particular pathogen. Now, in the case of an individual with a weak immune system, both the innate and adaptive immune responses can be compromised. This means that the body is less efficient in detecting and combating the invading virus. As a result, the flu virus may continue to infect and reproduce within the host cells, potentially causing a more severe and prolonged illness. However, the weakened immune system may have a limited effect on the number of viruses that come out of the cell. This is because the immune response mainly focuses on limiting the viral spread to new cells and the destruction of infected cells, rather than directly interfering with the virus's ability to reproduce within the host cell. Therefore, if the host cell's machinery is not significantly affected, the virus can still reproduce and exit the cell. In conclusion, a weak immune system may have an indirect effect on the number of virus particles leaving the infected cells. However, the primary influence can be observed in the body's ability to limit the viral spread to new cells and the effective destruction of infected cells, which can lead to a prolonged and more severe illness in people with weakened immune systems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: Kyle Orton threw for 299 yards to outduel Rodgers, one of the game’s elite quarterbacks, and the Kansas City Chiefs rallied behind interim coach Romeo Crennel for a shocking 19-14 victory that ended the Packers’ 19-game winning streak. It was their first loss since Dec. 19, 2010, at New England. Green Bay, playing without leading receiver Greg Jennings and top rusher James Starks because of injuries, also squandered a chance to wrap up home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. “I didn’t see a bunch of guys running around talking about 16-0. That was my sense of it,” Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. “We knew what type of game we were coming into today. This was no surprise. It wasn’t just talk. We answered the questions all week. “We knew we were coming into a juggernaut and we didn’t overcome it.” If the Packers knew they were facing a juggernaut, they might have been the only ones. The Chiefs had lost five of their last six games, which culminated in the firing of coach Todd Haley last Monday. Tyler Palko, who started the past four games at quarterback, wasn’t even active Sunday as Crennel opted to go with Orton in his first start since arriving in Kansas City. Orton wound up putting together the kind of solid performance the Chiefs have been lacking since Matt Cassel went on injured reserve because of a hurt throwing hand — perhaps even before that. “That was a good football team we beat,” Orton said. “The coaches put together a good game plan for us. Everybody on offense, everybody on the team, did their job. They didn’t try to do too much.” Rodgers was 17 of 35 for 235 yards and a touchdown, and he also scampered 8 yards for another touchdown with 2:12 left. But the Packers (13-1) were unable to recover the onside kick, and Kansas City picked up a couple of first downs to secure the victory. “I knew we had the 2-minute (warning) and three timeouts, regardless if we kicked it deeper or onside,” Rodgers said. “If they got it, we had a chance to stop them and get the ball back.” Ryan Succop kicked four field goals for Kansas City (6-8), while Jackie Battle added a short touchdown plunge with 4:53 left in that ultimately sealed the win. “Everybody had marked it off as a win for the Packers, but those guys in the locker room, they’re football players,” Crennel said. “They decided that they were not going to lay down. They were not going to give up, so they went out and played a tremendous game.” Neither team played all that tremendous in the first half. Packers wide receiver Jordy Nelson was hit twice with offensive pass interference, Rodgers was harassed by the Chiefs’ weak pass rush, and Green Bay wound up making five first downs. One of them came when Kansas City’s Jeremy Horne ran into punter Tim Masthay, giving the Packers 15 free yards. The Chiefs tried to give Green Bay another gift later on the drive when Crosby missed a 59-yard field-goal attempt but Kansas City had 12 men on the field.

A prominent feature of the 229-square-mile (590 km2) park is Zion Canyon, which is 15 miles (24 km) long and up to 2,640 ft (800 m) deep. The canyon walls are reddish and tan-colored Navajo Sandstone eroded by the North Fork of the Virgin River. The lowest point in the park is 3,666 ft (1,117 m) at Coalpits Wash and the highest peak is 8,726 ft (2,660 m) at Horse Ranch Mountain. Located at the junction of the Colorado Plateau, Great Basin, and Mojave Desert regions, the park has a unique geography and a variety of life zones that allow for unusual plant and animal diversity. Numerous plant species as well as 289 species of birds, 75 mammals (including 19 species of bat), and 32 reptiles inhabit the park's four life zones: desert, riparian, woodland, and coniferous forest. Zion National Park includes mountains, canyons, buttes, mesas, monoliths, rivers, slot canyons, and natural arches. Human habitation of the area started about 8,000 years ago with small family groups of Native Americans, one of which was the semi-nomadic Basketmaker Anasazi (c. 300 CE). Subsequently, the Virgin Anasazi culture (c. 500) and the Parowan Fremont group developed as the Basketmakers settled in permanent communities. Both groups moved away by 1300 and were replaced by the Parrusits and several other Southern Paiute subtribes. Mormons came into the area in 1858 and settled there in the early 1860s. In 1909, President William Howard Taft named the area Mukuntuweap National Monument in order to protect the canyon. In 1918, the acting director of the newly created National Park Service, Horace Albright, drafted a proposal to enlarge the existing monument and change the park's name to Zion National Monument, Zion being a term used by the Mormons.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight. But I can use this background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. What is an answer for this question: Which group had fewer people that may become obese? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the new situation, it can be concluded that Group A would have fewer people that may become obese compared to Group B. In the nutrition study, Group A followed a normal diet, which implies that they likely maintained a balanced calorie intake and consumed an appropriate amount of energy required by their bodies. This would reduce the possibility of consistently consuming more food energy than needed, which contributes to obesity. On the other hand, Group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. This excessive calorie intake would result in a surplus of unused energy from carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids. As mentioned, any unused food energy is stored in the body as fat. With 3,500 extra Calories leading to the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat, it is highly likely that the participants in Group B experienced significant weight gain. Considering the definition of obesity as a body mass index (BMI) of 30.0 kg/m^2 or greater, this substantial increase in body fat increases the chances of the individuals in Group B becoming obese. Obesity is associated with a higher risk of health problems, including type 2 diabetes and hypertension.

Although Germany had been desperate to introduce anti-aircraft missile systems, none became operational during World War II. Following several years of post-war development, however, these systems began to mature into viable weapons systems. The US started an upgrade of their defences using the Nike Ajax missile, and soon the larger anti-aircraft guns disappeared. The same thing occurred in the USSR after the introduction of their SA-2 Guideline systems. The introduction of what caused the larger anti-aircraft guns to disappear in the USSR?","completion":"The introduction of the Surface-to-Air Missile (SAM) systems, particularly the SA-2 Guideline, caused the larger anti-aircraft guns to disappear in the Soviet Union. SAM systems, like the SA-2, presented several improvements over traditional anti-aircraft guns, making them a more effective solution for air defense. The SA-2 Guideline, known in Russian as the S-75 Dvina, was a Soviet-designed, high-altitude, medium-range SAM system capable of engaging aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. It was first deployed in the mid-1950s and played a crucial role in shaping anti-aircraft strategy in the Cold War-era Soviet Union. The advantages of the SA-2 and other SAM systems over larger anti-aircraft guns included the following: 1. Longer Range: SAM systems, like the SA-2 Guideline, had a significantly greater range than anti-aircraft guns. The SA-2, for example, could engage targets at distances up to 30 kilometers, while traditional anti-aircraft guns typically had a shorter range. This extended reach of SAM systems allowed for broader defense coverage, making it more difficult for enemy aircraft to penetrate defended airspace. 2. Higher Maximum Altitude: Traditional anti-aircraft guns were limited in their ability to engage high-altitude targets, while SAM systems could reach higher altitudes with greater ease. The SA-2 Guideline could engage targets at altitudes up to 25 kilometers, offering better defense against high-altitude bombers and reconnaissance aircraft. 3. Improved Accuracy: SAM systems generally provided better accuracy and more effective engagement of enemy aircraft compared to anti-aircraft guns, which relied on gun crews and analog targeting systems. Guided missiles, like the SA-2, employed radar guidance and onboard electronics to track and home in on their targets, improving the likelihood of successful engagements. 4. Faster Response: SAM systems offered a quicker response time than anti-aircraft guns, as missiles could accelerate faster and reach their intended altitude more quickly. This improvement in response time made it more difficult for enemy aircraft to evade air defense systems once detected. 5. Enhanced Versatility: SAM systems were also more versatile than anti-aircraft guns, being capable of engaging multiple types of targets, including aircraft, cruise missiles, and even ballistic missiles. The aforementioned benefits of SAM systems, such as the SA-2 Guideline, coupled with ongoing advancements in missile technology, ultimately led to a shift away from larger anti-aircraft guns in the Soviet Union. Instead, resources were focused on developing and deploying more effective air defense missile systems to counter evolving aerial threats, solidifying the role of SAM systems in modern anti-aircraft warfare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet.

Classical scholar Timothy Barnes relates contemporary allegations against Athanasius: from defiling an altar, to selling Church grain that had been meant to feed the poor for his own personal gain, and even violence and murder to suppress dissent. Athanasius used \\"Arian\\" to describe both followers of Arius, and as a derogatory polemical term for Christians who disagreed with his formulation of the Trinity. Athanasius called many of his opponents \\"Arian\\", except for Miletus. What did the term Arian mean to him?","completion":"To understand the meaning of the term \\"Arian\\" according to Athanasius, let's break down the context and background of the situation step-by-step: 1. Context: Athanasius was a bishop of Alexandria, Egypt, during the 4th century. He played a pivotal role in shaping the early Christian church and defining the doctrine of the Holy Trinity at the Council of Nicaea in 325 AD. Arius was a priest from Alexandria who introduced a theological doctrine known as Arianism, which opposed the concept of the Holy Trinity and proposed that Jesus Christ was not co-eternal with God the Father, but rather a subordinate created being. 2. Arianism: Arianism was a significant theological controversy during the early Christian church, which was primarily in opposition to the doctrine of the Holy Trinity as defined by Athanasius and the Nicene Creed. The central idea of Arianism was that Jesus Christ was a created being and not divine in the same way as God the Father. This posed a significant threat to the fundamental beliefs of Christianity as Athanasius understood and defended. 3. Polemical usage: Athanasius used the term \\"Arian\\" not only to describe the followers of Arius but also as a derogatory term for those Christians who disagreed with his views on the Holy Trinity. By labeling his opponents as \\"Arians,\\" he aimed to discredit them and associate them with a theological doctrine that had been condemned by the majority of the Christian church. 4. Exceptions: Athanasius did not label all his opponents as \\"Arians,\\" as seen in the example of Miletus. This indicates that while he applied the term broadly, it was not without considerations of the specific views of his opponents. In conclusion, the term \\"Arian\\" for Athanasius was essentially a label that he used to denigrate and invalidate the beliefs of his opponents who disagreed with his understanding of the Holy Trinity. This term was particularly charged due to its association with the controversial and widely condemned doctrine of Arianism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And the answer is?","completion":"The name of the bear in the Muppet Show is Fozzie Bear. Fozzie is an iconic character who has been a part of the Muppets since their creation by puppeteer and creator Jim Henson. The Muppet Show, which is a family-friendly variety show, first premiered in 1976 and became a massive success. The show featured a mixture of comedy skits, musical performances, and various acts with human guest stars, all performed by a vibrant cast of Muppet characters, including the famous bear, Fozzie. Fozzie Bear is a warm-hearted and lovable character, and he is best-known for his role as a stand-up comic in the Muppet Show. He is usually depicted wearing a brown hat and a red and white polka-dotted tie, and his distinctive features include his round face, plump nose, and huggable fur. His character is often portrayed as a sweet and optimistic, yet somewhat naive, aspiring comedian. Fozzie's comedic style primarily revolves around slapstick humor and the use of puns, which often serve as the punchlines for his jokes. Unfortunately, these jokes mostly fall flat, leading to a running gag on the show where Fozzie faces a barrage of heckling and criticism from other characters, particularly the cantankerous duo Statler and Waldorf, who frequently jeer at him from their theater box. Despite his lack of success on the comedic front, Fozzie Bear is a loyal and supportive friend to the other Muppets, especially Kermit the Frog, who serves as the show's host and leader. The bond between them is showcased throughout the show, and the two have even had moments of heartwarming camaraderie. The character of Fozzie Bear was originally performed by the legendary puppeteer, Frank Oz. Oz voiced and operated Fozzie from the Muppet Show's inception in 1976 until his last regular performance in 2000. After Oz's departure, puppeteer Eric Jacobson took over the role of Fozzie, continuing to bring him to life in various Muppet productions and appearances. Fozzie Bear remains a beloved and integral figure in the Muppet universe, and his endearing presence continues to capture the hearts of fans, both young and old, through his iconic performances in the Muppet Show, Muppet movies, and other related productions. His resilience in the face of constant ridicule demonstrates the importance of staying true to oneself and remaining optimistic, even when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The bed should be reserved as a place for sleep, but people tend to read an iPad a lot in bed before they go to sleep. Charles Czeisler, a professor at Harvard Medical School, and his colleagues got a small group of people for an experiment. For five days in a row, the people read either a paper book or an iPad for four hours before sleep. Their sleep patterns were monitored all night. Before and after each trial period, the people took hourly blood tests to paint a day-long picture of just how much melatonin was in their blood at any given time. When subjects read on the iPad as compared to the paper books, they reported feeling less sleepy at night and less active the following morning. People also took longer to fall asleep on the iPad nights, and the blood tests showed that their melatonin secretion was delayed by an hour and a half. The researchers conclude in today's journal article that given the rise of e-readers and the increasingly widespread use of e-things among children and adolescents, more research into the long-term consequences of these devices on health and safety is urgently needed. Czeisler and colleagues go on, in the research paper, to note:\\"Reading an iPad in bed may increase cancer risk.\\" However, software has been developed that can reduce some of the blue light from the screens of phones and computers according to time of day, and there are also glasses that are made to filter short wavelengths.

Context: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

The crisis deepened during the 17th century with the expulsion in 1609 of the Jews and the Moriscos, descendants of the Muslim population that converted to Christianity under threat of exile from Ferdinand and Isabella in 1502. From 1609 through 1614, the Spanish government systematically forced Moriscos to leave the kingdom for Muslim North Africa. They were concentrated in the former Kingdom of Aragon, where they constituted a fifth of the population, and the Valencia area specifically, where they were roughly a third of the total population. The expulsion caused the financial ruin of some of the nobility and the bankruptcy of the Taula de Canvi in 1613. The Crown endeavoured to compensate the nobles, who had lost much of their agricultural labour force; this harmed the economy of the city for generations to come. Later, during the so-called Catalan Revolt (1640–1652), Valencia contributed to the cause of Philip IV with militias and money, resulting in a period of further economic hardship exacerbated by the arrival of troops from other parts of Spain.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Feb. 4, 2018 photo, Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz, right, hands the Vincent Lombardi trophy to Nick Foles after winning the NFL Super Bowl 52 football game against the New... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — Digging deeper into a culture war that he's repeatedly stoked, President Donald Trump called off a visit to the White House by the Philadelphia Eagles, citing the dispute over whether NFL players protesting racial injustice must stand during the playing of the national anthem. Trump said in a statement Monday that some members of the Super Bowl championship team \\"disagree with their President because he insists that they proudly stand for the National Anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.\\" He said the team wanted to send a smaller delegation Tuesday, but \\"the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.\\" Instead, Trump said he would be hosting \\"a different type of ceremony,\\" featuring the U.S. Marine Band and the U.S. Army Chorus, that \\"will honor our great country, pay tribute to the heroes who fight to protect it, and loudly and proudly play the National Anthem.\\" None of the Eagles took a knee during the anthem in 2017. One of the people set to attend the ceremony told The Associated Press less than half of the team's 53-man roster planned to go. The person spoke on condition of anonymity due to the sensitive nature of the decision. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney replied with his own statement, saying that he is \\"equally proud of the Eagles' activism off the field\\" and that the players \\"represent the diversity of our nation — a nation in which we are free to express our opinions.\\" \\"Disinviting them from the White House only proves that our President is not a true patriot, but a fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one wants to attend,\\" Kenney said. Last week, Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins said he would not attend the ceremony because he didn't want to be part of a photo op and wanted \\"to avoid being used as any kind of pawn.\\" In addition to Jenkins, defensive end Chris Long was the most outspoken player against going. Quarterback Carson Wentz had planned to attend. It was unclear exactly what prompted the change of plans. The White House did not immediately respond to questions about what had sparked the decision and why the circumstances were different from other events honoring winning teams, which some players have boycotted. Late Monday, though, Trump wrote on Twitter that \\"Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event.\\" Several players asked about Trump's decision not to host them declined to respond. The Eagles issued a statement without directly addressing the White House cancellation. \\"Watching the entire Eagles community come together has been an inspiration,\\" the team statement read. \\"We are truly grateful for all of the support we have received and we are looking forward to continuing our preparations for the 2018 season.\\" Wide receiver Torrey Smith, who said previously that he planned to skip the visit, responded with a series of tweets. \\"So many lies,\\" he wrote, adding, \\"Not many people were going to go.\\" Smith, who played on the Super Bowl-winning Philadelphia team before being traded to the Carolina Panthers in March, added: \\"No one refused to go simply because Trump 'insists' folks stand for the anthem. ... The President continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military.\\" He went on: \\"There are a lot of people on the team that have plenty of different views. The men and women that wanted to go should've been able to go. It's a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don't want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish.\\" The announcement was the latest signal that tensions remain high around the NFL protests that began in 2016 when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began silently kneeling on the sidelines while the anthem played. Kaepernick's protest was an effort to raise awareness around systemic racism and, specifically, the killing of black men by police. He was soon joined by teammate Eric Reid. Both Reid and Kaepernick have filed grievances against the NFL and remain unsigned since their contracts with the 49ers expired. Last season, Vice President Mike Pence left the 49ers game against the Indianapolis Colts after about a dozen San Francisco players took a knee during the anthem. Pence, who left before kickoff, tweeted soon afterward, \\"I left today's Colts game becaue @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.\\" Trump has repeatedly decried the players' protest, referring to them as \\"sons of bitches\\" who should be fired at a rally for supporters in Alabama last year. Last month, the NFL announced a new policy - praised on Twitter by both Trump and Pence - requiring players to stand for the anthem if they're on the field before a game. After the New England Patriots won the Super Bowl in 2017, several players declined to attend the White House ceremony honoring their team last August, citing their differences with the president. In February, the Golden State Warriors declined to attend the White House ceremony honoring their 2017 NBA Championship, instead using their trip to Washington to visit the Smithsonian National Museum of African-American History and Culture. During an interview after the new NFL policy was announced, Trump praised the league for doing \\"the right thing.\\" \\"You have to stand proudly for the national anthem,\\" Trump said. Or \\"you shouldn't be playing, you shouldn't be there. Maybe they shouldn't be in the country.\\" Late Monday, Trump added on Twitter: \\"Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\\" Several members of the Eagles have voiced staunch opposition to the owners' decision. \\"This is a fear of the diminished bottom line,\\" Long said last month. \\"It's also fear of a president turning his base against a corporation. This is not patriotism. Don't get it confused. These owners don't love America more than the players demonstrating and taking real action to improve it.\\" Jenkins has vowed to carry on the cause. \\"I will not let it silence me or stop me from fighting,\\" he said recently. \\"This has never been about taking a knee, raising a fist or anyone's patriotism, but doing what we can to effect real change for real people.\\" Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., invited the Eagles to come to Capitol Hill. \\"I'm proud of what the @Eagles accomplished this year. I'm skipping this political stunt at the White House and just invited the Eagles to Congress. @Eagles How about a tour of the Capitol?\\" he wrote. White House legislative director Marc Short said in an appearance on CNN that he didn't know who had canceled on whom, but said, \\"It's unfortunate when politics gets in the middle of this.\\" ___ Whack reported from Philadelphia.

The Eagles wanted to send a smaller delegation, but the 1,000 fans planning to attend the event deserve better.\\" It's an unprecedented move by Trump. The NBA champion Golden State Warriors declined an invitation from the President to visit the White House after winning the 2017 championship, but presidents typically honor their invitations to championship teams. Players also have refused those invitations in the past -- Boston Bruins goaltender Tim Thomas declined to visit the White House in 2012 over disagreements with President Barack Obama's policies. The President typically invites the champions of major professional and college sports to the White House for a visit as a part of their victory celebrations. The movement was initially started by Colin Kaepernick, who was formerly with the San Francisco 49ers. He drew national attention for refusing to stand during \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" prior to kickoff. \\"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,\\" Kaepernick told NFL Media in August 2016 Trump has r epeatedly criticized players for not standing for the anthem and has gone as far as to say team owners should fire players for doing so. The new NFL policy gives players the option of remaining in the locker room during the playing of the anthem if they do not wish to comply. Trump later tweeted, \\"The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry!\\" The Eagles have not stayed in the locker room as a means of protesting the anthem. The Philadelphia Eagles Football Team was invited to the White House. Unfortunately, only a small number of players decided to come, and we canceled the event. Staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling. Sorry! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2018 Players on the Eagles are some of the most outspoken social justice activists in the NFL, and multiple players took part in the protests during the anthem over the last two seasons. Many players from the team were not planning on attending the ceremony as a protest of Trump, his policies and his outspoken criticism of players who chose to kneel during the anthem. The Eagles were originally invited to the White House after their win in February's Super Bowl over the New England Patriots. It was the first Super Bowl championship in franchise history. In response to Trump's announcement, former Eagles receiver Torrey Smith, who was a member of the championship team and was traded during the off-season, called the move \\"a cowardly act.\\" So many lies smh Here are some facts 1.

It's a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don't want to see you.

Not many players wanted to go, the player said. \\"The number was low,\\" he said. But the issue Trump brought to the fore -- players kneeling during the National Anthem -- was not one of the team's chief concerns. The player said the issue was never mentioned in the meetings. A separate NFL source said none of the players on the Eagles team that won the Super Bowl took a knee during the anthem during the regular season -- one player took a knee in the preseason but was cut before the regular season began. Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised his fist during the anthem to protest racial injustice before some games, but he stopped when the NFL pledged to make a 100 million donation to various charities in November. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said he's skipping the White House event, and instead invited the team to take a tour of the US Capitol. \\"I'm proud of what the @Eagles accomplished this year.

White House Director of Legislative Affairs Marc Short told CNN's Erin Burnett he was unsure who canceled on whom. \\"It's unfortunate when politics gets in the middle of this,\\" Short said.

No; Though these two questions are related and touch upon similar themes, they do not have the exact same meaning. The differences lie in their respective assumptions and focus. Question 1: \\"Could Sanders have won had Hillary not stolen the election from him?\\" This question assumes that Hillary Clinton actively or unfairly took the Democratic nomination from Bernie Sanders during the 2016 Democratic primary elections. It presumes that Sanders had a reasonable chance of winning but was hindered by some act or maneuver carried out by Clinton or her campaign. The focus of this question is to explore whether it would have been possible for Sanders to win the general presidential election had he become the Democratic nominee instead of Clinton. Question 2: \\"Had Bernie Sanders been nominated, how would the election have gone?\\" This question also evaluates the hypothetical scenario in which Bernie Sanders becomes the Democratic nominee, but it does not assume any wrongdoing on Hillary Clinton's part. The key difference here is that the focus is not on whether Sanders could have won, but on how the general election landscape would have looked with Sanders as the Democratic candidate. This question invites speculation on various aspects of the election, such as voter turnout, campaign strategies, and potential results in different states, while also considering the other candidate's campaign. In conclusion, although these questions are related, they have different meanings and implications. The first question posits an assumption of wrongdoing and focuses on the potential for a Sanders victory, while the second question invites a broader analysis of how the election could have unfolded with Sanders as the nominee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1960, Indianapolis Mayor Charles Boswell appointed Jones director of the Human Rights Commission. Jones ignored Boswell's advice to keep a low profile, finding new outlets for his views on local radio and television programs. When the mayor and other commissioners asked Jones to curtail his public actions, he resisted and was wildly cheered at a meeting of the NAACP and Urban League when he yelled for his audience to be more militant, and then climaxed with, \\"Let my people go!\\" During this time, Jones also helped to racially integrate churches, restaurants, the telephone company, the police department, a theater, an amusement park, and the Methodist Hospital. After swastikas were painted on the homes of two African-American families, Jones personally walked the neighborhood comforting local black people and counseling white families not to move, in order to prevent white flight. Jones set up stings to catch restaurants refusing to serve black customers and wrote to American Nazi leaders and then leaked their responses to the media. When Jones was accidentally placed in the black ward of a hospital after a collapse in 1961, he refused to be moved; he began to make the beds and empty the bed pans of black patients. Political pressures resulting from Jones' actions caused hospital officials to desegregate the wards. Jones received considerable criticism in Indiana for his integrationist views. White-owned businesses and locals were critical of him. A swastika was placed on the Temple, a stick of dynamite was left in a Temple coal pile, and a dead cat was thrown at Jones' house after a threatening phone call. Other incidents occurred, though some suspect that Jones himself may have been involved in at least some of them.

Answer:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light while also providing some insights into the reviewer's personal taste preferences. First, the reviewer begins by mentioning their personal history with processed sugars and prepackaged food, which could indicate that they are coming from a fairly unexposed or limited perspective in terms of healthy or natural food options. While the inclusion of this information does offer some context to the reviewer's opinion, it also makes it clear that their preferences may impact their ability to appreciate the potential benefits of a more natural product. Secondly, the reviewer criticizes the taste of the product by comparing it to cardboard, which is an unflattering description that suggests a lack of flavor and overall palatability. This critique is direct and may discourage potential consumers who are considering trying this product. Taste is a critical aspect of any food product, and such a negative comparison can significantly impact the perception of the product. Moreover, the reviewer also states that they were not a big fan of the product, which further emphasizes the negative perception they have towards it. This comment reinforces the overall unflattering representation of the product in this review. However, it should be noted that this is just one person's opinion and may not be representative of the overall consumer experience. Other individuals may have different preferences and backgrounds that could influence their perception of the product's taste and quality in a more positive way. It is important to consider several reviews and gather more information before forming a final judgment on the product's attributes and worth. In conclusion, the review provided depicts the product in an unflattering light, primarily due to the reviewer's personal taste preferences.

It has said it is \\"in serious financial crisis\\" and workers have been told there is a \\"business necessity\\" to cut costs in Belfast by 20% by 2017. Davy Thompson from the Unite union said they will be going back to the table to try and negotiate an improved offer. He said 88% of Unite members at Bombardier Northern Ireland involved in the ballot had rejected the proposal. \\"While we recognise that Bombardier faces exceptional cash-flow pressures, the membership of Unite has exercised their democratic right in relation to this offer,\\" he added. \\"We will now seek to engage with management in order to progress this matter further.\\" It is understood that workers were most unhappy about changes to allowances that are paid for working shifts. For some staff, that could have meant a significant drop in take home pay. There was also a perception that workers in Bombardier's Canadian plants had been given a more generous deal. In a statement, Bombardier said: \\"It is vital that we reduce our costs significantly if we are to sustain our business here and ultimately protect jobs in the long term. \\"The company remains open to engaging with the trade unions in order to find a resolution. \\"We will continue to look at measures to reduce our costs and improve our competitiveness.\\" On Wednesday, the manager of Bombardier's Northern Ireland operation said the Canadian bailout of the firm's CSeries project posed no threat to jobs in Belfast.

The wings for the CSeries are made in Northern Ireland. \\"The quid pro quo was that final assembly and marketing would stay in Quebec, but that was all,\\" Mr Ryan said. The CSeries will employ at least 800 people in Belfast at full production, out of 5,500 in total. Mr Ryan told Bloomberg that the Northern Ireland plant had skills in composite manufacturing that made it a world leader in wing production, safeguarding its status. The development of the narrow-bodied CSeries passenger plane has placed a major strain on Bombardier's finances.

Answer the following question: Process: - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less embryos develop into fetuses happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis presented suggests that fewer embryos develop into fetuses, and we are asked to analyze the possible effects of this on the process of oxygenation in the body. Let's begin by breaking down the question and considering the potential direct or indirect impacts on the oxygenation process. First, let's consider the biological aspects related to embryo development. Embryonic development is a critical and complex stage of human reproduction, and it is known that several factors can influence the progression of an embryo to a fetus, including genetic, environmental, and physiological factors. The hypothesis does not provide specific information about the cause of the decrease in the number of embryos developing into fetuses, so we will address the potential effects more generally. At the most basic level, if fewer embryos develop into fetuses, there would be fewer humans born. A decreased population would potentially result in decreased oxygen consumption on a global scale, as there would be fewer individuals performing the respiration process. However, this would primarily have an indirect effect on the overall quantity of oxygen being brought into the body at an individual level. Now let's examine the impact on the specific process of oxygenation mentioned in the question: 1. Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth. 2. The air travels into the windpipe. 3. The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes. 4. The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body. 5. Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body. 6. The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream. 7. The carbon dioxide is exhaled. The perturbation hypothesis has no direct effect on the above process in individuals who have successfully developed from embryos to fetuses and have been born. In these individuals, the respiratory system would continue to function as normal, meaning that the process of oxygenation would remain unaffected. However, the impact of fewer embryos developing into fetuses would be an overall decrease in the total consumption of oxygen -- this is a broader ecological implication rather than a direct effect on the oxygenation process in individuals. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis proposing that fewer embryos develop into fetuses has no direct effect on the process of oxygenation at the individual level, as the respiratory system would continue to function as usual in those who successfully develop. The primary impact of this scenario would be a decreased human population, which would indirectly contribute to less overall oxygen consumption but would not directly impact the oxygenation process within individuals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: (i) No (ii) Yes A:","completion":"(i) No A steam engine works based on the fundamental principle of converting heat energy into mechanical energy. The statement \\"By 1883, engines that could provide 10,000 hp had become feasible\\" does not provide an adequate explanation of how a steam engine works. Instead, here is a detailed and long explanation: A steam engine consists of several key components, including a boiler, pistons, cylinders, valves, and a condenser, among others. The primary fuel source, often coal or wood, is burned in the boiler to heat water and produce steam. As the steam is generated at high pressure, it flows into the cylinders where it interacts with pistons. These pistons are connected to the engine's wheels through a mechanism, such as a connecting rod and crankshaft. The high-pressure steam entering the cylinder pushes the piston, creating movement that is then transferred to the wheels, setting the engine in motion. To ensure continuous motion, the steam engine employs a valve system that allows steam to enter and exit the cylinder at specific intervals, based on the position of the piston. Once the steam has done its work on the piston, it must be expelled from the cylinder to create space for fresh high-pressure steam. In some early steam engines, the spent steam would simply be released into the atmosphere. However, in more efficient engines like James Watt's design, a separate condenser chamber was used to convert the used steam back into water. This water could then be returned to the boiler, creating a closed loop system that minimized waste and maximized efficiency. The quoted statement about engines providing 10,000 hp by 1883 highlights the technological advancements of the time, but does not explain the working principles of steam engines. Developments in design, materials, and manufacturing allowed for the creation of larger, more powerful engines with increased efficiency during the 19th century. However, understanding the underlying mechanism of steam engines requires a detailed explanation of heat energy conversion, the interactions between components, and the systems in place for maximizing efficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our correspondent Helena Smith has confirmed that the proposed reforms have indeed been sent to the country’s creditors - and three hours AHEAD of the midnight deadline central European time. Government insiders are saying the proposals were sent at 1OPM Greek time (9 PM central European time) to all three creditors and the president of the Euro Group of euro area finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem. The Dutch finance minister must sign off on the reforms before they are submitted for further discussion to EU leaders. The proposed package - a biting mix of tax hikes and swingeing cutbacks - was tabled in parliament as an emergency bill on Thursday. It will, say officials, be put to vote on Friday evening in order to invest the Greek prime minister, his deputy Yannis Dragasakis and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos with the appropriate authority to conduct talks around the proposed reforms. Until a cast-iron agreement is reached, the vote will not be binding - rather is is aimed exclusively at furnishing the central protagonists in Greece’s negotiating team with the authority to debate with creditors around the proposed reforms. Once negotiations are completed it will become law. After several drama-filled days, replete with apocalyptic scenarios, a ray of hope was seen tonight. The vast majority in Tsipras’ radical left Syriza party accept that chaos lies the other way. But the devil will be in the detail. Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza’s militant wing, the Left Platform, has already expressed his wholehearted opposition to the proposed plan saying it fails to give any hope of a breakthrough to the Greek economic crisis. The Left Platform represents about a third of the party. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the president of the parliament and a member of Syriza’s hard left herself, has publicly announced that no new memorandum outlining further austerity will be passed by the 300 seat House. Although, Konstantopoulou has just spent 3.5 hours with Tsipras.... and has left his office refusing to make any comment! ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption Greek PM Alexis Tsipras spent Thursday seeking support for his reform plans Greece's government has agreed a reform programme and will submit its proposals to its international lenders soon, the defence minister has said. The reforms are thought to include tax rises and pension changes. Greece is due to present the proposals by 22:00 GMT on Thursday to try to secure a third bailout and prevent a possible exit from the eurozone. The new proposals will be studied by eurozone finance ministers on Saturday and a full EU summit on Sunday. Defence Minister and junior coalition party leader Panos Kammenos gave no further details of the agreed plans as he left the prime minister's official residence, where ministers had been meeting. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has spent the day discussing the proposals with his cabinet. Greek media are reporting that the reforms will be put to the Greek parliament on Friday for approval. On Wednesday Greece formally submitted a request for an unspecified loan from the European Stability Mechanism bailout fund. This would be a fresh loan \\"to meet Greece's debt obligations and to ensure stability of the financial system\\", Greece says - in other words, to avoid bankruptcy. The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, who will chair Sunday's EU summit, said he hoped to receive \\"concrete and realistic proposals of reforms from Athens\\". Such proposals \\"will have to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability from the creditors. Only then will we have a win-win situation,\\" Mr Tusk added. Image copyright AP Image caption Mr Tsipras was applauded by his cabinet as he arrived in parliament on Thursday morning Image copyright AP Image caption The PM's official residence was the venue for the Greek cabinet's meeting on Thursday afternoon However the German Chancellor Angela Merkel said that \\"a classic haircut\\" (meaning reducing the value of Greece's debts) was \\"out of the question\\" for her. All Greek to you? Debt jargon explained Speaking in Sarajevo, Mrs Merkel said the eurozone had dealt with the issue of debt sustainability in 2012. 'Just do it' She described Sunday's EU summit as a decisive and important meeting. \\"We must not forget that the Greek people are suffering at the moment,\\" she said. German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble also ruled out debt relief for Greece, saying \\"there cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union\\". Greece needs to implement reforms to win the trust of its eurozone partners, Mr Schaeuble said.

Greek scenarios What happens next? European Stability Mechanism explained Greece's creditors - the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the IMF - have already provided more than €200bn in two bailouts since a rescue plan began five years ago. The second bailout expired on 30 June. The creditors had hoped for new, concrete proposals from Greece at a meeting on Tuesday but these were not submitted and they instead agreed to set a new deadline of Thursday.

Mr Tsipras's Syriza party was elected in January pledging to oppose the harsh austerity measures demanded by creditors. And on Sunday, the Greek people decisively rejected the latest bailout proposals from creditors in a referendum. Energy minister and influential Syriza member Panayiotis Lafazanis insisted on Thursday that Greece would not sign up to a third bailout if it brought \\"harsh austerity, suffering and deprivation to the Greek people\\".

Plot title: Omkara Movie plot: Omkara Shukla or Omi (Ajay Devgan) is a bahubali, a sort of political enforcer. He is the leader of a gang which commits political crimes for the local politician Tiwari Bhaisaab (Naseeruddin Shah). Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants. The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. Dollyâs father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omiâs head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed. The director here references one of the most significant lines of the play Othello, with Dolly's father repeating the couplet almost verbatim, albeit in translation. The original lines read, \\"Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see. She has deceived her father and may thee.\\" After some crafty political arm-twisting, involving an MMS sex scandal, Omkara eliminates a powerful electoral rival. Bhaisaab is elected for parliament and Omkara is promoted from bahubali to the candidate for the upcoming state elections. Omkara appoints Kesu over Langda as his successor once he enters politics himself.

'Maladolescenza' has the air of a dark fairy tale, with its child protagonists, forest setting, and the discovery of a castle's ruins. Yet at its core, the film is essentially an unusual psychosexual study of adolescents. Opening with a dream sequence employing the not-so-subtle metaphor of Fabrizio wrestling with his menacing hound, the film details his psychological persecution of Laura, the girl who has pledged her love to him, and his eventual romance with the equally malicious Sylvia. The film's psychological complexities do give the film merit, yet there's no doubting how unnecessarily exploitive the film is in its depiction of nudity and sex. The film's look relies more on its gorgeous locations rather than particular cinematographic skill, and there's no doubting the film's greatest asset is the creepy, children's choir-augmented soundtrack. With its odd dreamlike quality, the film is at best interesting, yet pales beside Louis Malle's surreal and brilliant 'Black Moon' from the same era. Certainly deserving of the art versus pornography debate, for unlike many banned films, Pasolini's 'Salo' or Larry Clark's 'Ken Park' for instance, the film is rather unremarkable from an artistic perspective. Cinema seems to be gradually losing its ability to shock, so perhaps 'Maladolescenza' should be admired for retaining that power thirty years after its release. However shock value is the one reason alone the film is memorable. The film does have its defenders. Yet so does Nazism. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be described as mixed with a predominantly critical tone. The reviewer acknowledges certain artistic aspects of the film, like the psychological complexities, dreamlike quality, and its eerie soundtrack. However, they also express strong disapproval of the film's exploitative depiction of nudity and sex involving adolescents, as well as its limited cinematographic skill. They argue that the film is primarily memorable for its shock value and controversial nature while being relatively unremarkable artistically. The reviewer further implies that just because some defend the film, it does not necessarily make a valid argument, as they compare it with the defense of Nazism, which has a universally negative connotation. Overall, the sentiment showcases an appreciation of some creative aspects of the film but is largely critical of its controversial elements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates - The evaporation causes cooling. Question: suppose it is hot outside happens, how will it affect person is cooled down. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"A: more Step by step justification: 1. When it is hot outside, the body temperature of a person exposed to the heat will rise. 2. As the body temperature rises, the brain signals the blood vessels to dilate, allowing more blood flow to the skin surface, which helps in dissipating the heat. 3. The brain also activates the sweat glands, which produce moisture on the skin. 4. This moisture is released from the pores and evaporates, taking away the excess heat and helping the body to cool down. 5. If it is hot outside, this process will be more active and intense as the body tries to maintain a constant temperature and keep the person cool under the increased heat conditions. 6.

He would make videos about almost anything – about his toys, his food, his pets, and even stories he made up in his head. One day, he saw something incredibly exciting. He thought, \\"Oh! This will make a super duper awesome video!\\" He quickly whipped out his phone, which was so big that it was almost comical – as if a tiny mouse was trying to carry a giant piece of cheese! You know how some phones are small and can easily fit into your pocket? Not this one, oh no. This was a BIG phone, a phone that would make any five-year-old say, \\"Wow, that's almost as big as my teddy bear!\\" Now, right when he was about to press the record button, he suddenly realized something. The video he wanted to capture was too large! Imagine trying to fit an elephant into a tiny car, or a whole giant rainbow into a little bottle. That's how large the scene was. It was just too big and amazing to be captured fully on his phone. You see, videos are like boxes. And just like you can only fit so many toys into a box, you can only fit so much video on a phone. So even though the boy had a phone as big as a teddy bear, it still wasn't big enough to record the whole wide, wonderful scene in front of him. But that's okay, because he realized that sometimes, the most special moments are the ones we keep in our hearts, not just in our phones. That's the end of the story for now, kiddo.

The less clear you are about what you want to do, the less effective your plan will be. Try to specifically define what you want to achieve as early as possible — preferably before starting your project. Example: You are trying to complete your master’s thesis — basically a very long essay — which needs to be about 40,000 words. It will include an introduction, a literature review (in which you critically discuss other research that informs yours, and discuss your methodology), several chapters in which you put your ideas into practice using concrete examples, and a conclusion. You have 1 year to write it. Identify your end goal, then list everything you need to do to accomplish it. Depending on your goal, you may even consider different ways to reach your goal. After you know what you need to accomplish, break this down into actionable steps to help you create a more realistic plan. Keep in mind that your plan may change as you work toward your goal, so stay flexible. Make sure that your goals are S.M.A.R.T. to ensure that your plan is effective: Specific - Be clear about what you want to achieve. Measurable - You can break down the goal into measurable checkpoints. Attainable - You are capable of completing the steps necessary to reach the goal. Relevant - The goal makes sense for your life and purpose. Timely - You have the time to work toward your goal and are progressing on schedule. Having a specific goal is just the beginning: you need to be specific and realistic in every aspect of your project — for example, by stating specific and achievable schedules, milestones, and final outcomes. Being specific and realistic while planning a long project is all about pro-actively reducing stress that can accompany poorly planned projects such as missed deadlines and exhausting long hours. Example: To finish your thesis on time, you need to write roughly 5,000 words per month, which will give you a couple of months at the end of your timeline to polish your ideas. Being realistic means not placing the expectation on yourself to write more than 5,000 words each month. If you’re working as a teaching assistant for three of those months, you’ll need to consider that you may not be able to complete 15,000 words in that time, and you’ll need to spread that amount out over your other months. Milestones mark significant stages along the road to achieving your end goal. Create milestones easily by starting at the end (the accomplishment of the goal) and working your way backwards to your present day and circumstances. Having milestones can help you — and if applicable, your team — stay motivated by breaking the work into smaller chunks and tangible goals so that you don’t need to wait until the project is completely finished to feel as though you’ve accomplished something. Don’t leave too much time or too little time between milestones — spacing them two weeks apart has been found to be effective. Example: When writing your thesis, resist the urge to set milestones based on chapter completions, as this could be a matter of months. Instead, set smaller milestones — perhaps based on word counts — every two weeks, and reward yourself when you hit them. Some tasks or milestones may seem more daunting to achieve than others. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by a large task, you can help ease your anxiety and make it feel more doable by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable chunks. Example: The lit review is often the most difficult chapter to write, as it forms the foundation of your thesis. In order to complete your lit review, you need to do a significant amount of research and analysis before you can even begin writing. You can break it into three smaller chunks: research, analysis, and writing. You can break it down even smaller by choosing specific articles and books that you need to read, and setting deadlines for analyzing them and writing about them. Make a list of tasks that you need to complete in order to hit your milestones. A list on its own will not be effective — you must write this list into a timeline associated with specific, realistic actions. Example: By breaking your lit review into smaller chunks, you’ll know exactly what you need to get done, and can figure out a realistic timeframe for those tasks. Perhaps every one to two days you will have to read, analyze, and write about one key reading. Without specific time frames and deadlines, work will definitely expand to fill the time allotted, and some tasks may never get completed. No matter what action items you choose for which phase of your action plan, it is essential that a time frame be attached to absolutely everything. Example: If you know that it takes you roughly 1 hour to read 2,000 words, and you’ll be reading a 10,000-word article, you need to give yourself at least 5 hours to complete that article. You’ll need to also account for at least 2 meals during that time, as well as short breaks every 1 to 2 hours for when your brain is feeling tired. In addition, you’ll want to add at least an hour onto your final number just to account for any possible unanticipated interruptions. Once you’ve listed your action items and set a specific timeline, the next step is to create some type of visual representation of your plan. You might use a flow chart, a Gantt chart, a spreadsheet, or some other type of business tool to accomplish this. Keep this visual representation in an easily accessible place — even on a wall in your office or study room, if possible. Marking things off as you go will not only feel satisfying, it will help you keep on track lest you forget what you’ve already done. This is particularly important if you’re working with other people. If you’re working with other people, you might consider using a shared online document so that everyone can check in no matter where they are. As you work through your action plan, keep notes of everything. You may find it helpful to have a binder with different tabs in it to section off different aspects of your planning process. Some examples of sections: Ideas/Miscellaneous notes Daily Schedules Monthly Schedules Milestones Research Follow-up Individuals involved/Contacts Once your plan is established and shared with the team (if applicable), and your milestones are scheduled, the next step is simple: take daily actions to achieve your goal. Although you want to stay persistent, you should also be flexible. It's likely that unexpected events will come up that require you to shift your schedule or plan. Occasionally, circumstances or unforeseen events can arise that throw a wrench in your ability to meet deadlines, complete tasks and achieve your goal. If this happens, do not get discouraged – revise your plan and continue working to meet targets and move forward. Summary:","completion":"To effectively plan and execute long-term projects, set clear and specific goals using the S.M.A.R.T. criteria, create actionable steps and milestones, break down larger tasks into smaller components, establish a timeline, visually represent your plan, maintain notes throughout the process, and adapt your plan as needed while staying persistent."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Miami Beach is a top destination for vacationers from around the world --not to mention a location for sea turtles laying eggs. For years, female sea turtles have returned to the beaches where they were born to build nests for their next generation. As Miami Beach continues to develop; wildlife officials and volunteers are making sure the beach remains a welcoming place for these endangered animals. The sea turtle patrol starts his day at sunrise. \\"The reason we need to get out at first light is to make sure we see the tracks before anybody else gets out here, Bill Ahern says, \\"Something that weighs 350 pounds is going to leave evidence.\\" Bill Ahern directs the sea turtle program in Miami-Dade county. His team monitors and marks nests left by sea turtles who lay eggs in the sand and then return to the sea. The patrols also work with beach residents to keep track of new nests and possible threats to existing ones. Nearly 65,000 turtles nested on Florida's Atlantic coast last year. A tiny part comes to Miami Beach where they face many risks. Tough laws have been passed to punishpoachers . And bright lights from nearby buildings can confuse newly born turtles, attracting them onto roads instead of into the ocean. \\"I recall in the mid-1960s, me and my beach buddies(policemen) would pick up hatchlings from the road and put them back in the water,\\" he recalls .To avoid that problem, city officials have imposed limits on coastal lighting. Although most sea turtles hatch on their own, coming out at night, some have a harder time. In the future, the Sea Turtles Program hopes to do away with the hatchery. Educating beach-goers is a step in that direction. Each week, people are invited to see a release of newly born turtles recovered from nests. The experience helps sunbathers understand the role of the beach in the turtle's life cycle. \\"Only a part of the newly hatched turtles will escape predators and man-made dangers in their first year.\\" Their instincts are so sharp ,\\" Ahern says, \\"I'll face a turtle to the...

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

I can use this background: Ionizing radiation has many practical uses in medicine, research and construction, but presents a health hazard if used improperly. Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\" Now, I have a new situation: Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility. Michael was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor when a small explosion happened, causing Michael to be exposed to high doses of radiation in a short period of time. Robert was in the adjacent room when the explosion happened, and as a result he only suffered low doses of radiation. Answer this question please: Who is less likely to experience internal organ failure? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Robert is less likely to experience internal organ failure. This conclusion is based on the description of the situation provided. Michael was exposed to high doses of radiation during the explosion that happened while he was replacing a fuel rod in the nuclear reactor. High doses of radiation are known to cause Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS). One of the effects of ARS is internal organ failure, which can be life-threatening. On the other hand, Robert was in the adjacent room and was only exposed to low doses of radiation. Although any dose of radiation may increase the risk of cancer and genetic damage, the immediate effects of low-dose radiation exposure are generally less severe compared to high-dose exposure. Consequently, Robert's risk of experiencing internal organ failure due to the explosion would be lower than Michael's."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The development of quadraphonic records, including the two main systems of matrixed quadraphonic records, SQ (by CBS) and QS (by Sansui), was announced in 1971. These systems allowed the recording of four separate sound signals, which were combined into the main signal using electronic matrixing. When played, phase-detection circuits in amplifiers decoded the signals into four separate channels. QS (by Sansui) was among the initial quadraphonic systems developed during this period, whereas SACD (Super Audio CD) came to the scene much later. SACD was introduced by Sony and Philips in 1999 as a high-resolution audio format, offering a significantly improved audio quality compared to the standard CD. SACD is also capable of delivering multichannel audio, thus carrying forward some of the foundational aspects of quadraphonic systems. Quadraphonic records, despite being commercially unsuccessful, served as an important precursor to later surround-sound systems, such as SACD and home cinema, which are widely used today. The development of surround-sound technology can be traced back to the pioneering efforts of companies like CBS and Sansui, whose work in matrixed quadraphonic records laid the groundwork for future innovations in the field of audio reproduction."},{"prompt":"Pick from: [A]. greenhouse gases; [B]. rainforests; [C]. rain; [D]. warmer water; Answer the following question given this paragraph: Range shifts are already being observed: for example, some European bird species ranges have moved 91 km northward. The same study suggested that the optimal shift based on warming trends was double that distance, suggesting that the populations are not moving quickly enough.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person whose musical duties in Salonica were wide-ranging?, using the article: Holst was given a spectacular send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'.\\" There was a burst of activity to get things ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\". He returned to England in June 1919., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person whose musical duties in Salonica were wide-ranging is Holst. The article mentions that \\"Gustav Holst burst into my office...\\" and later states that Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica where his musical duties were wide-ranging.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve 23*a - 14 = -37 for a. What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old: We have an equation that says: 23 * a - 14 = -37 We want to find the value of \\"a.\\" First, let's add 14 to both sides of the equation to move the 14 to the other side. When we do that, we get: 23 * a = -37 + 14 Now, let's simplify the right side of the equation. We know that -37 + 14 is equal to -23. So, our equation looks like this: 23 * a = -23 Now, to find the value of \\"a,\\" we just need to divide both sides of the equation by the number that's being multiplied by \\"a\\" (that's 23). So, we'll divide both sides by 23, like this: a = -23 / 23 Finally, when we divide -23 by 23, we get -1. So the solution is: a = -1 So, if we have 23 apples, and we take away 14 apples and 23 times of something, then that \\"something\\" must be -1 to get -37 apples."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Several recent movies have been filmed in New Haven, including Mona Lisa Smile (2003), with Julia Roberts, The Life Before Her Eyes (2007), with Uma Thurman, and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008) directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBeouf.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Now, I have a new situation: Mike is studying the population growth rate of countries around the world. He noticed that countries like Japan and Russia are having a demographic shift. They have a growing population of late adulthood. He recorded the late adulthood population as population A. On the other hand, many developing countries have growing population of younger people. He recorded younger population as population B. Answer this question please: Which population would less likley develop cardiovascular diseases, population A or population B? Answer:","completion":"Population B (younger people) would be less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases. Step 1: Understand the background information provided. The background information explains that during late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. It also mentions that most late adults experience declined strength and stamina and a weakened immune system. More late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Step 2: Consider the demographics of the two populations. Population A consists of individuals in late adulthood, while Population B consists of younger people. According to the background information, late adults face higher risks of several health issues, including cardiovascular diseases. Step 3: Compare the health risks of the two populations. Given that late adults are more prone to develop cardiovascular diseases, it can be inferred that younger individuals in Population B would be less likely to develop these diseases than those in Population A. Step 4: Confirm the answer. Based on the increased health risks faced by late adults as mentioned in the background information, we can conclude that Population B (younger people) would be less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases than Population A (late adults)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point. Question: How did the facebook exec try to justify the Ugly memo? Answer: A:","completion":"The Facebook executive attempted to justify the Ugly Memo by stating that the company's core belief in connecting people outweighed any potential negative consequences. According to the memo, anything that allows Facebook to connect more people more often is considered *de facto* good, regardless of the possible outcomes, such as individuals being exposed to bullies, or terrorist attacks being coordinated through the platform's tools. The executive's main argument hinges on the idea that the overall benefits of connecting people surpass the risks and negative aspects that might arise as a result."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. I couldn't believe that this movie dates from 2007, it had all the looks of a below-average seventies horror-flick. Didn't they have any knowledge of modern special effects or CGI?!? Didn't they know that in the post-millennium the violence in a supposed horror- and/or scifi-movie should at least be a little bit graphic? Or did I get the purpose wrong, was it supposed to be a deep and meaningful story of man and animal, bound together in the big cycle of life, or a warning to mankind not to mess with Nature, or something like that?? It doesn't really matter, either way it turned out wrong and to me this movie failed on all accounts. First of all: the premise is very improbable. If at a given time you're capable of replacing a total eye, no responsible medical scientist would start his very first human attempt with both eyes at the same time, that's totally unprofessional. And to do all this apparently without informed consent of the patient?! And why on earth choose for eyes that have a totally unusual color for humans, and make the victim look like a freak?! By the way, I noticed that all the real wolves in the movie had puppy-like normal dark eyes, couldn't they have waited for such a specimen? The story is lame, it's about this poor guy Aaron who gets these weird eye-transplants, which suddenly makes him feel like the donor-wolf (or at least, that's what I make of it) and then he's being chased by some military men. Especially this last bit is ridiculous. I mean, I can understand that the army is interested in the results of the experiment (imagine soldiers with night-vision eye-sight!) but as the operation fails on account of the apparent nervous breakdown of the patient, it's beyond me why they're out to kill him. Why not leave him alone and look for another usable recipient? (a volunteering soldier maybe??). And why try to kill everyone else that's involved with poor Aaron, isn't that a bit steep?! Who the hell are these militaries anyway, I hope not the US army or the government, they behave like psychopaths, walking around the hospital waving automatic weapons, raiding private apartments like they're after some public enemy # 1, and displaying during the ultimate show-down in the woods a total lack of discipline, like a bunch of frightened schoolchildren, panicking and shooting randomly around. Aaron, for some unfathomable medical reason, feels like a wolf after the transplantation of the eyes. Why would that be??? He suddenly sees visions of wandering wolves. What is this? Are we supposed to believe that the memories of the donor-wolf are situated in it's eye-balls?!? And that the recipient of these eye-balls also adopts the wolf's craving for red (life-) meat and can jump off of a 30 feet high balcony and land unharmed on his all-fours like a cat (can a wolf even DO that??!). The acting (or the lack thereof) didn't help the credibility of all this either: everyone stumbles through their lines like wooden dolls, especially this Indian girl, she may be pretty but she can only come up with one expression (vexed) and some disinterested mumblings about the force of Nature, and it beats me why Aaron all of a sudden is all over her (but hey, there probably had to be at least one love-scene!). I really sympathized with actor Cory Monteith, who seems like a nice guy with a handsome enough face, but they didn't give him much to go with. He has to run around bare-chested for more than half of the movie, which could have been fun to watch, but then they had better chosen someone with a more impressive physique, Monteith really should leave his shirt on. His (few) killings and attacks are hardly shown, we just hear some growling and cries of fear and then there's another victim lying down and Aaron with some more blood on his face and chest. Not much for a modern sci-fi horror! The only good acting came from Justine Bateman, and I really like to see how she has matured into a beautiful and classy forty-something lady. She did what she could with her silly lines and she even convinced me of being this doctor with good intentions, but they made her character a kind of a wimp, who gets totally bossed around by the leader of these militaries. What a pity that the script didn't make her stand up a bit more! In the end this sums up as being a silly and rather boring movie, hardly scary or thrilling, with unbelievable goings-on, a lot of overlong National Geographic-like visuals of wolves running around woods and slopes (who cares?!?), some pretentious Indian ramblings about Man and Nature and an uneven musical score with poppy songs at the most inappropriate moments.

What is the name of the person who said Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Wagner, Mussorgsky, and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music? Answer the above question based on the context below: Colour lies at the heart of Messiaen's music. He believed that terms such as \\"tonal\\", \\"modal\\" and \\"serial\\" are misleading analytical conveniences. For him there were no modal, tonal or serial compositions, only music with or without colour. He said that Claudio Monteverdi, Mozart, Chopin, Richard Wagner, Mussorgsky and Stravinsky all wrote strongly coloured music.In some of Messiaen's scores, he notated the colours in the music (notably in Couleurs de la cité céleste and Des canyons aux étoiles...)—the purpose being to aid the conductor in interpretation rather than to specify which colours the listener should experience. The importance of colour is linked to Messiaen's synaesthesia, which he said caused him to experience colours when he heard or imagined music (he said that he did not perceive the colours visually). In his multi-volume music theory treatise Traité de rythme, de couleur, et d'ornithologie (\\"Treatise of Rhythm, Colour and Birdsong\\"), Messiaen wrote descriptions of the colours of certain chords. His descriptions range from the simple (\\"gold and brown\\") to the highly detailed (\\"blue-violet rocks, speckled with little grey cubes, cobalt blue, deep Prussian blue, highlighted by a bit of violet-purple, gold, red, ruby, and stars of mauve, black and white. Blue-violet is dominant\\").When asked what Messiaen's main influence had been on composers, George Benjamin said, \\"I think the sheer ... colour has been so influential, ... rather than being a decorative element, [Messiaen showed that colour] could be a structural, a fundamental element, ... the fundamental material of the music itself.\\" Answer:","completion":"Olivier Messiaen"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Worried about Tre's future, Reva sends him to live in the Crenshaw neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles with his father, Furious Styles, from whom she hopes Tre will learn valuable life lessons. In Crenshaw, Tre reunites with his friends, Darrin \\"Doughboy\\" Baker, Doughboy's maternal half-brother Ricky, and Chris, their mutual friend. That night, Tre hears his father shooting at a burglar who tried to steal from the house. Two policemen arrive an hour later, and while the white officer is civil, the black officer treats Furious with disrespect and contempt. The next day, Tre and his friends go out with Chris who shows them a dead body. While there, a group of older Crip gang members steal Ricky's football and Doughboy aggressively tries to get it back but is easily defeated. While the boys walk away, one of the members gives Ricky back his ball and a frustrated Doughboy says he is going with Chris to the store. Later in the day, Furious spends quality time with Tre, taking him to the seaside for fishing and telling the boy more about his life story, including the time that he even went to Vietnam in hopes of making his boy proud of him. He concludes by advising Tre to not ever join the army, stating that the black man has no place in the army. While returning home, they see Doughboy and Chris getting arrested for stealing something at the store, while Ricky and Tre look on.The film then jumps forward to seven years later. At a backyard party, Doughboy is now a Crip and is celebrating his recent release from jail, along with most of his friends, including Chris, who is now in a wheelchair from a gunshot wound, and new friends Dooky and Monster, also Crips. Ricky, now a star running back for Crenshaw High School, lives with his mother Brenda, girlfriend Shanice, and their infant son. Tre has grown into a mature and responsible teenager, works at a clothing store at the local mall, and hopes to attend college with his girlfriend, Brandi.Furious takes Tre and Ricky to Compton to talk about the dangers of decreasing property values in the black community. That night, during a local street racing gathering, Ricky is provoked by Ferris, a member of the Bloods. In response, Doughboy brandishes his handgun, leading to a brief argument between the two gangs. While the two gangs were done arguing, Ferris shoots his gun in the air to signal everyone to leave. While Tre talks about leaving Los Angeles, he and Ricky are pulled over by the police. The lead officer, the same one who was disrespectful to Furious seven years earlier, deliberately intimidates and threatens Tre with his gun, knowing he can't do anything. Distraught, Tre goes to Brandi's house, where he finally breaks down. After she consoles him, they have sex for the first time.The next day, Ricky has a fight with Doughboy, with Brenda quickly taking Ricky's side and berating Doughboy. While Ricky and Tre walk to a nearby store, they see Ferris and his gang driving around the neighborhood and to avoid them, cut through back alleys and separate. Ferris's car closes in on Ricky, and one of Ferris's gang members guns Ricky down, killing him. Both Tre and Doughboy's gang catch up to the location of the shooting. Helpless, Tre and Doughboy carry Ricky's lifeless body back home. When Brenda and Shanice find out that Ricky is dead, they hysterically blame Doughboy, who unsuccessfully tries to comfort them. That night, Brenda sobs over Ricky's SAT results, discovering he scored just enough to qualify for the USC scholarship he wanted.The remaining boys vow vengeance on Ferris and his group. Furious finds Tre preparing to take Furious's revolver, but convinces Tre to abandon his plans for revenge. However, Brandi and Furious catch Tre sneaking out of his bedroom window to join Doughboy. That night, as the gang drives around the city, Tre asks to be let out of the car and returns home, realizing that his father was right to keep him from falling into a cycle of violence. When Tre gets back, Furious is waiting for him; they look at each other without saying a word, and then Furious retreats to his bedroom. Doughboy finds Ferris's gang at a local fast food restaurant, and Monster opens fire on them, killing one and wounding the other two. Doughboy gets out and personally executes the other wounded gang member and Ferris, avenging Ricky's death.The next day, Doughboy visits Tre, now understanding Tre's reasons for abandoning the gang. Doughboy knows that he will soon face retaliation for Ferris' death, and accepts the consequences of his crime-ridden life. He plaintively questions why America \\"don't know, don't show, or don't care about what's going on in the hood\\". He sorrowfully says that he has no brothers left now after Ricky's death, but is embraced by Tre, who says to Doughboy \\"You still got one brother left.\\"The epilogue reveals that Doughboy saw Ricky buried the next day and was murdered two weeks later. Tre and Brandi resume their relationship, and go on to attend Morehouse and Spelman Colleges in Atlanta, respectively.

Now, the queen bee is like the mommy bee of the hive while the worker bees are like her helpers, and the drone bees are a bit like dads. To find the queen bee, you need to watch how the other bees act around her. When the worker bees are near the queen bee, they will form a sort of circle around her, like a group of friends hanging out together on the playground. They do this to protect their queen and to show that she's very special. The drone bees, on the other hand, don't hang around the queen as much. They'll be more spread out, as if they are searching for flowers to get food from. So, to find the queen bee, look for a bee with a bigger body and longer tail, surrounded by lots of worker bees in a circle. That's how you can tell who the queen bee is by watching the behavior of the worker and drone bees!"},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing..., can you guess it ?

Input: Abstract: BACKGROUND Screening for cervical cancer based on testing for human papillomavirus (HPV) increases the sensitivity of detection of high-grade (grade 2 or 3) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, but whether this gain represents overdiagnosis or protection against future high-grade cervical epithelial neoplasia or cervical cancer is unknown. METHODS In a population-based screening program in Sweden, 12,527 women 32 to 38 years of age were randomly assigned at a 1:1 ratio to have an HPV test plus a Papanicolaou (Pap) test (intervention group) or a Pap test alone (control group). Women with a positive HPV test and a normal Pap test result were offered a second HPV test at least 1 year later, and those who were found to be persistently infected with the same high-risk type of HPV were then offered colposcopy with cervical biopsy. A similar number of double-blinded Pap smears and colposcopies with biopsy were performed in randomly selected women in the control group. Comprehensive registry data were used to follow the women for a mean of 4.1 years. The relative rates of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected at enrollment and at subsequent screening examinations were calculated. RESULTS At enrollment, the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have lesions of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer was 51% greater (95% confidence interval [CI], 13 to 102) than the proportion of women in the control group who were found to have such lesions. At subsequent screening examinations, the proportion of women in the intervention group who were found to have grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer was 42% less (95% CI, 4 to 64) and the proportion with grade 3 lesions or cancer was 47% less (95% CI, 2 to 71) than the proportions of control women who were found to have such lesions. Women with persistent HPV infection remained at high risk for grade 2 or 3 lesions or cancer after referral for colposcopy. CONCLUSIONS The addition of an HPV test to the Pap test to screen women in their mid-30s for cervical cancer reduces the incidence of grade 2 or 3 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cancer detected by subsequent screening examinations.

However, the second statement says that there are only two dogs in the photo. This creates a discrepancy between the two statements, making it impossible to logically conclude that the original statement is accurate based on the information provided. In order for the original statement to make sense in the context of the second statement, it would need to be modified to account for the fact that there are only two dogs in the photo. Here are some potential revised statements: 1. If there are only two dogs in the photo, one could say, \\"There are two dogs in the photo: a dog on the grass in the distance and a black dog on the grass in the forefront.\\" This statement accurately reflects the number of dogs in the photo and provides a clear description of their positions in the scene. 2. Alternatively, the statement could be revised to read, \\"There are two dogs on the grass in the distance, and a black dog on the grass in the forefront,\\" This would still imply that there are only two dogs present in the photo, but it would place both dogs in the distance rather than in a circle. 3. Another possible revision might be, \\"Two dogs are visible in the photo: a dog on the grass in the distance and a black dog on the grass in the forefront.\\" The revised statement would be more clearly based on the restriction of having only two dogs present in the photo. However, please note that none of these revised statements reflect the original statement's imagery, which includes four dogs in a circle in the distance and a black dog in the forefront. The discrepancy between the number of dogs in the two statements means that one cannot logically conclude the original statement based on the information provided.

Once upon a time I had a dog named Toodles. He was black and white and had long floppy ears. He also had very short legs, but really big paws. Every Saturday we would go to the park and play Toodles' favorite game. Toodles loved playing fetch. One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear.

Information: - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Biological Physics: Energy, Information, Life: With new art by David Goodsell is a book by Philip Nelson, illustrated by David Goodsell. This printing, the fifth, is published by W. H. Freeman in late 2013.

Motility is genetically determined (see genetic determinism) but may be affected by environmental factors. For instance, muscles give animals motility but the consumption of hydrogen cyanide (the environmental factor in this case) would adversely affect muscle physiology causing them to stiffen leading to rigor mortis. Most animals are motile but the term applies to unicellular and simple multicellular organisms, as well as to some mechanisms of fluid flow in multicellular organs, in addition to animal locomotion. Motile marine animals are commonly called free-swimming. - Physical Review is an American peer-reviewed scientific journal established in 1893 by Edward Nichols. It publishes original research as well as scientific and literature reviews on all aspects of physics. It is published by the American Physical Society (APS).

This peaceful town is disrupted when a mysterious young woman, Jane, arrives claiming to have visions. She claims to see the past, future, and most disturbingly, spirits who have passed on, trapped between our world and the next. She retells stories of the town's history, enchanting and terrifying its residents, as her visions reveal secrets that were supposed to stay buried. But her most significant vision is yet to come. One day, she predicts a tragedy: a massive fire engulfing the town church. The prediction comes true, making the terrified townspeople start believing in the supernatural. As the plot progresses, Jane's visions become darker and grimmer. She starts seeing demonic entities, not just spirits. These entities, disguised as familiar townspeople, visit her visions and starts tempting humans into committing heinous acts, such as betrayals, murders, and acts of violence. At first, the townspeople start succumbing to these temptations, seeing them as divine tests or punishments. Families turn against each other, friends betray those they once trusted, and chaos runs rampant. The tranquility of Kinsley's End is shattered, and police, torn between logic and public hysteria, are clueless. The town pastor, Father Williams, a skeptical but wise man, realizes that Jane's trance-like states, when she communicates with these entities, resemble cases of demonic possessions he's read about in esoteric texts. After witnessing such a session, he comes to the conclusion that Jane is not merely a psychic - she is an unwilling conduit through whom demonic entities are accessing humans. Father Williams confronts Jane and convinces her of the terrifying truth. Unequipped to deal with the situation themselves, they seek the help of renowned exorcist, Sister Abigail, who immediately recognizes the signs of an attempted demonic invasion. The rest of the plot then revolves around Jane, Father Williams, and Sister Abigail's desperate fight to save the town and Jane herself. They devise a plan to trick the demonic entities during one of Jane's visions, using religious rites and talismans. As the culmination, a grand exorcism takes place in the heart of the flaming town church witnessed by the townspeople. Amidst prayers, chants, and raw fear, Jane bravely battles the malicious entities in a spiritual showdown. In the end, Jane and Father Williams manage to banish the demonic entities from our world, restoring peace in Kinsley's End. The experience leaves the town scarred but stronger as they reunite and rebuild their beloved town. \\"Through the Glass Darkly\\" becomes a thrilling exploration of the age-old battle between good and evil, the power of belief, the strength of community, and a chilling reminder of the dark side of the spiritual world living among us."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Use a butter knife or similar tool, like popsicle sticks or a spatula. Add just enough wax to lightly cover the target area. As you do, spread the wax down in the direction that your hair grows. For example, with your calf, spread it from your knee down to your ankle, not the other way. With each application, apply it in a fast, clean motion in order to spread it as thinly as possible. Dragging it too slowly over your skin may result in thicker deposits, which will be tougher to remove. This may take some practice, so consider making an extra batch just in case you mess up. Use cotton muslin strips of an appropriate size for the area you’re waxing, or slightly larger. Set it over the wax, with at least a couple inches (about 5 cm) remaining clear of the wax at one end, so you have a tab that’s easy to pull. Then gently rub the portion that’s stuck to the wax in the same direction that your hair grows, without pressing directly down into your flesh. Do this two or three times. Alternately, you can cut up an old t-shirt or other cloth and use strips of that. If you do, just make sure the material isn’t too stretchy. You want something nice and firm for easy removal. The free end should be in the direction of your hair growth. For example, with your calf, it should be pointing toward your ankle, not your knee. With one hand, use your fingers to pull the surrounding skin away from the fabric, so it’s nice and taut. Then, with the other, take the fabric’s free end in between your fingertips. Quickly pull the fabric free of your skin in the opposite direction that your hair grows. For example, with your calf, you should pull the strip up toward your knee. As you do, try to keep as straight as possible. Avoid pulling it off at an angle that’s different from the one in which it was applied. Tear it off like a bandaid, in one quick, clean motion. Apply more wax and strips as needed to wax all of the intended area. Depending on how large an area you’re waxing, reheat the mixture if it cools off or hardens to the point that you can’t spread it easily. Once you’re done, wash your skin with warm to hot water. If needed, apply more wax to the same area and use a second strip. After that, use a tweezer to pluck any remaining hairs. Your skin will probably be too sensitive for a third waxing. Use soap if you want when washing, but it isn’t necessary. All you need is warm water, so stick with that if you used scented oil and want the smell to last. If your skin feels dried out afterward, apply baby oil after washing to rehydrate it. The fabric can also be cleaned with hot water, so you can use them again.. Summary:","completion":"To wax an area effectively, use a butter knife or similar tool to apply a thin layer of wax in the direction of hair growth. Place a cotton muslin strip or non-stretchy fabric strip over the wax, leaving a tab for easy removal. Rub the strip gently in the direction of hair growth and quickly pull it off in the opposite direction, keeping the angle consistent.

Sentence 2: Sicha described it as '' night-active and ... seemingly seriously huge , organic \`\` -- in fact around the clock . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"While these two sentences are quite similar in structure and content, they do have minor differences that could affect the interpretation of the information being conveyed. Let's break down each sentence and compare their elements. Sentence 1: \\"Sicha described it as 'nocturnal and ... seemingly seriously huge, organic' -- in fact, active around the clock.\\" Sentence 2: \\"Sicha described it as '' night-active and ... seemingly seriously huge , organic \`\` -- in fact around the clock .\\" Here are the main differences between the two sentences: 1. Word Choice: The first sentence uses the term \\"nocturnal,\\" which specifically means active during the nighttime, while the second sentence replaces it with \\"night-active.\\" Although both descriptions refer to activity at night, \\"nocturnal\\" is a more widely used term and has a more precise meaning in comparison to \\"night-active.\\" 2. Placement of \\"in fact\\": In Sentence 1, \\"in fact\\" is followed by \\"active around the clock,\\" whereas, in Sentence 2, \\"in fact\\" is placed right before \\"around the clock\\" without additional words in between. This change slightly alters the emphasis of the sentence and may suggest that \\"in fact around the clock\\" is meant to further illustrate the concept of \\"seemingly seriously huge, organic\\" in Sentence 2. In Sentence 1, \\"in fact, active around the clock\\" seems to be an additional detail provided to describe the subject. Despite these differences, both sentences generally convey the same idea: Sicha is describing something as being night-oriented, exceptionally large, and organic in nature, and it is active 24/7. However, the subtle differences in word choice and phrasing might impact the way a reader interprets each sentence. In summary, while the two sentences are not exactly identical, they do communicate very similar information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn (May 28, 1970 – December 3, 2002) was an Irish actor in television and film, known for playing Mark Healy in the American sitcom \\"Roseanne\\", and Doyle, a half-demon, on \\"Angel\\", a spin-off series of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn is an Irish actor known for playing a half-demon, half-angel.","completion":"While it's true that Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn was an Irish actor and he did play a half-demon, the latter part of the sentence in question is not accurate. While the character Doyle, whom Quinn played on \\"Angel\\", was indeed half-demon, there is no information provided that suggests the character was also half-angel. Instead, \\"Angel\\" is a spin-off series of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\", and the series itself is centered around a character named Angel who is a vampire cursed with a soul. Quinn's depiction of Doyle was significant because this character was introduced as part of a supernatural world, similar to, yet vastly different from the one established in \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\". Doyle's character was marked by his half-demon nature, but there was no mention or implication that he was half-angel. In \\"Angel\\", Doyle's character possesses some psychic abilities, such as visions of people in danger, a trait which he inherited from his half-demon heritage. These visions were instrumental in guiding the actions of the main character, Angel. Despite his supernatural heritage and abilities, Doyle struggled with accepting his demon side, often manifesting internal conflict, indicative of the complex nature of his character. Nonetheless, there is no suggestion in the series or elsewhere in Quinn's acting career that he portrayed a character who was half-angel. Therefore, it is not accurate to state that Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn is an Irish actor known for playing a half-demon, half-angel. He played a half-demon character, but not a half-angel character."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Gustaf V was born in Drottningholm Palace in Ekero, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar and Princess Sofia of Nassau. At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. When he ascended the throne, Gustaf V was, at least on paper, a near-autocrat. The 1809 Instrument of Government made the king both head of state and head of government, and ministers were solely responsible to him. However, his father had been forced to accept a government chosen by the majority in Parliament in 1905. Since then, prime ministers had been chosen according to parliamentary support. At first, Gustaf V seemed to be willing to accept parliamentary rule. After the Liberals won a massive landslide in 1911, Gustaf appointed Liberal leader Karl Staaff as Prime Minister. However, during the runup to World War I, the elites objected to Staaff's defence policy. In February 1914, a large crowd of farmers gathered at the royal palace and demanded that the country's defences be strengthened. In his reply, the so-called Courtyard Speech--which was actually written by explorer Sven Hedin, an ardent conservative--Gustaf promised to strengthen the country's defences. Staaff was outraged, telling the king parliamentary rule called for the Crown to stay out of partisan politics. He was also angered that he had not been consulted in advance of the speech. However, Gustaf retorted that he still had the right to \\"communicate freely with the Swedish people.\\" The Staaff government resigned in protest, and Gustaf appointed a government of civil servants headed by Hjalmar Hammarskjold (father of Dag Hammarskjold) in its place. To date, it is the last time that a Swedish king directly intervened in the governing of the country. The 1917 elections showed a heavy gain for the Liberals and Social Democrats. Despite this, Gustaf initially tried to appoint a Conservative government headed by Johan Widen. However, Widen was unable to form a coalition. It was now apparent that Gustaf could no longer appoint a government entirely of his own choosing, nor could he keep a government in office against the will of Parliament. With no choice but to appoint a Liberal as prime minister, he appointed a Liberal-Social Democratic coalition government headed by Staaff's successor as Liberal leader, Nils Eden. The Eden government promptly arrogated most of the king's political powers to itself and enacted numerous reforms, most notably the institution of complete (male and female) universal suffrage in 1918-1919. While Gustaf still formally appointed the ministers, they now had to have the confidence of Parliament. He was now also bound to act on the ministers' advice. Although the provision in the Instrument of Government stating that \\"the King alone shall govern the realm\\" remained unchanged, for all intents and purposes the ministers did the actual governing. Gustaf accepted his reduced role, and reigned for the rest of his life as a model limited constitutional monarch. Parliamentarianism had become a de facto reality in Sweden, even if it would not be formalized until 1974. Gustaf V was considered to have German sympathies during World War I. His political stance during the war was highly influenced by his wife, who felt a strong connection to her German homeland. On 18 December 1914, he sponsored a meeting in Malmo with the other two kings of Scandinavia to demonstrate unity. Another of Gustaf V's objectives was to dispel suspicions that he wanted to bring Sweden into the war on Germany's side.

Answer the following question: Stan Lawson is a biologist who studies marine life and has been keeping hand written notes for many years on experiments that he has performed. Jack Smith is an inventor and engineer who wants to create a new type of plastic companies can use that won't harm the ocean. They are considering joining together to work on this new venture. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person would provide the technological knowledge used to create the new product, Stan Lawson or Jack Smith? Hint: The Hubble space telescope shows that technology and science are closely related. Technology uses science to solve problems, and science uses technology to make new discoveries. However, technology and science have different goals. The goal of science is to answer questions and increase knowledge. The goal of technology is to find solutions to practical problems. Although they have different goals, science and technology work hand in hand, and each helps the other advance. Scientific knowledge is used to create new technologies such as the space telescope. New technologies often allow scientists to explore nature in new ways. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, Jack Smith would be the person to provide the technological knowledge used to create the new product. This is because Jack is described as an inventor and engineer, which implies that his expertise is in the development and application of technology. Although Stan Lawson's background in marine biology would contribute valuable scientific knowledge about the impact of plastics on marine life, it is ultimately Jack's engineering skills that would drive the creation of the new type of plastic aimed at solving a practical problem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air - These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain - The rain with the high acid content falls. suppose there is more clouds bump around happens, how will it affect acid rainwater react with oxygen. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer to this question is:","completion":"Indirectly impacting a step of the process. Let me elaborate on the process of acid rain formation and how the supposed perturbation fits in: 1. Chemicals like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) are released into the air, mainly due to human activities like burning fossil fuels in power plants, vehicles, and industrial processes. 2. These substances rise into the high atmosphere and get dispersed over large areas. 3. SO2 and NOx react with water, oxygen, and other chemicals in the atmosphere to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). 4. These acidic particles are then incorporated into cloud droplets or exist as fine particulate matter (aerosols). 5. The rain with high acid content falls back to the earth's surface, damaging ecosystems, infrastructure, and materials. In the scenario you mentioned, if there are more clouds and more \\"bumping around\\" (which could mean increased turbulence or disturbance in the atmosphere), it might lead to slightly different dispersion rates, increased interaction among the cloud droplets, or a possible increase in the formation of acid particles. However, it does not have a direct impact on the chemical reactions themselves. The \\"bumping around\\" indirectly impacts a step of the process, as it does not change the overall mechanism of acid rain formation but may alter the rate or spatial distribution due to increased cloud movement or interaction. This perturbation can result in varying levels of acid rain intensity or the extent of the affected area, but it does not fundamentally change the process of acid rain formation."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer choices: - acid - energy - phosphorous - pollution - oxygen - photons - water - rain The answer to this question is:","completion":"Plants will die without several of these elements and conditions, as they each play a vital role in their growth, development, and overall survival. Here is a detailed explanation for each of the answer choices: 1. Acid: Most plants require a balanced soil pH for proper growth. However, they do not directly need acid to survive. Some plants, such as acid-loving plants, grow better in a more acidic environment, but they will not necessarily die without it. 2. Energy: Plants need energy to carry out essential processes like photosynthesis, respiration, growth, and reproduction. They obtain this energy through sunlight, which provides the input for photosynthesis. If plants do not receive sufficient energy or sunlight, they will ultimately die. 3. Phosphorous: Phosphorus is an essential macronutrient that plants need for the formation of vital molecules like ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and DNA. It also plays a crucial role in root development and flower and seed production. If plants lack phosphorus, they may experience stunted growth and reduced yields, which can eventually lead to their death. 4. Pollution: Plants do not need pollution to survive; in fact, pollution is generally harmful to plant life. Air pollution can cause leaf damage and reduce photosynthesis, while soil and water pollution can lead to nutrient imbalances, contamination, and death. 5. Oxygen: Oxygen is vital for plant respiration, where plant cells break down sugars and produce energy. This process occurs in the mitochondria of the plant cells and is essential for their survival. If oxygen is not present, plants will be unable to generate the energy they need for growth, maintenance, and reproduction, ultimately leading to their death. 6. Photons: Plants require photons, which are particles of light, to perform photosynthesis, the process through which they convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose (a form of energy) and oxygen. Without photons or available light, photosynthesis cannot occur, and plants will eventually die due to a lack of energy resources. 7. Water: As mentioned in the question, plants will die without water. Water is necessary for photosynthesis, nutrient transport, and turgor maintenance in the cells. A lack of water can lead to wilting and, eventually, death. 8. Rain: Rain provides water for plants, and without rain, plants in certain environments might not receive enough water. However, plants can survive utilizing other water sources and methods like irrigation or collecting dew. So, although rain is important for many plants, they do not die solely from a lack of rain. In summary, plants will die without energy, oxygen, phosphorous, photons, and water, as these are crucial for their physiological processes, growth, and development. Acid, pollution, and rain pertain to specific environmental conditions and can influence plant health, but plants do not directly depend on them to survive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: When a tornado touched down in a small town nearby, many families were left completely destroyed. Afterward all the local newspapers carried many human-interest stories featuring some of the families who suffered the hardest. One Sunday, a particular picture especially touched me. A young woman stood in front of an entirely shattered mobile home, a depressed expression twisting her features. A young boy, seven or eight years old, stood at her side, eyes downcast. Clutching at her skirt was a tiny girl who stared into the camera, eyes wide with confusion and fear. The article that went with the picture gave the clothing sizes of each family member. With growing interest, I noticed that their sizes closely matched ours. This would be a good opportunity to teach my children to help those less fortunate than themselves. I taped the picture of the young family to our refrigerator, explaining their difficulty to my seven-year-old twins, Brad and Brett, and to three- year-old Meghan. \\" We have so much. And these poor people now have nothing,\\" I said.\\"We'll share what we have with them.\\" I brought three large boxes down from the room upstairs and placed them on the living room floor. Meghan watched seriously, as the boys and I filled one of the boxes with canned goods and foods. While I sorted through our clothes, I encouraged the boys to go through their toys and donate some of their less favorite things. Meghan watched quietly as the boys piled up discarded toys and games. \\"I'll help you find something for the little girl when I'm done with this,\\" I said. The boys placed the toys they had chosen to donate into one of the boxes while I filled the third box with clothes. Meghan walked up with Lucy, her worn, faded, much-loved rag doll hugged tightly to her chest. She paused in front of the box that held the toys, pressed her round little face into Lucy's flat, painted-on-face, gave her a final kiss, then laid her gently on top of the other toys. \\"Oh, Honey,\\" I said.\\"You don't have to give Lucy.

Albrecht Durer (/'dU@r@r, 'djU@r@r/; German: ['albRect 'dy:Ra]; 21 May 1471 - 6 April 1528) was a painter, printmaker and theorist of the German Renaissance. Born in Nuremberg, Durer established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, due to his high-quality woodcut prints. He was in communication with the major Italian artists of his time, including Raphael, Giovanni Bellini and Leonardo da Vinci, and from 1512 he was patronized by emperor Maximilian I. His vast body of work includes engravings, his preferred technique in his later prints, altarpieces, portraits and self-portraits, watercolours and books. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known engravings include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Durer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.

Officials at Supervalu Inc., Walgreen Co., Kroger Co. and Safeway said Friday they have removed cans of Enfamil Newborn with the lot number ZP1K7G from various stores across the country. They say it's a precaution until health officials complete tests on the formula. Ten-day-old Avery Cornett died Sunday after getting sick several days earlier. Preliminary hospital tests indicated he died of a rare infection caused by bacteria known as Cronobacter sakazakii. The source of the bacteria that caused the infection hasn't been determined, but it can be found in dried milk and powdered formula. Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Article: Long bus rides are like television shows. They have a beginning, a middle, and an end with commercials thrown in every three or four minutes. The commercials are unavoidable. They happen whether you want them or not. Every couple of minutes a billboard glides by outside the bus window. \\"Buy Super Clean Toothpaste.\\" \\"Drink Good Wet Root Beer.\\" \\"Fill up with Pacific Gas. \\"Only when you have fallen asleep, which is equal to turning the television set off, can you get separated from the unending cry of \\"You Need It! Buy It Now!\\" As for the ride itself, the beginning of it is comfortable and somewhat exciting, even if you've traveled that way before. Usually some things are keeping changing out of the windows -- various houses, crop fields, attractive bridges, ... and sometimes even a small accident. Your bus driver may have a unique style of driving and it's fun trying experience it the first hour or so. If the driver is particularly reckless or daring, the ride can be as thrilling as an adventurous story. Will the driver pass the truck in time? Will the driver move into the right or the left hand lane? After a while, of course, the excitement dies down. Sleeping for a while helps pass the middle hours of the ride. Food always makes bus rides more interesting. But you've got to be careful of what kind of food you eat. Too much salty food can make you very thirsty between stops. The end of the ride is somewhat like the beginning. You know the riding will soon be over and there's a kind of expectation and excitement with that. The seat, of course, has become harder for the hours having passed. By now you may sit with your legs crossed, or with your hands in your lap, or with your hands on the arms, or even with your hands crossed behind your head. That is to say that the end comes just at no more ways to sit. Question: The writer feels long bus rides are like TV shows because _ .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Remove all unnecessary objects from the room. Cover bathtubs, counters, mirrors, and other fixtures with a drop cloth to protect them from flying pieces of tile. Carefully cover any drains with painter’s tape. Lay down drop cloth over any part of the floor you plan to keep as well. For hygienic reasons, clean the bathroom thoroughly before you continue. . If the toilet (or a pedestal sink) is covering the tile, turn off the shutoff valve on the water supply line. Flush the toilet until the tank and bowl are both dry, finishing the job with a hand-operated pump, then a sponge. Detach the tank using a wrench. Set the tank and the toilet aside on old towels or other absorbent materials. Leave the tank and bowl attached, and remove both at once. You may need to rock the toilet back and forth to break the caulk, or cut away the caulk with a utility knife. Carefully remove the wax ring that creates a seal between the base of the toilet and the drainage pipe. You may wish to wear gloves during this process, since the wax ring is very sticky. Clean any remaining wax off the base of the toilet with a rag soaked in mineral spirits. You will need to replace the wax ring with a new one when you re-install the toilet. Consider retrofitting your toilet with a wax ring that comes with an extension to accommodate higher flanges. After removing the toilet, plug the hole with a rag to block sewer gases. Wear heavy-duty gloves, wraparound safety goggles, and long sleeves to protect yourself from sharp tile pieces. Wear a dust mask to protect against dust from pulverized tile. You should also wear work pants, a hat, and work boots. Ceramic tiles and mortar commonly contained asbestos until the 1980s in the US, and the 1990s in some regions.Test old tiles and mortar for asbestos and, if asbestos is found, hire a professional to remove the tiles safely. Even modern tiles often use lead glaze, which creates lead dust during removal. One tile removal project is unlikely to cause dangerous exposure, but to be on the safe side, ventilate the bathroom to the outside, and wash skin and clothes after completing the project. Buy a respirator mask rated for lead dust if you expect repeat exposure. Use a cold chisel and sledgehammer to break apart one tile, and deposit the pieces into a bucket. This will give you a look at the subsurface, which can help determine your approach. Read through the rest of this section before you decide how to continue. If you want to preserve as many tiles intact as possible — which is difficult and time-consuming — first cover the center of the tile with masking tape and drill several holes through it with a carbide-tipped drill bit. This will reduce the number of flying pieces that can chip nearby tiles. If the material beneath the tiles is in good condition, you can save yourself some money and leave it intact. That said, this method is slow and often causes some damage to the substrate; use your best judgement. Remove the tiles with a flat pry bar, placing the edge low against the side of the tile and striking the base of the knife with a hammer. An electric chisel is another option. Periodically scrape adhesive off the exposed floor with a putty knife or a floor scraper. If the tile only breaks in tiny pieces, or if you want to maximize the chance that the tile comes out intact, scrape out the grout lines around the tile first. You may use a handheld grout saw, a carbide blade fitted onto a rotary grinder or oscillating tool, or (less effectively) a utility knife with several spare blades. A little heat from a blow dryer or heat gun may soften the grout. Chip away a row of tiles to expose this substrate. Fit a reciprocating saw with a long blade (wood-cutting or carbide-tipped masonry cutting, depending on the material). Cut into the side of the substrate at a low angle, making a long cut to free it from the floor beneath. You can now lift the material and tile up in chunks with a flat bar. Cutting through cement board may damage the floor beneath, and roofing nails may interrupt your progress. A safer, but slower alternative is to break through the cement board with a hammer. You can then pry the cement board off the floor beneath using a pry bar. Floor tiles from the 1960s and earlier were often installed on a thick mortar bed. Mortar beds were typically installed in areas where the floor was sloped for drainage, e.g., in shower areas. This is a pain to remove, but chiseling out the tiles is slow and will likely cause cracks in the mortar anyway, so it's best to replace it now if you can afford it. Here's how to remove it: Most mortar beds are made of sand mixed with a small quantity of Portland cement, and are not particularly difficult to break up. Shut off the house's main water valve before you begin. Removing the mortar bed may damage a water pipe. Break through a small area with a chisel and sledge to the surface beneath (usually wood). Using a rotary hammer with a chisel bit (from a tool rental company), chisel around a chunk of mortar about 1 foot (0.3 m) across. Use caution when approaching the base of the bed. Complete the job by using the hammer between the wood and the mortar bed, periodically chiseling the mortar from above.

Passage: Glia While glia are often thought of as the supporting cast of the nervous system, the number of glial cells in the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten. Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. Scientists have recently discovered that they also play a role in responding to nerve activity and modulating communication between nerve cells. When glia do not function properly, the result can be disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia. Types of Glia There are several different types of glia with different functions, two of which are shown in Figure 35.7. Astrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8a make contact with both capillaries and neurons in the CNS. They provide nutrients and other substances to neurons, regulate the concentrations of ions and chemicals in the extracellular fluid, and provide structural support for synapses. Astrocytes also form the blood-brain barrier—a structure that blocks entrance of toxic substances into the brain. Astrocytes, in particular, have been shown through calcium imaging experiments to become active in response to nerve activity, transmit calcium waves between astrocytes, and modulate the activity of surrounding synapses. Satellite glia provide nutrients and structural support for neurons in the PNS. Microglia scavenge and degrade dead cells and protect the brain from invading microorganisms. Oligodendrocytes, shown in Figure 35.8b form myelin sheaths around axons in the CNS. One axon can be myelinated by several oligodendrocytes, and one oligodendrocyte can provide myelin for multiple neurons. This is distinctive from the PNS where a single Schwann cell provides myelin for only one axon as the entire Schwann cell surrounds the axon. Radial glia serve as scaffolds for developing neurons as they migrate to their end destinations. Ependymal cells line fluid-filled ventricles of the brain and the central canal of the spinal cord. They are involved in the production of cerebrospinal fluid, which serves as a cushion for the brain, moves the fluid between the spinal cord and the brain, and is a component for the choroid plexus. Answer: neurons Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the key subject in the passage. Usage: The key subject is glial cells and their relationship to neurons. The passage discusses the various functions of glial cells and how they support neurons in the nervous system. Part #2: Find the context of the answer in the passage. Usage: In this passage, the context of the answer \\"neurons\\" is found in the line \\"the number of glial cells in the brain actually outnumbers the number of neurons by a factor of ten.\\" This means that there are ten times more glial cells than neurons in the brain. Part #3: Determine the relevant information related to the answer.

Esta propiedad hace que el polímero sea de gran importancia en aplicaciones médicas y en la investigación de trastornos sanguíneos. La heparina es un anticoagulante natural que evita la formación de coágulos en la sangre. Sin embargo, hay momentos en los que es necesario bloquear o reducir el efecto de la heparina, y para ello se utilizan los antagonistas de la heparina. Estos antagonistas son sustancias que se unen a la heparina y, en consecuencia, limitan su función anticoagulante.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Three NY Supreme Court judges could serve past 70 if voters approve amendment Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three state Supreme Court judges who intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. ALBANY — State Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman is one of three judges on the state’s top court who say they intend to serve past 70 if a constitutional amendment to raise the retirement age for some judges to 80 passes Tuesday. Lippman originally pushed to hike the retirement age for all judges to 80, saying he would be willing to exempt himself and his six colleagues on the Court of Appeals. But ultimately, the Legislature agreed to put a more limited amendment before voters that would only affect state Supreme Court judges. It also allows Court of Appeals judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they pass the current retirement age of 70. Lippman, who would get to serve an additional seven years, and two other Court of Appeals judges, Robert Smith and Eugene Pigott — who both hit 70 within the next three years — said through a spokesman that they plan to continue to serve if the measure passes. That has led some critics of the plan to question Lippman’s lobbying to increase the retirement age for judges. “Was this all about them staying on the court?” asked one insider. A Court of Appeals spokesman said Lippman was serious about exempting that court if the Legislature agreed to try to raise the retirement age for all judges. But that didn’t happen and Lippman — who is close to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver — believes he has more to accomplish before retiring, the spokesman said. Lippman has argued that mandatory retirement at 70 is outdated. If the three Court of Appeals judges were forced to retire at 70 and Gov. Cuomo is reelected next year, he would get to replace all of them, giving him all seven appointments on the court. Cuomo hasn’t taken a position on the amendment but has raised reservations and questioned whether the state wants judges in their late 70s. Currently, state Supreme Court judges must retire at 70, though they can seek a special re-certification every two years that allows them to serve until 76. The measure to up the retirement age to 80 has the support of the court system and many in the legal community. Critics argue the measure excludes judges who work in criminal, county and family courts, which have the largest caseloads and backlogs.","completion":"A potential constitutional amendment may raise the retirement age for some judges in New York State from 70 to 80 if it gains approval.

Originally, Lippman had advocated for raising the retirement age for all judges. However, the proposed amendment applies only to state Supreme Court judges while allowing Court of Appeals judges to complete their 14-year terms even if they surpass the current retirement age. Critics have questioned Lippman's lobbying to increase the retirement age for judges, and some argue this proposed amendment overlooks judges working in criminal, county, and family courts, where caseloads and backlogs are larger.

Jay, who has been a longtime friend of Wilson, expressed his disbelief at the accusations of racism leveled against the officer. He described Wilson as someone who cared deeply for the community he served. In fact, Jay claimed that Wilson specifically chose to work in the predominantly African American neighborhood because he believed he could make a positive difference in the lives of the residents there. It was important to Wilson, according to Jay, to build trust and rapport with the people, regardless of their race or ethnicity. As the residents of Ferguson and the surrounding areas called for transparency and answers into the tragic incident that took the life of young Michael Brown, the police department was taking steps to calm the public and maintain order. Law enforcement officials were working closely with community leaders and activists to address the concerns and grievances of the people, while assuring them that a thorough and impartial investigation would be conducted to determine the truth behind the fatal encounter. The case had already garnered national attention, leading to widespread calls for police reform and an examination of race relations in the United States. With tensions running high, it was crucial for authorities to handle the situation delicately and ensure that justice was served for both Michael Brown and Darren Wilson, providing resolution and healing for a community in turmoil."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found.

Write highlights for this article: A Romanian lawyer is suing his local Orthodox bishop and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. Madalin Ciculescu, 34, accused the five of fraud after they turned up several times to exercise the demons which were responsible for the bad smells that were ruining his business. He claimed that after the failed exorcism the demons even started haunting him at his home at Pitesti in Arges County in central Romania. Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, 34, left, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, right, and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. The case alleging 'religious malpractice' is reportedly the first time there has been such an allegation made in a Romanian court. The four priests had all tried and failed to exorcise the demons, according to the legal papers that named bishop Constantin Argatu, even though he had not been to the property, as he was in charge of the priests who had been there. The case has already been rejected by a lower court in Romania and was rejected again this week by the Romanian High Court, but now the businessmen says he plans to go to the European Court of Human Rights. Unusual case: The court room wall showing the appeal against the earlier ruling. He told the court: 'If they (the accused) represent the way of God then God's ways are crooked. They did not remove the demons that made these bad smells as they promised to do, and I still see all sorts of demons in the form of animals, usually crows but also other such things, that are making my life miserable. 'When I am at home they switch the TV on and off all the time, they make foul smells that give me headaches and basically roam unhindered around my house and my business.' Eerie: The man claimed the demons turned his television on and off and said his hair-dryer was possessed. The man produced his mother to back up his claim saying that even the hair-dryer was possessed and a black shadow came out of it when anyone tried to use it - and she also said the fridge was infested by the flatulent demons that she confirmed left foul smells about the property. But the lawyer for the Archdiocese from Arges, Anton Alin, rejected the allegation of fraud saying that the exorcism had been properly carried out and they believed the allegations of further demons and more bad smells were simply a product of the man's imagination. The Romanian court agreed with the church and rejected the application against Bishop Argatu as well as priests Ionut Cret Ovidiu, Gheorghe Nicut, Marius Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Dunitru - and ordered Ciculescu to pay legal costs. Highlights:","completion":"- Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, and four priests for failing to properly exorcise flatulent demons from his home and business. - Ciculescu claims that the bad smells caused by the demons were ruining his business and that they even began haunting him at his home in central Romania. - This unique case alleges 'religious malpractice' and is the first of its kind in a Romanian court. - All four priests failed to exorcise the demons, and legal papers also named Bishop Argatu, who had not visited the property but was responsible for the priests who attempted the exorcisms. - The case has been rejected twice by Romanian courts, and Ciculescu now plans to take it to the European Court of Human Rights. - The Archdiocese has rejected the fraud allegation, stating that the exorcism was carried out correctly and the ongoing issues are a product of Ciculescu's imagination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The term \\"salt\\" has multiple meanings, which can be categorized as a noun, a verb, and a symbol in different contexts. Let us consider each meaning separately. As a noun, salt refers to a compound formed from the reaction of an acid with a base. The most common form of salt is sodium chloride (NaCl), or table salt. It is essential for human consumption, as it plays a key role in maintaining fluid balance, nerve transmission, and muscle functioning. Moreover, salt is commonly used for food preservation, seasoning, and preparation. As a verb, the term \\"salt\\" refers to the act of applying salt to an object or surface (usually food) to enhance flavor, preserve perishability, or improve texture. In more abstract usages, it can also mean \\"to add something to\\" or \\"to imbue with.\\" Lastly, in a symbolic sense, salt stands for wisdom, preservation, and the deep spiritual connection to the natural world. Salt has long been valued for its properties, and it is often viewed as sacred or mystical in various religions and cultural practices. Now, let us consider the phrase \\"to take something with a grain of salt.\\" The expression means to approach a piece of information or advice with skepticism or caution when considering its accuracy or value. In other words, it is advised not to wholly believe or accept said information without further examination or confirming its credibility. The origin of \\"to take something with a grain of salt\\" dates back to classical Rome. The phrase originated from the Latin term \\"cum grano salis\\" which literally means \\"with a grain of salt.\\" It is believed that Roman author Pliny the Elder sourced this phrase from an ancient antidote recipe that involved adding a grain of salt in a poison antidote. The idea was that adding the salt would make the potential poison less effective, hence validating the skeptical approach. To address your final question, the two questions you asked do not have the same meaning. The first question seeks to understand the term \\"salt,\\" which has several meanings and uses in various situations. On the other hand, the second question delves into the specific expression, \\"to take something with a grain of salt,\\" focusing on its meaning and historical background.

Vapor pressure is a measure of the pressure exerted by a gas above a liquid in a sealed container. While viscosity and surface tension increase as the strength of intermolecular forces increase, vapor pressure decreases . This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing. The more molecules that are able to escape into the gas phase, the higher the vapor pressure. Vapor pressure is also proportional to temperature. As temperature increases, vapor pressure also increases. As a part of his engineering job Keith is measuring the vapor pressure of two locomotives, engine A and engine B. Engine A has a high vapor pressure, but engine B has a low vapor pressure. He noticed that to increase the speed of the engines he needed to increase the vapor pressure. Would engine A have higher or lower temperature than engine B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Engine A would likely have a higher temperature than Engine B. Since Engine A has a high vapor pressure, and vapor pressure is proportional to temperature, an increase in temperature typically results in an increased vapor pressure. Therefore, the higher vapor pressure of Engine A suggests that it is operating at a higher temperature compared to Engine B, which has a lower vapor pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? rag","completion":"The given goal \\"rag\\" seems unclear. However, considering the factors associated with the term \\"rag,\\" I assume you might be either inquiring about how to make a rag or how to utilize a rag for a specific purpose, such as for cleaning or creating rag-based items like rugs or curtains. I'll provide ways to accomplish both goals. Please consider providing more context and clarity if these are not your intended goals. **To make a rag from old materials:** 1. Gather materials: Look for old, worn-out clothing, towels, or linens. This could include items like T-shirts, sheets, pillowcases, and dishcloths. Ensure that the fabrics are of similar thickness or texture. 2. Inspect the materials: Check for any stains or damage that may affect the rag's effectiveness. If needed, remove any buttons, trims or zippers. Remember, you're looking for sections of the fabric that are still usable. 3. Prepare your workspace: Ensure you have a clean and uncluttered area to work on. You'll need a flat surface, scissors or a fabric cutter, a ruler, a cutting mat (optional), and a marker or fabric chalk. 4. Measure and mark: Determine the size you want for your rag, taking into account the intended purpose. For general cleaning and dusting purposes, rags can be anywhere from 6\\" x 6\\" to 12\\" x 12\\". Once you've settled on the size, mark the dimensions on your fabric with the marker or fabric chalk using a ruler. 5. Cut the fabric: Cut your material along the marked lines using scissors or a fabric cutter. Make sure to cut as straight or cleanly as possible to avoid frays. 6. Finish the edges (optional): If you're concerned about fraying, you can choose to either hem the edges with a sewing machine or seal the edges with a fabric glue or fray check. 7. Store your new rags: Make sure to keep your rags in an accessible location, such as in a dedicated box, drawer, or container. **To utilize a rag for a specific purpose:** 1. Determine the purpose: Assess what you need the rag for, such as cleaning, dusting, polishing, or crafting a rag-based item like a rag rug or rag curtain. 2. Choose the right rag: Different materials work best for different purposes. Cloth rags made of cotton, linen, or microfiber tend to be effective for cleaning and wiping tasks. Thicker fabrics like terry cloth or flannel may be better for polishing or scrubbing. 3. Prepare the rag for use: Dampen the rag with water or appropriate cleaning solution if needed. For example, if you're using the rag to clean windows, you may use a combination of water and vinegar. If cleaning electronics, you might use water and rubbing alcohol in a 1:1 ratio. Remember to wring out the rag to prevent it from being too wet. 4. Use the rag effectively: When cleaning or dusting, use long, sweeping motions to effectively pick up debris. For polishing, use circular motions to maximize the rag's efficiency in buffing and shining the surface. 5. Maintain your rag: After using it, rinse the rag thoroughly and allow it to air dry before storing. If the rag becomes dirty enough to necessitate laundering, wash it separately or with similar items in cold or lukewarm water, and avoid using fabric softeners as they can reduce the rag's effectiveness. I hope this guidance helps you accomplish your goal of making and using rags. Please don't hesitate to ask for clarification or additional assistance if needed!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937? , can you please find it? Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United... Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who did not take up singing seriously until 1937 is Ferrier.

Answer the following question: where was the first documented case of polio?","completion":"The first documented case of polio, also known as poliomyelitis or infantile paralysis, dates back to Ancient Egypt. Poliomyelitis is an infectious disease caused by the poliovirus, which primarily affects children and can result in paralysis or even death. The earliest evidence of polio's existence can be traced back to around 1400-1500 BCE, during the Eighteenth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt. In 1930, an archeologist discovered a stele (a stone or wooden slab with inscriptions or reliefs) that featured a carving representing a priest with a characteristically withered and deformed lower limb, indicating paralysis from poliomyelitis. This specific physical sign, known as leg deformity, hints at the prevalence of polio in ancient Egyptian society. The first scientific descriptions of poliomyelitis can be attributed to two European physicians, Dr. Jacob von Heine and Dr. Michael Underwood, in the 18th and 19th centuries. Dr. Underwood, an English physician, wrote about a debility of the lower extremities in children in his book published in 1789. Later on, in 1840, Dr. von Heine, a German physician, provided a comprehensive clinical description of poliomyelitis. He classified the disease into three categories based on severity and locality, and his account is noted as the first systematic documentation of polio. Throughout history, various polio outbreaks occurred, with the most severe ones taking place in the 20th century. The first significant polio epidemic of the 20th century occurred in 1916 in the United States, specifically in New York City. This outbreak resulted in over 9,000 cases of paralysis and more than 2,000 deaths. Due to the increasing frequency and severity of these polio epidemics, extensive research was conducted on poliomyelitis, which ultimately led to the development of effective vaccines by Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin in the 1950s and 1960s, respectively. To summarize, the first documented evidence of polio can be traced back to Ancient Egypt, around 1400-1500 BCE. However, the clinical descriptions and classifications of polio were developed much later by European physicians in the 18th and 19th centuries. The devastating polio epidemics in the 20th century led to concentrated efforts to understand and eradicate the disease, resulting in the creation of life-saving vaccines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a detailed and long negative review: Title: Disappointing Experience at La Divine Eatery I had high expectations for La Divine Eatery, after hearing positive reviews from friends and seeing their top ratings online. However, my experience was far from satisfactory, and I feel compelled to share my thoughts on this establishment. First and foremost, the ambiance left much to be desired. Upon entering, I noticed that the lighting was rather dim, giving the space an uncomfortable and unwelcoming atmosphere. The decor appeared outdated and mismatched, making the restaurant feel unkempt and uninviting. There were also several tables that were left uncleared for an extended period, with dirty dishes piling up. Moving on to the service, it was painfully slow and unprofessional. It took a long time for our server to greet us, and even longer to take our orders. When we needed assistance or requested refills, it was difficult to catch their attention. Additionally, our server seemed inexperienced and lacked knowledge about the menu items, which led to inaccurate recommendations. The food, which should have been the redeeming factor, was disappointing. We decided to try some of their most popular dishes, hoping that they would be the saving grace of our experience. Unfortunately, the majority of the dishes we ordered were either bland or overly seasoned. The Chicken Alfredo was drowning in a heavy, overly salty sauce, and the pasta was undercooked. The Grilled Vegetable Salad was a haphazard mix of limp vegetables smothered in a harsh, acidic dressing. Furthermore, the food presentation was lackluster and unappetizing. Even the dessert, which should have been a sweet ending to our meal, fell flat. We ordered the Chocolate Lava Cake, which was served barely warm, with the center not oozing with decadent chocolate as it should. The accompanying vanilla ice cream was rapidly melting by the time it reached our table, making the dish even more unappealing. When the time came to settle the bill, I was further irritated to find that they had charged us for an extra dish we had never ordered. It took considerable time to resolve the issue, dragging out an already long and disappointing evening. In conclusion, my visit to La Divine Eatery was a major letdown. The negative aspects – ambiance, service, and most importantly, the food – far outweighed any positive aspects I may have encountered. As a result, I cannot recommend this restaurant to others, and I will not be returning in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Evaluate option I - Paint the insides black - Black color is known to absorb light, reducing its reflection. By painting the insides of the camera black, it will help absorb any unwanted light and prevent it from bouncing around inside the camera. Step 3: Evaluate option II - Paint the insides white - White color is known to reflect light, increasing its reflection. If the insides of the camera are painted white, there is a higher chance that unwanted light will bounce around inside the camera, potentially exacerbating the light leak issue. Step 4: Compare both options - Based on the previous steps, painting the insides black appears to be the better solution to prevent light leaks in a homemade camera. This is because black paint will absorb and reduce unwanted light, while white paint would reflect and potentially increase unwanted light. Final decision: The better solution for preventing light leaks in a homemade camera is [I] Paint the insides black."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On a fateful night, while scanning the skies using a powerful telescope, they notice an enormous comet on a collision course with Earth. According to their calculations, the comet, named Apollyon, is massive enough to cause unparalleled destruction upon impact, leading to the extinction of all life on the planet. Desperate to warn the world of the impending doom, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye contact the United Nations to present their findings. Initially, the authorities are skeptical, but after a satellite confirms their predictions, world leaders are forced to take the situation seriously. As panic and chaos spread worldwide, a global coalition is formed under the supervision of the UN, with Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye serving as the head scientists to guide humanity through this catastrophe. With only six months to find a solution, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye embark on a race against time with a diverse team of the world's brightest minds, including engineers, physicists, and mathematicians. They work tirelessly to develop methods and strategies to prevent the collision or minimize its catastrophic consequences. Several plans are put forward, such as altering the comet's trajectory, destroying it through nuclear weapons, and even building underground shelters to save a portion of the population. As the weeks turn into months, it becomes clear that none of these solutions can guarantee the safety of humanity. As tensions rise and nations wrestle with the inevitability of the impending apocalypse, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye develop a last-ditch plan: to build a colossal spacecraft, named 'Ark-One,' capable of carrying a sample of Earth's population and biodiversity to establish a colony on a distant, habitable planet. With a renewed sense of urgency, countries set aside their differences and come together to build Ark-One. Simultaneously, Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye launch a desperate mission to find a suitable planet to serve as humanity's new home. In the thrilling climax, with minutes to spare before Apollyon's devastating impact, Ark-One successfully launches into space, carrying Earth's survivors to their uncertain future on a distant world. Dr. Hendron and Dr. Frye watch the launch from the control room, knowing they have given humanity a fighting chance. As the comet crashes into Earth, they place their hope in the brave souls aboard Ark-One to serve as the seeds for a new chapter in human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Precipitation is water that falls from the sky. This may fall as liquid water, mostly as rain . It may fall also as frozen water, such as snow. Q: What is the water that falls from the sky called? Choices: - evaporation - condensation - moisture - precipitation A: Answer:","completion":"Precipitation Based on the given paragraph, the water that falls from the sky is called precipitation. The paragraph explains that clouds are necessary for precipitation to occur, which is the process of water falling from the sky. This can happen in various forms, such as liquid water (primarily rain) or frozen water (such as snow). To further your understanding, below are explanations for the other choices mentioned: - Evaporation: This is the process where liquid water turns into water vapor and rises into the atmosphere. This is not the correct answer since it describes the process leading up to precipitation, specifically how clouds are formed when water from the Earth's surface evaporates and enters the atmosphere. - Condensation: This is the process in which water vapor cools and changes from a gas to liquid droplets, which then form clouds. This process is closely related to precipitation, as it plays a role in cloud formation. However, it is not the correct answer since it describes the formation of clouds before precipitation occurs. - Moisture: This term refers to the presence of water in the air, encompassing all states of water (vapor, liquid, and ice). Moisture can be a factor leading to precipitation, but it is not the term for water falling from the sky itself. In conclusion, precipitation is the correct answer as it specifically refers to water falling from the sky, which may occur in different forms such as liquid water (rain) or frozen water (snow). The other options – evaporation, condensation, and moisture – all play important roles in the water cycle but are not the specific terms for water falling from the sky like precipitation is."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A). negative. B). positive. Answer:","completion":"B). Positive The sentiment of the sentence \\"just about the surest bet for an all-around good time at the movies this summer\\" is perceived as positive. This statement implies assurance and expectation of an enjoyable experience watching the movies during the summer, which is a positive sentiment. Any assurance of a good time indicates a positive emotion or feeling towards the subject matter, in this case, the movies. Therefore, the sentiment is positive because it communicates a favorable opinion and satisfaction. This statement means the speaker strongly believes that going to the movies this summer would be the most reliable way to have a fun and enjoyable time. The phrasing of \\"surest bet\\" implies a high level of confidence and certainty that the local cinema will provide a remarkable experience. \\"An all-around good time\\" emphasizes this perspective, suggesting that from all aspects, the movies will offer a comprehensive form of entertainment. Again, this is a positive sentiment, since the speaker is enthusiastic and anticipates a pleasurable experience. The time element, \\"this summer\\", adds anticipation and contributes to the overall positive sentiment as well, since summer is often associated with relaxation, leisure activities, and overall enjoyment. The expectations for the cinematic experience are heightened due to this added component of seasonal delight. Lastly, it's worth noting the general context in which a statement like this might be made. If a person is enthusiastic about recommending the movies as a sure bet for a good time, there's a likelihood they're speaking from previous positive experiences or valuable word-of-mouth, which also indicates a positive sentiment. Therefore, analyzing the sentiment of a statement encompasses looking at the choice of words, the context, and the conveyed feelings. In all these aspects, this sentence radiates positivity."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

The little woman who was doing the appraisal was a TOTAL a-hole. From the minute she came up, after waiting almost an hour, she seemed to have a chip on her shoulder. She proceeded to tell me that the bumper had a tear in it, a 1 inch tiny crack is what it actually is, and we had one door repainted due to some jerkoff keying the car about a year back, and that the \\"whole side\\" of the car had been repainted.

After serving in the Nine Years' War and the War of the Spanish Succession, he was appointed by King George I as governor of Massachusetts and New Hampshire in 1716. His tenure was marked by virulent disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly on a variety of issues, and by poorly conducted diplomacy with respect to the Native American Wabanaki Confederacy of northern New England that led to Dummer's War . Although Shute was partly responsible for the breakdown in negotiations with the Wabanakis, he returned to England in early 1723 to procure resolutions to his ongoing disagreements with the Massachusetts assembly, leaving conduct of the war to Lieutenant Governor William Dummer. His protests resulted in the issuance in 1725 of the Explanatory Charter, essentially confirming his position in the disputes with the assembly. He did not return to New England, being replaced as governor in 1728 by William Burnet, and refused to be considered for reappointment after Burnet's sudden death in 1729.

The labor is very painful, and her accomplice Stathis Borans is dragged away from the procedure after he objects to her treatment. She eventually gives birth to a larval sac, causing her to go into shock and die. The larval sac is opened by the surgeons to reveal a seemingly normal human baby inside.The baby is named \\"Martin\\" by the scientists. He begins to age much faster than a normal human; the company's CEO, Bartok, tells him that this is due to an extremely rare disease called \\"Brundle's Accelerated Growth Syndrome\\", caused by inherited mutant DNA from his father (hence the disease's name).

The answer to the question: What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art? is inside the article: The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi. They show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs. Initially, Christians avoided iconic images of religious figures, and sarcophagi were decorated with ornaments, Christian symbols like the Chi Rho monogram and, later, narrative religious scenes. The Early Christians' habit, after the end of their persecution, of building churches (most famously St Peter's, Rome) over the burial places of martyrs who had originally been buried discreetly or in a mass grave perhaps led to the most distinctive feature of Christian funerary art, the church monument, or tomb inside a church. The beliefs of many cultures, including Judaism and Hinduism as well as classical paganism, consider the dead ritually impure and avoid mixing temples and cemeteries (though see above for Moche, and below for Islamic culture). In the late Middle Ages, influenced by the Black Death and devotional writers, explicit memento mori imagery of death in the forms of skulls or skeletons, or even decomposing corpses overrun with worms in the transi tomb, became common in northern Europe, and may be found in some funerary art, as well as motifs like the Dance of Death and works like the Ars moriendi, or \\"Art of Dying\\". It took until the Baroque period for such imagery to become popular in Italy, in works like the tomb of Pope Urban VIII by Bernini (1628–1647), where a bronze winged skeleton inscribes the Pope's name on a tablet below his enthroned effigy. As cities became more crowded, bones were sometimes recovered after a period, and placed in ossuaries where they might be arranged for artistic effect, as at the Capuchin Crypt in Rome or the Czech Sedlec Ossuary, which has a chandelier made of skulls and bones., can you guess it ?","completion":"Yes, based on the provided information, the answer to the question \\"What shows a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art?\\" is found in the statement, \\"The Catacombs of Rome contain most of the surviving Christian art of the Early Christian period, mainly in the form of frescos and sculpted sarcophagi.\\" These catacombs show a Christian iconography emerging, initially from Roman popular decorative art, but later borrowing from official imperial and pagan motifs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Potential reasons could be a disciplinary issue, discussing academic performance, or addressing a school-related concern. Step 3: Create an opening for the conversation To begin the conversation, I will have James enter the principal's office, being greeted by the principal. This will set the scene for the dialogue. Step 4: Develop a natural flow for the conversation The conversation should progress naturally from the opening.

She had been brutally beaten and sodomized with a metal pipe. Following an investigation, eight members of a local gang, known as the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew,\\" were convicted for the gruesome murder. However, decades later, lawyers have called into question the validity of these convictions due to a crucial piece of evidence that was withheld from the prosecution. The New York Times reported that during the time of the murder, witnesses near the crime scene had reported seeing another man, James McMillan. McMillan was later convicted of assaults on two women in the same area and the murder of another woman in the same neighborhood. According to a lawyer arguing for the eight convicted gang members, McMillan's presence raises doubt about the prosecution's case. \\"He is the reason that you should have doubt about this prosecution's case,\\" the lawyer stated during a hearing at the Supreme Court on Wednesday.

The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district.

It lasted from about 174 to 163 million years ago. In European lithostratigraphy, rocks of this Middle Jurassic age are called the Dogger. This name in the past was also used to indicate the Middle Jurassic epoch itself, but is discouraged by the IUGS, to distinguish between rock units and units of geological time. - The Early Cretaceous/Middle Cretaceous (geochronological name) or the Lower Cretaceous (chronostratigraphic name), is the earlier or lower of the two major divisions of the Cretaceous. It is usually considered to stretch from 146 Ma to 100 Ma. - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - Iguanodon (; meaning \\"iguana-tooth\\") is a genus of ornithopod dinosaur that existed roughly halfway between the first of the swift bipedal hypsilophodontids of the mid-Jurassic and the duck-billed dinosaurs of the late Cretaceous. While many species have been classified in the genus \\"Iguanodon\\", dating from the late Jurassic Period to the late Cretaceous Period of Asia, Europe, and North America, research in the first decade of the 21st century suggests that there is only one well-substantiated species: \\"I. bernissartensis\\", which lived from the late Barremian to the earliest Aptian ages (Early Cretaceous) in Belgium and possibly elsewhere in Europe, between about 126 and 125 million years ago. \\"Iguanodon\\" were large, bulky herbivores. Distinctive features include large thumb spikes, which were possibly used for defense against predators, combined with long prehensile fifth fingers able to forage for food. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Not to be confused with Dyrosauridae Dryosaurids were primitive iguanodonts . They are known from Middle Jurassic to Early Cretaceous rocks of Africa , Europe , and North America . - Hypsilophodonts (named after \\"Hypsilophodon\\", itself derived from the \\"Hypsilophus\\" (\\"high-crested\\") genus of iguana lizard and literally meaning \\"\\"Hypsilophus\\"-tooth\\") were small ornithopod dinosaurs, regarded as fast, herbivorous bipeds on the order of 12 meters long (3.36.6 feet). They are known from Asia, Australia, Europe, New Zealand, North America, and South America, from rocks of Middle Jurassic to late Cretaceous age. The group traditionally has included almost all bipedal bird-hipped dinosaurs other than iguanodonts, and some early phylogenetic analyses found it to be a natural group, but more recent studies have found that the group is mostly paraphyletic and the taxa within represent a series leading up to Iguanodontia. Some of these studies have moved some traditional hypsilophodonts out of the Ornithopoda, such as \\"Agilisaurus\\" and \\"Othnielosaurus\\" (=\\"Othnielia\\"). Thus, the only certain member at this time is \\"Hypsilophodon\\". Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'parent taxon'.

They are distinctly different in terms of the context, particular information being sought after, and the responses they will generate. Let's break down each question. Firstly, \\"What is teabagging?\\" Teabagging is a term derived from the online gaming community, particularly from first-person shooter games. It is a rather comic (though questionable) action performed by a player's avatar, where the character crouches repeatedly over a defeated opponent's character to taunt or celebrate. The term mirrors a real-world action of dipping a tea bag into a cup of hot water, hence, 'teabagging.' It is seen by some gamers as a harmless, playful tactic, while others may find it disrespectful or unsporting. The second question, \\"What is the best gamer lifehack?\\" asks for a very different kind of information. Instead of seeking the definition or meaning of a particular term or behavior, it's asking for tips, tricks, or strategies to efficiently succeed in gaming or improve the overall gaming experience. A lifehack in a gaming context might involve suggestions for optimal equipment setups, software enhancements, time or task management for lengthy games, or techniques for mastering certain aspects of gameplay. In conclusion, although both questions pertain to the world of gaming, their focus is different. The first question seeks to define a specific term used in the gaming community, while the second question prompts for advice or tips to enhance a gamer's experience. Thus, they are not only answered differently but also provide different types of information.

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Q: Article: The word I'm going to introduce to you today is-phubbing. Let's see the definition of this term:phubbing n. the act of snubbing someone in a social setting by looking at your cell phone instead of paying attention As you can probably guess, phubbing is a blend of phone and snubbing. The term was coined by a 23-year-old Melbourne resident Alex Haigh. Obviously, he got fed up with how people are always checking Facebook or Twitter on their phones when they are supposed to be interacting with someone face to face. He wanted to put an end to this social phenomenon, therefore he came up with this catchy term. And it did catch on. The word's earliest media mention dates back to June 2012, and in a little over a year's time, phubbing has already been picked up by almost all the mainstream media outlets one can think of. Here is a typical example from the British newspaper The Independent. In the article titled The Rise of Phubbing, which was published on August 5, 2013, Tom Chatfield writes, there's an uncomfortable truth at the heart of phubbing: other people are easier to handle when seen on screen. They're less likely to demand unreasonable efforts such as undivided attention or clean shirts. While the term phubbing has undoubtedly taken off, some people question why it is called phubbing instead of phnubbing. Alex Haigh has not personally addressed the issue, but word has it that phubbing sounds more crispy and thus easier to remember. Phubbing is indeed a univers al problem that can no longer be ignored. So why do people keep phubbing each other if they know it's rude? Is there anything we can do to stop it? Or maybe we should just be more kind, because sometimes there are good excuses to phub. I think there is plenty we can do to try and stop phubbing. For starters, we can jo in Alex Haigh in his Stop Phubbing campaign. Remind our friends and family that phubbing is not appreciated. We can also make or download some anti-phubbing posters to spread the word in public places. And don't forget that some phubbers simply do not realize the harmful effect their behavior has on others,so be b rave enough to stop them, even if you are a total stranger.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Major Charles 'Copper' Carrington (David Niven), who has a distinguished World War II record and was awarded the Victoria Cross, is arrested for embezzling Â£125 from his unit's safe. Other charges include leaving the base and entertaining a woman officer in his room, this being forbidden by the base commander Colonel Henniker (Allan Cuthbertson). Appearing in his own defence, Carrington's case at his court-martial is that he took the money openly because of back pay owed him. The Army Paymaster had failed to pay him for expenses during postings in the Far East and his wife Valerie (Margaret Leighton) was pressuring him for money. She lives in another part of the country, and has become ill and suicidal as a result of financial worries. Carrington claims he told his superior, Colonel Henniker, about his decision to remove the money. He transferred Â£100 of it to his wife's account to give her relief from her financial problems. He then left the base to compete in a major horse race in which he betted the rest of the money on himself, hoping to be able to pay back the cash taken. When he fell from his horse, his friend Captain Alison Graham (Noelle Middleton) tried to return the money, but was denied access to the safe. As for the incident in his room, it is established that Carrington was bed-ridden from his fall and that Graham was visiting him to discuss the embezzlement. She was fully dressed and sitting on a chair when Colonel Henniker stormed in, reminding them that it was against regulations for male and female officers to be together in private quarters. Henniker admits waiting for some time between seeing Graham go to Carrington's room and then entering himself. Henniker is in fact Carrington's enemy, resenting his war record, achievements and popularity at the base. There is an element of... My question: who will be quashed and Carrington acquitted Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided plot, Major Charles \\"Copper\\" Carrington is accused of embezzlement and other charges. Over the course of the court-martial, the case unravels to reveal that Carrington took the money openly due to back pay owed to him, had informed his superior Colonel Henniker about his decision, and that the incident involving a woman officer in his room was innocent. It is also revealed that Colonel Henniker resents Carrington and is his enemy. While the plot does not specifically mention the final outcome, it is highly suggested that the charges against Carrington would be quashed, and he would be acquitted, because of the evidence and explanations presented at the trial that justify his actions and show Henniker's bias against him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (I) negative (II) positive","completion":"I would identify this review as negative (I). While the reviewer acknowledges the great production values and performers, their main focus is on the negative aspects that impacted their overall experience. Firstly, the reviewer criticizes the show's length, stating that the one-hour runtime is \\"ridiculous for the price.\\" This indicates that they didn't find the show to be a good value for the money spent, which could discourage potential viewers or attendees from watching or attending the show. Moreover, the reviewer's use of the word \\"ridiculous\\" highlights that they feel strongly about this negative aspect of the show. Secondly, the reviewer comments on how the show's music selection lacks appeal to a more modern and younger demographic. As they mention being 65 years old and still finding that the music is too outdated, the reviewer suggests that one would need to be significantly older to appreciate the musical choices. This criticism may be considered a negative aspect, as it reflects that the show is not catering to a broader audience or staying in tune with contemporary preferences. In conclusion, despite mentioning positive elements like the production values and performers, the overall tone of the review leans more towards the negative side, as the reviewer's primary focus is on the issues that impacted their enjoyment of the show. The issues raised, such as the show duration and music selection, convey dissatisfaction with the experience, leading me to categorize this review as negative (I)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Understanding the Task Firstly, I need to understand the context of the question and the options given. The question is about cowboys, people who tend cows and other livestock on a ranch and perform other farm tasks, and where they were leading the heifers, which are young female cows. Step 2: Evaluating the Options Now let's go through each option to evaluate their plausibility: - deep sea: Cowboys and heifers would not be in the deep sea as it is not the natural environment for either. - slaughterhouse: While technically a place where cows may end up, the wording of the question, specifically \\"across the property,\\" suggests a location within the same property or farm, not a separate destination which usually slaughterhouse implies. - cattle ranch: A realistic answer considering cowboys works on ranches and heifers are cattle which would be tended on a ranch. - countryside: While countryside is a viable setting for a cattle ranch, the question specifically asks about where the heifers were being herded towards, not the general area where this was taking place. - barnyard: This could be a potential destination, but it's less likely since ranch is specifically implemented in the cowboy's tasks to herd cattle. Step 3: Making the Final Decision Based on the analysis of the question and the options, the most logical answer is \\"cattle ranch\\". While few options could be somehow linked to the activity of cowboys and heifers, \\"cattle ranch\\" is the most direct and plausible answer in the context given."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"A diode that allows current to flow with light\\" Context: \\"LEDs have also been used as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits. The forward voltage drop (e.g. about 1.7 V for a normal red LED) can be used instead of a Zener diode in low-voltage regulators. Red LEDs have the flattest I/V curve above the knee. Nitride-based LEDs have a fairly steep I/V curve and are useless for this purpose. Although LED forward voltage is far more current-dependent than a Zener diode, Zener diodes with breakdown voltages below 3 V are not widely available.\\" Answer:","completion":"The type of diode that allows current to flow with light is a photodiode. In the given context, LEDs are discussed as a medium-quality voltage reference in electronic circuits. While LEDs emit light when a current is applied, a photodiode works in the opposite way, generating a current when it is exposed to light.

The answer is:","completion":"Joachim Vadian, also known as Joachim Vadianus, was born Joachim von Watt on November 29, 1484, in St. Gallen, Old Swiss Confederacy. Vadian emerged as a leading Swiss humanist scholar of the sixteenth century, known for his contributions as a scholar, historian, and editor. Vadian began his studies at the Universities of Vienna and Basel, where he immersed himself in the intellectual spheres of theology, humanism, and the sciences. His education laid the foundation for a diverse and expansive career, exploring various fields of interest and dedicating himself to public service. During his time in Vienna, Vadian became acquainted with several prominent humanists of the time, including Johannes Cuspinian, Conrad Celtis, and Jakob Wimpfeling. Their influence and intensive collaboration helped to shape Vadian's personal and intellectual growth. In 1512, he married Martha Grebel, the daughter of an esteemed apothecary in St. Gallen, further cementing his ties to the city. Upon returning to St. Gallen, Vadian's knowledge and expertise were recognized, and he was appointed as a lecturer in corresponding scientific fields such as mathematics, physics, and astronomy. Simultaneously, his political career took off as he held various public offices, including those of city physician, councillor, and mayor. He served as mayor of St. Gallen for multiple terms. As a historian, Vadian authored several Latin works, including \\"Epitome trium terrae partium Asiae, Africae et Europae compendiariam locorum descriptionem continens\\" (1534), a historic and geographical survey of the known world at the time. His other works encompassed theological, exegetical, and philological subjects, as well as political history. As an editor, he worked on numerous scientific publications. Aside from his scholarly and political pursuits, Vadian also played a pivotal role in the Protestant Reformation movement in Switzerland. He collaborated with Huldrych Zwingli and other reformers in shaping the religious landscape and took part in various theological discussions and disputes. Joachim Vadian passed away on April 6, 1551, in his birthplace, St. Gallen, Old Swiss Confederacy. His life's work significantly influenced Swiss humanist scholarship and the development of his city. An engraving after an older original by David Herrliberger from Zurich (1748) serves as a tribute to this esteemed scholar, featuring his portrait and commemorating his contributions to humanism, history, and the Reformation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Pirogues cut from the trunks of kapok trees are most often used, along with traps, nets, baskets, and fences. In the early 20th century, experienced fishermen from other parts of Senegal, along with others from Mali, Guinea, and Ghana, developed deep-sea fishing on the island and introduced new equipment.The collection of shellfish, especially oysters, is another traditional activity which still takes place in Casamance, which is one of three oyster-producing regions in Senegal, along with Petite Côte and Sine-Saloum. Oysters collect on the roots of mangrove trees which are uncovered at low tide. They are harvested during the dry season, mainly by women, who control, from harvest to distribution, an activity that requires little investment and provides them with some financial independence. Oysters are an important component of the family diet. Rich in dietary minerals and vitamin C, they are the second largest source of animal protein among the Jola people after fish, followed by chicken, and pork. Oysters are readily associated with rice, the staple food, and in times of shortage, even replace it. Locally, oysters are boiled or grilled on a wood fire and consumed with a spicy sauce. Those destined for sale or preservation, however, are sun-dried or smoked. In some villages, including Carabane, they are kept alive for several weeks before being transported to market. Oysters are also a source of income, and Carabane is located in the center of the collection zone, which is one of the reasons why boats formerly called at the island. Oysters were once easily transported from Carabane to Dakar, where they were either sold by the pickers themselves or by hawkers. contains an answer for the question: What four ways are the oysters cooked by the Jola people?, what is it ?

Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup’s rim.

As someone who frequently relies on weather updates, I find this app provides nearly everything I need in terms of functionality and performance. The user interface is very intuitive and easy to navigate. High-quality satellite images and real-time weather updates give me an accurate idea of upcoming weather conditions. The push notifications keep me informed about any significant changes in the meteorological situation around my location, helping me better plan my day. One of the standout features of the app is the radar and satellite imagery, which allows me to understand not just the current weather patterns but how they're developing. It covers both, regional and national weather patterns, making it equally useful for travelers. However, there is still room for improvement. The app occasionally suffers from slow loading times, especially when accessing more advanced features or during peak usage hours. Additionally, the weather forecast sometimes seems to be a bit off compared to other major weather services. Overall, the com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather app deserves a solid 4-star rating. While it's not perfect, its targeted focus on the Indian region, intuitive interface, and effective use of satellite imagery make it an essential part of my daily routine.

He says that \\"extreme heat and pressure change rock into metamorphic rock\\" and \\"metamorphic Rocks Metamorphic rocks are the most common rocks in which garnets are found\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Choices: --by radioactive formations --extreme cold and pressure --raw crystal formations --extreme heat and pressure --The bending of a ray of light --rays or beams --Light passing through water --solid, liquid, gas The answer is:","completion":"\\"extreme heat and pressure\\" This is the best answer to the question based on the hints provided by the teacher. Garnets formation is typically associated with metamorphic rocks which are primarily formed through extreme heat and pressure. This process tends to cause changes in the physical or chemical composition of the rocks. To explain further, the process involves pre-existing rocks, also known as parent rocks, which can be either sedimentary, igneous or even older metamorphic rocks. When these rocks are subjected to intense heat and pressure, deeper below the Earth's surface, they undergo a physical or chemical change to form metamorphic rocks. This change may not melt the rock completely, but instead, it affects the texture, crystal structures, mineralogy and can help with the formation of new minerals, such as garnets. The process often takes millions of years and it can happen in a variety of settings, such as along tectonic plate margins, or in areas where mountains are being formed. The pressure exerted on a rock will become greater with an increase in depth. Similarly, the temperature increases the deeper you go below the surface of the Earth. Garnets, which are usually deep red or brown in color, are silicate minerals that crystallize in the cubic system. They are typically found in metamorphic rocks like gneiss and schist, where they can grow large and are often well-formed crystals. So, the extreme heat and pressure are essential for their formation and crystal growth, and thus it’s the best option among the choices provided. The other choices, such as \\"by radioactive formations\\", \\"extreme cold and pressure\\", \\"raw crystal formations\\", etc., do not accurately describe the specific conditions under which garnets are usually formed.

Korn fills the role of the Scooby-Doo crew, also known as Mystery, Inc., investigating the supernatural occurrences in the town. Korn's members Jonathan Davis, James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer, Reginald \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu, Brian \\"Head\\" Welch, and David Silveria all provided their own voices for this episode, lending authenticity to the portrayal of the band.

After working extensively with the catatonic patients who survived the 1917-1928 encephalitis lethargica epidemic, Sayer discovers that certain stimuli reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states: Activities such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. While patient Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) proves elusive in this regard, Sayer soon discovers that Lowe is able to communicate with him using a Ouija board.After attending a lecture on the subject of L-Dopa and its success with Parkinson's sufferers, Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Lowe yields astounding results, as he completely \\"awakens\\" from his catatonic state; inspiring Sayer to seek funding so that all his patients can receive L-Dopa and experience \\"awakenings\\" back to reality.Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula (Penelope Ann Miller), the daughter of another patient, and begins spending time with her when she comes to the hospital to visit her father.

Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let's examine each question separately. Question 1: What if there is an equal amount of antimatter and matter in the universe? This question is about a hypothetical scenario in which the universe contains equal amounts of antimatter and matter. To answer this question, I would analyze the consequences of such a scenario, as well as the current scientific understanding of the matter-antimatter balance in the universe. Answering this question step-by-step: 1. Review current understanding of matter and antimatter distribution in the universe. 2. Evaluate a scenario in which the matter-antimatter balance is equal. 3. Analyze the consequences and implications of this scenario, including possible interactions and annihilation events. Question 2: It's said there are 10^80 atoms in the universe. Does this include antimatter and dark matter or is not enough known about those to quantify them? This question is asking whether the estimate of 10^80 atoms in the universe includes antimatter and dark matter, or if the quantification of these is still uncertain. To answer this question, I would explain the current understanding of the composition of the universe and the basis for the 10^80 atoms estimate. Answering this question step-by-step: 1. Review current understanding of the composition of the universe, including proportions of matter, antimatter, and dark matter. 2. Examine the basis for the 10^80 atoms estimate. 3. Determine whether the 10^80 atoms estimate includes antimatter and dark matter, or if these are not well-quantified within that estimate. Comparing both questions, the first question is a hypothetical scenario focusing on the consequences of an equal balance of matter and antimatter, while the second question investigates whether the estimated number of atoms in the universe includes antimatter and dark matter.

Create a 2D matrix with the dimensions \`(len(A)+1)\` x \`(len(B)+1)\`. Initialize all elements in the matrix to 0. 2. Loop through each element in both lists (use nested loops). Compare each element from list A with each element from list B. 3. If the elements from A and B are equal, add 1 to the value found in the previous diagonal cell (i.e., the cell at \`matrix[i-1][j-1]\`) and store this value in the current cell \`matrix[i][j]\`. 4. If the elements from A and B are not equal, choose the maximum value between the previous elements in the same row or the same column (i.e., \`max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1])\`) and store this value in the current cell \`matrix[i][j]\`. 5. Once you have completed all iterations, the matrix's bottom-right cell will contain the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the actual subsequence, backtrack from the bottom-right cell by considering the following rules: - If the cell value is equal to its left cell value, move left. - If the cell value is equal to its top cell value, move up. - If the cell value is the result of its top-left cell value incremented by 1, it means that this element is part of the longest common subsequence. Include it in the result and move diagonally up and to the left. 7. Reverse the subsequence (as you collected elements in reverse order) and return it. Following the procedure, here is the Python code that computes the longest common subsequence: \`\`\`python def longest_common_subsequence(A, B): matrix = [[0] * (len(B) + 1) for _ in range(len(A) + 1)] for i in range(1, len(A) + 1): for j in range(1, len(B) + 1): if A[i-1] == B[j-1]: matrix[i][j] = matrix[i-1][j-1] + 1 else: matrix[i][j] = max(matrix[i-1][j], matrix[i][j-1]) longest_subsequence = [] i, j = len(A), len(B) while i > 0 and j > 0: if matrix[i][j] == matrix[i-1][j]: i -= 1 elif matrix[i][j] == matrix[i][j-1]: j -= 1 else: longest_subsequence.append(A[i-1]) i -= 1 j -= 1 return longest_subsequence[::-1] A = [9635, 4025, 'i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a', 'c', 8077, 9137, 4637] B = ['L', 'k', 'i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a', 'x', 9437, 'F', 'i', 'M'] result = longest_common_subsequence(A, B) print(result) \`\`\` This code will output the longest common subsequence: \`\`\` ['i', 'c', '6597', 'j', '645', 'C', 'a'] \`\`\` This is the longest common subsequence in the given lists A and B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say he was satisfied or dissatisfied? Title: Didn't Last Long-No Customer Service Review: I purchased this item last April and had used it only 8-10 times through the summer. It worked well (when it was operational) on small jobs that I needed done. However, in October I needed to do some maintenance on the pool but when I turned it on, the motor/blades (for lack of a better word) would barely turn, sounding as if the motor was freezing up. I contacted customer service twice (both times I got an answering machine) and have never received a call back. I gave up after reading the small print in the instruction booklet, as it says for returns you must have the original packing box. Of course, it's a catch-22; even if I still had the container, I couldn't get a call back. I was not impressed with the item or the (complete lack of) customer service. Order at your own risk. A:","completion":"Based on the customer's review, it can be concluded that the customer was dissatisfied with the product and the overall experience. There are a few reasons to support this conclusion. 1. Product durability: The customer expressed disappointment in the product's performance, as it didn't last long even though it was used only 8-10 times. The motor seemed to be freezing up, which indicates a possible malfunction or low quality of the product. 2. Inadequate customer service: The customer reached out to the customer service twice to discuss the issue with the product but received no response. This shows that the company's customer service failed to address the customer's concerns, which adds to the dissatisfied experience. 3. Frustration with the return policy: The customer also emphasized that the return policy required the original packing box, which they no longer had. However, even if they had retained the container, they were unable to get in touch with the customer service, creating a catch-22 situation. This further adds to the dissatisfaction that the customer faced. 4. Lack of trust in the company: In the review, the customer warns future buyers to \\"order at your own risk.\\" This statement suggests that the customer was so unhappy with the product and customer service that they wouldn't recommend the product to others. In summary, based on the customer's review, it is reasonable to conclude that they were dissatisfied, citing issues with the product's durability, a lack of customer service, and frustration with the return policy. The customer's final remark highlights the lack of trust in the company and the overall negative experience they had with the product."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They don't act in the romantic ways that I read in books or I see on TV. My father has a bad temper. When he's tired from the hard work, it is easy for him to lose his temper. One day, my mother was sewing a quilt . \\"Mom, may I ask you a question?\\" I said. \\"What?\\" \\"Is there love between you and Dad?\\" I asked her in a very low voice. My mother stopped her work and raised her head in surprise. She didn't answer immediately. Then she continued to sew the quilt. I was very worried because I thought I had hurt her. But at last I heard my mother say the following words: \\"Susan, look at the thread . Sometimes it appears, but most of it disappears in the quilt. It makes the quilt strong. If life is a quilt, then love should be a thread. It can hardly be seen, but it's really there. Love is inside.\\" I couldn't understand her until the next spring. My dad got sick suddenly. My mum had to stay with him in the hospital for a month. When they returned, they both looked very pale. _ . After they were back, every day in the morning and dusk, my mother helped my father walk slowly on the country road. The doctor had said my father would recover in two months. But after two months he still couldn't walk by himself. All of us were worried about him. \\"Dad, how are you feeling now?\\" I asked. \\"Susan, don't worry about me,\\" he said gently. \\"I just like walking with your mom. I like this kind of life.\\" Looking at his eyes, I knew he loves my mother deeply. Once I thought love meant flowers, gifts and sweet kisses. But now, I understand that love is just like the thread.

A) her mum was angry with her B) her mum didn't know how to answer the question C) she thought she hurt her mum's heart D) her mum's answer was hard to understand","completion":"The story you shared about your parents portrays a deep understanding of love that is not often depicted in media or popular culture. It is not always the grand gestures, romantic storylines, or perfect relationships that define love, but rather the quiet strength and support that binds two people together through life's ups and downs. Yes, your parents might not show their love in the same way that books or television series do, but that doesn't mean they don't share a deep connection. When you asked your mother about the love between her and your father, her response was profound. By using the metaphor of a thread in a quilt that is not always seen but still contributes to its strength and warmth, she explained that love is not always visible, but it is always present. It was not until your father's illness that you were able to grasp the full meaning of your mother's words. The way she cared for him in the hospital and helped him through his recovery shows the strength of their bond. Your father's confession about enjoying the walks with your mother and the look in his eyes when talking about her are true demonstrations of love. In response to the question about why the writer felt worried, the correct answer would be C) she thought she hurt her mum's heart. Your concern stemmed from the fact that your mother did not immediately respond to your question about love between her and your dad. You may have been worried that you crossed a boundary or brought up a sensitive subject. However, your mother's eventual response was gentle and insightful, teaching you a valuable lesson about love. Real-life love is neither perfect nor straightforward, but it is the quiet moments, acts of care, and unspoken support that truly define the relationship between two people. Your parents may not always display their love overtly, but their shared life experiences and the way they face challenges together are a testament to the love that exists within their relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some ancient people believed that lightning and thunder were the weapons of the gods. In reality, lightning is a flow of electricity formed high above the earth. A single flash of lightning 1.6 kilometers long has enough electricity to light one million light bulbs . The American scientist and statesman, Benjamin Franklin, was the first to show the connection between electricity and lightning in 1752. In the same year he also built the first lightning rod . This device protects buildings from being damaged by lightning. Modern science has discovered that one stroke of lightning has a voltage of more than 15 million volts . A flash of lightning between a cloud and the earth may be as long as 13 kilometers, and travel at a speed of 30 million meters per second. Scientists judge that there are about 2,000 million flashes of lightning per year. Lightning hits the Empire State Building in New York City 30 to 48 times a year. In the United States alone it kills an average of one person every day. The safest place to be in case of an electrical storm is in a closed car.

It includes the Patimokkha, a set of 227 rules for monks in the Theravadin recension. The precise content of the vinayapitaka (scriptures on Vinaya) differs slightly according to different schools, and different schools or subschools set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya. Novice-monks use the ten precepts, which are the basic precepts for monastics.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The Patimokkha, a foundational aspect of the Vinaya, refers to the collection of rules and regulations guiding the monastic conduct within the Theravada Buddhist tradition. As a moral code specifically designed for monks and nuns, the Patimokkha plays a crucial role in shaping the monastic life and maintaining community harmony. The term \\"Patimokkha\\" can be broken down into two components: \\"Pati\\" meaning \\"toward\\" and \\"Mokkha\\" meaning \\"liberation.\\" This conveys that the rules are intended to guide the monastic community towards spiritual liberation. Comprising 227 rules for monks (Bhikkhus) and 311 rules for nuns (Bhikkhunis), the Patimokkha serves as a code of conduct that provides a practical framework for monastic discipline. These rules focus on promoting a lifestyle that fosters mindfulness, simplicity, and meditation, thereby enabling monks and nuns to stay on the path to enlightenment while living harmoniously within the monastic community. The Patimokkha rules can be divided into eight categories, based on the severity of the transgression and the corresponding penalties. The categories are: 1. Parajika: Rules that entail expulsion from the monastic community. There are four Parajika rules for monks and eight for nuns. Violation of these rules leads to immediate expulsion from the monastic order. 2. Sanghadisesa: Rules that call for disciplinary proceedings within the community. There are thirteen Sanghadisesa rules for monks and seventeen for nuns. Offenders must undergo penance and rehabilitation under the supervision of the monastic community. 3. Aniyata: Rules with undetermined penalties that require the offender to undergo a formal inquiry by the community. There are two Aniyata rules for monks and nuns. 4. Nissaggiya Pacittiya: Rules involving offenses that require the relinquishment of any gains made from the offense and confession. There are thirty Nissaggiya Pacittiya rules for monks and thirty-two for nuns. 5. Pacittiya: Rules that necessitate self-confession and acknowledgment of the offense in front of a fellow monastic. There are ninety-two Pacittiya rules for monks and one hundred and sixty-six for nuns. 6. Patidesaniya: Rules requiring an acknowledgment of wrongdoing but not a formal confession. There are four Patidesaniya rules for monks and eight for nuns. 7. Sekhiya: Rules of training that provide guidance on appropriate monastic behavior and etiquette. There are seventy-five Sekhiya rules for both monks and nuns. 8. Adhikarana-samatha: Rules governing the resolution of conflicts within the monastic community. There are seven Adhikarana-samatha rules for both monks and nuns. In addition to the Patimokkha, the Vinaya also includes regulations for novice monks (Samaneras) who adhere to the ten precepts, which serve as basic guidelines for monastic life. These precepts, a more simplified and less stringent code of conduct, aid in laying the foundation for future adoption of the complete Patimokkha rules when the novice monk is ready to advance within the monastic order. While the Patimokkha serves as a significant source of monastic discipline across the Theravada tradition, the precise content of the Vinaya Pitaka varies slightly among the different schools and subschools of Buddhism.

Generally, the film is a dark and quirky \\"tragicomedy\\". The \\"everyman\\" protagonist, Dr. Frank Sangster, is a dentist with a fairly pleasant but rather innocuous, ordinary and uneventful life. But all of this gets derailed, and Frank's life descends into an increasingly complex mess, from the minute a beautiful and seductive new patient named Susan Ivey comes to him, seeking a root canal and a little pain relief. On Susan's initial office visit, Frank schedules her for a root canal the very next day, and offers her some Ibuprofen to address her pain in the meanwhile. Claiming that she is allergic to the offered medication, Susan requests a prescription for the addictive pain-killer Demerol. Frank provides the prescription, but only for five tablets. However, Susan changes the dosage from five tablets to fifty when she collects the medication from her pharmacist. Susan arrives for her appointment twelve hours late, having mistaken the time. She seduces Frank, talking him into getting drunk and having sex with her. During the night, Susan steals all of Frank's narcotics. The next day, there is a DEA agent at Frank's office demanding to see the dentist's narcotics supply, because an 18-year-old has driven a car off a cliff under the influence of cocaine hydrochloride from a bottle registered to the dentist. Knowing that Susan has stolen his entire drug supply, Frank puts the agent off, saying he dispensed it all to patients. The agent leaves with the promise that if Frank fails to produce the empty containers in two days, the DEA will place him under arrest. That night Frank goes to Susan's hotel room to demand the empty containers, threatening that he'll call the police if she doesn't provide them.

A man buys heroin from his dealer, Mike. The man meets two mobsters who are also looking for Mike, because he owes them 100,000. The mobsters shoot the man and leave him for dead. In Paraguay, siblings Rudy and Gloria and their friend Pat prepare for a journey into the rain forest. They plan to prove Gloria's theory that cannibalism is a myth. The trio encounter Mike and his partner Joe. Joe is badly wounded; Mike explains that they were attacked by cannibals. During the night, Gloria goes missing and Rudy finds a native village while looking for her. Due to Joe's injuries, the travelers decide to stay in the nearly deserted village. Mike seduces the naive Pat. In a cocaine-fueled rage, he encourages Pat to kill a native girl. She is unable to do it, so Mike kills the girl himself. In his dying moments, Joe reveals that he and Mike were responsible for the cannibals' aggression. They came to the region to exploit the natives for emeralds and cocaine, taking advantage of their trust in white men. One day, while high on cocaine, Mike brutally tortured and killed their native guide in full view of the tribe. A badly charred body, previously believed to be that of a different guide, is actually this native. Mike kidnapped a native girl to lead them out of the jungle, but the outsiders were followed and attacked. Following the latest murder, the natives hunt the outsiders. Joe dies of his wounds, and his body is found and cannibalized by the natives in full view of Rudy and Gloria, who are hiding from the natives. Mike and Pat abandon the others, but all are captured by the natives and forced into a cage. The prisoners are forced to watch Mike as he is tortured and beaten. The natives transport their prisoners to another village, but Rudy manages to escape. He is caught in a booby trap in the jungle, and his bleeding wounds attract piranhas.

Sentence 2: Kim Un Yong's daughter rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic.

So, looking at the sentences you gave me: in the first one, it says arrangements were made for Kim Un Yong's daughter to rehearse with the Berlin Philharmonic. That means she definitely rehearsed with them. The second sentence also says that she rehearsed with the Berlin Philharmonic. There's no other possible interpretation, so the first sentence does entail the second one.

In order to make the event successful and enjoyable for everyone involved, they will likely need to complete a series of tasks beyond just going to the store to buy things. Here are some potential steps that Jordan's friends and others may want to take next: 1. Create a guest list: It's crucial to know who's coming to the party, as this will help determine the required supplies and space. Jordan's friends can start by creating a guest list that includes names and contact information. They should also consider sending out invitations with RSVP requests to help manage the expected attendance. 2. Plan the party theme: Depending on the occasion, Jordan's friends might want to choose a theme for the party. This can help with selecting decorations, food, and potential activities during the event. 3. Purchase decorations: Besides the general supplies, they'll need to buy decorations that fit the party's theme. This could include items like balloons, banners, tablecloths, and festive centerpieces. 4. Plan a menu: Food is an essential component of any party. Jordan's friends should consider what kind of food they want to serve, be it finger foods, a buffet-style meal, or a sit-down dinner. They should also keep in mind any dietary restrictions among the guests. 5. Arrange for beverages: Alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks should be considered for the guests. They can choose to buy pre-made beverages or prepare their cocktails depending on their preferences and the party atmosphere. 6. Organize entertainment: No party is complete without some form of entertainment. Jordan's friends can plan for music (either by creating a playlist or hiring a DJ), organize games, or even consider hiring a magician or other performers to keep guests entertained throughout the event. 7. Set up the party space: Before the party begins, they need to make sure the location is clean and arranged to accommodate the guests. This includes arranging seating, setting up tables for food and drinks, and decorating the area according to the chosen theme. 8. Provide transportation: Depending on the location of the party, Jordan's friends might want to help guests with transportation to and from the event. They could arrange carpools, hire a shuttle service, or provide details for local public transportation. 9. Capture memories: To remember the event, Jordan's friends may want to designate a photographer (either professional or an amateur friend) to capture pictures throughout the party. 10. Write thank you notes: After the party, it's essential for Jordan's friends to express gratitude to the guests for attending. Sending personalized notes or emails can help keep friendships strong and show appreciation for their presence.

And I was wondering What will Casey want to do next? Options are: 1). project their voice. 2). fall off stage. 3). get stage fright.","completion":"It's great to hear that Casey has landed the big role as the love interest in the school play! Based on the options you provided, it seems most likely that Casey would want to focus on option 1, projecting their voice. This is a crucial skill for any actor, as it helps ensure that the audience can hear the dialogue clearly and understand the story. Projecting one's voice means making it louder and clearer, so it carries effectively across the entire performance space. To do this, actors need to practice various techniques like proper breath support, resonance, diction, and maintaining a good posture. This will not only give Casey the confidence to perform well in front of an audience, but also make them a more effective communicator on stage. Options 2 and 3, falling off stage and getting stage fright, are undesirable outcomes that Casey would want to avoid. Falling off stage can lead to injuries and disrupt the performance, while stage fright can negatively impact an actor's ability to perform at their best.

Analyze the objects of the sentences: In the first sentence, the object is \\"with people,\\" while in the second sentence, the object is \\"with two men.\\" The meaning of \\"people\\" is broader, as it encompasses all individuals without specifying gender or number. In comparison, \\"two men\\" is more specific and indicates two male individuals. 4. Consider the overall meaning and context: Overall, both sentences describe an interaction between a lion and a group of people. However, the first sentence is broader and could include any number of people, regardless of gender, while the second sentence is specific to two men. Based on these observations, I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 4 on a scale of 0-5. The sentences are quite similar as they have the same subject, verb, and overall theme.

Given the context: What does Skylar need to do before this? A:","completion":"Before Skylar can get new glasses after renewing their prescription at the doctor's, they need to do the following steps: 1. Schedule an eye exam: Skylar needs to make an appointment with an optometrist (eye doctor) to have their eyes tested. This usually involves booking a suitable time and date for the exam. 2. Attend the eye exam: During the eye exam, the optometrist will evaluate Skylar's visual acuity, eye health, and discuss any concerns or issues they might be experiencing with their vision. The optometrist may also test for any other eye problems, such as glaucoma or cataracts. 3. Obtain a prescription: If the optometrist determines that Skylar needs vision correction, they will provide a prescription specifying the strength and type of lenses required for their glasses. The prescription will include important information, such as the lens power (measured in diopters) for each eye - specified as sphere, cylinder, and axis values - and the pupillary distance (PD). 4. Choose frames and lenses: With a valid prescription in hand, Skylar can now visit an optical store or shop online for new glasses. They will need to select frames that suit their face shape, personal style, and comfort. Additionally, they need to select lenses made of the appropriate material (e.g., plastic, glass, or polycarbonate) and any optional features such as anti-reflective or scratch-resistant coatings, tints, or polarization. 5. Place the order: Once Skylar has chosen the frames and lenses, they should provide the prescription details to the optical store or online retailer, who will then create the glasses accordingly. The ordering process may also involve taking additional measurements, such as bridge width or temple length, to ensure a proper fit. 6. Wait for the glasses: After placing the order, Skylar will need to wait for the glasses to be prepared, which could take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the complexity of the prescription and the chosen options. Upon receiving the new glasses, Skylar should try them on and check the fit, comfort, and vision quality. It's important to address any issues with the optical store or online retailer promptly, as there might be a limited time window for adjustments, exchanges, or refunds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Your task is to generate answer \\"yes\\" when the tweet has that particular sentiment, otherwise generate answer \\"no\\". Input: Review: \\"Carriers\\" follows the exploits of two guys and two gals in a stolen Mercedes with the words road warrior on the hood hightailing it down the highway for the beach with surfboards strapped to the top of their car. Brian (Chris Pine of \\"Star Trek\\") is driving and his girlfriend Bobby (Piper Perabo of \\"Coyote Ugly\\")has shotgun, while Brian's younger brother, Danny (Lou Taylor Pucci of \\"Fanboys\\") and his friend--not exactly girlfriend--Kate (Emily VanCamp of \\"The Ring 2\\") occupy the backseat. This quartet of twentysomething characters are living in a nightmare. Apparently, a viral pandemic--which co-directors & co-scenarists Alex Pastor and David Pastor tell us absolutely nothing about--has devastated America. Naturally, the lack of exposition shaves off at least fifteen minutes that would have slowed down this cynical melodrama about how humans degenerate in a crisis and become their own worst enemies.This lethal virus gives you the shingles and then you bleed and die. Most everybody runs around wearing those white masks strapped to their nose and mouth by a thin rubber band. Initially, this foursome encounters a desperate father, Frank (Christopher Meloni of \\"Runaway Bride\\"),and his cute little daughter Jodie (Kiernan Shipka of \\"Land of the Lost\\") blocking the highway with their SUV. Brian swerves around Frank when he tries to waylay them, but in the process, the oil pan in their Mercedes ruptures and they wind up on foot. Reluctantly, they hitch a ride with Frank after they seal Jodie up in the rear of the SUV. She wears a mask over her nose and mouth and it is speckled with blood. Frank has heard that doctors are curing ailing people at a hospital and they head to it. Sadly, somebody has lied to Frank. The hospital physician is giving the last couple of kids some Kool-Aid that will put them out of their misery. The cure did not improve their condition. Everybody else in town is dead. Kate tries without success to get a dial tone on every phone. Frank realizes that there is no hope for his daughter and he lets the heroic quartet appropriate his SUV and take off.Indeed, \\"Carriers\\" qualifies as a relentlessly depressing movie about the effects of a pandemic on four sympathetic people who degenerate into homicidal murderers to protect themselves. They reach a country club and frolic around on a golf course until another four show up in suits and masks with pump-action shotguns. Incredibly, our protagonists manage to escape without getting shot, but Brian has a scare when he almost falls into the water with a floating corpse. Eventually, they discover that one of them has become infected. Later, as they are about to run out of gas, Brian blocks the highway like Frank did at the outset. Danny tries to stop a pair of older Christian women driving the car. Danny lies that his pregnant wife is about to give birth and he needs their help. Brian throws caution to the wind and blasts away at the ladies with his automatic pistol when they refuse to help them. Brian catches a slug in the leg from the passenger, but he kills her. No,\\"Carriers\\" is not a beer & pizza movie that you can either laugh off or laugh with because the humor is virtually non-existent. By the end of this 84-minute movie, our heroes have turned into villains who only care only for themselves and their plight. Chris Pine makes quite an impression as fun-loving Brian and his energetic performance is the only reason to hang with this hokum, while the only other well-known actress, Piper Perabo, is relegated to an inconsequential girlfriend role. As Bobby, she makes tragic the mistake of showing compassion to a dying little girl and pays an awful price. It is a testament to Pine's performance that he can change his character to the point of putting himself before others. Essentially, Pine has the only role that gives him the ability to pull a one-eighty from happy-go-lucky guy to heartless guy. The two directors are Spanish brothers, and they never let the momentum flag. Since there is no relief in sight, \\"Carriers\\" sinks into predictability. \\"Irréversible\\" cinematographer Benoît Debie does a fantastic job with his widescreen lensing and as unsavory as this road trip becomes, Debie makes it look like a dynamic film. Aside from the lack of a happy ending or closure in any sense of the word, \\"Carriers\\" suffers because it is so horribly cynical. The scene when the German shepherd attacks Danny conjures up the most suspense, but even it could have been improved. Unfortunately, the Pastor brothers do not scare up either much tension or suspense. By fade-out, you really don't care what happens to anybody. Question: is it a negative review?

How to make light fettuccine alfredo Cook the fettuccine. Bring a large sauce pot full of water to a boil over high heat. Once the water boils, remove the lid and add 1 pound (454 g) of dry fettuccine pasta.","completion":"Stir occasionally to prevent the pasta from sticking together. Allow the fettuccine to cook for about 8-10 minutes or until it reaches an al dente texture (firm but not hard). You can test this by removing a piece of pasta from the pot, letting it cool for a moment, and biting into it to check the consistency. Keep in mind that the fettuccine will continue to cook slightly after being drained, so it's better to err on the side of a slightly firmer texture. Drain the pasta. Once the fettuccine is cooked to your desired texture, carefully pour the pasta and water into a colander or use a slotted spoon to remove the pasta from the pot. Allow the pasta to drain for a few moments, then give it a gentle shake to get rid of any excess water. While it's draining, you can start to prepare the light alfredo sauce. Prepare the ingredients for the sauce. To create a lighter alfredo sauce, you will need the following ingredients: - 2 cups (480 ml) of low-fat milk - 1 cup (240 ml) of low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth - 3 cloves of garlic, minced - ¼ cup (30 g) of all-purpose flour - ½ teaspoon of salt (or to taste) - ¼ teaspoon of freshly ground black pepper (or to taste) - ¾ cup (85 g) of grated parmesan cheese - 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter - Chopped fresh parsley, for garnish (optional) Create a slurry for the sauce. In a small bowl, whisk together ¼ cup (60 ml) of the low-fat milk and all-purpose flour until a smooth paste is formed. This slurry will be used to thicken the sauce without using heavy cream, allowing for a lighter alfredo. Saute garlic and heat the milk mixture. In a large saucepan, melt the unsalted butter over medium-low heat. Add the minced garlic and cook for 1-2 minutes or until fragrant but not browned. Gradually whisk in the remaining low-fat milk (1¾ cups or 420 ml), low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, salt, and black pepper. Increase the heat to medium and allow the liquid to come to a simmer. Thicken the sauce. Slowly whisk the slurry into the simmering milk mixture, continuously stirring to prevent any clumps from forming. Cook the sauce, continuously stirring, for about 2-3 minutes or until it has thickened enough to coat the back of a spoon. Add parmesan cheese. Remove the saucepan from heat and gradually stir in the grated parmesan cheese until it melts and the sauce is smooth and creamy. Adjust salt and black pepper as needed. Combine the fettuccine and sauce. Add the drained fettuccine to the saucepan with the alfredo sauce and toss gently to coat each noodle evenly. Allow the pasta to absorb some of the sauce for a minute or two before serving. Serve the light fettuccine alfredo. Transfer the pasta to individual serving plates, garnishing with a sprinkle of freshly chopped parsley if desired. Serve immediately while the dish is still warm, accompanied by a salad or steamed vegetables, and a slice of crusty bread to complete your lighter meal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Texans scored first with 5:55 left after Blue caught a pass from Fitzpatrick to lead 7-0. In the second quarter Ben Roethlisberger was sacked by Watt and fumbled the ball near midfield. Houston capitalized on the turnover with a Bullock 39 yard field goal to lead 10-0 with 13:39 left in the 2nd. Houston continued their trend of scoring on each possession with another Bullock field goal (38 yards) to extend their lead to 13-0 with 7:20 left; part of the same drive included the Texans converting on a 4th down and inches. The Steelers finally managed to get on the board with a 44-yard field goal from Shaun Suisham to trail 3-13 with 3:13 left. After forcing a 3 and out for the Texans, the Steelers struck back with a 35-yard touchdown pass from Roerhlisberger to Bryant to trail 10-13 with 1:27 left. After a Houston fumble at their 4-yard line, Pittsburgh took their first lead of the night to lead 17-13 with 1:03 remaining. The Steelers scored off of another Texans turnover after a Fitzpatrick pass was deflected to extend their lead with 0:14 left in the half. Following a series of Houston turnovers in arguably the worst-played three minutes in NFL history, Pittsburgh lead 24-13 at the half.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. and the situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean.

Options: - office depot - cup - pencil shop - shelf - classroom The answer is \\"cup\\" because A:","completion":"The answer is \\"cup\\" because a cup serves as an efficient, convenient, and accessible storage solution for holding multiple pencils in various environments. Let's look at the other options provided and analyze why the cup is the superior choice. 1. Office Depot: While Office Depot is a well-known retail store that sells office supplies, it is not a practical place to keep many pencils, especially when you need to use them regularly. Going to the store every time you need to grab a pencil would be quite inconvenient, and it is not a dedicated storage solution, but instead a place to purchase pencils. 2. Pencil shop: Like Office Depot, a pencil shop is a place to buy pencils rather than keep them. Although you may find a great variety of pencils there, it doesn't provide an immediate storage solution for personal use. Also, going to a pencil shop every time you need a pencil would be time-consuming and impractical. 3. Shelf: A shelf might be a good place to store and display a pencil collection, but it isn't the most convenient or efficient option. Shelves often require more room and offer little assistance in keeping the pencils organized, as they can quickly become cluttered or disorganized. Also, accessing a pencil from a shelf may necessitate reaching for it, which may not be as convenient as picking it up from a cup. 4. Classroom: A classroom is a location where pencils are often used, but it is not a dedicated storage solution. Instead, a classroom usually has multiple storage options, such as desks, drawers, or even cups, which hold pencils. Storing pencils in a classroom without a proper containment method would not be beneficial or organized, making it an unsuitable option. A cup, on the other hand, offers several benefits for storing multiple pencils. It is a versatile and portable solution that can be placed in various environments, such as home offices, classrooms, or workplaces. A cup can easily be moved around, making it convenient when you need to use or share your pencils. Additionally, a cup can hold multiple pencils vertically, which aids in keeping them neat, organized, and easily accessible. In conclusion, a cup is the most suitable option among the choices provided, as it ensures convenience, accessibility, versatility, and organization – qualities that the other alternatives do not offer in terms of pencil storage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Sixty-year-old multi-billionaire Robert Miller manages a hedge fund with his daughter Brooke Miller (Brit Marling) and is about to sell it for a handsome profit. However, unbeknownst to his daughter and most of his other employees, he has cooked his company's books in order to cover an investment loss and avoid being arrested for fraud. As she thinks that the business is so successful, Brooke can't understand why her father wants to sell - and he says that he's started to feel old and tired, and wants to spend more time with his family. However, he has a mistress (Laetitia Casta) who is supposedly supported financially by him. Miller looks extremely nervous with the last meeting with the prospective investor.One night, while driving with his mistress, he begins to doze off and has an accident in which she is killed. Miller leaves the scene and decides to cover up his involvement to prevent the public, the prospective buyer James Mayfield (Graydon Carter) and his wife (Susan Sarandon), from discovering the truth.Miller calls Jimmy Grant (Nate Parker), a twenty-three year old from Harlem with a criminal record whom he helped get off the street in the past. After being driven home by Grant, Miller drags his injured body into bed at 4:30 am, arousing suspicion in his wife. The next day, he is questioned by police detective Bryer (Tim Roth). Bryer is keen on arresting a billionaire for murder and begins to put the pieces together. While all this is going on, Miller's daughter discovers the financial irregularities and realizes that she could be implicated and confronts her father.Jimmy is arrested and placed before a grand jury but still refuses to admit to helping Miller. Miller once again contemplates turning himself in. Even though Jimmy is about to go to prison, Miller tells Jimmy that investors are depending on him and that waiting for the sale to close before coming forward would serve the greater good.

Solve -220*n + 30*n + 1710 = 0 for n.","completion":"To solve the equation -220n + 30n + 1710 = 0 for n, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The equation contains two terms with the variable n: -220n and 30n. Combine these terms by adding them together: -220n + 30n = -190n. So the equation becomes -190n + 1710 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable term. To isolate the variable term -190n, move the constant term (1710) to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: -190n + 1710 - 1710 = 0 - 1710. This simplifies to -190n = -1710. Step 3: Solve for the variable n. To find the value of n, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable term (-190): (-190n) / (-190) = (-1710) / (-190). Both sides of the equation now become: n = 9.

Information: - Archosaurs are a group of diapsid amniotes whose living representatives consist of birds and crocodilians. This group also includes all extinct non-avian dinosaurs, extinct crocodilian relatives, and pterosaurs. Archosauria, the archosaur clade, is a crown group that includes the most recent common ancestor of living birds and crocodilians. It includes two main clades: Pseudosuchia, which includes crocodilians and their extinct relatives, and Ornithosuchia, which includes birds and their extinct relatives (such as non-avian dinosaurs and pterosaurs). - Desmatosuchinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs, the other being Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to \\"Desmatosuchus\\" than the last common ancestor of \\"Desmatosuchus\\" and \\"Stagonolepis\\". All synapomorphies that diagnose the clade can be found in the osteoderms. These include tongue-and-groove articulations for lateral plates present in dorsal presacral paramedian plates and large spikes on the lateral cervical, dorsal, and caudal plates. - Aetosaurinae is one of the two subfamilies of aetosaurs , the other being Desmatosuchinae . It is a stem - based taxon defined as all aetosaurs more closely related to Aetosaurus than to the last common ancestor of Aetosaurus and Desmatosuchus . The only synapomorphy that diagnoses the clade Aetosaurinae is the medial offset of the dorsal eminences of the paramedian osteoderms . A phylogenetic study in 2012 found Aetosaurinae to be paraphyletic , with Aetosaurus being the basal-most stagonolepidid and aetosaurines like Calyptosuchus , Neoaetosauroides , and the newly described Aetobarbakinoides being successively more derived taxa leading up to a clade containing Desmatosuchinae and Typothoracisinae . Under this phylogeny , most traditional aetosaurines are more closely related to Desmatosuchus than they are to Aetosaurus , and the clade Aetosaurinae can only include Aetosaurus . - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Desmatosuchus (from Greek \\"desmos\\" 'link' + \\"soûkhos\\" 'crocodile') is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the Order Aetosauria. It lived during the Late Triassic. - Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur. Its type and only species is \\"N. engaeus\\". Fossils have been found from the Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in La Rioja, Argentina, and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic. It was the first aetosaur known from the formation, with remains being discovered in the 1960s. - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - Aetosaurus is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile belonging to the order Aetosauria. It is generally considered to be the most primitive aetosaur. Three species are currently recognized: \\"A. ferratus\\", the type species from Germany and Italy; \\"A. crassicauda\\" from Germany; and \\"A. arcuatus\\" from eastern North America. Additional specimens referred to \\"Aetosaurus\\" have been found from South Africa, the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States, and the Fleming Fjord Formation of Greenland. Specimens of \\"Aetosaurus\\" occur in Norian-age strata. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - The Late Triassic is the third and final of three epochs of the Triassic Period in the geologic timescale. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages. - Typothoracisinae is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs closer to \\"Typothorax\\" than to \\"Stagonolepis\\" or \\"Desmatosuchus\\". As with many aetosaur taxa, most of the synapomorphies that diagnose the clade are found in the osteoderms. These include a strongly acute angle of flexion between the dorsal and lateral flanges of the dorsal and lateral plates and triangular-shaped pelvic and anterior caudal dorsal lateral plates possessing semicircular borders and hook-like eminences. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Emil Hans Willi Hennig (April 20, 1913 November 5, 1976) was a German biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in 1950. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (ordinary flies and mosquitoes). - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - In biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also \\"last common ancestor\\" LCA, or \\"concestor\\") of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group, for are directly descended. The term is also used reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms. - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\". - In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characteristic of a clade. Apomorphy implies a characteristic that is different from the form of an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, of use in determining membership in a clade. Synapomorphy is a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms. In other words, it is an apomorphy shared by members of a monophyletic group, and thus assumed to be present in their most recent common ancestor. The word synapomorphy, coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig, is derived from the Greek words ', \\"syn\\" = shared; ', \\"apo\\" = away from; and \\"\\", \\"morphe\\" = shape.A - In zoological nomenclature, a type species (\\"species typica\\") is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type specimen(s). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a type genus. - Calyptosuchus (meaning \\"covered crocodile\\") is an extinct genus of crurotarsan from the Late Triassic of North America. As an aetosaur, it was heavily armored and had a pig-like snout used to uproot plants. The genus might be a junior synonym of \\"Stagonolepis\\". - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - Typothorax is an extinct genus of typothoracisine aetosaur that lived in the Late Triassic. Its remains have been found in North America. Two species are known: \\"T. coccinarum\\", the type species, and \\"T. antiquum\\". - Stagonolepis is an extinct genus of stagonolepidid aetosaur known from the Late Triassic (Carnian stage) of Europe. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - Aetosaurs (\\"aetosaur\\" ; order name \\"Aetosauria\\" ; from Greek, (aetos, \\"eagle\\") and (sauros, \\"lizard\\")) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera. What is the relationship between 'aetosaurinae' and 'subfamily'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Aetosaurinae is a subfamily within the family Stagonolepididae. In biological classification, a subfamily is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Aetosaurinae, being a subfamily, is a group of more closely related aetosaurs that share certain characteristics and are considered to have a common ancestor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeffrey's friend Robert gives Jeffrey a bottle of gibberellins one day and tells Jeffrey to pour some of the bottle onto the daisies. Jeffrey doesn't question this, because he is very trusting of his friend Robert, and pours the gibberellins onto the daisies, but not onto the roses. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which plants will grow slower, the daisies or the roses? Hint: Gibberellins are hormones that cause the plant to grow. When gibberellins are applied to plants by scientists, the stems grow longer. Some gardeners or horticulture scientists add gibberellins to increase the growth of plants. Dwarf plants (small plants), on the other hand, have low levels of gibberellins ( Figure below ). Another function of gibberellins is to stop dormancy (resting time) of seeds and buds. Gibberellins signal that it’s time for a seed to germinate (sprout) or for a bud to open. A:","completion":"Given the information provided, the roses will grow slower than the daisies. This is because Jeffrey applied gibberellins, a hormone responsible for promoting plant growth, to the daisies but not to the roses. Since gibberellins cause plants to have longer stems and promote overall growth, the daisies that received this hormone treatment will grow at a faster rate compared to the roses, which did not receive any gibberellin treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Holst's absorption of folksong, not only in the melodic sense but in terms of its simplicity and economy of expression, helped to develop a style that many of his contemporaries, even admirers, found austere and cerebral. This is contrary to the popular identification of Holst with The Planets, which Matthews believes has masked his status as a composer of genuine originality. Against charges of coldness in the music, Imogen cites Holst's characteristic \\"sweeping modal tunes mov[ing] reassuringly above the steps of a descending bass\\", while Michael Kennedy points to the 12 Humbert Wolfe settings of 1929, and the 12 Welsh folksong settings for unaccompanied chorus of 1930–31, as works of true warmth.Many of the characteristics that Holst employed — unconventional time signatures, rising and falling scales, ostinato, bitonality and occasional polytonality — set him apart from other English composers. Vaughan Williams remarked that Holst always said in his music what he wished to say, directly and concisely; \\"He was not afraid of being obvious when the occasion demanded, nor did he hesitate to be remote when remoteness expressed his purpose\\". Kennedy has surmised that Holst's economy of style was in part a product of the composer's poor health: \\"the effort of writing it down compelled an artistic economy which some felt was carried too far\\". However, as an experienced instrumentalist and orchestra member, Holst understood music from the standpoint of his players and made sure that, however challenging, their parts were always practicable. According to his pupil Jane Joseph, Holst fostered in performance \\"a spirit of practical comradeship ... none could know better than he the boredom possible to a professional player, and the music that rendered boredom impossible\\".

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: Where could you find a pebble that has been walked on? Here are possible answers to this question: - lake - playground - pond - aquarium - stucco I believe the correct choice is \\"playground\\", here's why: A:","completion":"You are correct that the most likely answer is \\"playground.\\" Let's analyze each option to understand why this is the best choice: 1. Lake: Although you may find pebbles near the shoreline of a lake, it is less likely that they have been walked on compared to pebbles in a playground. Lakeshores are not as frequently trafficked as playgrounds, especially in areas where pebbles are submerged in water. 2. Playground: Playgrounds are ideal locations for finding pebbles that have been walked on. Many playgrounds have surface materials like pebbles, sand, or wood chips that provide a softer cushion for children at play. As children walk and play in these areas, the pebbles are naturally subjected to foot traffic, making it a suitable environment to find pebbles that have been walked on. 3. Pond: Similar to lakes, pebbles can be found near the edges of ponds. However, ponds are also not as frequently visited as playgrounds. The likelihood of finding pebbles that have been walked on would be relatively lower compared to playgrounds. 4. Aquarium: Pebbles can certainly be found in aquariums, whether in exhibits or as part of the decorative material in fish tanks. However, it is very unlikely that these pebbles would have been walked on by humans, as they are either submerged in water or enclosed in an exhibit. 5. Stucco: Stucco refers to a material made from cement, sand, and lime, applied to exterior and interior walls for a textured finish.

Context: After a tough loss at home, the Steelers traveled to Cincinnati to take on the Bengals. After a scoreless first quarter, the Steelers were the first to score in the 2nd when Ben Roethlisberger found Heath Miller on a 1-yard TD pass for a 7-0 lead. Afterwards, the Bengals would tie it at 7-7 when Andy Dalton hooked up with Jermaine Gresham on a 10-yard TD pass. They took the lead when Dalton ran for a 20-yard TD himself for a 14-7 game. The Steelers wrapped up the scoring of the first half coming within 4 when Shaun Suisham kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 14-10 game at halftime. The Steelers retook the lead in the 3rd quarter when Roethlisberger found Le'Veon Bell on a 10-yard TD pass for a 17-14 game. However, the Bengals took the lead back when Dalton found A. J. Green on an 81-yard TD pass to make the score 21-17.

Write the answer: What is the highest mountain on Antarctica?","completion":"The highest mountain on Antarctica is Mount Vinson, also known as Vinson Massif. It is the tallest peak on the continent and is situated in the Sentinel Range, a part of the Ellsworth Mountains, located in West Antarctica near the Ronne Ice Shelf. The mountain takes its name from Carl Vinson, a US Congressman from Georgia who was instrumental in supporting and funding scientific research and exploration in Antarctica during his tenure from 1914 to 1961. Mount Vinson has an elevation of 16,050 feet (4,892 meters), making it one of the highest peaks in the Seven Summits, a collection of the tallest mountains on each of the seven continents. The mountain was first discovered and photographed in 1958 during the US Navy's mapping operation, and it was initially mapped by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 1961. Notably, Mount Vinson's first recorded ascent took place on December 18, 1966, by a team led by Nicholas B. Clinch. Climbing Mount Vinson is a challenging endeavor on account of the remote location and the harsh Antarctic weather conditions, which include extreme cold temperatures, strong winds, and potential storms. The climbing season typically runs from November to January, corresponding to the Antarctic summer when the conditions are relatively more favorable for mountaineers. Access to the mountain usually involves chartering a specialized plane to transport the climbers and their equipment from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Union Glacier Camp in Antarctica, followed by another flight to Mount Vinson base camp. While ascending Mount Vinson, climbers need to be well accustomed to using crampons, ice axes, and other necessary equipment, as they will traverse through glaciers, ice-falls, and crevasses. Additionally, they must be physically fit and acclimatize to the altitude to reduce the risk of acute mountain sickness or other altitude-related issues. Due to the factors mentioned above, climbing Mount Vinson is generally reserved for experienced mountaineers. In terms of ecological importance, the region surrounding the Ellsworth Mountains is subject to strict environmental regulations to preserve the fragile ecosystem and the pristine condition of the Antarctic continent. Climbers and researchers in the area must adhere to guidelines that aim to protect the environment, minimize waste, and prevent contamination. In conclusion, Mount Vinson, with an elevation of 16,050 feet (4,892 meters), reigns as the highest mountain in Antarctica. This peak, situated in the Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains, is a formidable ascent, but it remains a sought-after conquest for mountaineers striving to complete the Seven Summits challenge."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Input: Recent outbreaks of infectious pathogens such as Zika, Ebola, and COVID-19 have underscored the need for the dependable availability of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). The cost and risk of R&D programs and uniquely unpredictable demand for EID vaccines have discouraged vaccine developers, and government and nonprofit agencies have been unable to provide timely or sufficient incentives for their development and sustained supply. We analyze the economic returns of a portfolio of EID vaccine assets, and find that under realistic financing assumptions, the expected returns are significantly negative, implying that the private sector is unlikely to address this need without public-sector intervention. We have sized the financing deficit for this portfolio and propose several potential solutions, including price increases, enhanced public-private partnerships, and subscription models through which individuals would pay annual fees to obtain access to a portfolio of vaccines in the event of an outbreak. .

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which camp experienced warmer weather? Two teams of scientists were in Antarctica to study the weather. Camp Alpha was located in East Antarctica, while camp Omega was situated in West Antarctica. Hint: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the camp that experienced warmer weather was Camp Omega, which was situated in West Antarctica. The hint indicates that East Antarctica, where Camp Alpha was located, is colder than West Antarctica due to its higher elevation and weather fronts rarely penetrating far into the continent."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who is discovered by a priest? is inside the article: The movie is set in 1985, in the fictional town of Quatssack, New Hampshire. Quatssack seems like a nice, ordinary town, but it harbors a dark and deadly secret: it is the home of the Children of the Yeti, an evil cult that worships a yeti that lives in the woods. The yeti was captured in the Himalayas and brought to the town as an old man′s sideshow, but had escaped, and is reportedly the last of its kind. Each night, Debra, one of its members, lures young men to the cult with the intention of offering it up to the yeti as a means of keeping it sexually sated. The movie opens up with such an example, with Debra and Raymond, the cult′s leader, looking on while laughing sadistically. Five college students—fraternity brothers Adam and Dick, their girlfriends Sally and Emily, and a fifth member named Joe—are coming to Quatssack on a camping trip, unaware of the town′s secrets. On their first night, Joe is killed while going to the bathroom in the woods, and since he was the one who had the car keys, the remaining four cannot leave town. The old man, who now owns a hideous-looking creature called \\"Tentacle Boy\\" and displays it as a sideshow, informs them of the yeti that he used to own now living somewhere in the woods. Emily goes into a nearby church to pray for Joe′s safety, and while she is in there, she is discovered by a priest as a \\"Chosen One\\" that was prophesied to take down the Children of the Yeti. She accepts her destiny, and the priest gives her supplies for her mission. Meanwhile, Adam, Dick, and Sally, who are waiting for Emily outside, are ambushed by a redneck demanding the whereabouts of the Chosen One. Emily emerges from the church and shoots the redneck with a crossbow, and despite his seemingly near-fatal wound, demands that the redneck take them to the cult′s location.

With the help of Charles Stearn, an expert on vacuum pumps, in 1878, Swan developed a method of processing that avoided the early bulb blackening. This received a British Patent in 1880.[dubious – discuss] On 18 December 1878, a lamp using a slender carbon rod was shown at a meeting of the Newcastle Chemical Society, and Swan gave a working demonstration at their meeting on 17 January 1879. It was also shown to 700 who attended a meeting of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Newcastle upon Tyne on 3 February 1879. These lamps used a carbon rod from an arc lamp rather than a slender filament. Thus they had low resistance and required very large conductors to supply the necessary current, so they were not commercially practical, although they did furnish a demonstration of the possibilities of incandescent lighting with relatively high vacuum, a carbon conductor, and platinum lead-in wires. Besides requiring too much current for a central station electric system to be practical, they had a very short lifetime. Swan turned his attention to producing a better carbon filament and the means of attaching its ends. He devised a method of treating cotton to produce 'parchmentised thread' and obtained British Patent 4933 in 1880. From this year he began installing light bulbs in homes and landmarks in England. His house was the first in the world to be lit by a lightbulb and also the first house in the world to be lit by hydroelectric power. In 1878 the home of Lord Armstrong at Cragside was also among the first houses to be lit by electricity. In the early 1880s he had started his company. In 1881, the Savoy Theatre in the City of Westminster, London was lit by Swan incandescent lightbulbs, which was the first theatre, and the first public building in the world, to be lit entirely by electricity.

First, we have a math problem with lots of numbers and the letter 'g'. Our job is to find out what number 'g' is. The problem looks like this: -612 * g - 1011 * g - 7052 = 10801 The first thing we're going to do is combine the 'g' parts. That's like saying if you have some apples and I give you more apples, how many apples do you have? So, -612 * g and -1011 * g are our apple groups. Let's add those together: -612 - 1011 is -1623 Now, our problem is easier and looks like this: -1623 * g - 7052 = 10801 Next, we want to get 'g' by itself, so we need to get rid of that pesky -7052. It's like taking away some toys so we can see the ones we want clearly. To do this, we add 7052 to both sides of the '=' sign (because if we do it to one side, we have to do it to the other to keep things fair): -1623 * g = 10801 + 7052 Now our problem is: -1623 * g = 17853 We're almost there! We just need to find out what 'g' is. To do this, we need to get rid of the -1623 that's multiplying 'g'. So, we'll do the opposite, which is dividing both sides by -1623. g = 17853 / -1623 And we get: g = -11 So, after solving our math problem like a story, we find out that 'g' is -11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While it is true that Russell joined the Blue Jackets, Michael Blunden is not his brother — as the first sentence explains, Kris Russell is his brother. To maintain accurate information, it is important to address these discrepancies. The second sentence should be rewritten as follows: \\"On 7 July 2011, Russell was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for Michael Blunden and joined his brother Kris Russell within the Blue Jackets organization.\\" This revised sentence more accurately reflects the information presented in the first sentence while maintaining a similar structure to the original second sentence. The main takeaway is that both sentences communicate similar ideas, but the second sentence contains errors regarding the players involved in the trade and their relationships. The first sentence more accurately reflects the situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 12*y + 13 + 33 = -14 for y.. What is the answer??","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're putting together a puzzle or building with blocks. We have: 12*y + 13 + 33 = -14 First, let's add the two numbers we know: 13 + 33 = 46. Then our equation will look like: 12*y + 46 = -14 Now, we want to get \\"y\\" alone on one side. So we need to get rid of the 46 next to it. To do this, we will subtract 46 from both sides of the equation: 12*y + 46 - 46 = -14 - 46 That means: 12*y = -60 Now, we want to know what \\"y\\" is equal to. Since 12 times \\"y\\" equals -60, we can divide -60 by 12 to find out what \\"y\\" is. So the last step is: y = -60 / 12 Now, if we do the division we get: y = -5 So the answer is: y = -5.

When the twelve year old Pitka announces he wants to become a Guru so that girls will love him, Tugginmypudha puts a chastity belt on him until he can learn that loving himself is more important than being loved by others. Pitka's dream is to become the number #1 Guru and appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show. He lives a charmed life with thousands of followers, including the celebrities Jessica Simpson, Val Kilmer and Mariska Hargitay. His teachings, which involve simplistic acronyms and plays on words, are displayed in PowerPoint slide shows. In Canada, Jane Bullard inherits the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey team, who are on a losing streak; her star player, Darren Roanoke, has been playing badly ever since his wife Prudence left him for the rival Los Angeles Kings player, Jacques \\"Lè Cocq\\" Grandé. Jane is a big fan of Pitka's, and offers to pay him 2 million to patch up Darren's marriage, so the team can win the Stanley Cup. Pitka's agent tells him that if he succeeds, Oprah will have him on her show. Pitka encourages the rival team to beat Darren up during a game, to distract him from his distress over his wife's affair. Darren begins to play well but then gets suspended for the next two games after beating up Le Cocq, and hitting Coach Cherkov with a hockey puck. Later, Pitka has dinner with Jane. He tries to kiss her, only to hear a ding on his chastity belt. Upset when he tells her their love cannot be, she runs out. Pitka advises Darren to write an apology to Prudence, and fights off a rooster to deliver the letter. After they lose three games, Coach Cherkoff berates Jane and punches Pitka in the groin. He is only slightly injured from hitting the chastity belt but Pitka moans and drops to the ground.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. When calculating your income for you debt-to-income ratio, use the amount of money you make before taxes and not what you make after taxes are taken out. Example: If the person in the example continued from above makes 39,000 on a yearly basis before taxes, or 750 a week before taxes, one of these figures should be used instead of a net income figure. Divide your annual gross income by 12 to determine your average monthly income. If you do not know your annual gross income, take your weekly income and multiply it by the number of payments you receive in a year. If you get paid every other week, this would be 26 payments; for payment that occurs weekly, this would be 52 payments. This will give you your annual income, and you can divide this number by 12 to determine your monthly income. Alternatively, you can take your weekly payment and multiply it by 4.3 or multiply your bi-weekly pay by 2.15 to determine your rough monthly income. Example: If a person's yearly gross income is 39,000, then: 39000 / 12 = 3250 If a person's weekly gross income is 750, then: 750 * 52 = 39000; 39000 / 12 = 3250 Alternatively, if a person's weekly gross income is 750, then: 750 * 4.3 = 3225 If you received commissions, bonuses, tips, overtime, or money from other sources, like alimony, rental income, investment income, pension, disability, or child support, add that money to your monthly income. Example: If you receive investment income of roughly 200 each month, add that to your monthly gross income of 3250, giving you a total income of 3450. Summary:","completion":"To find out how much money you make each month, you need to use the amount you make before taxes are taken out. You can do this in a few ways: 1.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade.

Beyoncé, Jay Z, Solange Knowles speak out on elevator fight video: 'We love each other and, above all, we are family' Jay Z and Solange have made nice — more than a week after she opened a can of whoop-ass on the Brooklyn-born rapper. Breaking their silence over the videotaped elevator attack for the first time, Jay Z, Beyoncé and Solange Knowles issued a statement on Thursday, saying the family drama has been ironed out. “As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident. But the most important thing is that our family has worked through it,” the trio said in a statement to The Associated Press. “Jay and Solange each assume their share of responsibility for what has occurred. They both acknowledge their role in this private matter that has played out in the public. They both have apologized to each other and we have moved forward as a united family.” Rachel Roy, seen at the May 5 Met Gala in New York, was apparently getting too close to Jay Z — prompting Solange's attack. The statement does not address what led to the punching and kicking at the Standard Hotel following a Met Gala after-party in Chelsea’s Boom Boom Room. Sources have told the Daily News the beatdown was triggered by Solange taking offense to designer Rachel Roy getting “too close” to the 44-year-old Jay Z. Beyoncé’s younger sibling didn’t like the way Roy was hovering over the rap mogul — and took her feelings out on him, the sources said. “Rachel is a little too close to Jay Z,” a source told The News. “Solange doesn’t like it, and Beyoncé doesn't like it.” Solange, 27, was drunk and belligerent at the time, the sources added. But the family statement dismissed the claims. “The reports of Solange being intoxicated or displaying erratic behavior throughout that evening are simply false,” the statement read. “At the end of the day, families have problems and we’re no different. We love each other and, above all, we are family. We’ve put this behind us and hope everyone else will do the same.” Signs that the family had healed its rift came earlier Thursday when Solange posted two childhood photos of Beyoncé on her Instagram page. Solange had previously taken down nearly all photos of her 32-year-old sister. The Standard Hotel fired the worker responsible for leaking the shocking video. In a statement, hotel officials said they were “pursuing all available civil and criminal remedies.” Beyoncé, Jay Z and Solange Knowles released this statement: As a result of the public release of the elevator security footage from Monday, May 5th, there has been a great deal of speculation about what triggered the unfortunate incident.

Write down or make a mental note of things that are confusing or unclear. Use a highlighter or pen to underline, circle, or highlight facts that can be verified. Verifiable facts are those which are based in objective reality rather than on opinion, conjecture, or unfounded belief. All verifiable science relies on the work of other scientists to establish its credibility and inspire further studies. One way to verify the science you read is to follow up on the information provided in the study’s footnotes. Check referenced sources to ensure that their conclusions and statistics match those presented in the scientific literature you’re attempting to verify. If you’re reading science in a popular publication, sources will be cited in the text rather than in footnotes or endnotes. Non-specialized sources should describe specific studies but might not refer to published peer-reviewed article by name. They might also refer to certain scientists or authors, or to the titles of scientific journals where relevant publications appeared. Use this information to track down more information whenever possible. You can also refer to review articles, which summarize all of the previous findings of a particular field. When you're reading through sources, there are some red flags you should look out for that may indicate the source isn't reliable. If you see any of the following red flags, be extra cautious when using the source material: The source hasn't been referenced elsewhere. The author hasn't written anything other than the one source.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who noted the building's resemblance and \\"strong architectural kinship\\" to the Romney Presbyterian Church?, using the article: The interior and exterior of Literary Hall remain largely intact. At two stories, the building is tall in its proportion and incorporates elements from both early American and Victorian styles, which were common in academic buildings built during this period.Architectural historian S. Allen Chambers described Literary Hall as an anomaly because the basic design and fenestration patterns, which invoke early Federal and Greek Revival design elements, are adorned with details more characteristic of the Victorian era.According to architectural historian Michael J. Pauley of the West Virginia Department of Culture and History's Historic Preservation Unit, Literary Hall's unique structural features make the building \\"one of Romney's and Hampshire County's most notable landmarks, and one in which this community is justifiably proud\\". Pauley further averred that the building is \\"highly representative of the development of education and literature in the early United States\\". In describing its impact on Romney's streetscape, Chambers described Literary Hall as \\"adding distinction to Romney's major street intersection\\". Chambers also noted the building's resemblance and \\"strong architectural kinship\\" to the Romney Presbyterian Church.Literary Hall is a two-story red brick structure, rectangular in plan, and topped with a gable roof. The first floor of Literary Hall consists of four rooms, and the second story is a single large ballroom. Fused with symmetrical elements evoking Federal and Greek Revival architectural styles are exterior decorative moldings and brick corbeling in the Victorian style., what would be the answer ?

Energy often changes from one form to another. For example, the drummer transfers motion to sound energy. When the moving drumstick strikes the drum head, the drum starts to vibrate. The motion of the vibrating drum head creates the sound you hear. Any form of energy can change into any other form. Frequently, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved.

Usage: The input string \\"fourtwozeroninefour\\" contains the spelled out digits \\"four\\", \\"two\\", \\"zero\\", \\"nine\\", and \\"four\\". This part of the definition instructs you to identify the separate single digit numbers in the given string. In this case, there are no spaces between the numbers, so you must recognize them based on the English spelling of each digit. Part #2: Converting spelled out digits to numerical digits. Usage: After identifying the spelled out digits, convert them to their numerical forms. For example, \\"four\\" should be converted to 4, \\"two\\" to 2, \\"zero\\" to 0, \\"nine\\" to 9, and \\"four\\" again to 4.

They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859.

We need to consider the effects of placing speed zones in areas where manatees congregate. The main concern is the impact of boat propellers on manatees. Step 2: Evaluate each option based on the given situation. 1. Less water pollution in manatee habitats will occur: Although reduced boat speeds may lead to less water disturbance, there is no direct correlation between the speed limits and reduced water pollution in this context. So, this option is less likely to occur. 2. Manatees will seek alternate food sources: The question states that manatees feed on sea grasses in brackish water, so their food source is not tied to boat traffic. Consequently, implementing speed limits is unlikely to push manatees to seek alternate food sources. This option is less likely to occur. 3. New manatee predators will surface: Since there is no mention of the relationship between manatee predators and boat speeds, this option also seems unrelated to the implementation of speed limits. This option is less likely to occur. 4. Manatee populations will increase: By implementing speed zones, boats will be required to maintain lower speeds, which may decrease the chances of manatees being injured or killed by propellers. As a result, a reduction in manatee deaths could potentially lead to an increase in their population. Step 3: Choose the most likely outcome based on the evaluation. Based on the evaluation of all options, I conclude that the most likely outcome if speed zones are placed in areas where manatees congregate is: * Manatee populations will increase."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Article: Washington: NASA has announced evidence that Jupiter's largest moon, Ganymede, has a saltwater ocean under its icy surface. The ocean seems to have more water than all the water on Earth's surface, according to new Hubble observation. New Hubble observations of Ganymede's magnetic field strongly suggest that the moon, which is the largest in our whole solar system, is home to a subsurface ocean. Scientists estimate the ocean is 95 kilometres thick, which is about 10 times deeper than Earth's oceans. But unlike our salty waters, Ganymede's ocean is buried under 150 kilometres of ice. While scientists have speculated since 1970s about the presence of an ocean on Ganymede------the largest moon in our solar system------ until now the only observational evidence came from a brief flyby by the Galileo spacecraft, which didn't observe the moon long enough to confirm a liquid ocean. This discovery marks an important milestone, highlighting what only Hubble can accomplish. In its 25 years in orbit, Hubble has made many scientific discoveries in our own solar system. A deep ocean under the icy surface of Ganymede opens up further exciting possibilities for life beyond Earth. Scientists have already confirmed the existence of an ocean on Europa, another moon orbiting Jupiter, and NASA has announced plans to send an unmanned mission there searching for the life that might come with liquid water. Hubble is a telescope that orbits Earth, but because of its impressive gravitational analyses it can be used to study the inside of far distant planets. Using these same principles, scientists could theoretically detect oceans on distant planets as well. Question: What type of writing does this passage belong to? Options: A: A term essay B: A news report C: An experiment report D: An exploration review. A:","completion":"This passage belongs to type B: A news report. The passage provides information on a recent discovery made by NASA regarding Ganymede, Jupiter's largest moon.

Answer:","completion":"\\"What Remains of Us\\" and \\"Without the King\\" both fall under the genre of documentary films. Let's delve deeper into the specific characteristics and themes of each documentary to give a better understanding of their respective sub-genres and subject matters. 1. What Remains of Us (2004) - Directed by François Prévost and Hugo Latulippe, this Canadian documentary film is centered around Kalsang Dolma, a Tibetan woman living in Canada. She secretly brings a videotaped message from the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the 14th Dalai Lama, to his oppressed people in Tibet. The film captures the reactions and emotions of Tibetans living under the Chinese occupation as they view the message of hope and guidance. \\"What Remains of Us\\" can be classified within the sub-genre of political documentaries, as it touches on the themes of political oppression, human rights, and the struggle for Tibetan freedom. The documentary exposes the harsh realities of life under Chinese rule and promotes cultural preservation amidst adversity. Its approach to storytelling falls under the category of a personal documentary, showcasing the experiences of Kalsang Dolma and her journey as a bridge between the exiled Dalai Lama and his followers in Tibet. 2. Without the King (2007) - Directed by Michael Skolnik, \\"Without the King\\" is a documentary that presents an inside look into the African kingdom of Eswatini, formerly known as Swaziland. The film primarily focuses on the nation's absolute monarch, King Mswati III, and his family's extravagance while the majority of the population lives in poverty and suffers from the world's highest HIV/AIDS rate. This documentary can be classified within the sub-genre of socio-cultural and political documentaries, as it explores the contrast between the royal family's opulence and the suffering of the Swazi people. The film also delves into themes such as wealth inequality, human rights abuses, and the need for political reform. As \\"Without the King\\" documents the lives of the royal family and those affected by their rule, it falls under the category of a character-driven documentary, with personal stories interweaved with the broader political issues. In conclusion, both \\"What Remains of Us\\" and \\"Without the King\\" are documentary films that uncover political and socio-cultural themes through personal narratives, exploring the realities of the subjects documented and the challenges they face. While both documentaries might be centered around different geographical regions and socio-political contexts, their common ground lies in shedding light on the hardships and resilience of the respective communities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue crusading for equality. 4. Discriminate due to gender age or race. Q: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

After finishing their blog post, the author will likely continue crusading for equality. This is because the author demonstrates a strong understanding of the severity and ubiquity of discrimination in various forms, and a genuine concern for addressing the problem. In the passage, the author acknowledges that they will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of discrimination. Yet, they are determined to contribute to raising awareness about the issue. As such, it stands to reason that they will continue to be an advocate for equality moving forward. Moreover, the author's intent to create practical, implementable steps for people to take in order to combat discrimination also suggests that they are invested in creating real change. By focusing on actions that individuals can take, the author is aiming to empower others to join them in the fight for equal treatment. In sum, the determination to raise awareness, work on actionable steps, and encourage others to participate in the struggle against discrimination all point to the author's continued crusade for equality in all its forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She could understand them easily; at the same time she taught the children to speak English and play the piano. After hearing that her father was seriously ill; Edith returned home to look after him. She then decided to become a nurse. Afterwards for five years she worked in an English hospital where she proved to be highly professional at her job. A Belgian doctor was so impressed that he invited her to his country to organize a training school for nurses. The First World War broke out in 1914 and Edith Cavell's school of nursing became a hospital. She stayed there to look after the sick and wounded soldiers . Edith treated them with kindness. Between November 1914 and August 1915 she secretly helped about 200 wounded soldiers and prisoners escape from the Germans. Later the German army found out what Edith had done and they arrested her. Finally; the Germans killed her; but they could not _ . A tall statue has been built in Trafalgar Square; London; in honor of the brave English nurse.

It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - Belfast is the capital and largest city of Northern Ireland, the second largest on the island of Ireland, and the heart of the tenth largest Primary Urban Area in the United Kingdom. On the River Lagan, it had a population of 286,000 at the 2011 census and 333,871 after the 2015 council reform. Belfast was granted city status in 1888. - A prison escape (or prison break) is the act of an inmate leaving prison through unofficial or illegal ways. Normally, when this occurs, an effort is made on the part of authorities to recapture them and return them to their original detainers. Escaping from prison is also a criminal offense in some countries, e.g. United States and Russia, and it is highly likely to result in time being added to the inmate's sentence, as well as the inmate being placed under increased security. Aggravating factors include whether or not violence was used. - The Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA or PIRA) was an Irish republican paramilitary organisation that sought to remove Northern Ireland from the United Kingdom and to bring about an independent republic encompassing all of Ireland. It was the biggest and most active republican paramilitary group during the Troubles. It saw itself as the successor to the original IRA and called itself simply the Irish Republican Army, or \\"Óglaigh na hÉireann\\" in Irish. It was also widely referred to as such by others. - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\". - The Northern Ireland Assembly (Ulster Scots: \\"Norlin Airlan Assemblie\\") is the devolved legislature of Northern Ireland. It has power to legislate in a wide range of areas that are not explicitly reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom, and to appoint the Northern Ireland Executive. It sits at Parliament Buildings at Stormont in Belfast. - The Maze Prison escape (known to Irish republicans as the Great Escape) took place on 25 September 1983 in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. HM Prison Maze (also known as Long Kesh) was a maximum security prison considered to be one of the most escape-proof prisons in Europe, and held prisoners convicted of taking part in armed paramilitary campaigns during the Troubles. In the biggest prison escape in UK history, 38 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) prisoners escaped from H-Block 7 (H7) of the prison. One prison officer died of a heart attack as a result of the escape and twenty others were injured, including two who were shot with guns that had been smuggled into the prison. The escape was a propaganda coup for the IRA, and a British government minister faced calls to resign. The official inquiry into the escape placed most of the blame onto prison staff, who in turn blamed the escape on political interference in the running of the prison. - The River Lagan (Ulster Scots: \\"Lagan Wattèr\\") is a major river in Northern Ireland which runs 53.5 miles (86 km) from the Slieve Croob mountain in County Down to Belfast where it enters Belfast Lough, an inlet of the Irish Sea. The River Lagan forms much of the border between County Antrim and County Down in the east of Ulster. It rises as a tiny, fast-moving stream near to the summit of Slieve Croob; Transmitter Road runs nearby. From here it continues on its journey to Belfast through Dromara, Donaghcloney and Dromore. On the lower slopes of the mountain, it is joined by another branch from Legananny (Cratlieve) Mountain, just opposite Slieve Croob. At Dromara, about four miles from its source, its height above the sea is 390 ft (119m). As the river continues on its journey to Belfast, it turns east to Magheralin into a broad plain between the plateaus of Antrim and Down. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - The Troubles is the common name for the ethno-nationalist conflict in Northern Ireland during the late 20th century. Also known internationally as the Northern Ireland conflict, it is sometimes described as a \\"guerrilla war\\" or \\"low-level war\\". The conflict began in the late 1960s and is usually deemed to have ended with the Good Friday \\"Belfast\\" Agreement of 1998. Although the Troubles mainly took place in Northern Ireland, violence spilled over at times into parts of the Republic of Ireland, England and mainland Europe. - Ireland, also described as the Republic of Ireland ('), is a sovereign state in north-western Europe occupying about five-sixths of the island of Ireland. The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants.

Context: I showed up at the address on Columbine's invitation just before eleven; it was a converted warehouse in an industrial zone on the city's north side. Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation. So I was fairly confident I'd be able to gain admission to this thing without incident. \\"No, absolutely not,\\" the doorman said, pressing a meaty palm into my chest. \\"I was invited!\\" I said, exasperated. \\"I have documentation.\\" I waved the rave card in front of his face. \\"No dice.\\" I stepped aside to let a couple of aging goths through the door and wondered for a moment if the doorman somehow knew who I was. Then I noticed the ear piece he was wearing and my eyes darted back to the surveillance camera. \\"Motherfucker,\\" I spat and raised both arms to flip off the camera. I didn't know it at the time, but at that moment Dylan Maxwell was sitting in front of a wall of monitors, laughing his ass off. Question: Who was standing under the surveillance camera? Answer: OPT: [+] The doorman [+] Hipster [+] not enough information [+] Dylan Answer:","completion":"The person standing under the surveillance camera was the doorman.

The University and College Union (UCU) has recently been in dispute with employers over proposed changes to the USS pension scheme, and the most sustained period of industrial action in the sector’s history has highlighted the fears staff have for the security of their futures post-retirement. Such unprecedented strike action needs to be situated within the wider context of a public sector undergoing transformation: while the concept remains contested, the influence of “neoliberal” ideas on universities can most clearly be seen in Success as a Knowledge Economy – the government white paper that preceded the 2017 Higher Education and Research Act – which states: “Competition between providers in any market incentivises them to raise their game, offering consumers a greater choice of more innovative and better quality products and services at lower cost. Higher education is no exception.” Yet what might “raising our game” mean for academic staff? The university has been described as an “anxiety machine”: the creeping marketisation of the sector along with pressure to recruit students (now “consumers”), increasing managerialism, and the implementation of processes of audit – such as the REF and TEF – to evaluate performance have arguably contributed to a progressively anxious landscape in which to labour. In 2016/17, 34% of academic staff were employed on fixed-term contracts – a figure likely to be disputed by the UCU, since in 2016 it estimated the extent of casualisation in the sector to be closer to 54% once atypical contracts had been taken into consideration. In addition to pressures facing many staff in universities – such as time-management, meeting growing employer expectations, and the evaluation of performance – “casualised” contracts present particular challenges for those facing employment uncertainty: in a material sense, this can be a case of keeping up with...

Help as much as you can. David is a doctor who works for the public health department. After analyzing health data for his city, he found twenty percent of the population have myopia. He categorized them as group A. Another eighty percent didn't have myopia. He put them in group B. He now needs to devise a plan on how to tackle myopia in his city. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B? Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school.

Here is a news article: But this weekend's shopping spree provides another important lesson. It tells us how we shop. The key storyline of Thanksgiving 2011 is not about mobs lining up at midnight. It's about buyers leaning back with iPads after the big family dinner. It's about the continuing rise of online, and especially mobile, shopping. Here's what the numbers don't tell us: anything useful about the recovery. Are shoppers really more confident about the economy? Or are they just desperate for deals? We don't know. The last time shoppers spent this much over Thanksgiving were the dark days of 2008. Afterwards, holiday sales promptly fell off a cliff. Here's what the Black Friday/Cyber Monday numbers tell us: Americans just spent a lot of money. The National Retail Federation estimates that Americans spent a record 52 billion dollars through Sunday. That doesn't include the online retail haul from Cyber Monday. Online sales on Cyber Monday eclipsed last year's record of 1.03 billion, according to Coremetrics. This year's Thanksgiving sales don't tell us anything about the health of our economy. But they do show us something about its digital future. Consider these numbers. On Black Friday, in-store purchases increased about 7%. But online, Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday sales jumped by 39%, 24% and 33%, respectively. Growth in mobile was even more explosive. PayPal reported that payments via phones and tablets were up more than 500% on each of the three major shopping days. IBM said mobile devices were responsible for 9.8% percent of online Black Friday sales, up from 3.2% a year ago. So no, mobile hasn't replaced good old fashioned Black Friday chaos. It hasn't even replaced regular old web browsing. But it's arrived as a key piece of holiday commerce. And it's only going to get bigger. That has implications across business. For retail, it means adjusting to customers who are harder to lure and more discriminating. More people are doing their shopping while sitting with family on Thanksgiving proper rather than waiting for a trip to the mall the next day. And when they do make that trip to Macy's or Target, shoppers can browse the aisles phone in hand, comparing prices. For Silicon Valley, it underscores the need to win the mobile arms race. In the end, the fates of the tech's giants are tied to our shopping habits. Google and Facebook live off ads. Amazon lives off eCommerce. And as more and more Americans shop on phones and tablets, owning those spaces will be ever more crucial to their business models. It's why Amazon has the Kindle Fire, and why Facebook is working on a new phone with HTC. Thanksgiving sales won't tell us whether the economy is about to take off. But they do tell us what we've become as a shopping culture. More than that, as the biggest consumer nation on earth, it tells us where we're headed as a business culture. Our future is on our phones. And the companies that learn to compete in that environment are the companies that will survive. > ||||| Article Excerpt Online sales on Cyber Monday rose to a record 1.25 billion as consumers continued to make the Web an integral part of their holiday shopping. The 1.25 billion is the heaviest online commerce day ever, according to research firm comScore Inc., and represents a 22% rise from last year's Cyber Monday. Cyber Monday last year saw then-record online purchases totalling 1.03 billion. Meanwhile, for some retailers it is no longer just Cyber Monday—it is Cyber Week.

Mobile payments through phones and tablets also saw a remarkable growth of over 500% on each of these shopping days. This trend emphasizes the need for retailers to adapt to more discerning customers and highlights the importance of winning the mobile space for tech giants like Google, Facebook, and Amazon.

Paley put the radio network's news operation at the same level as entertainment, and authorized White to interrupt programming if events warranted.

She said global risks were not expected to have a deep impact on the US, but caution was still appropriate. Global developments and risks had led policymakers to project a slower path of rate rises than initially expected in December, Ms Yellen said. US markets rose during her speech at the Economic Club of New York. Her tone was similar to the Fed's statement in mid-March, when the central bank made no change to rates and guided expectations towards a slower pace of increases after December's increase. Ms Yellen repeated her message from earlier public speeches that volatile oil prices and China's slowing growth, along with how soon inflation would reach the Fed's 2% goal, were key factors guiding the Fed towards taking a gradual approach on raising rates. Omer Esiner, chief market analyst at Commonwealth Foreign Exchange, said her caution was not surprising, but stood in contrast to support for rate rises from other Fed speakers in recent days. He added: \\"On balance, [Yellen's] comments do not sound consistent with a looming rate hike in April and leave considerable doubt about whether rates will rise in June. Earlier on Tuesday the head of the San Francisco Federal Reserve, John Williams, said the US economy was doing \\"quite well\\". As she has done in past speeches, Ms Yellen said the market should be open to the possibility of news that boosts confidence. \\"We should not ignore the welcome possibility that economic conditions could turn out to be more favourable than we now expect,\\" she said. The audience in New York laughed when Ms Yellen was asked how long the Fed expected to take to reach \\"normal\\" interest rates and whether she felt the market had failed to understand the bank's plan. The Fed chief has been trying to reassure markets of its \\"gradual\\" plan since taking action in December. Following Ms Yellen's speech, Wall Street climbed sharply . The S&P 500 rose 0.8% and the Nasdaq index jumped 1.5%, although the Dow Jones Industrial Average added just 0.1%. Although the focus of her speech was on interest rates, Ms Yellen did address the other tools the Fed has at its disposal if the US economy was to suffer a downturn. These unconventional tools - including asset purchases, forward guidance and negative interest rates, which have been used in Europe - have been criticised for helping banks and not stimulating economies. Ms Yellen defended the use of these tools, saying they helped prevent the recession from becoming worse. \\"They have been effective policy, they have made a difference and inflation may have been lower and unemployment higher - by noticeable amounts - had we not employed those policies,\\" she said.

(Associated Press) In this photo released by the Saudi Press Agency, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, right, shakes hands with Salah Khashoggi, a son of Jamal Khashoggi, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Oct. 23, 2018.... (Associated Press) JERUSALEM (AP) — A Saudi dissident has filed a lawsuit against an Israeli surveillance company, claiming its sophisticated spyware targeted him and helped lead to the killing of his friend, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The suit, filed in a Tel Aviv court on Sunday, follows others previously filed against the company. But because of the dissident's ties to Khashoggi and his high-profile killing Oct. 2 at the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, it is likely to shine a greater spotlight on the Israeli company and the Israeli government, which licenses the export of the surveillance technology. According to the lawsuit, Omar Abdulaziz, a sharp critic on social media of the Saudi royals and a resident of Canada where he has received asylum, said he was friends with Khashoggi and worked with him on a project meant to rein in pro-monarchy Saudi trolls. The lawsuit says Abdulaziz received and clicked on a link sent to his phone in June 2018 that he argues exposed his mobile communications to Saudi authorities. It says Abdulaziz faced increased harassment by Saudi authorities after he clicked on the link, including against his family members in Saudi Arabia. \\"The spying that was directed against (Abdulaziz) and the disclosure of the content of the conversations and messages between him and Khashoggi through the system contributed in a tangible way to the decision to assassinate Mr. Khashoggi by the assassins at the consulate,\\" the lawsuit states, citing news reports and other sources claiming that NSO Group sold Saudi Arabia the technology in 2017 for 55 million. Abdulaziz is demanding 600,000 shekels — about 160,000 — in damages from the company, as well as an order preventing it from selling its technology, known as \\"Pegasus,\\" to Saudi Arabia. In a written statement, NSO Group said the company's technology \\"enables governments and law enforcement agencies to fight terrorism and crime.\\" It said it takes \\"an extremely scrupulous\\" approach to the sale of its products, which also undergo vetting and licensing by Israel's defense ministry. \\"We do not tolerate misuse of our products. If there is suspicion of misuse, we investigate it and take the appropriate actions, including suspending or terminating a contract,\\" it said. NSO has been under the spotlight for months after dissidents, journalists and other opposition figures have come forward to claim the company's technology has been used by repressive governments to spy on them. These include Mexican and Qatari journalists who have already filed lawsuits against the company and an Amnesty International employee who was allegedly targeted by the software. The new suit comes days after the human rights group said it was considering legal steps to have NSO Group's export license revoked. It said it had made an urgent request to Israel's defense ministry to have the company's export license revoked following the targeting of one of its employees. It said the request was denied. \\"We thoroughly reject this inadequate response. The mountain of evidence and reports on NSO Group and the sale of its spyware to human rights-violating regimes is substantial proof that NSO has gone rogue,\\" said Molly Malekar, programs director of Amnesty International Israel. By continuing to approve of NSO, she added, Israel's defense ministry is practically admitting to knowingly cooperating with a company whose \\"software is used to commit human rights abuses.\\" ||||| London (CNN) In his public writings, Jamal Khashoggi's criticism of Saudi Arabia and its Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was measured. In private, the Washington Post columnist didn't hold back. In more than 400 WhatsApp messages sent to a fellow Saudi exile in the year before he was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Khashoggi describes bin Salman -- often referred to as MBS -- as a \\"beast,\\" a \\"pac-man\\" who would devour all in his path, even his supporters. CNN has been granted exclusive access to the correspondence between Khashoggi and Montreal-based activist Omar Abdulaziz. The messages shared by Abdulaziz, which include voice recordings, photos and videos, paint a picture of a man deeply troubled by what he regarded as the petulance of his kingdom's powerful young prince. \\"The more victims he eats, the more he wants,\\" says Khashoggi in one message sent in May, just after a group of Saudi activists had been rounded up . \\"I will not be surprised if the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him on.\\" This is what logic says, but I no longer have faith in it to analyze the man's mind. Is there a possibility that when he becomes a King he would pardon them Arrests are unjustified and do not serve him (logic says), but tyranny has no logic, but he loves force, oppression and needs to show them off. He is like a beast \\"pac man\\" the more victims he eats, the more he wants. I will not be surprised that the oppression will reach even those who are cheering him, then others and others and so on. God knows The exchanges reveal a progression from talk to action -- the pair had begun planning an online youth movement that would hold the Saudi state to account. \\"[Jamal] believed that MBS is the issue, is the problem and he said this kid should be stopped,\\" Abdulaziz said in an interview with CNN. But in August, when he believed their conversations may have been intercepted by Saudi authorities, a sense of foreboding descends over Khashoggi. \\"God help us,\\" he wrote. Two months later, he was dead. Abdulaziz on Sunday launched a lawsuit against an Israeli company that invented the software he believes was used to hack his phone. \\"The hacking of my phone played a major role in what happened to Jamal, I am really sorry to say,\\" Abdelaziz told CNN. \\"The guilt is killing me.\\" Omar Abdulaziz believes Saudi authorities intercepted private messages between him and Jamal Khashoggi. SIM cards and financial support Abdulaziz began speaking out against the Saudi regime as a college student in Canada. His pointed criticisms of government policies drew the attention of the Saudi state, which canceled his university scholarship. Canada granted him asylum in 2014 and made him a permanent resident three years later. In almost daily exchanges between October 2017 and August 2018, Khashoggi and Abdulaziz conceived plans to form an electronic army to engage young Saudis back home and debunk state propaganda on social media, leveraging Khashoggi's establishment profile and the 27-year-old Abdulaziz's 340,000-strong Twitter following. The digital offensive, dubbed the \\"cyber bees,\\" had emerged from earlier discussions about creating a portal for documenting human rights abuses in their homeland as well an initiative to produce short films for mobile distribution. \\"We have no parliament; we just have Twitter,\\" said Abdulaziz, adding that Twitter is also the Saudi government's strongest weapon. \\"Twitter is the only tool they're using to fight and to spread their rumors. We've been attacked, we've been insulted, we'd been threatened so many times, and we decided to do something.\\" The pair's scheme involved two key elements that Saudi Arabia might well have viewed as hostile acts. The first involved sending foreign SIM cards to dissidents back home so they could tweet without being traced. The second was money. According to Abdulaziz, Khashoggi pledged an initial 30,000 and promised to drum up support from rich donors under the radar. In one exchange, dated May this year, Abdulaziz writes to Khashoggi. \\"I sent you some ideas about the electronic army. By email.\\" \\"Brilliant report,\\" Khashoggi replies. \\"I will try to sort out the money. We have to do something.\\" Omar Abdulaziz I sent you a brief idea about the work of the electronic army Jamal Khashoggi Brilliant report. I will try to sort out the money. we have to do something. You know, sometimes I get affected by their attacks and hate tweeting. A month later, another message sent by Abdulaziz confirms the first 5,000 transfer has arrived. Khashoggi replies with a thumbs up. But in early August, he says he received word from Saudi Arabia that government officials were aware of the pair's online project. He passed the news to Khashoggi. \\"How did they know?\\" asks Khashoggi in a message. \\"There must have been a gap,\\" says Abdulaziz. Three minutes pass before Khashoggi writes back: \\"God help us.\\" Omar Abdulaziz Once they heard about the bees, they were really worried and disturbed, the officials. They arrested a lot people and raided many places. I bore the brunt of having the group and communication. I'm glad you're abroad and you are safe. Jamal Khashoggi How did they know about the bees? The family's safety Omar Alzahrani I began to create groups I began to do some work and surely there must have been a gap Tens of people must have been involved in this. Can you imagine my brother was telling me, Omar don't tweet about Canada and about the bees. ! Otherwise I will go to prison Jamal Khashoggi God help us. Omar Alzahrani Those who ride the sea shouldn't fear of drowning. Jamal Khashoggi May god protect you, you are in Canada which is the sanctuary for the aggrieved people. May god protect you from any Qaddafis or Qaddafi stupidity (Qaddafi as an adjective) Do not discuss the subject of bees even in Instagram. The 'hack' Abdulaziz first spoke publicly about his contact with Khashoggi last month after researchers at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported his phone had been hacked by military-grade spyware. According to Bill Marczak, a research fellow at the Citizen Lab, the software was the invention of an Israeli firm named NSO Group, and deployed at the behest of the Saudi Arabian government. Marczak said at least two other Saudi dissidents have been targeted with NSO tools: an activist named Yahya Assiri and a staff member who had been involved in Amnesty International's work on Saudi Arabia. Danna Ingleton, an Amnesty deputy program director, said its technology experts studied the staff member's phone and confirmed it was targeted with the spyware. Amnesty is currently exploring potential recourse against NSO Group and last week wrote a letter to the Israeli Ministry of Defense requesting it revoke NSO's export license, Ingleton said. On Sunday, Abdulaziz's lawyers filed a lawsuit in Tel Aviv, alleging NSO broke international laws by selling its software to oppressive regimes, knowing it could be used to infringe human rights. \\"NSO should be held accountable in order to protect the lives of political dissidents, journalists and human rights activists,\\" said the Jerusalem-based lawyer Alaa Mahajna, who is acting for Abdulaziz. The lawsuit follows another filed in Israel and Cyprus by citizens in Mexico and Qatar. In a statement to CNN Monday, after the lawsuit was filed, NSO Group said it was \\"completely unfounded\\" and \\"shows no evidence that the company's technology was used\\" to hack Abdulaziz's phone. NSO also said its technology helps governments and law enforcement agencies \\"fight terrorism and crime in a modern age\\" and is fully vetted and licensed by the Israeli government. The statement added: \\"The lawsuit appears to be based on a collection of press clippings that have been generated for the sole purpose of creating news headlines and do not reflect the reality of NSO's work.\\" \\"In addition, products supplied by NSO are operated by the government customer to whom they were supplied, without the involvement of NSO or its employees.\\" Jamal Khashoggi is remembered at a memorial in Washington. 'Tyranny has no logic' The fact Abdulaziz's phone contained spyware means Saudi officials would have been able to see the same 400 messages Abdulaziz exchanged with Khashoggi over the period. The messages portray Khashoggi, a Saudi former establishment figure, becoming increasingly fearful for his country's fate as bin Salman consolidates his power. \\"He loves force, oppression and needs to show them off,\\" Khashoggi says of bin Salman, \\"but tyranny has no logic.\\" Such discussions could be considered treasonous in Saudi Arabia, a country with one of the world's worst records for free speech. In a sign Khashoggi and Abdulaziz were mindful of their security in exile, they flitted back and forth between phone calls, voice messages and chats on WhatsApp and other encrypted platforms like Telegram and Signal. Omar Abdulaziz Just wishing you happy health, a greeting and every good thing Jamal Khashoggi I hope you are well Omar. May God listens to you and rid us and the nation from this predicament. As Khashoggi speculated about bin Salman's future, Abdulaziz was already in the crown prince's sights and was about to receive a visit with a message right from the top. 'Message from MBS' Last May, Abdulaziz said two Saudi government emissaries asked to meet with him in Montreal. He agreed and says he secretly recorded 10 hours of their conversations over the course of their five-day stay. He shared them with CNN. Speaking in Arabic, the men, referred to only as Abdullah and Malek, tell Abdulaziz they have been sent on the orders of bin Salman himself, bypassing the usual channels like the Security Ministry. Bin Salman watches him on his Twitter feed, they say, and wants to offer him a job. \\"We have come to you with a message from Mohammed bin Salman and his assurance to you,\\" one of them says. Abdelaziz's recorded messages are telling because Saudi Arabia has always claimed its crown prince had nothing to do with plots like the one leading to Khashoggi's death, blaming that incident on a failed rendition attempt, masterminded by advisers and subordinates from the security staff. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman attends the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh. Chillingly, the men mention also Saud al Qahtani, bin Salman's powerful social media enforcer -- fired and under investigation in Saudi Arabia amid claims by Turkey that he was the mastermind of Khashoggi's murder. \\"If Saud al-Qahtani himself hears your name, he will immediately know and you can meet with Prince Mohammed directly,\\" says one other man. Then they recommend Abdulaziz visits the Saudi embassy to pick up some paperwork. Poignantly, Abdelaziz says it was possibly Khashoggi's advice that saved his life. \\"He told me not to go and only to meet them in public places.\\" On October 2, Khashoggi did the opposite. It was the last time he checked his WhatsApp messages. |||||Summary:","completion":"Omar Abdulaziz, a Saudi dissident based in Canada, has filed a lawsuit against Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, claiming its spyware targeted him and contributed to the killing of his friend, Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Additionally, peat moss helps improve soil structure, making it a popular choice among gardeners and horticulturists. Here are some primary reasons why peat moss is good for growing: 1. Water retention: Peat moss can hold up to 20 times its weight in water, ensuring that plants maintain adequate moisture levels throughout their growth cycle. This is particularly beneficial in areas with irregular rainfall or dry climates. 2. Aeration: The structure of peat moss enables proper aeration, ensuring that plant roots receive sufficient oxygen. This promotes healthy root development and prevents root rot caused by waterlogged soil conditions. 3. Soil amendment: When mixed with garden soil, peat moss enhances the soil's overall texture, composition, and water-holding capacity. This makes it easier for plant roots to grow and expand, leading to healthier and more vigorous plants. 4. Acidic pH: Peat moss has a naturally low pH level, often between 4.0 and 4.5. This makes it suitable for growing acid-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, and rhododendrons. For plants that require a neutral or alkaline pH, the pH level can be adjusted by adding lime or other supplements. 5. Pest resistance: Peat moss is generally pest-resistant, which can help to reduce the risk of infestations and disease in the plants grown in it. In conclusion, while the suggested answer is not accurate, peat moss is indeed beneficial for growing a variety of plants by improving soil structure, moisture retention, and providing a suitable environment for healthy root growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When you choose a currency pair, for example, EUR/USD, the chart you generate will show you how many US dollars you can buy for one Euro. You can test the relative strength of a particular currency by looking at several different pairings. The various pairs available depend on the Forex service you're using. You can pull up charts for major pairs, such as EUR/USD. You also often have the option of looking at minor pairs as well, such as AUD/CAD (the relationship between the Australian Dollar and the Canadian Dollar). Your chart shows how the exchange rate between the two currencies changed over time. In a candlestick chart, each candlestick accounts for a specific time period you set. You also set the overall time period, which determines how many candlesticks you have. For example, you could set your overall chart to show a 24-hour period, with each candlestick representing one hour. Each candlestick shows the opening price at the beginning of the hour and the closing price at the end of the hour, as well as the high and low price during that period. Since you chose a 24-hour period, you would have 24 candlesticks total. The position of the candlesticks on the graph shows the fluctuations in the exchange rate between the two currencies over the period of time you've chosen. The time period is expressed in intervals along the Y-axis and the exchange rate is charted along the X-axis. Generally, there are two types of candles: a bullish candle and a bearish candle. On most candlestick charts, the bullish candle is open while the bearish candle is colored in. The differences are as follows: If the closing price is higher than the opening price, you have a bullish candle. If the opening price is higher than the closing price, you have a bearish candle. The top and bottom lines of the candle itself display the opening and closing exchange rate for the pairing you've chosen. You know which one is the opening and which is the closing by looking at the coloration of the candle body. Then you'll see lines extending from the top and bottom of the candle, giving rise to the name of the chart. The highest point, at the tip of the wick, is the highest exchange rate for the pairing for the selected period. The lowest point, at the tip of the shadow, is the lowest exchange rate for the pairing for the selected period. On a bullish candle, the highest line of the candle will be the closing price, while the lowest line of the candle will be the opening price. For a bearish candle, the highest line would be the opening price and the lowest line would be the closing. Part of what makes candlestick charts fun to read are the names given to different patterns. Once you learn to identify these patterns, you can more accurately predict which way the market is going to move for the pairing you're evaluating. Some patterns with predictive value are: Big candles: A big candle body indicates a trend that is continuing for a longer period of time. If you see a large bullish candle, you know the bullish trend is continuing for that pairing. A large bearish candle indicates a continuing bearish trend. A bullish candle might signal you to buy that pairing, while a bearish candle would signal you to sell. Doji candles: Doji candles have little to no candle body. These indicate the market condition is neutral or tentative. Doji candles can tell you to hold off on either buying or selling that currency pairing. Once you know how to identify types of candlesticks, look at their relative position on the chart. This helps you understand what that particular pattern is actually telling you about the way the market is moving. For example, suppose you see a Doji candle with the candle line at the bottom of the formation so that there's a longer wick and no shadow. If you see that candle at the top of an uptrend, it may signal that the uptrend is reversing.

Summarize this article: The outspoken Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw has carefully picked his moment to deliver a verdict on \\"serious weaknesses\\" at seven of the weakest performing chains of academy schools in a hard-hitting letter to the education secretary. He doesn't hold back on what he describes as \\"worrying findings\\". And just a few days ago the government took a further step towards removing local councils from the running of schools. Draft plans for a national funding formula will mean the \\"vast bulk\\" of government education cash going directly to schools by 2020. That will allow the cake to be sliced differently, but it is also a paving measure for another big government ambition - to make councils running schools in England \\"a thing of the past\\". I understand the Treasury was keen for the funding formula announcement to be made this week, which suggests we may hear more in the Budget next week about the push for more schools to become academies. Many parents in England barely register whether their local school is run by the council or by an academy trust. They're pre-occupied with other fundamentals like a sense of order and community and, of course, exam results. But by and large people do care whether their taxes, their public money, is well spent. So it is no surprise that Sir Michael focuses some of his criticism not just on poor results, but on high salaries and big bank reserves. In essence he's asking if these particular seven trusts are value for money for the pupils, the parents and taxpayers. Is it a partial and skewed assessment as the government suggests? Certainly there are plenty of excellent academy schools too, which he acknowledges. In terms of council-run schools, only yesterday, schools minister Nick Gibb singled out some of the worst performing local authorities in terms of GCSE results. So it cuts both ways. Labour wants the government to press the pause button so they can look at the system of holding academy trusts to account and ensure it's robust. That's not going to happen. Instead the government will continue to point to its network of eight regional schools commissioners whose job it is to do just that. If anything, all the signals are that the foot will be on the accelerator towards all schools in England becoming academies. Summary:","completion":"A school inspector found some problems at seven groups of academy schools. He says there are \\"serious weaknesses\\" and he's worried. The government wants more schools to become academies, but some people think they need to stop and check if everything is okay first. The government still wants to keep moving forward, and soon we might see more schools becoming academies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

In recent years, several other craters of around the same age as Chicxulub have been discovered, all between latitudes 20°N and 70°N. Examples include the disputed Silverpit crater in the North Sea, and the Boltysh crater in Ukraine. Both are much smaller than Chicxulub, but are likely to have been caused by objects many tens of meters across striking the Earth. This has led to the hypothesis that the Chicxulub impact may have been only one of several impacts that happened nearly at the same time. Another possible crater thought to have been formed at the same time is the larger Shiva crater, though the structure's status as an impact crater is contested.The collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994 demonstrated that gravitational interactions can fragment a comet, giving rise to many impacts over a period of a few days if the comet should collide with a planet. Comets undergo gravitational interactions with the gas giants, and similar disruptions and collisions are very likely to have occurred in the past. This scenario may have occurred on Earth at the end of the Cretaceous, though Shiva and the Chicxulub craters might have been formed 300,000 years apart.In late 2006, Ken MacLeod, a geology professor from the University of Missouri, completed an analysis of sediment below the ocean's surface, bolstering the single-impact theory. MacLeod conducted his analysis approximately 4,500 kilometres (2,800 mi) from the Chicxulub crater to control for possible changes in soil composition at the impact site, while still close enough to be affected by the impact. The analysis revealed there was only one layer of impact debris in the sediment, which indicated there was only one impact. Multiple-impact proponents such as Gerta Keller regard the results as \\"rather hyper-inflated\\" and do not agree with the conclusion of MacLeod's analysis, arguing that there might only be gaps of hours to days between impacts in a multiple-impact scenario (cf. Shoemaker-Levy 9) which would not leave a detectable gap in deposits. The answer is:","completion":"Ken MacLeod"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker.

House and Senate Republican leaders announced Tuesday that their sole appointees to the May 5th meeting would be House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) and Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.)--neither of whom are budget leaders and both of whom function largely as political mouthpieces for their party. GOP leaders also each opted to send only one appointee, instead of the requested four, to the meeting. \\"I remain skeptical that the administration will take this effort seriously, especially after it all but ignored its previous debt commission and President Obama had to be dragged kicking and screaming to consider minimal spending cuts for the rest of this fiscal year,\\" Cantor said in a statement. \\"A serious effort to get our fiscal house in order is sorely needed, however, which is why I believe this commission should commence with a clearly defined target and purpose, under a time frame to produce that result -- so that it doesn't end up in the graveyard of previous commissions that failed to improve our nation's finances.\\" At the same time, some Democratic sources said their own party's picks for the meeting aren't as credible as they could be. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) only named a total of four appointees instead of eight: Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.), Senate Appropriations Chairman Daniel Inouye (D-Hawaii), House Budget ranking member Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) and Assistant Democratic House Leader James Clyburn (D-S.C.). But it's not the numbers that are the problem.

During his speech, the president bashed the House GOP budget proposal put forward by Budget Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and said he would not accept more tax breaks for the rich at the expense of entitlements. Ryan, who was seated in the audience during the speech, later called Obama's remarks \\"excessively partisan.\\" GOP leadership aides say there is nothing fishy about their picks for the White House meeting. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart said Republican leaders were \\"just trying to be efficient\\" by sending two appointees instead of eight; he called the White House's original proposal of 16 members \\"unwieldy.\\" Boehner spokesman Michael Steel declined to comment on why Cantor was tapped instead of Ryan. Kyl has played a role in past negotiations with the White House: He was the top negotiator for Senate Republicans in the tax-cut talks with the White House in December. But Kyl threw up several roadblocks to passing the START treaty as part of the tax deal--a top priority to Obama--and the final deal was finally hatched privately between Biden and McConnell. Reid and McConnell both passed over members of the Senate's \\"Gang of Six\\" for the deficit meeting. That group has been working for months on its own deficit-reduction plan and has grumbled about the White House moving forward with its fiscal plan without factoring in the work the group has done. The first meeting is set to take place at the Blair House, where a bipartisan group of lawmakers met with Obama for a largely unproductive health care reform summit in 2010. ||||| WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama’s much discussed speech last week on how to remedy the country’s fiscal future was part of a far broader, more strategically detailed political strategy than has been previously reported. Several high-ranking administration officials have confirmed that the White House laid out plans for the address as far back as the last calendar year, with the president’s economic team and other senior staff members “meeting regularly since February to put the policy together and work on the speech.” In presenting a fiscal roadmap, the administration aimed to demonstrate Obama's fundamental seriousness towards what is widely perceived to be a looming deficit crisis. But the speech also illuminated both the lack of communication between the White House and Capitol Hill and a growing conviction among insiders that the president must move the deficit debate off center stage in order to tackle other domestic priorities. The address, delivered at George Washington University last Wednesday, outlined an expansive approach towards leveling the federal government’s balance sheet. Obama expressed a need for simplifying the tax code and raising the rates on the highest earners. He called for a “debt fail-safe” trigger, mandating Congress to pass across-the-board spending reductions if the nation’s debt does not decline. He advocated stronger cuts in the Pentagon’s budget and less waste in Medicare. His remarks, in all, were positively received by Democrats and derided as partisan waste by Republicans. Yet build-up to the speech illustrated more than reactions to it. Capitol Hill officials, including the White House's top allies, say they were left completely in the dark. No one, it appears, knew Obama would deliver an address until his top aide, David Plouffe, announced plans on the Sunday shows. Key aides were briefed on its content only days (if not hours) before the president took the stage. “Members and staffs had no idea what they were going to say until about four hours before the speech—three days after the speech was announced,\\" said a senior Senate Democratic aide. \\"It was pretty ham-handed in its roll out and members weren't pleased.\\" The abundance of secrecy left the impression that White House officials came up with the idea for Obama’s speech at the eleventh hour in an effort to divert attention away from the debate raging in Congress. “They were scrambling to change the subject from the budget debacle and this was what they latched on to,” said the aide. Having failed to effectively brief members of Congress on the details of his plan, few lawmakers could therefore amplify the president's message. Administration officials, for their part, steadfastly refute the idea that they simply \\"winged\\" it. According to one Obama aide, the president and his team decided in December that he would have to “lay out a comprehensive plan” for deficit reduction “after the FY2011 funding debate had completed.” Another White House official described the planning as even more specific, asserting, “Its been on the schedule for the Wednesday after the [continuing resolution avoiding a government shut down] was resolved for months now.” Because a vote on the continuing resolution was delayed on several occasions, the date of the speech remained, consistently, in flux. According to these individuals, the President’s staff had been considering university locations near or in Washington, D.C. for venue well before the speech was announced, with an eye toward delivering subsequent deficit-focused addresses outside the nation's capital the following week. Michelle Sherrard, a spokesman for George Washington University, did not have a specific date for when the administration first contacted the university. She noted only that \\"The White House and GW regularly communicate about the possibility of hosting upcoming events on campus.\\" One administration aide defended congressional outreach, adding, “Throughout this process the President’s team has been in touch with leaders on the Hill, including both the Gang of Six [Senators meeting on their own deficit proposal] and Congressman [Paul] Ryan, and other stakeholders like the deficit commission chairs.” “In touch,” however, remains an inherently subjective phrase. As late as the Tuesday night before the speech was delivered, one extremely close White House ally professed to not having a clue about what would be said. “I don't think they have briefed anyone and I am not sure the speech is done!” In fact, the speech wasn’t done. According to an administration aide, “the president worked until late in the night Tuesday, and put final touches on the speech on Wednesday morning.” Why did it take so long to finalize the details on a speech planned months in advance? For one, various areas of policy disagreement within the White House remained unresolved. In particular, officials familiar with the discussions say, Obama's economic advisers warned against calling for a final balance of three dollars in spending reductions for every dollar generated in additional tax revenue, arguing the ratio was too explicit. Medicare reform sparked another element of disagreement. In his speech, the president proposed strengthening the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a group tasked with finding excessive and unnecessary spending within the system. Several aides wanted him to further outline specific ways to empower Medicare to negotiate over drug prices and medical procedures. In the end, Obama kept the speech broad, leaving Democrats officials on the Hill largely pleased. Several members of Congress also expressed agitation with the timing. Obama’s speech came after Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) unveiled his own budget plan, giving his own remarks the veneer of a presidential response rather than executive leadership. Moreover, by calling for additional talks on deficit reform, the president miffed lawmakers either working on or invested in the Gang of Six talks currently ongoing. “The fact that the president has come out with his vision should be a positive reinforcement, another indication that this is important work that needs to be done,” Press Secretary Jay Carney said on Monday in response to complaints Obama stepped into Gang of Six territory. “And the fact that the President built his vision by borrowing in many ways from the recommendations of the bipartisan commission on which a number of members of that Senate group sat… gives a good sign, a good indication, of the fact that there is a building consensus around the way to approach this problem. So he thinks it’s very complementary to the process.” But many Democrats don't want \\"complementary.\\" The Gang of Six already gives progressives angina, with the Democratic members of the group -- including Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Mark Warner (D-Va.) -- openly supporting elements of Social Security reform and even extending the Bush tax cuts. Should the president end up complementing or even embracing their approach, the worry goes, no progressive counterpoint to Ryan's proposal will emerge. Instead, the distance between the Gang of Six and the Republican alternative will become the “compromise.” The White House has been noticeably tight-lipped about its thoughts on Gang of Six conversations, perhaps because scarce information exists as to what, exactly, the lawmakers are discussing. But signs of mounting concern permeate both on and off the Hill. When Vice President Joe Biden hosts a deficit reduction meeting with members of Congress at the Blair House on May 5, no Democratic lawmakers from the Gang of Six will be present. Instead, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is sending Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Dan Inouye (D-Hawaii). Gang of Six member and Budget Committee Chair Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), one Democratic Senate aide relayed, was more than “irked” by his absence from the talks. Other Democrats voiced relief over the Gang of Six absence, speculating that both Reid and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) were growing wary about the bipartisan group's role. Gang of Six criticism is more intense off the Hill, with several of the nation’s most powerful union groups laying down crisp lines in the sand over elements they consider non-negotiable, such as ending tax cuts for the richest Americans. “Any plan to reduce the deficit that does not include ending the Bush tax cuts -- a clear contributor to the deficit -- is not a serious plan,” said Michelle Nawar, Director for Legislation at the Service Employees. “Every middle class family should be offended if Congress calls on them to bear the burden for reducing a deficit they did not cause while continuing to handout more tax giveaways to millionaires and corporations. We'll see what the Gang of Six proposes, but how could any Democrat support a plan that cuts needed services for seniors and children while continuing these expensive tax giveaways?” Nawar's question presumably extends to Obama, who has punted once on letting the Bush tax rates for the wealthy expire (they will now lapse at the end of 2012). A far more immediate and pressing concern, however, is whether the administration’s attempt to jump ahead of the deficit debate will yield the type of political fruits the White House envisions. The president’s advisers -- chiefly, former Senior Communications Aide David Axelrod –- have long seen benefits to deficit hawk-ery in private polling. But the payoff this time around has been limited: An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Tuesday showed that 57 percent of Americans disapproved of the way Obama is handling the economy. “I think they were concerned about how to give the president credibility on this issue and how to win over some independents,” one top party strategist said of Obama’s speech on Wednesday. “The irony is it won’t give him any. He could have offered 10 billion more in cuts for the CR and it would never be good enough for the GOP.” ||||| A:","completion":"The White House's proposed deficit talks with Congress seem to be unraveling before they have even started.

President Obama had called for bipartisan talks during an address on fiscal policy, with Vice President Biden taking the lead. On the other side, President Obama's recent speech on the country's fiscal future was part of a broader, more strategically detailed political strategy. The White House aimed to demonstrate Obama's seriousness toward the perceived looming deficit crisis while also highlighting the lack of communication between the White House and Capitol Hill. The speech, which was generally well received by Democrats and criticized by Republicans, outlined several measures to address the deficit, including simplifying the tax code, implementing a debt fail-safe trigger, and cutting spending on the Pentagon and Medicare. However, Congressional outreach was minimal, leaving lawmakers unable to amplify the president's message, and tensions arose over the timing of the speech and which lawmakers would participate in subsequent deficit talks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Town That Dreaded Sundown Context: Before the \\"Phantom-attacks\\", which occurred about eight months after World War II, Texarkana was pleasant and citizens were preparing for a good future. On the night of Sunday, March 3, 1946, Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins park on a lovers' lane. Soon, the hood of the car opens and closes and a man with a bag over his head with holes cut out for his eyes is seen holding wires he had yanked from the engine. While Sammy tries starting the car, the man breaks his window and pulls him out, cutting him on the broken glass. The man then gets inside the car with Linda. The next morning, Linda is found on the side of the road barely alive. While at the crime scene, Deputy Norman Ramsey reports that both victims are still alive. He leaves a message for Sheriff Barker to meet him at Michael-Meagher Hospital. At the hospital, a doctor tells Sheriff Barker that Linda was not raped but that her back, stomach, and breasts were \\"heavily bitten; literally chewed.\\" At the police station, Barker suggests to Police Chief Sullivan to warn teens and college students from parking on lonely roads. On March 24, while investigating a lovers' lane in heavy rain, Ramsey hears gunshots and finds Howard W. Turner dead in a ditch and the corpse of his girlfriend, Emma Lou Cook, tied to a tree. Ramsey spots the hooded man escaping in a car. Panicked, the town sells out of guns and other home safety equipment. Sheriff Barker calls in help and tells Ramsey they are getting the most famous criminal investigator in the country, the \\"Lone Wolf\\" of the Texas Rangers, Captain J.D. Morales. After arriving, Morales explains he'll be in charge of the investigation and calls the unidentified attacker a Phantom. Ramsey is assigned to assist Morales, and Patrolman A.C.

[The King of Kong] would play like dark comedy were there not such honest-to-God cruelty at its core. 3.

Context: “Teachers like to agree with each other, when we talk about learning. It’s hard to change that, when the model we have wanted to make work has nonetheless been failing for 40 years.” Professor Brian Boyd No area has remained up there in the contentiousness charts in Scotland as the notion of business and education working together to do something better for our young people. Most schools do not ‘partner’ with colleges or universities. Instead, they are production facilities for undergraduates and college entrants. Fewer are set up to systematically provide apprenticeship opportunities as well as learning. At NoTosh, we’ve been working on a few, nascent projects to change the attitudes of schools from being these production facilities into something more of a life support - what metrics of success might we use if schools judged their success on the results of their alumni, five, ten or twenty years down the line, much like universities do? City of Glasgow College have partnered with Newlands Junior College (NJC) to make the experience of a day in college more than what, in other circumstances, is too often perceived as a day off from school. The Junior College is called this, and not a school, for that very reason, to mark it out as a stepping stone between school and full-blown college. NoTosh helped last August to provoke the team around their thoughts of what 'unschool' might look like. The College was backed and founded by Jim McColl, one of Scotland’s top business people. In the future, suggests, McColl, might be be possible to take funding of learning out of its pre-existing silos, particularly for this group of students, about 60 in every city at these ages, who just need a different approach to the traditional comprehensive approach?

Question: After the story ends, how have students at Newlands Junior College reacted to partnering with Glasgow College? Answer:","completion":"While the text does not provide explicit information on the students' reactions at Newlands Junior College (NJC) after partnering with City of Glasgow College, it is possible to infer some potential outcomes based on the context and goals of the partnership. The partnership between Newlands Junior College and City of Glasgow College aimed to create a more seamless educational experience and provide a stepping stone between traditional school and full-blown college. By shifting the focus from solely being a production facility and incorporating a more diversified approach, the partnership likely has positive impacts on students' learning and engagement. Students at Newlands Junior College might react positively to the partnership due to the following reasons: 1. Exposure to new learning opportunities - Partnering with Glasgow College allows NJC students to explore different courses, hands-on learning experiences, and the resources available at the college level. This broader range of educational opportunities may result in increased student interest and engagement in their studies. 2. Greater relevance to future careers - The partnership also aims to provide apprenticeship opportunities and focus on the long-term success of students. As students feel their education is preparing them better for their future careers and personal development, they may view the partnership positively. 3. A sense of \\"unschool\\" - The collaboration between NJC and City of Glasgow College prompted a rethinking of the traditional school model, leading to discussions about \\"unschooling.\\" Students may appreciate and enjoy the departure from conventional school norms, finding it refreshing and motivating. 4. Support and guidance - The partnership focuses on judging the success of the educational institutions based on the results of alumni five, ten, or twenty years down the line. This emphasis on long-term support and guidance may make students feel more cared for and valued, leading to a positive reaction to the partnership. In summary, while there is no direct information on the students' reactions to the partnership between Newlands Junior College and City of Glasgow College, it is likely that the students have appreciated the new opportunities, more extensive support, and innovative approaches offered by the collaboration. The partnership helps both institutions create a holistic learning environment aiming for long-term success, which may result in increased student satisfaction and engagement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. who conquered the persian empire and most of the ancient world??","completion":"Alexander the Great, also known as Alexander III of Macedon, was the individual responsible for conquering the Persian Empire and most of the ancient world. He was born in 356 BCE in Pella, the ancient capital of Macedonia, and was the son of King Philip II and his fourth wife, Olympias. Alexander was tutored by the Greek philosopher Aristotle during his early years, who laid the foundations for his renowned military and tactical knowledge. In 336 BCE, following the assassination of his father, Alexander ascended to the Macedonian throne at the young age of 20. He inherited a strong and well-organized army, which he expanded and used for military conquests throughout his reign. He initially focused on securing his authority over the Greek city-states, especially in areas where his father's authority had been contested. This led to the formation of the League of Corinth, a unified Greek alliance under Macedonian control, in 337 BCE, which deemed Alexander the Hegemon (leader). Alexander embarked on his legendary military campaign against the Persian Empire in 334 BCE. At this time, Achaemenid Persia was the most powerful empire in the known world, stretching from the borders of India to Egypt and extending into Asia Minor. Alexander's forces initially were inferior in number compared to the Persian armies, but his tactical brilliance and the exceptional performance of his troops allowed him to defeat the Persians in a series of remarkable battles. Three of the most famous battles fought between Alexander the Great and the Persian Empire were the Battle of Granicus (334 BCE), the Battle of Issus (333 BCE), and the Battle of Gaugamela (331 BCE). His victories in these engagements not only weakened the Achaemenid Empire but also established Alexander's image as a legendary military commander. As he advanced eastward through the Persian Empire, Alexander toppled Persian satrapies, secured city-states, and incorporated new territories into his ever-expanding realm. In 330 BCE, Alexander ultimately defeated Darius III, the last Achaemenid ruler, consolidating his control over the Persian Empire. Alexander continued his conquests even beyond Persia, leading his army into Central Asia and India. He established numerous new cities and spread Greek culture and language, a process known as Hellenization, throughout the conquered regions. However, his military campaigns took a toll on his troops, and they eventually refused to march further into India. Alexander reluctantly turned back and traveled to Babylon, where he later died in 323 BCE at the age of 32. The cause of his death remains a topic of conjecture, with possibilities ranging from fever and illness to poisoning. Following Alexander's death, his vast empire was divided among his ambitious generals, marking the beginning of the Hellenistic Period. These subsequent kingdoms continued to exert influence over the Mediterranean and Near Eastern region for centuries to come, perpetuating the legacy of Alexander the Great and his impact on the ancient world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

DANVERS — Prosecutors said Thursday that the 14-year-old student charged with killing Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer last month also raped her and robbed her of her cellphone, credit cards, and underwear before dumping her body in a nearby wooded area. The new details were revealed in indictments handed up by an Essex County grand jury. It charged freshman Philip D. Chism with not only first-degree murder, but also aggravated rape and armed robbery in the slaying, which has stunned the small town and garnered nationwide attention. Continue reading below “It’s unreal that [Philip] would do something like that,” Jessica DiPietro, 14, a freshman who was a student in one of Ritzer’s classes, said as she discussed the indictments outside the high school Thursday afternoon. “It’s unbelievable. I cannot even process into words why he would do something like that. It’s devastating.” The new charges provided no insight into what might have motivated a teenager who was developing a positive reputation in his new high school to allegedly turn on Ritzer, a popular and enthusiastic 24-year-old math teacher. Students have said that Ritzer asked Chism, who had just moved to the community from Tennessee, to stay after school on Oct. 22 in order to prepare for an upcoming exam. Prosecutors say Chism attacked her with a box cutter, raped and robbed her, and then dumped her body in an area behind the school. Continue reading it below A law enforcement official with knowledge of the investigation has told the Globe that surveillance footage from inside the school showed Chism pushing a recycling bin, which may have been used to transport Ritzer’s body, through the hall and outside the building. “The indictments returned today detail horrific and unspeakable acts,” Essex District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said in a statement Thursday. “This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family.” Investigators believe that after abandoning the body — taking Ritzer’s credit cards, iPhone, and underwear with him — Chism walked to a nearby movie theater where he bought a ticket to an afternoon showing of Woody Allen’s “Blue Jasmine.” “We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen,” the Ritzer family said in a statement issued by a spokesman. “As a family, we continue to mourn Colleen’s passing and ask that the media respect our privacy during this very difficult time.” An Essex County prosecutor stressed during a recent court hearing that there was no evidence that Ritzer engaged in any wrongdoing in her relationship with Chism. According to authorities, Ritzer was reported missing to Danvers police at about 11:20 p.m. Oct. 22 when she did not return home and did not answer her cellphone. Police found blood in a second-floor bathroom at the high school, prompting a search of the grounds and the discovery of her body shortly before 3 a.m. Chism was picked up by police in the early morning hours of Oct. 23, when he was found walking north Route 1 in nearby Topsfield. He initially pleaded not guilty to a murder charge after his arrest that day. Denise Regan, Chism’s court-appointed defense attorney, declined to comment on the indictments when reached by phone Thursday afternoon. Chism, a lanky teenager, was a standout on the school’s junior varsity soccer team and described by fellow students as quiet and amiable. “I wish I could say that you could tell that [Philip] was someone who would do something like that, but I can’t,” said Andrew Poland, a 14-year-old freshman who was the same history class as Chism and was a student in Ritzer’s geometry class. “I don’t know what snapped in him to do this.” Chism will face the murder charge as an adult, while his indictments on the rape and armed robbery charges were as a juvenile offender, and will initially be handled in Salem Juvenile Court. An aggravated rape charge is brought when there is serious bodily harm to the victim, or when the rape was committed during another violent felony. Prosecutors have alleged that Chism sexually assaulted Ritzer with an object. Chism is currently being held without bail in a Department of Youth Services facility. More than 1,000 mourners attended funeral services for Ritzer held at Andover’s St. Augustine Church on Oct. 27. During the service, Ritzer was lauded for seeing “the goodness in other people’’ and as someone who considered teaching not just her job, but her calling in life. Students at the high school remain shocked by the allegations, with some recalling Chism as a quiet student, who mostly kept to himself but did not show signs that he might be capable of violence. “I just don’t know why he would do that,” said Alec Cianfrocca, a 15-year-old sophomore who was in Ritzer’s geometry class and was visibly upset as he discussed the charges outside of the high school Thursday afternoon. “I don’t like to think about it much, because it makes me upset.” John R. Ellement ||||| Story highlights Philip Chism indicted on murder, other charges in the killing of teacher Colleen Ritzer Prosecutor says indictments detail \\"horrific and unspeakable acts\\" Defense lawyer declines to comment on action A Massachusetts grand jury Thursday indicted 14-year-old Philip Chism on charges of murder, aggravated rape and armed robbery in connection with last month's slaying of his algebra teacher, Colleen Ritzer, according to the Essex district attorney. Citing Massachusetts law, prosecutors said they would ask that Chism be tried in an adult court. \\"The indictments ... detail horrific and unspeakable acts,\\" said District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett. The armed robbery indictment alleges that Chism, armed with a box cutter, robbed Ritzer of credit cards, an iPhone and her underwear. The aggravated rape indictment alleges that he sexually assaulted her with an object. Under the aggravated rape and armed robbery indictments, Chism was charged as a youthful offender, but prosecutors said they will move to join those charges with the murder case in Superior Court. \\"This is the first step in a long process to secure justice for Ms. Ritzer and her family,\\" Blodgett said. Ritzer was known to her friends and family as a woman who inspired many, whether it be in the classroom or online, with her heart, intellect and positive spirit. \\"She was happy,\\" said Jen Berger, Ritzer's best friend. \\"I don't even know what the world is like without her. It's a scary thought.\\" A 2011 graduate of Assumption College who was working toward a master's degree at Salem State University, Ritzer seemed to always wear a wide smile and was approachable to students and colleagues alike, said Charlotte Dzerkacz, who became good friends with Ritzer in 2011 when they taught at the same middle school. \\"She was energetic, she was compassionate,\\" Dzerkacz said. \\"You couldn't ask for anything more from a teacher or a friend.\\" In a statement, the Ritzer family said: \\"We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen.\\" Chism allegedly killed Ritzer, 24, on October 22 in the girl's bathroom of Danvers High School with a box cutter he brought to school, a source close to the investigation told CNN. Ritzer went to a regular girls bathroom on the second floor when someone was using the locked faculty bathroom. Chism followed her in, according to the source. Ritzer was punched a few times before being killed, officials said. Her body went into a recycling bin, then outside the school where it was tossed, the source said. Authorities found a bin that apparently had been thrown off an embankment some 100 feet away from Ritzer's body. After changing his clothes, Chism went to a Wendy's restaurant and a movie, according to the source. Denise Regan, Chism's public defender, declined to comment. A week after the slaying, about 400 Danvers High School students were among the estimated 1,000 people who gathered to pay final respects at the church where the family of popular math teacher worshiped. Many mourners wore pink clothing -- Ritzer's favorite color -- and pink flowers decorated the outside of Andover's St. Augustine Church. The Rev. Peter G. Gori, in his homily, offered advice on how to approach Ritzer's death. \\"Perhaps we should ask not why, or even how she died, but rather why and how did she live,\\" Gori said. Authorities are still investigating the motive for her killing. Documents filed in a Tennessee court 12 years ago may shed light on Chism's past. The court papers showed that Chism's father agreed during a separation from his mother to have restricted time with his son, who was then 2, because of \\"prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse.\\" The documents said the parents were attempting to reconcile. Chism's uncle, Terrence Chism Blaine, told CNN in the days after the crime that the boy's parents are now separated and that the father -- a former military man -- now lives in Florida. The suspect's mother, Diana Chism, last month released a statement through her son's attorney saying her \\"heart is broken for the Ritzer family and the loss of their daughter and sister Colleen Ritzer.\\" \\"Her son was born in love and is dear to her, very dear,\\" the statement said. ||||| More details may be released in court about the death of a popular Danvers teacher who police say was killed by one of her students. The Associated Press, The Boston Globe and other media organizations have asked a Salem District Court judge to lift an order that bars public viewing of search warrants and other documents in the case of 14-year-old Philip Chism. Some of those documents are expected to be made public Friday. Chism has been held without bail since shortly after the Oct. 22 slaying of 24-year-old Colleen Ritzer, whose body was found behind Danvers High School. He was indicted Thursday on charges of murder, aggravated sexual assault, and armed robbery. Authorities say he sexually assaulted Ritzer with an object before killing and robbing her. \\"The indictments returned today detail horrific and unspeakable acts,\\" Essex County District Attorney Jonathan Blodgett said. The indictment says Chism, armed with a box cutter, stole Ritzer's underwear, credit cards and iPhone. A ruling on her exact cause of death is pending. Chism had previously pleaded not guilty to a murder charge. A message seeking comment was left with his attorney Thursday. The indictment adds charges of aggravated rape and armed robbery. Chism was spotted leaving a movie theater about 6:30 p.m. on the day Ritzer was killed, then picked up by police as he walked along a highway in a neighboring town six hours later. Police said they believe Ritzer died sometime after the school day ended at 2 p.m., but they have not said exactly when. Ritzer's family issued a statement saying they continue to mourn and asking for privacy. \\"We are devastated and heartbroken by the details of the horrific circumstances surrounding the death of our beautiful daughter and sister, Colleen,\\" the statement said. Prosecutors have not revealed a motive for the killing, though two classmates said Chism was in Ritzer's class after dismissal the day she was killed. Chism had moved to Massachusetts from Tennessee before the start of the school year and played on the school's junior varsity soccer team. Court records indicate Chism's parents had difficulties early in their marriage. In a parenting plan included in 2001 divorce papers, his mother, Diana, insisted on supervising any time her husband, Stacy, had with their son and a younger daughter. She cited \\"prior physical and emotional abuse as well as alcohol abuse\\" by her husband. Both adults signed the papers. The divorce was apparently never finalized after both parents signed an order stating they wanted to attempt to reconcile. Shortly after the killing, Diana Chism released a statement through her son's public defender saying she was heartbroken for Ritzer's family. Ritzer was described as an enthusiastic, caring teacher who stood outside her classroom and greeted all students, whether they were in her classes or not. Ritzer's family has established a scholarship to honor her work. It will benefit graduates of Andover High School, in her hometown, who pursue teaching careers. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"A 14-year-old student, Philip Chism, has been charged with the murder, aggravated rape, and armed robbery of Danvers High School teacher Colleen Ritzer.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: Which school's motto is translated as \\"I sustain the wings\\"? from the following article ? In 1943, a bombing mission by a Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress that had successfully dropped its bombs on target, has degenerated into an emergency situation over the Pacific. The navigator on board has not been able to plot a course back to the bomber's home base. The lives of the crew and the loss of the bomber depends on the skill and training provided for the navigator who represents a \\"weak link\\" in the crew. The one solution to a lack of readiness to go to war in the air is the selection, testing, training and preparation offered by the Army Air Forces Officer Candidate School found in Miami, Florida. The motto of the school is Sustineo Alas (translated as \\"I sustain the wings\\"). The selection and testing to qualify is rigorous; after a physical examination, test scores based on general knowledge, and a stint as a corporal in command of soldiers, only 23 out of 1,000 candidates are chosen to proceed to the Officer's Candidate School. All of the candidates have a diverse background and experiences, some as entertainers such as Robert Preston, while others have been successful in sports, business, science and academia. Many have also had combat experience as well as leadership positions. The twelve-week course stresses discipline, efficiency and restrictions that combine to instil all the attitudes and ethos of the officer cadre. The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Army Air Forces Officer Candidate School found in Miami, Florida. Step-by-step justification: 1.

Can an idea be right and wrong at the same time? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"First, let's address each question individually and analyze them step-by-step. 1. What is the work of HR in any company? Step 1: Define the term HR (Human Resources). Human Resources is a department within a company that focuses on managing and organizing personnel-related matters. Step 2: Describe the tasks and responsibilities of HR. Some typical tasks and responsibilities of HR include recruitment, training, performance management, employee benefits and compensation, legal compliance, and employee relations. HR also develops company policies, procedures, and ensures a positive work environment. 2. Can an idea be right and wrong at the same time? Step 1: Define the context of the question. To determine if an idea can be right and wrong simultaneously, we need to understand the context in which the idea is being presented. Step 2: Analyze the possibility of a paradox. An idea being right and wrong at the same time might seem paradoxical, but this can happen when there are conflicting perspectives or contrasting moral standards at play. For example, specific cultural beliefs or social norms may lead individuals to view the same idea as both right and wrong. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? Step 1: Compare the topics of both questions. The first question is about Human Resources' role in a company, and the second question is related to the nature of ideas and whether they can be simultaneously right and wrong. Step 2: Determine if the focus is in the same general area. The first question is in the area of business and company management, while the second question deals with philosophy and the nature of ideas. Step 3: Provide a conclusion. These questions are not the same, as they tackle different subject areas, and their focus is on different aspects of human understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Plants require what to grow and flower?\\" from the given options is \\"Light.\\" While it is true that plants require water to grow, and certain flowers that grow from bulbs may prefer cool water, this fact is not explicitly represented among the answer choices. However, light is one of the critical factors necessary for the growth and flowering of plants, as it is involved in the process of photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, which they can use to fuel their growth and development. During photosynthesis, plants absorb light energy from the sun using their green pigment called chlorophyll. This energy helps facilitate the conversion of carbon dioxide (from the air) and water (from the soil) into glucose, which serves as their primary source of energy. Plants use this glucose to power their cellular activities and produce oxygen as a byproduct, which is released back into the environment. In addition to light, plants require several other essential elements for proper growth and flowering, including water, carbon dioxide, appropriate temperature, and essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. All these factors collectively contribute to the plant's overall health and ability to grow and produce flowers. To sum it up, while water is vital for the growth and flowering of plants, it is not explicitly mentioned in the list of answer choices. Light is the best answer from the options provided, as it is a crucial factor in the photosynthesis process that allows plants to grow and produce flowers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prisoners died due to bad camp conditions and the poor supply of food, shelter, clothing, and health care. About a thousand POWs, 5 percent of total fatalities, were shot, primarily in escape attempts. Food was especially scarce in 1942 in Finland due to a bad harvest. Punishment for escape attempts or serious violations of camp rules included solitary confinement and execution. Out of 64,188 Soviet POWs, from 18,318 to 19,085 died in Finnish prisoner of war camps. In 1942 the number of prisoner deaths had a negative effect on Finland's international reputation. The Finnish administration decided to improve living conditions and allowed prisoners to work outside their camps. Hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union ceased in September 1944, and the first Soviet POWs were handed over to the Soviet Union on 15 October 1944. The transfer was complete by the next month. Some of the POWs escaped during the transportation, and some of them were unwilling to return to the Soviet Union. Furthermore, Finland handed over 2,546 German POWs from the Lapland War to the Soviet Union.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Paragraph: To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. Question: \\"In what year was Faro burned?\\" Answer: \\"1585\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choose from: (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"Answer: (1). no. Explanation: The paragraph states that Faro was torched nine years after the 1587 attack on the Algarve by British ships commanded by Francis Drake.

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling. The Sixth Circuit Court affirmed some of the decision, holding that it was the state's responsibility to integrate across the segregated metropolitan area. The U.S. Supreme Court took up the case February 27, 1974. The subsequent Milliken v. Bradley decision had wide national influence. In a narrow decision, the Court found that schools were a subject of local control and that suburbs could not be forced to solve problems in the city's school district.\\", answer the following question.

Use the following highlights to write an article: The body of Jorge Armando Moreno was found near Morelos in Zacatecas. It was found alongside bodies of four unidentified women and one man. All six murder victims had been tortured and dumped at a busy roadside. He was arrested this month and confessed to assassinations and murders. But Moreno was released, with the criminal age of responsibility set at 14. Article:","completion":"Title: Disturbing Discovery: Six Bodies including Teen Assassin Found Tortured and Dumped Near Morelos, Zacatecas The small town of Morelos in Zacatecas has become the scene of one of the most gruesome discoveries in recent memory. The body of 13-year-old Jorge Armando Moreno, along with the remains of four unidentified women and one man, was found dumped at a busy roadside in the area. It is a disturbing incident that has left everyone shaken, raising questions about the dangerous methods criminals are employing in Mexico, even enlisting teenagers. Step 1: Introduce the Case Jorge Armando Moreno's lifeless remains were discovered in a horrific state, revealing that all six victims had been subjected to inhuman torture before ultimately being disposed of. This reflects a distressing reality that continues to grip many parts of the country, where drug cartels are in an ongoing struggle for control and dominance. Step 2: Background of Jorge Armando Moreno The case of young Moreno is particularly distressing due to his age. He was arrested earlier this month, at which time he confessed to his involvement in a series of assassinations and murders. However, because the age of criminal responsibility in Mexico is set at 14 years, Moreno was released – a decision that now seems to have had fatal consequences. Step 3: Reflect on the Troubling Circumstances This grim discovery has raised several questions, chiefly about the vulnerability of youngsters like Moreno. It highlights how they can be targeted by crime syndicates, often using their age to avoid severe penalties if arrested. With youngsters like Moreno being subjected to torment and even death, it turns a harsh spotlight on the potential consequences of current laws around criminal responsibility. Step 4: Discuss Future Implications The tragic case of Jorge Armando Moreno and the other victims underscores the need for both legal and social reform. Authorities must not only reconsider the age of criminal responsibility but also address underlying socio-economic factors, which often lead to young people being lured into dangerous situations by criminal groups. In conclusion, the gruesome discovery near Morelos in Zacatecas serves as a stark reminder that violent crime continues to plague the region. With vulnerable youngsters like Jorge Armando Moreno falling victim to these brutal circumstances, it is essential to address the loopholes in existing laws and commit to social reform. Only then can we hope to prevent more youths from meeting such a tragic end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Room Upstairs is a 1987 Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie based on the novel \\"The Room Upstairs\\" by Norma Levinson, starring Stockard Channing, Sam Waterston, Joan Allen and Linda Hunt. The young Jerry O'Connell, Devoreaux White and Sarah Jessica Parker all have small supporting roles. The film aired on CBS on January 31, 1987 and was later distributed on DVD. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The film was distributed after its original showing.","completion":"Yes, the sentence, \\"The film was distributed after its original showing,\\" follows the preceding text effectively, and here is a more detailed elaboration. The 1987 TV movie, The Room Upstairs, is a notable adaptation of Norma Levinson's novel, featuring a cast of accomplished actors. Stockard Channing, Sam Waterston, Joan Allen, and Linda Hunt played the lead roles, while talents like Jerry O'Connell, Devoreaux White, and Sarah Jessica Parker made notable appearances in supporting roles. This Hallmark Hall of Fame movie was originally aired on CBS on January 31, 1987, attracting a significant audience and garnering praise for its performances and storytelling. Given its success, it is reasonable to deduce that there was a demand for the film to be distributed beyond its original TV airing. In response to this demand, the movie was eventually released on DVD, enabling an even wider range of viewers to experience the story. This also allowed those who had watched the film upon its original airing to re-watch it at their leisure, while introducing the movie to new audiences. This distribution not only helped to extend the reach of The Room Upstairs but also contributed to its enduring legacy as a Hallmark Hall of Fame TV movie. Therefore, the sentence, \\"The film was distributed after its original showing,\\" accurately reflects the information presented in the preceding text and provides further context on the distribution and subsequent availability of The Room Upstairs after its initial TV broadcast.

His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa.

(CNN) -- Bahraini authorities on Sunday explicitly tied the recent arrests of alleged \\"terrorist cell\\" members with Iran, claiming the suspects got funding from that Middle Eastern nation and had ties to Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Basij, according to a state media report. A day earlier, a Bahrain Ministry of Interior spokesman said authorities had arrested five people for allegedly planning attacks against -- among other targets -- the interior ministry building, the King Fahad Causeway and Saudi Arabia's embassy in Manama. On Sunday, a spokesman for the public prosecution office -- which has taken over the investigation from the interior ministry -- offered new details about the alleged plotters. Much of the new information was derived from what the official Bahrain News Agency describes as \\"confessions made by some of the accused gangsters.\\" The BNA report specifically referenced money that one suspect supposedly got during a visit to","completion":"Iran, and identified the individual's alleged ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and Basij forces. The state media outlet also detailed how the accused individuals had purportedly received training in Iran, including instructions on making and using explosives, as well as in carrying out acts of sabotage and assassination. Furthermore, the BNA report stated that the alleged terrorist cell had been given clear directives from their Iranian handlers to target key infrastructure and government facilities throughout Bahrain. These operations were aimed at destabilizing the Bahraini government and fostering unrest among the population, which the Iranian benefactors allegedly hoped would create a power vacuum and allow Iran to assert greater influence in the region. In response to these allegations, the Bahraini government has taken swift and decisive action to counter the threat posed by the alleged terrorist cell. All suspects have been placed under arrest, and the public prosecution office has been tasked with conducting a thorough investigation into the matter. This will include not only examining the specifics of the alleged planned attacks, but also looking into the wider network of individuals and organizations that may have been involved in supporting the cell. In light of these recent developments, diplomatic ties between Bahrain and Iran have already begun to deteriorate. The Bahraini government is likely to condemn Iran forcefully on the international stage and may call for other nations – particularly those in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) – to take a harder stance against Iranian interference in regional affairs. On the other hand, Iran has consistently denied any involvement in the alleged plot, dismissing the accusations as groundless and politically motivated. As the investigation continues, it remains to be seen whether concrete evidence supporting Bahrain's claims will emerge, or whether the situation will ultimately escalate into a more significant diplomatic crisis. Aside from the impact on Bahrain-Iran relations, this incident could also have broader implications for the region's security and stability. The discovery of the alleged terrorist plot underscores the ongoing tensions between Sunni and Shia factions in the Middle East, with Iran frequently being accused of backing Shia militants in an effort to increase its influence across the region. As the investigation unfolds, regional actors and the international community will be closely monitoring how the situation develops, with any further escalations posing potential risks to security in the Gulf and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime.

Just as she was about to give up hope, Nina decided to visit the dusty attic, which was filled with the memories of generations past. Though she rarely ventured up there, she knew that her family had stored a wealth of long-forgotten treasures, ones that might contain the perfect solution for her Halloween dilemma. As she ascended the creaky attic stairs, dodging cobwebs and brushing aside years of accumulated grime, Nina felt a twinge of excitement. The dimly lit attic seemed like the perfect place for her to discover the ideal Halloween getup. Making her way to a corner of the attic that seemed promising, she spotted a trunk that she had never seen before. It appeared to be a treasure trove of her grandmother's belongings from her much younger days. She carefully opened the trunk and was greeted by a musty blast of air as she began to sift through its contents. At the bottom of the trunk, she found an old, beautifully tailored white dress, adorned with intricate lace and delicate buttons running down the back. Nestled among the folds was an old locket, a peeling black and white photograph of her grandmother wearing the very same dress, her face radiantly anticipating a night out on the town. Nina hesitated, knowing that the dress must hold sentimental value. But she could feel her grandmother's youthful spirit beckoning her, urging her to don the dress for a night of adventure as the Ghost of Southern Belle Past. She carefully removed the dress and locket from the trunk, making sure to fold up the remaining items before leaving the attic. As she slipped into the dress, the room seemed to fill with fragrant gardenias and magnolia blossoms, as if her grandmother's spirit had come to life along with the costume. Gently fastening the locket around her neck and brushing tendrils of her hair in a loose updo, Nina admired herself in the mirror. As she gazed at her reflection, she realized she looked hauntingly similar to her grandmother in the photograph, and the idea of being a spectral Southern belle captivated her. Using makeup from her everyday kit, she powdered her face white and added dark hollows beneath her eyes to complete her ghostly look. Armed with the locket and the spirit of her late, vivacious grandmother, Nina felt complete. As she floated through the Halloween party that evening, whispers of her ethereal beauty and the spectral elegance of her ghostly Southern belle costume followed her like a delicate trail of confetti. Nina smiled, knowing she had done justice to her grandmother's memory that night. As the party drew to a close, she fingered the locket around her neck, vowing to visit the attic more often, for it was moments like these when history truly came alive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

'","completion":"The given phrase can be dissected into two parts: the first part carries a negative tone, while the second part leans more towards a positive sentiment. The first part of the sentence, \\"through putrid writing, direction, and timing,\\" is negative in nature. The use of the word \\"putrid\\" to describe writing and direction indicates a strong feeling of disapproval and distaste. Moreover, when combined with the negative impact of unsatisfactory timing, the overall sentiment in this part of the sentence is decidedly negative. On the other hand, the second part of the sentence introduces an element of positivity: \\"with a smile that says, 'if I stay positive, maybe I can channel one of my greatest pictures, Drunken Master.'\\" Here, the subject is trying to maintain a positive outlook despite the challenges presented in the first part of the sentence. The reference to \\"Drunken Master,\\" one of the individual's successful works, introduces a glimmer of hope and indicates an optimistic mindset. The use of the smile is also a positive element, further emphasizing an attempt to maintain a positive attitude despite the negativity in the first part of the sentence. In conclusion, the given phrase conveys mixed sentiment, with the first part being decidedly negative and the second part leaning towards positivity. The overall tone is one of resilience and determination, showcasing the capacity to acknowledge flaws while striving for optimism and personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"Why did Addison do this?\\", is \\"Because there's nothing to do\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"While \\"Because there's nothing to do\\" may indeed be a reason why Addison and his sister chased chickens around the farm, neither \\"Yes\\" nor \\"No\\" sufficiently answer the question in a detailed and comprehensive manner. The question attempts to understand the motive behind Addison's actions, and a more appropriate response should provide insight into those motives. To generate a detailed and long answer, consider the following: There could be multiple factors contributing to why Addison and his sister decided to chase the chickens around the farm: 1. Boredom: The farm may not have many activities or attractions for the siblings, and chasing chickens provides a source of entertainment in the absence of other options. 2. Curiosity: Addison and his sister might be curious to see how the chickens react when being chased or how difficult it is to catch a chicken, an experience that they may not have had before. 3. Playfulness: Children often have a playful nature, enjoying interactions with animals and seeking fun in simple activities. Chasing chickens could be an expression of this playful desire. 4. Competitive spirit: Some people enjoy challenges and trying to outperform others, even when it comes to seemingly mundane activities. Addison and his sister could be having a friendly competition to see who can catch the most chickens or who can do it in the least amount of time. 5. Interaction with animals: Lastly, some people find joy and fulfillment in engaging with animals. Addison and his sister may be attracted to the opportunity to interact with and observe chickens in a natural setting. In conclusion, \\"Because there's nothing to do\\" could be a valid reason why Addison and his sister chased the chickens, but it is not the only potential explanation. This answer fails to encompass the full range of motives that could have led to their actions, and it cannot be appropriately represented by a simple \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" response.

Options: - oklahoma - new mexico - texas - mexico - great plains Explain why a human would choose \\"new mexico\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"New Mexico\\" as the answer to the question above because of several reasons related to history, geography, and the cultural significance of Llano Estacado. 1. Historical Context: Llano Estacado, also known as \\"the Staked Plain,\\" is a vast, semi-arid, and elevated region located mostly in eastern New Mexico and northwest Texas. The area has a rich history of exploration and settlement, with many prominent explorers such as Francisco Coronado passing through in search of the fabled \\"Seven Cities of Gold\\" in 1541. The Llano Estacado region was the focus of much exploration and development during the early days of the Spanish colonial period, particularly in the 16th and 17th centuries. Since the original question references an individual who was \\"bound for Llano Estacado,\\" this historical context suggests that New Mexico would be a plausible destination. 2. Geographical Factors: Apart from its historical association, the Llano Estacado region is also geographically situated within the borders of New Mexico. The area stretches from northeastern New Mexico into the Texas Panhandle and eastern portions of Colorado and Oklahoma. Since the individual mentioned in the question is traveling to Llano Estacado, it is not unreasonable to assume that they might be headed toward the New Mexico portion of the plain. 3. Cultural Significance: The Llano Estacado has a unique cultural identity, thanks to its historical significance, landscape, and the indigenous communities that have lived in the region for centuries. New Mexico, in particular, retains a strong connection to its Native American, Spanish, and Mexican cultural roots. The state is renowned for its striking landscapes, including the Llano Estacado, which have significantly influenced the arts, literature, and folklore of the region. Choosing New Mexico as the individual's end goal aligns with the cultural aspects associated with Llano Estacado. 4. Proximity to Well-Known Destinations: Choosing New Mexico as the end goal also makes sense in terms of the region's proximity to other noteworthy destinations. These include the Pecos River Valley, which runs along the eastern edge of Llano Estacado, and the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which form the southernmost subrange of the Rocky Mountains. Additionally, New Mexico is home to several historic cities and Native American cultural sites, which could make it an appealing destination for an individual traveling to Llano Estacado. 5. Process of Elimination: By examining the options listed, a human might conclude that New Mexico is the most fitting answer. Oklahoma and the Great Plains aren't directly associated with Llano Estacado. Texas, although geographically connected to Llano Estacado, may not best capture the historical and cultural significance of the region in comparison to New Mexico. The end goal being Mexico seems less likely, as it's further away and doesn't hold the same connection to Llano Estacado. In summary, a human would choose \\"New Mexico\\" to answer the question above due to the historical context, geographical factors, cultural significance, proximity to well-known destinations, and the process of elimination. The connection between Llano Estacado and New Mexico's unique cultural, historical, and geographical elements makes it a reasonable and fitting answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr Pepper is described as a distinctively different type of drink with a unique taste of its own and is not classified under any traditional flavor profiles, including root beer. The jingle from 1978 by Jake Holmes underscores this by stating, \\"It's not a cola, it's something much much more. It's not a root beer, you get root beer by the score.\\" Furthermore, former CEO and president of the Dr Pepper/7-Up Company, W.W.

Answer the above question based on the context below: While driving his Dual-Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the \\"Italian\\" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.) Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino. That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out. He then spends the night with Polly.

The radio signal's electrical component induces a voltage in the conductor. This causes an electrical current to begin flowing in the direction of the signal's instantaneous field. When the resulting current reaches the end of the conductor, it reflects, which is equivalent to a 180 degree change in phase. If the conductor is 1⁄4 of a wavelength long, current from the feed point will undergo 90 degree phase change by the time it reaches the end of the conductor, reflect through 180 degrees, and then another 90 degrees as it travels back. That means it has undergone a total 360 degree phase change, returning it to the original signal. The current in the element thus adds to the current being created from the source at that instant. This process creates a standing wave in the conductor, with the maximum current at the feed. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What part of the radio signal creates voltage?","completion":"The part of the radio signal that creates voltage is the varying electric field component.

Read this article and answer this question The Raiders traveled to take on Washington on Sunday Night Football. Beginning a rough night for Derek Carr, on the second play of the game, Carr threw his first interception on the season. Washington took advantage of the turnover, driving 67 yards on eight plays as Kirk Cousins hit Chris Thompson on a 22-yard pass to give Washington the lead 7-0. The teams exchanged punts on each of their next three possessions, but the Raiders turned the ball over again with 10 minutes remaining in the second quarter when Carr was picked off for the second time in the game. Washington again took advantage, driving 72 yards and scoring their second touchdown on a Vernon Davis 18-yard touchdown catch. As a result, the Raiders trailed 14-0 at the half. The Raider offense was completely shut down in the first half, managing only 47 yards from scrimmage. Washington continued to dominate the Raiders in the second half, driving 75 yards on the opening possession and upping the lead to 21-0 on a Josh Doctson 52-yard touchdown catch. A punt by the Raiders followed and Washington missed a field goal attempt on their next possession as the score remained 21-0. On the Raiders next possession, they were forced to punt, but Jamison Crowder muffed the punt and the Raiders recovered at the Washington 18-yard line. Two plays later, Carr hit Jared Cook from 21 yards out to notch the Raiders first points and cutting the lead to 21-7. A Washington field goal moved the lead to 24-7 as the Raiders were forced to punt again. Following a fumble on the next Washington possession, the Raiders could not get into the end zone from the Washington 20 and were forced to settle for a Giorgio Tavecchio 22-yard field goal. Washington answered the field goal with their own to move the lead back to 17 at 27-10. Neither team could muster anything further as the Raiders fell 27-10. The loss moved the Raiders to 2-1 on the season. The disappointing performance was led by the Raider offense which went 0-11 on third down tries and managed only 128 total yards. Meanwhile, the Raider defense gave up 472 yards to Washington, 356 through the air.

Article: When I was a kid, I always used to wonder how in the world my father work outside in the winter without a coat. It could be minus 20 degrees centigrade and there'd be Dad, removing snow, or perhaps chopping some wood --- his coat thrown aside--- wearing a shirt , a cap, and a pair of gloves. \\"Aren't you cold, Dad?\\" I'd ask. \\"No,\\" Dad would reply. \\"I'm not cold--- working too hard to be cold.\\" Many times I wondered whether my father was an extremely tough man, or whether he was foolish. One time when I was quite young, perhaps five or so, I went ice fishing with Dad. It was a bright, clear day--and bitterly cold. After we'd been out on the ice for a little while, my feet started getting cold. \\"Daddy, my feet are cold.\\" I said. \\"Yeah, it's cold out here today,\\" he replied. \\"Tell you what,\\" he said. \\"Walk around. Make some circles in the snow. See how many different patterns you can make. That will get your feet warm.\\" Now, I was just a little girl at the time but I remember thinking, \\"How in the world will walking around in the snow make my feet warm? Dad must be out of mind. But he was my father, after all. I made circles in the snow. I made squares. Pretty soon I was having so much fun making patterns in the snow. I forgot about my feet being cold. Now, all these years later, I know, too, from personal experience how my father was able to take his coat off and work outside in the winter wearing just a shirt, a cap and gloves. Because I do it, too. \\"Aren't you cold?\\" my husband asked one winter day. \\"No,\\" I replied. \\"I'm not cold--working too hard to be cold.\\" I hope my husband has decided I'm both tough and smart. But I guess quite a bit of the time he thinks I'm foolish. Wherever Dad is in that great big farm in the sky--I'm sure he can't help but smile whenever I take my coat off while I'm working outside in the winter.

We have this equation: -605*a = 607*a - 1210*a - 24 First, we need to simplify the right side of the equation. We have 607*a and -1210*a: 607 apples - 1210 apples = -603 apples So now the equation looks like this: -605*a = -603*a - 24 Next, we want to move the -603*a from the right side to the left side of the equation. We do that by adding 603 apples to both sides: -605 apples + 603 apples = -603 apples + 603 apples - 24 Now it looks like this: -2*a = -24 Now we want to know how many apples we have if we divide them into 2 equal groups.

Sentence 1: To fall off a point. Sentence 2: They sailed south around the point. Does point mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the term \\"point\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. Essentially, the word \\"point\\" can be defined and interpreted in various ways depending on its context, and in these two sentences, it has been used in two vastly different contexts. In Sentence 1: \\"To fall off a point,\\" the word \\"point\\" could be interpreted in several ways depending on further context, but let's focus on two of the most common meanings. - \\"Point\\" could refer to a specific location or place, implying a physical location from which someone or something is falling off. In this sense, \\"point\\" could also refer to the edge or tip of a physical object. Falling off a point means that something or someone has fallen from a particular location or from the edge of something. - Another possible interpretation could be that \\"point\\" refers to a certain stage within a system or process. In such a context, \\"falling off a point\\" could mean the decline or decrease from that specified point or level. In Sentence 2: \\"They sailed south around the point,\\" the word \\"point\\" is used to refer to a geographic term. In geographical parlance, a 'point' often refers to a specific location on a map, usually the projecting point of land extending into the water, which could be a headland or a promontory. Here, 'point' could mean a specific landmark that sailors use for navigation. So, in these two sentences, the word \\"point\\" does not convey the same meaning. While it may refer to a specific place, stage, position, or level in Sentence 1, it refers to a geographical feature or place in Sentence 2. The difference in the usage of the term \\"point\\" in these sentences showcases how English words can carry multiple meanings depending on the context in which they're used."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

CHAPTER LXXIX The Wharton Wedding It was at last settled that the Wharton marriage should take place during the second week in June. There were various reasons for the postponement. In the first place Mary Wharton, after a few preliminary inquiries, found herself forced to declare that Messrs. Muddocks and Cramble could not send her forth equipped as she ought to be equipped for such a husband in so short a time. \\"Perhaps they do it quicker in London,\\" she said to Everett with a soft regret, remembering the metropolitan glories of her sister's wedding. And then Arthur Fletcher could be present during the Whitsuntide holidays; and the presence of Arthur Fletcher was essential. And it was not only his presence at the altar that was needed;--Parliament was not so exacting but that he might have given that;--but it was considered by the united families to be highly desirable that he should on this occasion remain some days in the country. Emily had promised to attend the wedding, and would of course be at Wharton for at least a week. As soon as Everett had succeeded in wresting a promise from his sister, the tidings were conveyed to Fletcher. It was a great step gained. When in London she was her own mistress; but surrounded as she would be down in Herefordshire by Fletchers and Whartons, she must be stubborn indeed if she should still refuse to be taken back into the flock, and be made once more happy by marrying the man whom she confessed that she loved with her whole heart. The letter to Arthur Fletcher containing the news was from his brother John, and was written in a very business-like fashion. \\"We have put off Mary's marriage a few days, so that you and she should be down here together. If you mean to go on with it, now is your time.\\" Arthur, in answer to this, merely said he would spend the Whitsuntide holidays at Longbarns. Answer the following questions: 1. What month is the wedding to occur? 2. Is it during the third week? 3. Is it happening on schedule? 4. Why not? 5. Who would be able to come now? 6. Who got married before her? 7.

They might steal someone else's idea for a science project, or copy a book report from the Internet and hand it in as if it's his or her work. Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who study for the test or who are the true winners of a game. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even though there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. A kid who thinks cheating is the only way to pass a test need to talk with the teacher or another grown-up. They can find some ways to help solve this problem. Talking about the problem and working it out will make him or her feel better than cheating. Kids who cheat may feel worried about getting caught. Whether they are caught or not, these kids may feel _ or embarrassed. Even if they feel fine or don't get caught, that doesn't mean it's OK.

Process: - Grass and small plants grow in an area - These plants die - The soil gains organic material - The soil becomes more fertile - Larger plants are able to be supported - Trees eventually grow. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less fertile soil happens, how will it affect soil becomes more fertile. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that there is a change in the soil fertility - in this case, it becomes less fertile. Step 2: Identify the factors affecting soil fertility Soil fertility is affected by the presence of organic material (from dead plants and other organisms), nutrients, water, and other factors. In this context, the fertility increase is mainly due to the addition of organic material from dead plants. Step 3: How less fertile soil affects the process If the soil becomes less fertile, this may lead to a reduction in the growth of grass and small plants, as they would have fewer nutrients and other necessary elements to support their growth. Step 4: Determine the direct effect of less fertile soil With fewer grasses and small plants growing, there would be less organic material added to the soil when they die. This could cause a negative feedback loop, where soil fertility is not increased as much due to the lower amount of organic material being added. Step 5: Determine indirect effects of less fertile soil In addition to the direct effect on soil fertility, less fertile soil might also indirectly affect other aspects of the ecosystem. For example, there may be less water retained in the soil for plant use, or beneficial microbes may not be as abundant. This could further reduce the ability of the soil to gain fertility. Step 6: Consider the impact on larger plants and trees If soil fertility is not increasing as much due to the perturbation, larger plants and trees may struggle to grow in the affected area. Without sufficient nutrients to support their growth, they may not be able to establish or compete successfully with other organisms. Step 7: Evaluate the perturbation hypothesis Based on the analysis, it appears that the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process. Less fertile soil would likely negatively affect the ability of the soil to become more fertile, both directly (through reduced organic material input) and indirectly (through other factors like water retention or microbial activity).

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... and the situation: Two neighboring farms used different farming methods. Hill farm used GMO seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Valley farm used only organic methods and non-GMO seeds. Answer the following question: Which farm will grow fewer crops with increased germlines? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Valley farm, which uses only organic methods and non-GMO seeds, will grow fewer crops with increased germlines. This is because Hill farm uses GMO seeds that have been genetically engineered to have desired germlines, such as increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance, and herbicide tolerance. These attributes can make GMO crops more productive and resilient compared to non-GMO crops."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – Sarah Burke's family has more than grief to deal with after her tragic death: The skier racked up more than half a million dollars in medical bills after her accident, CTV reports. The family has set up a website seeking donations to help—so far they've raised almost 125,000. It's unclear whether Burke had insurance to cover the kind of accident she suffered; the Canadian Freestyle Ski Association provided coverage for her, but only in CFSA-sanctioned events. Burke was injured during an event put on by her sponsor, Monster Energy.","completion":"Title: Sarah Burke's Family Faces Big Medical Bills After Tragic Accident Once upon a time, there was a very talented skier named Sarah Burke. She was really good at skiing and many people loved to watch her perform amazing tricks in the snow. But one day, Sarah had a very bad accident while she was skiing at an event. This made her family and friends very sad. When someone gets really hurt, they need to go to the hospital so that doctors and nurses can help them feel better. The hospital is a place where they can be taken care of and get better. And that's what happened to Sarah, too. She had to go to the hospital because of her accident. But going to the hospital can also cost a lot of money. Sarah's hospital bills added up to more than half a million dollars. This is a really big number, much bigger than the number of fingers and toes you have! Her family started to worry because they didn't have enough money to pay that big number. This is when something called insurance can help. Insurance is like a big piggy bank that people can use when they really need help with money. But sometimes, insurance doesn't cover everything. It's like having a piggy bank that only helps pay for certain toys, but not all the toys you want. In Sarah's case, her insurance was only going to help pay for some things, not everything. It turns out that her insurance from the Canadian Freestyle Ski Association would only help if her accident had happened at one of their events. Unfortunately, her accident happened at an event organized by a different group called Monster Energy. So, to help Sarah's family, they made a special website. This website was like a big sign saying, \\"Help us raise money to pay for Sarah's hospital bills!\\" And guess what? People cared about Sarah and her family, so they started giving money. So far, the family has been able to collect almost 125,000. This is a lot of money, but they still need more to pay that big number for the hospital. Sometimes, life can be very hard and sad. But when people come together to help each other, like they did for Sarah's family, it can make things a little easier. It shows us that even in tough times, people can support each other and spread love and kindness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. If you want to make the best possible impression on your customers, package the product elegantly (making sure it won't break during shipping), bring it to the post office, and ship it off. It's really as simple as that. Unfortunately, sometimes the customer isn't going to like what they bought. Make the return/exchange policy clear, but don't burn bridges by refusing a refund. Eating these refund costs will be a good business practice, and should keep your Amazon/eBay/Etsy ratings high. Cycle the feedback you get into making your products even better. Iterate on bad designs, negative interactions, or product flaws. Remember that the customer is always right, even when they aren't. It's one of the hardest parts of doing business, but it's one of the oldest rules in the book. If you treat your customers like undeserving bums, they'll feel like that. And while that may feel good after a brutal exchange, it certainly doesn't pad the wallet. In the beginning, it can be a good strategy to stay focused on one or two products, so that you get a hang of the process and don't spend too much time juggling pictures, descriptions, demographics, etc. After you've gotten a foothold in a market and developed confidence in an e-commerce platform (such as eBay), it could be profitable to start selling distinct, but related, products. If you're serious about making money, you'll want to look at your sales after a couple months and figure out how to increase them. Here are just a few ideas you can use: Negotiate better prices from wholesale. As you buy more in bulk, your power to negotiate goes up. Don't be afraid to use it! The wholesalers want your business. Look for recurring revenue sources. Think about ways you can ensure repeat business. Could email, snail mail, a subscription pack, or something else creative get you return business? Ask for help, or outsource. Could a few more pairs of hands and legs help you deliver more packages and increase the sales you make? Especially if you're only selling part-time, constant trips to the post office and regular time sunk into payment processing could be eating away at your profitability. Summary:","completion":"To make a good impression on customers, package your product nicely, make a clear return/exchange policy, and always be kind to customers. When you start selling online, focus on one or two products at first. To make more money, try negotiating better prices, finding ways to get repeat business, and asking for help or outsourcing tasks.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents.

A: Available options: *joints *ligaments *veins *tendons","completion":"Skeletal muscles are attached to bones by tendons. A tendon is a tough, flexible band of fibrous connective tissue that connects the skeletal muscles to bones. The tendons' primary function is to transmit the power generated by the contraction of the muscle to the bone to effect movement. Ligaments, on the other hand, connect bone to bone and helps stabilize joints. Veins transport deoxygenated blood from different parts of the body back to the heart. Hence, the correct answer is tendons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Besides a birthday and a couple dead parents, there wasn't much else we shared in common. She was an over-achiever and a bit of a kiss-ass, always trying to make mom and dad proud, which she seemed to pull off with ease. She was the girl in high school who played every sport, joined every club, ran the student council, and somehow still managed to pull A's without breaking a sweat. Intense doesn't even begin to describe her. I could never compete with that, so instead I decided to build an identity for myself as the rebel. Unfortunately, I somehow equated rebelling with turning into a giant asshole. We grew up in a middle-class suburban family. Our father was a teacher and our mother an architect. They were the kind of couple that kept a date night to go dancing every Friday for the 31 years they were married. They died when Jenny and I were twenty-two. We sold the house where we grew up and split the cash; neither of us wanted to set foot in it again. Jenny used the money to pay for her Master's. After school she went to work for James McPherson, one of the most powerful and richest men in the city. Aside from owning the St. Augustine, McPherson had interests in real estate, land development, venture capital, and other things I really should've known more about. The McPherson family was old money here going back to when this valley was nothing but orchards. If I said that at one time or another the McPherson family had owned every single square foot of land in our city, I'd probably be exaggerating - but not much. Jenny ran the McPhersons' charitable foundation, which basically meant that not only did they have so much money that they had to start giving it away, but they even had to hire someone else just to get rid of it for them. How structured was Jenny's life in school? A. not enough information B. She dropped out of school C. She had lots of free time D. Very structured A:","completion":"D.

Answer the following question: Process: - You breathe in - Diaphragm and other muscles expand to allow room for your lungs to fill - The air flows into the narrow bronchioles in the lungs - From the bronchioles to the alveoli - The oxygen enters into the bloodstream - Is switched with the carbon dioxide in the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide enters through the alveoli - Through the narrow bronchioles - Into the lungs - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body. Question: suppose the river flows weaker happens, how will it affect less oxygen is taken into the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If the question is referring to a situation where the air flow (like river flow) becomes weaker, it could lead to less oxygen being taken into the body. In this case, the perturbation's influence on the second effect mentioned, which is the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide, can be examined in detail. A weaker air flow means that there might not be a sufficient amount of oxygen reaching the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. As a result, the concentration of oxygen in the alveoli could be lower than usual, which may affect the rate at which oxygen diffuses across the respiratory membrane and binds to the hemoglobin in red blood cells. This reduced rate of diffusion could lead to an overall decrease in the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Consequently, less oxygen would be available for cells to use during aerobic respiration, which might limit their ability to produce energy efficiently. This could directly impact metabolism and various physiological processes that depend on oxygen, such as cellular repair and regeneration, detoxification, and the immune response. This perturbation would also impact the exchange of carbon dioxide. With less oxygen being taken up by the blood, there might be less carbon dioxide being removed from the bloodstream in the alveoli and expelled when we exhale. This could lead to a buildup of carbon dioxide in the bloodstream, which may result in respiratory acidosis, a condition that arises from too much carbon dioxide in the body, and consequent disruption of the blood's acid-base balance. To summarize, a weaker air flow, in this case, could lead to a less efficient gas exchange, potentially affecting both oxygen uptake and carbon dioxide removal. This perturbation could thus have a negative effect on overall health and physiological processes, as less oxygen would be available for cellular functions and more carbon dioxide could accumulate in the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate. - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Tennessee General Assembly is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Tennessee.

Electrical circuit: An electrical circuit is a path of electrical elements that allow the flow of electricity. It is clearly unrelated to the concept of colleges, so we can eliminate this option. 2. Big town: A big town is a moderately populated urban area. Based on population and available resources, it is plausible for a big town to have more than one college. This is a suitable answer. 3. Big city: A big city is a densely populated urban area, usually with a higher population than a big town. It is highly likely that a big city has more than one college, due to its size and resource availability. This is also a suitable answer. 4. Building: A building is a structure with walls and a roof, serving various purposes such as residential, commercial, or industrial use. While it's possible for a single building to be home to more than one college or educational facilities, it is not inherently related to the number of colleges. It is less suitable than a big town or big city. 5.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Two colleagues read about types of chemical reactions. Sean studied about the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. Gabe studied about other influencing factors. and a hint : Raising the temperature of a chemical reaction usually results in a higher rate of reaction. When the reactant particles are heated, they move faster and faster. This results in a greater frequency of collisions. A more important effect of the temperature increase is that the collisions occur with a greater force and are thus more likely to surmount the activation energy barrier and go on to form products. Increasing the temperature of a reaction increases the number of effective collisions between reacting particles, so the reaction rate increases. Please answer this question : Which student read less about the activation energy barrier? Answer:","completion":"Gabe read less about the activation energy barrier. Justification: From the given information, we know that Sean studied the influence of temperature on chemical reactions. The hint provided explicitly links temperature increases to the activation energy barrier, and how it affects reaction rates. Since Sean's focus was on temperature, he likely encountered information about the activation energy barrier.

Not only is it unable to see, but because it cannot receive the visual stimulus from its environment that a sighted child does, it is likely to be slow in intellectual development. Now the ten-month old son of Dr. and Mrs. Dennis Daughters is the subject of an unusual psychological experiment designed to prevent a lag in the learning process. With the aid of a sonar-type electronic that he wears on his head, infant Dennis is learning to identify the people and objects in the world around him by means of echoes . The device is an improvement of the \\"Sonicguide\\", an instrument produced by Telesensory Systems, Inc., of Palo Alto, Calif, and used by blind adults in addition to a smart or guide dog. As adapted for Dennis, it consists of a battery-powered system about the size of a half dollar that is on a headgear. A transmitter sends out an ultrasonic pulse that creates an 80 degree cone of sound at 6 feet. Echoes from objects within the cone are perceived (felt) as sounds that vary in pitch and volume with the size and distance of the object. The closer an object is, the lower the pitch, and the larger the object, the louder the signal. Hard surfaces produce a sharp ping, while soft ones send back signals with a slightly fuzzy quality. An object slightly to the right of Denny's sends back a louder sound to his right ear than to the left. Thus , by simply moving his head right and left and up and down, he can not only locate an object but also get some notion of its shape and size, thanks to the varying qualities of sounds reaching his ears as the cone of ultrasound passes _ . Dennis likes to use the device to play a kind of peek-a-boo with his mother. Standing on her knee and facing her directly, he receives a strong signal in both ears. By turning his head away, he makes her seem to disappear. \\"From the first time he wore it,\\" says Mrs. Daughters, \\"it was like a light going on in his head.\\" What remains to be determined is how well the device will help Dennis cope with...

Does the sentence \\"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece was very influential in this regard, as were Robert Wood's Palmyra and Baalbec.\\" answer the question \\"What direction did British architecture go in mid 18th century?\\"","completion":"While the provided sentence does offer some insight into the architectural influences during the mid-18th century in Britain, it does not explicitly answer the question, \\"What direction did British architecture go in mid-18th century?\\" To adequately answer that question, it is necessary to delve deeper into the broader architectural climate in Britain around that time and examine how the mentioned works contributed to shaping those trends. The mid-18th century in Britain corresponds to a period known as the Georgian era (1714-1830), named after the reigns of Kings George I-IV. Architecturally, this period was marked by a departure from the earlier, more opulent Baroque style, which featured grand ornamentation, in favor of more symmetrical and restrained designs rooted in classical antiquity. This architectural shift was part of a broader cultural movement known as Neoclassicism, which emphasized the rediscovery and emulation of Greco-Roman art, architecture, and principles. In this context, the publication of works such as \\"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece\\" and Robert Wood's \\"Palmyra and Baalbec\\" played a significant role in driving change in British architectural styles. \\"The Antiquities of Athens,\\" authored by James Stuart and Nicholas Revett, was published in four volumes between 1762 and 1816. This work provided architects and designers with accurate drawings of ancient Greek buildings, columns, and pediments, which supplemented the understanding of Classical Greek architecture. Moreover, it also played a crucial role in popularizing Greek Revival architecture in Britain. Robert Wood's \\"Palmyra and Baalbec,\\" published in 1753, documented the detailed measurements and illustrations of ancient ruins in Palmyra, Syria, and Baalbec, Lebanon. The focus on these ancient architectural masterpieces, which blended Greco-Roman and Oriental styles, contributed to the growing fascination with and appreciation for classical principles. These books, along with other influential publications like Giovanni Battista Piranesi's etchings of ancient Rome, helped to create a fascination with returning to more classical architectural features. As a result, British architects of the mid-18th century began incorporating Neoclassical elements into their designs. Buildings from this period typically featured characteristics such as symmetrical facades, columns with classical orders (Doric, Ionic, or Corinthian), pediments, and minimal ornamentation, allowing for a more refined and harmonious appearance. Examples of Georgian architecture with Neoclassical influences include London's Somerset House, Syon House in West London, and the Royal Crescent and Circus in Bath. To summarize, the direction in which British architecture went in the mid-18th century was mainly towards Neoclassicism, characterized by a renewed appreciation for classical antiquity and a more restrained and elegant style. Works like \\"The Antiquities of Athens and Other Monuments of Greece\\" and Robert Wood's \\"Palmyra and Baalbec\\" were very influential in disseminating knowledge about ancient architectural styles and promoting this shift to Neoclassical architecture in Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy can be very frightening. If you are experiencing these symptoms and are feeling really overwhelmed or panicked, take a few moments to breathe deeply. Remind yourself that it's okay to feel scared or upset, and that what you are experiencing now will pass. The best thing you can do is get to the doctor as soon as possible so that they can figure out what is going on and give you appropriate treatment. If you suspect an ectopic pregnancy, whether or not you've already had a positive pregnancy test, get to a doctor or emergency room as soon as possible. An ectopic pregnancy can become life-threatening quickly if left untreated. Your doctor will have a better chance of diagnosing you correctly if you can give them a clear description of your symptoms. Let them know how long you have had the symptoms and whether they appeared gradually or suddenly. Provide as many details as possible. For example, if you are experiencing pain, describe the location, type, and intensity of the pain. You might say, “I got a sudden, sharp pain in my pelvis about an hour ago, and it hasn't gone away.” In addition to asking about your current symptoms, the doctor may want to know details about your overall health and any recent history that might be related to your symptoms. They may ask about: The date of your last period. Whether your last period was unusual in any way. Any previous pregnancies. Whether you are sexually active or trying to conceive. What type(s) of birth control you are using, if any. Whether you have had in vitro fertilization. Your previous history of serious health conditions, if any. Any medications you are currently taking. A pelvic exam is usually the first step in diagnosing an ectopic pregnancy. Your doctor will check for any particular areas of pain or tenderness and feel for obvious masses. At the same time, they will check to see if there are any other visible causes of your symptoms. While your doctor will not be able to definitively diagnose an ectopic pregnancy based on a pelvic exam alone, this exam can help narrow down the most likely causes of your symptoms. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy based on the pelvic exam, they may wish to run lab tests to check your hCG and progesterone (pregnancy hormone) levels. Unusual pregnancy hormone levels can be a good indicator of ectopic pregnancy. Your doctor may draw some blood or ask you to provide a urine sample for testing. If your doctor suspects an ectopic pregnancy, they will probably recommend an immediate vaginal ultrasound. Your doctor or an ultrasound technician will insert a small device into your vagina to perform the ultrasound and look for evidence of an ectopic pregnancy. Occasionally, it may be too early for an ectopic pregnancy to show on an ultrasound. If this is the case, your doctor may monitor your condition and repeat the ultrasound at a later date. An ectopic pregnancy is usually clearly visible on an ultrasound by 4-5 weeks after the date of conception. In some cases, your doctor may wish to perform a culdocentesis. This test can help determine whether you have a ruptured fallopian tube. In culdocentesis, a needle is inserted into the top of the vagina to check for the presence of blood behind the uterus and above the rectum. If your symptoms are severe enough (e.g., if you are bleeding heavily), your emergency medical team may decide there is no time for diagnostic testing. In these situations, the best option may be emergency surgery to locate and treat the source of the problem as quickly as possible.","completion":"The article provides guidance on recognizing and seeking medical help for suspected ectopic pregnancy, emphasizing the importance of providing detailed symptoms and undergoing diagnostic tests to ensure appropriate treatment and prevent life-threatening complications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: How can I sell my last 786 digits in currency note? - This question is asking for a method to sell the last three digits (786) of a currency note. - It does not specify any particular currency or note denomination, so it could apply to any note with the last three digits being 786. Question 2: How much I can earn by auctioning my 20 Rupees note which ends with 786? - This question asks for an estimation of earnings after auctioning a specific note, which is 20 Rupees with the last three digits being 786. - The auction aspect implies that the value of the note might be determined by bidding, meaning that the final value could be higher or lower than the face value. - In this question, the currency is specified (Rupees) and the denomination of the note is mentioned (20 Rupees).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Before purchasing, check the expiration date on the package. Then, before use, make sure you also check the expiration date printed on the condom wrapper. If it’s expired, toss it out. Never use an expired condom. It could tear or fail. Check out the wrapper for any signs of obvious rips or tears. If the package is torn or ripped, toss the condom out and use a new one. Female condoms are polyurethane or nitrile pouches with flexible rings at each end that you insert into the vagina or anus. They collect pre-cum and semen, preventing pregnancy and reducing the transmission of STDs. Female condoms don’t protect women during oral sex. For that, you will need to use a dental dam, or a condom that is cut open. Don’t use a female condom and a male condom at the same time. It doesn’t provide twice the protection — in fact, it can cause breakage in either or both condoms. These are the zig-zag edges on either side of the wrapper that are designed to tear apart quickly and easily. Don't get carried away in your passion. Don't shred open the package, and stay away from scissors, teeth, machetes, or any other sharp instrument to open a condom wrapper, or you could tear the condom itself! A torn condom won’t protect against pregnancy or STDs. Female condoms are more expensive than male condoms, at about 4 apiece. Many women find it easy to stand with a foot on a chair, lie down, squat, or raise one leg up. You’ll find out what works best for you with a little practice. Female condoms have a flexible ring at each end. One end will be closed, a lot like a male condom. Pinch the ring at the closed end of the condom with your thumb and middle finger so it narrows. The open end should be hanging down. If you’ve used tampons before, this is the same process. Squeezing the ring to keep it narrow, insert the closed end of the condom as far as it will go. Insert your index finger into the condom and push it gently into your vagina. Be very careful if you have long nails — tearing the condom will render it ineffective. You should feel it meet resistance at some point. That’s a sign you’ve reached your cervix. Make sure the condom is not twisted inside your vagina. If you’ve inserted the condom correctly, the outer ring should be hanging about an inch outside your vagina. It is possible to use the same method to insert a female condom into your anus for anal sex; however, the easiest way is to remove the inner ring and place the female condom on the penis (or sex toy). The penis is then inserted into the anus. Regardless of what’s going into your vagina (or anus), adding some lubricant will help reduce friction. This makes it less likely for the condom to tear. Because female condoms are made from polyurethane or nitrile (a synthetic latex) and not latex, it is safe to use oil-based, water-based, or silicon-based lube with a female condom. It’s important to use your hand to guide the penis or sex toy inside you so that it doesn’t end up sliding outside the condom pouch. You should stop having sex immediately, remove the condom, and insert a new female condom if any of these things happen: The condom slips The penis or sex toy enters your vagina (or anus) outside the condom pouch during sex The outer ring of the condom enters the vagina You may wish to consider using emergency contraception (the morning-after pill) if your partner has ejaculated inside your vagina, on the vaginal opening, or if semen drips from the anus onto the vaginal opening. Squeeze the outer ring closed with two fingers. Gently slide the condom out of your vagina or anus. Don’t yank or tug on it, as this could break the condom. discreetly. Tie the open end in a knot to prevent spillage. Wrap it in toilet paper or tissue, and throw it in a trash can. Don’t flush condoms down the toilet. Most septic systems can’t handle them, and they may clog up the toilet. Don’t reuse female condoms.

Please answer the following question: Question: how does gilgamesh consequently view his immortality I found the following answer on Google: Nevertheless, Gilgamesh's fame lived on after his death, because of his great building projects, and his account of what Utnapishtim told him happened during the flood. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the statement you found on Google is partially correct in addressing how Gilgamesh views his immortality. However, there is much more depth to Gilgamesh's perspective on immortality that needs to be considered. The Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known literary works, revolves around the story of Gilgamesh, the King of Uruk, searching for immortality. Throughout the epic, Gilgamesh is portrayed as a strong and determined hero who nevertheless also struggles with the reality of his mortality. At the beginning of the story, Gilgamesh is marked by his arrogance and oppressive rule over the people of Uruk. He is considered two-thirds god and one-third human, which makes him almost but not completely immortal. He believes that his demigod status entitles him to immortality. However, his life takes a significant turn when he becomes friends with Enkidu, a wild man created by the gods to rival Gilgamesh. Through the course of their adventures and friendship, Gilgamesh becomes kinder and more empathetic. When Enkidu dies, Gilgamesh is deeply affected by the loss and is struck by the inevitability of his own mortality. Consequently, he embarks on a quest to find Utnapishtim, the one human who achieved immortality after surviving the great flood, to learn the secret of eternal life. After overcoming numerous challenges and trials, Gilgamesh finally reaches Utnapishtim, who tells him the story of the flood and explains that the gods granted him immortality as a unique gift for surviving. Utnapishtim presents Gilgamesh with a test to achieve immortality - to stay awake for six days and seven nights. Gilgamesh ultimately fails this test. However, on his return journey to Uruk, Gilgamesh gains valuable insights into the nature of life and the importance of leaving a lasting legacy. He eventually comes to terms with his mortality, recognizing that he cannot achieve physical immortality. Instead, he refocuses his energies on building great structures and stories about his deeds, thus ensuring that his name and accomplishments live on in the memory of future generations. So, while it is accurate to say that Gilgamesh's fame lives on after his death through his building projects and stories, it is also essential to highlight his internal journey through which he comes to accept the reality of his mortality and discovers a different kind of immortality, one rooted in the impact he leaves behind. Overall, Gilgamesh's view of immortality evolves from a desire for eternal life to an acceptance of leaving a lasting legacy as the true immortality that can be achieved by humans."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prior to creating the Asterix series, Goscinny and Uderzo had previously had success with their series Oumpah-pah, which was published in Tintin (magazine) magazine. Astérix was originally serialised in Pilote magazine, debuting in the first issue on 29 October 1959. In 1961 the first book was put together, titled Asterix the Gaul. From then on, books were released generally on a yearly basis. Their success was exponential; the first book sold 6,000 copies in its year of publication; a year later, the second sold 20,000. In 1963, the third sold 40,000; the fourth, released in 1964, sold 150,000. A year later, the fifth sold 300,000; 1966s Asterix and the Big Fight sold 400,000 upon initial publication. The ninth Asterix volume, when first released in 1967, sold 1.2 million copies in two days. How many more of the fifth book sold than the fourth and third?","completion":"To determine how many more of the fifth book sold than the fourth and third, we first need to find the difference in sales between the fifth and the fourth book, and then the difference between the fifth and the third book. The fifth book sold 300,000 copies, while the fourth book sold 150,000 copies. Difference between fifth and fourth book sales: 300,000 - 150,000 = 150,000 The third book sold 40,000 copies. Difference between fifth and third book sales: 300,000 - 40,000 = 260,000 Now, add both differences to find how many more of the fifth book sold than the fourth and third: 150,000 + 260,000 = 410,000 So, 410,000 more copies of the fifth book were sold than the fourth and third books combined."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a 0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \\"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\\" Spy thought \\"some subterfuge\\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \\"short-fingered vulgarian.\\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for 1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for 0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for 0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump.

The magazine's intention was to put to the test the idea that every person has a price, no matter how small. By cashing the checks for minuscule amounts, these celebrities demonstrated that they were willing to go to the effort of depositing insignificant amounts of money, possibly for the sake of being thrifty or just taking advantage of any financial opportunity presented to them.

Article: Hanover was founded in medieval times on the east bank of the River Leine. Its original name Honovere may mean \\"high (river)bank\\", though this is debated (cf. das Hohe Ufer). Hanover was a small village of ferrymen and fishermen that became a comparatively large town in the 13th century due to its position at a natural crossroads. As overland travel was relatively difficult, its position on the upper navigable reaches of the river helped it to grow by increasing trade. It was connected to the Hanseatic League city of Bremen by the Leine, and was situated near the southern edge of the wide North German Plain and north-west of the Harz mountains, so that east-west traffic such as mule trains passed through it. Hanover was thus a gateway to the Rhine, Ruhr and Saar river valleys, their industrial areas which grew up to the southwest and the plains regions to the east and north, for overland traffic skirting the Harz between the Low Countries and Saxony or Thuringia.

Review: like a travel-agency video Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"To determine if the given movie review sentence is negative or positive, let's analyze the language and context. Step 1: Analyze the language of the sentence The sentence states the movie is \\"like a travel-agency video.\\" In isolation, this phrase does not inherently carry negative or positive connotations, as it could be interpreted as a compliment (vibrant visuals and engaging content) or a critique (boring, uninspired visuals and content).
