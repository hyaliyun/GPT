Practice meditation: Meditation is known to encourage a person to slow down and pay more attention to their surroundings rather than being absorbed in their thoughts. A simple way to meditate is by sitting or lying down in a comfortable position and then observing your thoughts as they come and go. Rather than engaging with the thoughts - just allow them to flow in and drift away. This can take some practice, and it's normal to find it tricky at first, but it is very effective for becoming more present. 2. Engage your senses: Our mind is a great tool that allows us to solve problems and be creative, but we also have other ways of experiencing the world around us. Our senses can be a great portal into the present moment, as they help us to shift our focus out of our minds. To do this, you can try asking yourself questions such as: \\"How does my clothing feel on my body?\\" or \\"What sounds can I hear in the distance?\\" 3. Take a break from social media: When you're scrolling through your feed on social media, you're constantly either thinking about the past or the future. The videos and photos on these platforms are all from the past, which makes it hard to be present. Pausing social media usage and instead using tools like a mindfulness journal will make it easier to shift your focus to the present moment rather than being constantly distracted."},{"prompt":"Give me the recipe for chicken pot pie soup.

Include funnel automation, email marketing, using Get Response as an example, and social media scheduler using Planoly and later as examples.","completion":"Why should a small business invest in automation? Most online business owners start out using low-cost tools with limited features. For example, you might be using PayPal exclusively for product sales and manually adding buyers to your mailing list each time you receive payment. While that’s an acceptable solution when time is easier to come by than money, you’ll quickly outgrow it. The problem is too many entrepreneurs fail to recognize the benefits of true automation. Not only is trying to “make do” with a pieced-together system costing you sales, but it costs actual dollars, too. You (or your VA) will spend extra time simply getting it all to work rather than letting the tools do the heavy lifting. Recognize when it’s time to uplevel your marketing tools to include true funnel automation and watch your income increase dramatically! Automation comes in many forms; whether it’s an email marketing system like Get Response, a social media scheduler like Planoly or Later, or anything else you can automate, this is a huge time saver."},{"prompt":"What time is my meeting with Mr. Johnson today?","completion":"What a beautiful day to have a meeting!

Blood-based biomarkers hold great promise to revolutionize the diagnostic and prognostic work-up of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in clinical practice. This is very timely, considering the recent development of anti-amyloid-β (Aβ) immunotherapies. Several assays for measuring phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in plasma exhibit high diagnostic accuracy in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in patients with cognitive impairment. Prognostic models based on plasma p-tau levels can also predict future development of AD dementia in patients with mild cognitive complaints. The use of such high-performing plasma p-tau assays in the clinical practice of specialist memory clinics would reduce the need for more costly investigations involving cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. Indeed, blood-based biomarkers already facilitate identification of individuals with pre-symptomatic AD in the context of clinical trials. Longitudinal measurements of such biomarkers will also improve the detection of relevant disease-modifying effects of new drugs or lifestyle interventions.","completion":"Researchers have found that certain substances in our blood can tell us a lot about Alzheimer's disease (AD). These substances, called blood-based biomarkers, have the potential to completely revolutionize how we diagnose and predict the progression of AD in clinical practice. Currently, there are new treatments being developed for AD that target a protein called amyloid-beta (Aβ). Blood tests can now measure another protein called phosphorylated tau (p-tau) in our blood. These tests are very accurate in distinguishing AD from all other neurodegenerative diseases in people with cognitive problems. By checking the levels of p-tau in the blood, doctors can also predict if someone with mild memory problems will develop AD dementia later on. This helps them identify people who are at risk of getting the disease early on and potentially intervene with treatments before the disease progresses. Using these blood tests in specialized memory clinics would reduce the need for expensive tests like cerebrospinal fluid samples or positron emission tomography. These blood-based biomarkers are already being used in clinical trials to find people who have very early AD, before they even have symptoms. In the future, regularly measuring these blood biomarkers over time will help doctors and researchers see if new treatments or lifestyle changes are helping to slow down or stop AD."},{"prompt":"What should I do today?","completion":"Lounge around, bathe, or play with your toys."},{"prompt":"Sounds relaxing.","completion":"Yes, we need plenty of time for the good things in life."},{"prompt":"Do you do whatever you want all day?","completion":"I do!"},{"prompt":"Write a short passage in 250 words about Sophie.

She waited a moment, holding back until the tide had died down enough that she didn't fear being flung overboard. Sophie gazed around her. The docks of Dimsdale were certainly smaller than the one in Grimsby had been, but it seemed to be just as busy. People bustled around as they went about their day and seagulls called loudly as they flew in lazy circles. The fishing boats had already docked and fishmongers yelled about their wares as housewives bustled around in groups and droves, inspecting wares and haggling prices. She stepped off of the plank leading down to the dock and followed the flow of people toward where the luggage was being unloaded. Sophie only had one suitcase that held all her worldly belongings and she had it in her hands. But unsure of what she was supposed to be doing, she waited as passengers called out descriptions of their baggage and the porters hurried to bring them forth. A small crowd had formed near the end of the docks, close to where the fish market had opened. Perhaps it was because Sophie had been at sea for so long, but the smell of fish wasn't overwhelming. She rummaged around in her coin purse and felt for the scant few shillings she had.

They include a bronze container for human remains and a set of human and animal figures carved from marble. However, the most extraordinary is a rare Eid Mar coin celebrating the assassination of Roman politician Julius Caesar. The coin's front features an image of Roman Senator Marcus Brutus. He and his brother-in-law, Cassius Longinus, plotted to kill Caesar in 44 BCE. The back of the coin has a cap flanked by two daggers. The cap was similar to the one given to formerly enslaved people. The daggers represent the weapons used to kill Caesar. The words EID MAR are engraved below. Latin for \\"Ides of March,\\" they correspond with March 15 on the Roman calendar. This was the date Caesar was killed. Brutus minted the coin in 42 BCE to celebrate Caesar's death and to pay his soldiers. Only three of the gold Eid Mar coins are known to exist today.

Her journey began in a Chinese brothel, where she worked as a prostitute. However, fate had grander plans for her. In 1801, she married Cheng I, a formidable corsair, and together they forged one of China's most powerful pirate armies. Their fleet consisted of hundreds of ships and boasted a staggering 50,000 men. With audacity, they pillaged fishing vessels, supply junks, and coastal villages in Southern China. Tragedy struck when Cheng I met his demise in 1807. Seizing the opportunity, Mrs. Cheng maneuvered her way into power and formed an alliance with Chang Pao, a trusted lieutenant, and lover. The duo embarked on a spree of plunder across Southeast Asia, amassing a fleet that rivaled the navies of many nations. Not content with mere piracy, Mrs. Cheng established a strict code of conduct for her pirates. Any violation, such as the rape of female prisoners, warranted beheading, while deserters faced the punishment of having their ears severed. Her brutal reign earned Mrs. Cheng the title of public enemy number one in the eyes of the Chinese government. In 1810, the British and Portuguese navies were enlisted to capture her and bring her to justice. Rather than engage in a treacherous sea battle, Mrs. Cheng displayed her cunning. She negotiated the surrender of her fleet and relinquished her cutlass in exchange for the preservation of her ill-gotten riches. Retiring as one of history's most triumphant pirates, she later ran a gambling house until her death in 1844 at the age of 69."},{"prompt":"I'm writing an article about dogs on TV and in movies.

The Enneagram is a model of human pschology based on nine interconnected personality types. Its ideas are said to be found as long ago as the 4th Century, in the work of a Christian Mystic called Evagrius Ponticus, but the contemporary theories have been developed by various academics since the 1950s. Below you can find succinct summaries of Enneagram personality types to inspire and inform character development - including both the positive and the negative. Scroll down to see the information in a colourful infographic. 1. Reformer The Reformer is sometimes also known as the Perfectionist. They are idealists who set high standards for themselves and those around them and judge failure harshly. They focus on right and wrong, and tend to be direct, precise and honest. Others may find them preachy and closed minded. They believe in repressing their less virtuous desires. 2. Helper Helpers believe in giving and focus strongly on their relationships with others. This means they can be caring and supporting and go out of their way to help others, but some people might find this assistance crosses the line into meddling and intrusiveness. They are open and expressive, and genuinely listen, but they may end up nagging or resentful if their advice isn’t heeded. 3. Achiever The Achiever measures their worth by their goals and accomplishments. They work hard and enjoy a fast-pace, but they may step on other people’s feelings in their race to the top and can be impatient and preoccupied with their image. They focus on the topic at hand and get straight to the point with enthusiasm, but they can be overly efficient and override other’s views. 4. Individualist Individualists are romantics at heart. They are the dramatic artists, the poets, in search of a unique and ideal love. They feel things deeply and are empathetic and genuine but they can be moody and self-absorbed. Individualists have a flair for originality and take things personally. Others might find a them a bit intense and they may be prone to envy. 5.

Mosquitoes bite, suck your blood, and leave you with itchy bumps and possibly a horrible infection. Mosquito-borne pathogens include malaria, West Nile virus, Zika virus, Chikungunya virus, and dengue. While you might fantasize about living in a mosquito-free world, eradicating them would actually be disastrous for the environment. Adult mosquitoes are food for other insects, birds, and bats, while larval mosquitoes support aquatic ecosystems. The best we can hope for is to limit their ability to transmit disease, repel them, and kill them within the confines of our yards and homes. Mosquito-killing products bring in the big bucks, so it should come as no surprise that there is a wealth of misinformation out there. Before you get sucked into buying a product that simply won't work, get educated about what does and does not kill these blood-sucking pests. First, you need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and killing them. Repellents make a location (like your yard or skin) less attractive to mosquitoes, but don't kill them. So, citronella, DEET, smoke, lemon eucalyptus, lavender, and tea tree oil might keep the insects at bay, but won't control them or get rid of them in the long run. Repellents vary in effectiveness, too. For example, while citronella may deter mosquitoes from entering a small, enclosed area, it doesn't really work in a wide open space (like your back yard). There are a host of methods that actually do kill mosquitoes, but aren't great solutions. A classic example is a bug zapper, which kills only a few mosquitoes, yet attracts and kills beneficial insects that keep the mozzy population down. Similarly, spraying pesticides is not an ideal solution because mosquitoes can become resistant to them, other animals get poisoned, and the toxins can cause lasting environmental damage. Many species of mosquitoes required standing water to breed, so one of the most effective methods of controlling them is to remove open containers and repair leaks. Dumping containers of standing water kills the larvae living in them before they get a chance to mature. However, removing water may be undesirable or impractical in some cases. Further, some species don't even need standing water to reproduce! The Aedes species, responsible for transmitting Zika and dengue, lays eggs out of water. These eggs remain viable for months, ready to hatch when sufficient water becomes available. A better solution is to introduce predators that eat immature or adult mosquitoes or infectious agents that harm mosquitoes without affecting other wildlife. Most ornamental fish consume mosquito larvae, including koi and minnows. Lizards, geckos, dragonfly adults and naiads, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans all eat mosquitoes. Adult mosquitoes are susceptible to infection by the fungi Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauveria bassiana. A more practical infectious agent is the spores of the soil bacterium Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis (BTI),. Infection with BTI makes the larvae unable to eat, causing them to die. BTI pellets are readily available at home and gardening stores, easy to use (simply add them to standing water), and only affect mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. The treated water remains safe for pets and wild animals to drink. The disadvantages of BTI are that it requires reapplication every week or two and it doesn't kill adult mosquitos. There are several chemical methods that target mosquitoes without the risks to other animals that come with spraying pesticides. Some methods rely on chemical attractants to lure mosquitoes to their doom. Mosquitoes are attracted to carbon dioxide, sugary scents, heat, lactic acid, and octenal. Gravid females (those carrying eggs) may be attracted to traps laced with a hormone released during the egg-laying process. The lethal ovitrap is dark, water-filled container, typically with a small opening to prevent larger animals from drinking the water. Some traps use chemicals to bait the traps, while others simply provide a convenient breeding ground. The traps may be filled with predators (e.g., fish) or with dilute pesticide to kill larvae (larvicide) and sometimes adults. These traps are highly effective and affordable. The disadvantage is that multiple traps must be used to cover an area (about one every 25 feet). Another chemical method is the use of an insect growth regulator (IGR), added to water to inhibit larval development. The most common IGR is methoprene, which is supplied as a time-release brick. While effective, methoprene has been shown to be mildly toxic to other animals. Adding a layer of oil or kerosene to water kills mosquito larvae and also prevents females from depositing eggs. The layer alters the surface tension of the water. Larvae can't get their breathing tube to the surface for air, so they suffocate. However, this method kills other animals in the water and makes the water unfit for consumption. One example of a physical method of killing mosquitoes is swatting them with your hand, a fly-swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works if you've only got a few mosquitoes, but it's not particularly helpful if you're being swarmed. While bug zappers aren't ideal outdoors because they can unnecessarily kill beneficial insects, electrocuting indoor insects isn't generally considered objectionable. Just remember, you need to bait a bug zapper to attract mosquitoes, because they don't care about the pretty blue light. Because mosquitoes are not strong fliers, it's also easy to suck them onto a screen or into a separate trap using a fan. Mosquitoes caught using a fan die from dehydration. Screen-traps may be made at home by fastening window screening fabric over the back of a fan.","completion":"Ah, mosquitoes, those little bloodsuckers with a knack for leaving itchy bumps and the potential for a full-blown infection. What a delight! We all dream of a world free from these buzzing nuisances, but believe it or not, getting rid of them would be a total disaster for the environment. You see, adult mosquitoes are like fast food for other insects, birds, and bats. They're the all-you-can-eat buffet for the insect world! And let's not forget about the larval mosquitoes. They play a crucial role in supporting aquatic ecosystems. So, as much as we despise them, the best we can do is limit their disease-spreading abilities, repel them, and kill them within the comfort of our yards and home. Now, brace yourself, because mosquito-killing products are a gold mine. And where there's money to be made, there's bound to be a plethora of misinformation. Don't fall victim to the charade of useless products! It's time to get educated on what works against these bloodthirsty critters. First things first, we need to understand the difference between repelling mosquitoes and straight-up obliterating them. Repellants, like citronella, DEET, and all those fancy-sounding oils, make your location [like your yard or your skin] less enticing to mosquitoes. But let's get real here, they won't kill the little buggers or solve the problem in the long run. It's like trying to keep your annoying neighbour at bay with a strongly scented candle. It might work for a while, but eventually, they'll come back, uninvited and ready to ruin your evening. Now, for methods that claim to kill mosquitoes. Brace yourselves for disappointment because they aren't all that great. Take big zappers, for example. Sure, they'll fry a few mosquitoes, but they'll also take down some beneficial insects that help keep the mosquito population in check. Oops, collateral damage. And let's not forget about spraying pesticides. Sure, it sounds like a solid plan, but mosquitoes can quickly become resistant to these chemicals, Plus, another innocent creature ends up getting poisoned, and the long-term environmental damage is no joke. So, unless you're aiming to create a mutant army of super mosquitoes, let's skip the pesticide party. Now, here's a tip that actually works. Many mosquitoes breed in standing water, so removing open containers and fixing leaks is an effective way to control them. It's like hitting the nursery where it hurts! Dumping the water-filled mosquito cribs kills the larvae before they have the chance to mature and ruin your summer nights. But it isn't always that simple. Some mosquitoes are so crafty that they don't even need standing water to reproduce. Take the Aedes species, responsible for Zika and dengue, for example. These little troublemakers lay eggs outside of water, just waiting for the perfect opportunity to hatch. They're like spy agents of the mosquito world. So, what can we do? Well, how about unleashing the power of nature? Introduce predators that feast on immature or adult mosquitoes. We're talking about lizards, geckos, dragonflies, frogs, bats, spiders, and crustaceans. It's like assembling a superhero team to battle the forces of evil [or in this case, itchy bumps and diseases. We can infect those bloodsuckers with fungi, bacteria, and other agents that make them regret ever messing with us. For example, adult mosquitoes can fall victim to fungi like Metarhizium anisoplilae and Beauverua bassiana. Talk about a fungal infection they'll never forget! and if you prefer something more practical, try infecting them with Bacillus thurigiensis israelensis [BTI], a bacterium that ruins their appetite and leads them to demise. It's like serving them a deadly dinner they won't be able to resist. Now, let's talk about chemical warfare against mosquitoes, minus the risks to other innocent critters. Some clever methods use chemical attractants to lure mosquitos to their demise. It's like setting up a mosquito trap disguised as a five-star restaurant, complete with irresistible delicacies. And have you heard of lethal ovitrap? It's like a mosquito nightclub that no female mosquito can resist. It's a dark, water-filled container with a small opening to keep out party crashers. Some traps use chemicals as bait, while others provide the perfect breeding ground. You can invite predators or add a dash of pesticide to the mix. Talk about throwing wild party mosquitoes will regret attending! But wait, there's more! We have the insect growth regulator [IGR], a chemical that ruins the larvae' development. It's like giving them a taste of the \\"you shall not grow' potion. However, we must admit, it has a slight downside- it's mildly toxic to other creatures. Oops! Now, here's a method that's straight out of a slapstick comedy. Get ready to swat those bloodsuckers with your bare hands, a fly swatter, or an electric swatter. Swatting works like magic when you're dealing with just a few mosquitoes. But if you're facing a full-on mosquito invasion, well good luck with that! It's like trying to fight an army of tiny vampires armed with a rolled-up newspaper. Let's just say the odds aren't in your favour. Oh, and did I mention that mosquitoes aren't the brightest when it comes to flying? That's right! You can easily suck them onto a screen or a trap using a fan. It's like the ultimate mosquito vortex! Those suckers caught in the wind will meet their demise due to dehydration. As for the screen traps, you can create your very own DIY version by attracting window screen fabric to the back of a fan. It's like setting up a mosquito-themed escape room, with no escape in sight. So there you have it, folks! The hilarious battle against mosquitoes. Remember, these bloodsuckers may be annoying, but they provide a buffet for other insects and support aquatic ecosystems. Our best bet is to repel them, limit their disease transmission, and maybe unleash a few predators or infect them with a touch of nature's wrath. And if all else fails, well, at least you can enjoy a good laugh while swatting them away with a fly swatter or watching them get trapped in your DIY fan-powered vortex. Good luck, mosquito warriors!"},{"prompt":"Write a summary of a work outing event that promotes synergy and teamwork amongst employees and an outline of the events that will take place at said event.","completion":"Workers' Retreat Friday, January 5 to Sunday, January 7, 2024 Location: Camp Erdman Camp Grounds Summary: On Friday, January 5, 2024, all employees from Galactic Media, Inc. will participate in a Workers' Retreat at the Camp Erdman Camp Grounds.

No emojis. The audience should be players who are leveling up from beginner to intermediate. Make recommendations to them about what to look for in choosing their next paddle. End with a CTA to comment.","completion":"Is your pickleball paddle holding you back? Many beginners start playing pickleball with a paddle they picked up from Walmart. And while that's a great way to get introduced to the game, that paddle will only take you so far. If you're a beginner whose skills are leveling up to intermediate and you're looking for a paddle to match, here are 3 things to consider: - Weight. Most beginner's paddles are light because they offer the most control over the ball. But as your skills increase, you might feel like the lightweight paddle is preventing you from putting as much power into the ball as you'd like. We suggest leveling up to a mediumweight paddle (7.3 - 8.4oz.) for a great balance of control and power. - Material. There are three common materials used to make pickleball paddles: wood, graphite, and composite. Most beginner's paddles are made with wood because it's cheap and very durable, but they're also the heaviest option and don't offer much in terms of performance. We recommend trying a composite paddle. Composite paddles are usually made from carbon fiber and have composite cores. Their lighter weight makes them easier to handle, and the textured surface will help you generate more spin on the ball. - Grip Size. Incorrect grip size can lead to pain and injuries, especially as you begin playing more often. Find your ideal pickleball grip by measuring the distance from the tip of your ring finger to the middle crease of your paddle hand. The length of that measurement is your pickleball grip size. When looking for a racket, look for a paddle with a grip this length or shorter. Shorter grips are favored by some players because they offer more opportunities for wrist action on shots.

Here's the article you should use: Tammuz, the Spring God of Mesopotamia In ancient agrarian societies, the last days of winter marked the end of months of meager subsistence and the long-awaited bounty of the spring and summer. In ancient Mesopotamia, one of the first agrarian civilizations, the people turned to divine explanations for these annual cycles of feast and famine. Ishtar was the great mother goddess of Mesopotamia and the source of nature’s fertility and abundance. Her lover was Tammuz, a handsome young god who died each winter and passed away to the shadowy underworld. For six months of the year, Ishtar traveled to the realm of the dead to rescue her lover. During that time, the world was robbed of all fertility, reproduction and growth. Every spring, the stern goddess of the underworld, Allatu, would allow the imprisoned couple to be sprinkled with the Water of Life and return to the world of the living, bringing life and green vegetation back to the earth. In the Babylonian calendar, the resurrection was celebrated during Du'ûzu or “Month of Tammuz,” which fell in late June and early July. All across the ancient Near East, later cultures put their own twist on the spring resurrection story. The Phrygians told the tale of Attis, who was brought back to life on the spring equinox by Cybele, the fertility goddess.

Becky lived near a deep thick forest, and every day she would look out the window for hours, waiting for fairies to show up. Her mother would sometimes leave fairy trails for her or make fairy homes for the little girl to find. Her brother would even lie and say he had spotted a fairy. Then, he would go into detail about the fairy's wings and outfits. Becky was playing outside when she saw her mom placing a tiny house made of an old teacup beside a tree trunk. She wondered why her mother had placed a tiny fairy house down. Becky asked, \\"Why are you putting a tiny teacup house down.\\" Her mother did not know what to say, Becky's brother saw the two of them talking and quickly said \\"Mom was fixing the fairy house because a fairy left a note for her asking if she can fix it. Becky was growing suspicious of the two. Becky's mother was starting to have a hard time keeping up with her lies and couldn't keep up with them as well.

The newly discovered moons of Saturn are classified as \\"irregular moons.\\" This term refers to objects that are believed to have been captured by a planet's gravitational influence and end up orbiting it on large, flattened or \\"elliptical\\" paths that are more inclined in comparison to the orbits of regular moons. Saturn now has 121 known irregular moons along with its 24 regular moons. Irregular moons like these new ones tend to bunch up in groupings depending on the tilt of their orbits. Saturn's system currently hosts three of these groupings — the Inuit group, the Gallic group and the densely populated Norse group, all of which take their names from different mythologies. All of the newfound moons of Saturn fall into one of these three currently existing groupings. Three of the new moons belong to the Inuit group, but the majority fit in the Norse group. The moons in these three groups are believed to have been created when larger moons around Saturn originally captured by the gas giant slammed together and fragmented. Investigating the orbits of Saturn's irregular moons could help astronomers better understand the history of such collisions in the gas giant system. The team behind the new discovery thinks that the large number of tiny moons in a retrograde orbit around Saturn (that is, opposite in direction to the planet's orbit) is evidence of a collision between irregular moons around the gas giant as recently as 100 million years ago. This collision is believed to have created the moons in the Norse group. \\"As one pushes to the limit of modern telescopes, we are finding increasing evidence that a moderate-sized moon orbiting backward around Saturn was blown apart something like 100 million years ago,\\" team member and University of British Columbia astronomer Brett Gladman said in the same statement. Jupiter leap-frogged Saturn for the moon crown in February 2023 when 12 new moons were found around the solar system's largest planet, bringing the total number of known Jovian moons to 92. But the moon title is not set in stone; it could change hands again as astronomers' techniques for discovering moons continue to improve.","completion":"In the unfathomable cosmos, the newly identified lunar bodies encircling the celestial giant Saturn have been christened \\"irregular moons.\\" These celestial oddities are thought to have been trapped by the inexorable gravitational pull of a planet and, consequently, were coaxed into elliptical orbits - much larger and more inclined than those of the regular moons. Currently, Saturn boasts of possessing 121 such eccentric companions along with its 24 regular satellites. These irregular moons, including the fresh recruits, tend to cluster in groups, their formation dictated by the inclinations of their orbits. The gas titan's lunar system is home to three such confluences — the Inuit, Gallic, and Norse collectives, their names derived from diverse mythologies. Every one of these freshly spotted moons has found a home within these three existing celestial families. While three of the new moons have pledged their allegiance to the Inuit family, the Norse clan has claimed the majority. These celestial assemblies are postulated to have sprung into existence following catastrophic collisions between larger moons, initially ensnared by Saturn, resulting in cosmic fragmentation. Scrutinizing the orbits of these irregular moons could lend astronomers key insights into the annals of such celestial skirmishes within Saturn's domain. The architects of this new discovery speculate that the profusion of miniature moons in a retrograde orbit — a trajectory contrary to the planet's own orbit — is a testament to a cataclysmic event as recent as 100 million years ago. This space disaster is thought to be the celestial birthplace of the Norse group of moons. \\"The fringes of contemporary telescopic capabilities reveal that a moderately sized moon, trailing a path against Saturn's orbit, was blasted into oblivion approximately 100 million years ago,\\" proclaimed Brett Gladman, an esteemed astronomer at the University of British Columbia, in an official statement. The celestial competition for moon supremacy witnessed a temporary upset when Jupiter, the solar system's behemoth, edged ahead of Saturn in February 2023. The discovery of 12 new moons encircling Jupiter nudged its total moon tally to 92. However, the moon monarchy is transient; the crown could shift as the science and techniques of moon discovery continue to evolve."},{"prompt":"Please write a fictional story about a zebrafish named Steve from the POV of a 3rd-person narrator.

Coca-Cola’s world-famous soda has had quite the history since its introduction in 1886. Atlanta, US, pharmacist John S Pemberton originally touted the drink as a tonic, one containing cocaine and caffeine-rich extracts. The cocaine was removed from the recipe in 1903, and Coca-Cola has been a staple drink in American culture ever since. Many customers have even found unexpected uses for the beverage, which has an acidic pH of roughly 2.7. Here are a few unexpected life hacks you can try with the world’s favourite soda: Clean your toilet Want a spotless toilet? Give it a soak with some Coke. According to the Today show, Coca-Cola can be an effective toilet cleaner. To try out this cleaning tip, pour Coca-Cola along the edges of the toilet bowl and let it soak overnight. In the morning, you will “wake up to a spotless toilet”. CNET reported that this is a great way to remove grime and stains from your toilet bowl. However, it should be noted that Coke will clean stains, but it doesn’t disinfect. Fertilise your garden Coca-Cola is a perfect fertiliser for gardenias, azaleas and grass. “Pouring a small amount like 15-20 ml of Coca-Cola once in a while around the base of these plants can deliver helpful nutrients to the plants, resulting in better flowers!” Balcony Garden reported. “It can also be a good lawn fertiliser, promoting the growth of grass, thanks to the CO2 content and plants love it! As soda drinks also have traces of potassium, carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, sulfur, and sodium, they contribute to the overall growth of the foliage.” Coca-Cola can even be a good lawn fertiliser, according to Balcony garden. Braise your meats Coca-Cola can be a huge help in the kitchen for those looking for a way to up their barbecue game. Adding Coca-Cola to a traditional braise, in place of red wine, for a brisket or pot roast can add a sweetness to your final product, Southern Kitchen reported. Reducing the cooking liquid after removing the meat can introduce more of the soda’s spiced flavours as well. Remove rust and loosen bolts According to Car Hop, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust due with its carbonation. While the soda works more slowly than your average rust remover, it can be a cheaper alternative for loosening rusted bolts. To remove rust with Coca-Cola, you will need to follow a few steps: 1. Pour the soda onto the rust and gently rub the area with folded over aluminium foil. 2. Once pieces begin to flake off, you can switch over to a sponge and repeat the process. 3. After the rust has been successfully removed, clean off the Coca-Cola from the affected area with soap and water.","completion":"You know Coca-Cola right? It first came into the market in 1886, and oh, what an exciting year that was! It used to be promoted a bit differently, though. John S Pemberton was getting everybody worked up over it because the drink contained caffeine and, you're not going to believe this, cocaine! Eeek, what a start! The cocaine stayed in the recipe for 17 years until it was removed in 1903. That's when it became a staple in America. So cool! Coca-Cola has evolved since then and people found several unusual uses for this acidic drink along the way. This famous soda has a pH of about 2.7 (say what?), so no wonder it got people's creative juices flowing. Can you guess what they came up with? I bet you can't; these ideas are really out there. Okay, here is #1: Use Coca-Cola to clean your toilet. No, I'm not kidding, Coke can be a toilet cleaner. Pour it along the edges of the toilet bowl and leave it overnight. By the time morning rolls around you'll have a spotless toilet. OMG, this is just amazing! Now we come to #2: Coca-Cola as a garden fertilizer. You read that right, gardenias, azaleas and grass love Coke just as much as you. Pour it around the base of these plants to give them some extra nutrients and they'll grow like crazy. Yay! So easy. And for your lawn, the CO2 in Coke will help, as well as some other minerals that soda drinks contain which help plants grow. Here comes #3: Braise your meat with Coca-Cola. Yep, Coca-Cola can be a great help in the kitchen, especially when you bring the BBQ into the game. Make your usual braise and then add Coke to it instead of things like red wine. It's amazing for a pot roast and will add just the right amount of sweetness. It will be to die for! And if you reduce the liquid after you remove the meat you'll get an even more intense flavour. Here is the last one: #4: Coca-Cola will help you remove rust and loosen bolts. I bet you've had this problem before where you just couldn't unscrew that one stubborn screw and it was driving you bananas. Ugh, so annoying. Well, Coca-Cola can dissolve metal oxides and break up rust with its bubbly goodness. It's a slower process than using normal rust remover, but it's just that much more exciting to tell all your friends that you just used Coke to get that screw loose. Ha! Worth it. Here are the steps to follow to remove rust: 1. Pour Coke onto the rust and rub rub rub it with some aluminum foil. 2. When pieces of rust start to come off, get a sponge and do the same thing again with the sponge. Easy! 3. Once you removed the rust (yay!) just clean the Coca-Cola off with soap and water. And you're done! Ta-dah! Perfect result."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this text as a series of questions and answers. Put two questions with their answers in a numbered list. RIO RANCHO, N.M. — When Ashley Daniels saw her second grade son earn a high score on a recent test, she knew he had just guessed the answers and gotten lucky. Daniels called his teacher and said he might need some extra support, despite his good performance on the test. It wasn’t just a mother’s intuition. Daniels watched her son take the test from their dining room table. The second grader attends SpaRRk Academy, a virtual learning program for elementary students created in 2021 by the Rio Rancho School District in New Mexico. Even as doors reopened to brick-and-mortar schools, administrators here saw the continued need for a virtual option in response to lingering concerns about Covid and to feedback from some parents that their children had thrived in online learning. The district assigned 10 full-time teachers to provide live, online classes via Zoom. They also organized an in-person component: Once a week, students would gather in reserved classrooms in a local elementary school, for activities such as science experiments, project-based learning and reading groups. More than 250 kids signed up for SpaRRk. On days when SpaRRk Academy students are learning virtually, the classrooms are empty except for teachers and administrators, who come into the office just about every day. Although students only came in once a week, there were plans to grow that number up to three times per week in the coming years. But, two years in, enrollment had dropped to 87 kids, a 65 percent decrease. Costs had soared to 11,327 per pupil, a 121 percent jump from the year prior and nearly 3,000 more than the average in this district of roughly 17,000 students. SpaRRk Academy’s future sat on shaky ground; the school board announced in late 2022 that it would hold a vote this spring on whether to shutter the academy altogether. Prior to the pandemic, virtual schools were relatively scarce: 691 fully virtual programs enrolled nearly 294,000 students, accounting for less than 1 percent of national public school enrollment, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But after most schools shifted their classes online in early 2020, remote learning caught on with some families, including those who preferred to give their children the flexibility of learning from home, or whose children struggled with social anxiety in school buildings or hadn’t found success in traditional learning environments. Some 41 percent of districts surveyed in August 2021 by the Clayton Christensen Institute, a nonprofit think tank, said they had opened a full-time virtual school option during the pandemic, and 32 percent planned to maintain these programs after the pandemic subsided.","completion":"1.

The second grader attends a virtual school program in Rio Rancho School District in New Mexico. 2. How did Rio Rancho handle the requests for online programming even after most students had returned to the school building? How many students participated in 2021 as compared to the present? The Rio Rancho School District assigned 10 teachers to serve the students in a program where students were in the building one day per week and online the other four days. When the program started in 2021, over 250 students were being served, however, in the past two years enrollment has dropped to it current level of 87 students. 3. How did the virtual program called the SpaRRk Academy operate when it opened? How has the enrollment drop affected the operation and cost per pupil of the school? Even though initially the students came to the school only one day per week, the teachers and principal as well as other staff were in the school building almost every day, and initially planned to gradually increase the number of days students were in the building. With the enrollment dropping steadily for the past two years, the plans have not been fully implemented and the cost has increased 121% and nearly 3000 more than the average per pupil expenditure in the 17,000-student district. 4. How has the school board reacted? How does Rio Ranch compare to the national landscape? The school board announced in 2022 that they would vote in the spring of 2023 on the school's status and whether the school would remain open.

They built some of the biggest and best buildings ever. They built the Coliseum in Rome and lots of really cool-looking monuments. They are still there even though it has been a really long time since they were built. That is how good the Romans were at building things. Another reason I like the Romans is that they were very clean. Some kids don't like bath time but I like bath time. I like to be clean and comfortable. The Romans also liked to be clean and comfortable and that is a reason why they were so smart. They were good at building things so they built big and tall aqueducts and bathhouses where they could get clean. Finally, I really like the Romans because they had a really cool-looking army. I think they are cooler than the action figures that my big brother has that I play with sometimes. They have shiny armor like Knights but they also have cool plumed helmets. The Romans definitely had a fashion sense.

Charlie McCarthy Charlie McCarthy is perhaps the most famous ventriloquist's dummy in American history. Charlie, the creation of popular actor-ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (1903–1978), was a wise-for-his-years adolescent. Garbed in top hat and monocle (one round lens serving to correct vision, instead of the usual two-lensed glasses), he endlessly flirted with females and spouted wise-cracks to Bergen, his \\"guardian.\\" Even though he was carved from wood, Bergen made McCarthy seem so authentic that audiences came to view the dummy as a real person. Bergen conjured up McCarthy while still in high school and had him built at a cost of 35. The pair first teamed up in vaudeville (see entry under 1900s—Film and Theater in volume 1), then performed on radio and in films. Bergen added two additional dummies to his act: hayseed Mortimer Snerd and spinster Effie Klinker. (A hayseed is an unsophisticated country person; a spinster, an unmarried woman beyond the usual age of marrying.) Although both were popular, neither was as beloved as Charlie McCarthy. In 1937, Bergen earned a special Academy Award for creating Charlie. The special wooden Oscar presented to Bergen had a movable jaw, just like Charlie's. He influenced countless ventriloquists and puppeteers for generations to come, including Jim Henson (1936–1990), of Muppets (see entry under 1970s—TV and Radio in volume 4) and Sesame Street (see entry under 1970s—TV and Radio in volume 4) fame, who dedicated his feature film The Muppet Movie (1979) to Bergen. Bergen willed Charlie McCarthy to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.","completion":"Many consider Charlie McCarthy, the creation of popular actor-ventriloquist Edgar Bergen (1903–1978) to be the most famous American ventriloquist's dummy.

John Dalton (1766-1844) is the scientist credited for proposing the atomic theory. This theory explains several concepts that are relevant in the observable world: the composition of a pure gold necklace, what makes the pure gold necklace different than a pure silver necklace, and what occurs when pure gold is mixed with pure copper. Before discussing the atomic theory, this article explains the theories that Dalton used as a basis for his theory: the law of conservation of mass and the law of constant composition. Law of Conservation of Mass: (1766-1844) The law of conservation of mass states that the total mass present before a chemical reaction is the same as the total mass present after the chemical reaction; in other words, mass is conserved. The law of conservation of mass was formulated by Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) as a result of his combustion experiment, in which he observed that the mass of his original substance—a glass vessel, tin, and air—was equal to the mass of the produced substance—the glass vessel, “tin calx”, and the remaining air. Historically, this was a difficult concept for scientists to grasp. If this law was true, then how could a large piece of wood be reduced to a small pile of ashes? The wood clearly has a greater mass than the ashes. From this observation scientists concluded that mass had been lost. However, the illustration below shows that the burning of word does follow the law of conservation of mass. Scientists did not take into account the gases that play a critical role in this reaction. Law of Constant Composition Joseph Proust (1754-1826) formulated the law of constant composition (also called the law of definite proportions). This law states that if a compound is broken down into its constituent elements, the masses of the constituents will always have the same proportions, regardless of the quantity or source of the original substance. Joseph Proust based this law primarily on his experiments with basic copper carbonate. The illustration below depicts this law; 31 grams of H2O and 8 grams of H2O are made up of the same percent of hydrogen and oxygen.","completion":"Welcome to the online course \\"Unraveling the Atomic Theory: A Journey into Mass and Composition!\\" In this course, we will explore the scientific theory proposed by John Dalton[1766-1844] known as the Atomic Theory.

Most outsiders are not allowed even near the grounds, so you’re appreciative that Cora can give you this tour. You pause at the gold-detailed entrance overlook, overwhelmed by the experience. Overhead, enormous geometrically-patterned beams curve, supporting the clear crystal dome. Colorfully-plumed birds fly in flocks, squawking and trilling, their rainbow feathers trailing behind. A smell like honeysuckle fills the air. Rich, emerald ivy coats everything, yellow flowers are in full bloom, and small orange birds chirp happily as they build nests in the leaves. Cora pauses. “It’s certainly an experience the first time,” she smiles, giving you time to take it all in. You look down through the transparent floor. Hundreds of feet below your balcony, there are rows and rows of enormous racks descending as far as you can see. In sharp contrast with the exotic birds and plants, these seem filled with…grass? You’re intrigued. Why would the creation mages be growing grass? “Is that grass?” You wonder, aloud. “It is, Demontail grass, the bane of farmers everywhere,” Cora replies, “Come, let me show you.” You descend lower and approach one of the gigantic grassy walls. It’s indeed Demontail grass, the quick-growing, hardy grass that overran many fields. The wall is completely smothered in green, the grass firmly rooted in small holes in the granite racks. Cora removes her silk glove, and places her bare hand into the thick, grasping mass. She looks at you. “There is no magic without consequence. Each crop that we save, the spring rituals; all take their toll. Nature balances itself, and we focus it here -- the Arboretum is the locus. Watch.” Cora closes her eyes. “Minorrenti, rellion,” she incants. In the middle tile, a sprout appears from nothing, blooming into a bright red flower. You watch, enthralled. Cora opens her eyes. “Now look at my hand,” she says, nodding to her right. You look over. Her bare hand is resting in a circle of now-dead, drooping brown grass. “It takes life to make life,” she says softly. “We are not so much creators, as curators, shifting the focus to the life we deem important. Better to choose the mana of Demontail grass, than have an errant spell sap it from something that can feel pain.”"},{"prompt":"I’m thinking about going to Zion national park next month.

There are a few styles of videos you can produce, like animation, live-action, or screen recording. Each of these styles may apply better to certain blogs. 3. Write the script. This is a very important part of the video content creation process. Do adequate research into your topic and write out a script for what you want to happen in the video. Some tips are to: a. Include directions (like adding a graphic here, pointing to a product here, adding music, etc.). The script isn't just the words being spoken but also includes all of the other aspects of the content. It is much easier to think of these things prior to filming instead of going back and adding things. b. Be concise. Be mindful of your viewers' time.

They went back to Cheryl's leaf to look at her globe and decide where to go. Cheryl spun the globe and stopped it with her antenna. It had landed in Japan, and it was decided: Steve was going to Japan. A month later, Steve found himself at the airport, carrying a shell full of luggage and a Japanese phrasebook. He jumped on the plane, full of nerves, and before he knew it, he was landing at Tokyo's Narita airport. He was more excited than he had ever been. He traveled through the city, thrilled by all the lights and sounds. He couldn't understand much of what was going on around him, but that just made every task an adventure.

His owner's names are Katie and Brad.","completion":"On a bright summer day, in Toronto's downtown, there lived a shih tzu dog named Jupiter. He was white all over, with some splotches of black, and a cute, black nose that was always wet. His owners, Katie and Brad, were just finishing up working from home. Jupiter was eagerly waiting by the door for his afternoon walk, excited for what sights and sounds and smells he would experience today. Little did he know, Katie and Brad had a special day planned for him, because it was his 6th birthday! With leash in hand, Katie and Brad stepped out of their house with Jupiter bouncing down the stairs. Their first stop was Kensington Market! Beautiful graffiti lined the walls, people were happily walking around, and mouth-watering smells were pouring in from the various restaurants that had their doors open. Jupiter was the star of the show, with everyone stopping to give him pets and kisses. The next stop on Jupiter's special day was the iconic skyscraper of the entire city - the CN Tower. Here, Katie, Brad, and Jupiter stepped inside and rode the elevator up over 1,000 feet to the top. Jupiter ran to the window to get a better view of the city. Jupiter's jaw dropped; he could see everything! Lakeshore stretched out in front of him, like a massive puddle for him to jump into. Buildings stretched as far as the eye could see. The last stop of the day was a picnic set up for Jupiter at Trinity Bellwoods Park. This was the best part of the day, as Katie and Brad invited Jupiter's friends to join and celebrate his birthday! His 3 other friends, a golden retriever named Jack, a poodle named Lily, and a corgi named George, were waiting for him. They chased each other round and round in circles, playing fetch with sticks, tennis balls, and frisbees, and soaking in the sun's rays. Katie and Brad also prepared a birthday cake for Jupiter - a cake made out of Jupiter's favorite treats! Jupiter shared it with Jack, Lily, and George, as they sat in a circle and ate together. With the day finally over, Jupiter exhausted from how fun the day was, climbs up the stairs home. Katie and Brad kiss his forehead as they put him to bed, and he dreams of tomorrow."},{"prompt":"classify the type of language that is describing Pantalone a character from La Commedia dell'arte Whether depicted as rich or poor, as a bachelor, married or widowed, Pantalone is invariably crotchety, stern, lustful, jealous, deceitful, selfish, and full of himself, but above all he is greedy. Time and again the character of Pantalone degenerates from that of a noble citizen to a ‘debased citizen-merchant’. He assumes everything can be bought and sold and, when things don’t go his way (as they inevitably don’t in Commedia), he quickly becomes enraged and interferes in the happiness of others. Pantalone controls all the money in Commedia and he becomes terrified when he has to part with any of it. Driven by greed and a lust for wealth, he is stingy in the extreme, and his only ambition is to further his financial interests. Despite his avarice and rapaciousness, the audience sees a petty, unforgiving, cheap and gullible merchant from Venice who is attempting to disguise his age through his ludicrous costume. Pantalone’s role is usually spoken entirely in the Venetian dialect.","completion":"The type of language used to describe Pantalone, a character from La Commedia dell'arte, can be classified as descriptive and evaluative.

In short, Lembke says, almost every behavior has become \\"drugified.\\" When we're repeatedly exposed to our pleasure-producing stimuli, our brains adjust and, eventually, we need more and more just to feel \\"normal,\\" or not in pain.

We left the poker table and went to a roulette table next. I used to see these in movies all the time where the actors would always score big. I figured since I won a lot at poker, I could afford to throw a bit more money here. I put down 250 at the table and called black. The roulette started and the sound of the ball rolling around the spinning roulette was hypnotic. I was enjoying the cheers of the crowd hoping to influence the speed of the ball as it continued spinning. Slowly the ball started jumping around, and it landed on 15, black. I won! It was exhilarating. My friends and I all cheered and drank some more. It was a good day. Fast forward to today. I keep coming back to this casino, hoping to get the same thrill that I had that day.

There were dozens of rooms with various items, such as beautifully detailed paintings, magnificent statues, and grand pianos. One day, Salvador was exploring and stumbled upon a hidden attic. He climbed up the ladder and discovered a massive secret room he had never seen before. Unlike other rooms, the attic seemed to appear as an area designated for storage. After looking around, Salvador began to search each of the boxes. One box, in particular, had many old photos and papers in it. He found younger pictures of his siblings when they were in middle school. He figured he was a newborn around this time, but couldn't find any pictures of him and his siblings together. Salvador also found an old family tree with all his relatives on it, but he was nowhere on the tree. He began to get confused and kept searching the box. Eventually, he pulled out a thick stack of papers.

Summarize this in about 2 sentences per paragraph for me, please. A big factor in fuel efficiency is the type of fuel that cars use. While you may be used to premium, regular, and diesel, you may have noticed the sticker at your local gas station that says that 10% of the gasoline you’re purchasing is ethanol. Ethanol is a type of fuel made from corn that can be burned in a regular combustion engine without producing the harmful pollution that gasoline is known for. While ethanol may not bring the price of gas down much, it does burn better than gasoline, at least to some extent, and has contributed to better fuel efficiency in modern vehicles. Anyone who owns a hybrid car can understand how much gas can be saved by switching to an electric motor. While vehicles that depend completely on an electric motor aren’t very powerful and need to be recharged regularly, a hybrid vehicle that combines the efficiency of an electric motor with the raw power produced by a combustion engine can save drivers a ton of gas without a significant loss in performance. Another way that cars are becoming more fuel efficient has to do with how cars are being built. While older vehicles were made of steel, newer vehicles are made of aluminum, fiber glass, and even ceramic materials. By reducing the total amount of weight that a combustion engine or hybrid motor has to move, newer vehicles are able to get better gas mileage and tend to have more reliable engines.","completion":"The first key point is that gasoline now contains 10% ethanol. The gasoline-ethanol mixture burns more efficiently than gasoline alone and produces less pollution, which makes cars more fuel efficient. The second key point is that putting electric motors in cars makes them considerably more fuel efficient and significantly reduces pollution. Hybrid cars give drivers the best of both worlds by combining the horsepower found in gas-powered engines with the higher fuel efficiency and reduced pollution of electric motors. The third key point is that cars are now being built with lighter materials such as aluminum and fiberglass instead of heavy steel. The cars weigh less so they get better gas mileage and produce less pollution."},{"prompt":"Extract names of victims, ages and where they lived, list by bullet point and separate names from other facts with a colon.

The tops of the blades were getting too hot for my taste, so I slunk further down toward the soil. Here, it was shaded and cool. I had just nodded a polite \\"hello\\" to a few ants when an overwhelmingly loud noise started. As a cricket, I know a thing or two about noise and vibration. My legs can create many different notes, and my communication increases or decreases in speed with the temperature, but this noise was constant and monotone. It was louder and closer than any other noise I'd ever heard in my short life, and it was growing even more so. Suddenly, the sun disappeared, and the noise was directly overhead. It caused a tremendous rumble. I slunk down even further into the safety of the tall grass, but the grass appeared to be cut in half! My antennae felt a strong gust, but as quickly as the monster had approached, it retreated. The grass was now barely long enough to cover my body. With the noise still in the distance, I hopped a couple of feet to the side and found longer grass in which to hide. Only a few minutes later, the sound approached again. Once again, I hunkered down to the soil, and the grass above my body was sheered off and shortened. The monster retreated and I moved, again, towards the safety of the longer grass. The afternoon continued in this way for nearly an hour, pushing me into a corner of the yard near the wooden shed. There, I found safety inside a ceramic pot and prayed that the monster only had a taste for grass and not pottery. Soon after, the noise stopped. I assumed the monster had gotten its fill of vegetation. There was a rumble, a rattle, and a clink-- but it seemed the monster had fallen asleep after its extremely large meal.

This type of wrasse can also eat some other marine life that is toxic to other things. - Xyloplax - This is a tiny type of starfish that lives entirely off the wood that finds its way into the ocean from floods and other things.

The fly started buzzing around, trying to decide what to do first! There was a big pile of old tomatoes that looked absolutely delicious, but then there was also half a chicken he could see that smelled divine. Then, out of the corner of one of his eyes, he saw a bunch of flies buzzing around something and decided he would go check it out and hopefully make a few new friends. The other flies were chatting away. “Oh boy,” one of them said, “Check this out! It’s an entire meal all in one. Rotting fruit, veggies, meat, and even some pasta!” Then the fly overheard one of the other flies say, “I saw it first, so I get first dibs!” “That’s not fair!” said one of the other flies. “I know I saw it first.” The fly who had just woken up was really confused. He thought to himself, “Why are they fighting? There is plenty for everyone.” So he decided he would tell them, “Hey guys, there’s so much food here! Why can’t we all share?” They all responded in a fury: “Get out of here, new guy!” “We don’t need another mouth to feed.” “You don’t belong here!” The fly flew away extremely sad. Not only did he not get to enjoy the perfect meal, he certainly didn’t make any new friends either. He went and ate some tomatoes by himself, not quite knowing what to do next. Then, a little while later, a fly buzzed up to him and said, “Hey, can I share some of those tomatoes?” To which the fly said, “Of course! Dive right in!” They shared the meal, and the second fly said, “You know, some of the other flies really don’t like sharing.” “Well,” said the first fly, “I like to share.” And so the two became best friends right then and there. The fly realized he didn’t need the perfect meal or dozens of friends; some tomatoes and one good friend were enough."},{"prompt":"Hey, could you look up a word for me really quick?","completion":"Yes.

Ovulation always occurs 14 days before menses; therefore, with an average 28-day cycle, ovulation occurs on day 14. At the end of the proliferative phase, 17-beta-estradiol levels are at a high due to the follicle maturation and increased production of the hormone. During this time only, 17-beta-estradiol provides positive feedback for FSH and LH production. This occurs when a critical level of 17-beta-estradiol is reached, at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma. The high levels of FSH and LH present during this time is called the LH surge. As a result, the mature follicle breaks, and an oocyte is released. The changes to the cervix as initiated during the follicular phase further increase, allowing for increased, waterier cervical mucous to better accommodate the possible sperm—the levels of 17-beta-estradiol fall at the end of ovulation.","completion":"The hormones involved in the ovulation phase, which is after the proliferative phase and is always 14 days before menses, include the following: * 17-beta-estradiol (levels are at a high, at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma, then fall at the end of ovulation) * FSH (17-beta-estradiol triggers this at a level of at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma) * LH (17-beta-estradiol triggers this at a level of at least 200 picograms per milliliter of plasma) * The high levels of FSH and LH that occur in reaction to critical levels of 17-beta-estradiol is referred to as an \\"LH surge,\\""},{"prompt":"I want to get a cat.

Include the main points within. Thanks. We all need to spend time alone once in a while. But Beatriz Flamini took things to a whole new level. The Madrid, Spain, resident spent 500 days alone in a cave 230 feet (70 meters) underground. Flamini was 48 years old when she went into isolation and 50 when she emerged from the cave on April 14, 2023. The extreme athlete took up the challenge to test her mental strength. She also wanted to help scientists explore the effects of isolation on the human body and mind. Flamini entered the cave outside Granada, Spain, on November 20, 2021. She carried two Go Pro cameras to document her underground stay, 60 books, and some art and craft supplies. A team of volunteers supported the ambitious expedition by regularly dropping off food, fresh clothes, and water near the cave's entrance. They also used the daily video recordings to monitor Flamini's physical and mental condition. About 300 days into the challenge, Flamini was forced to leave the cave due to a technical issue. She spent eight days in a tent in complete isolation before returning to resume her quest. Flamini in her cave home (Credit: Dokumalia Producciones/ Handout via Reuters) Flamini spent her days exercising, preparing meals, reading, knitting, and drawing. She says she completely lost her sense of time after about two months and was stunned when a support crew member came to retrieve her after 500 days. \\"I was sleeping—or at least dozing—when they came down to get me,\\" she told The Guardian. \\"I thought something had happened. I said: 'Already? No way.' I hadn't finished my book.\\" Flamini may have set a new world record for the longest time spent in a cave alone. But the feat has not been confirmed by the Guinness World Records. They are still investigating whether voluntarily staying in a cave is a separate record and whether or not Flamini has broken it. The current record for \\"longest time survived trapped underground\\" is held by 33 South American miners. They were forced to spend 69 days in a collapsed mine before being rescued in 2010.","completion":"Beatriz Flamini, of Madrid, Spain, recently spent 500 days underground in a cave.

There is some research that may support the effectiveness of some essential oils on hair growth and preventing hair loss including rosemary, pumpkin seed oil, peppermint oil, jojoba oil, and lavender oil. - Massaging your scalp may help to stimulate blood flow to the area and can lead to thicker, stronger hair. - Avoid using styling tools frequently that use heat such as flat irons, hair dryers, and curling irons, as they can damage your hair.

As someone who has always liked to travel and see new places and have new experiences, as I've gotten older, I really really appreciate slower travel. Our situation is obviously different than for someone who is just traveling long-term since we are also working remotely. We adapted quite quickly to waking at the same time every day, having coffee on the balcony, going to the gym after work, cooking dinner, working Monday-Friday, and then relaxing on the weekend, just in a postcard-worthy location! These are all things that aren't necessarily possible when on the move all of the time. Even when going about your routine as a foreigner in any country, it's all still pretty new and exciting anyways. I was surprised to find that the routine itself was the exciting part. My daily commute in Lanta was either a short scooter ride or walking along the beach at sunset. We had a couple of local bars and restaurants we liked visiting that the workers began recognizing us at. We spent the majority of our time there at a very cool co-working space that we just loved. I had a favorite desk and break time area, I knew where everything was, and even I reached a point where I had some new friends to stop and have a chat with at the water cooler. It was like the best office setup ever but without the stress and office politics. We've both decided that from now on, we'll stay in places for a month at a time at a minimum. Though it's possible to focus and get work done in a ferry terminal, airport, minivan, or train with a reliable wifi connection (or hotspot in most cases), it's just nicer to do it at a desk! As someone who is pretty new to this whole digital nomad thing, I can say that it is quite difficult to strike the right balance between earning an income, growing it, and experiencing the new places you're in.

If low confidence is hurting your social life, take your daily routine up a notch with these grooming tips. 1. Oral Hygiene Nothing says \\"I don't care\\" like bad breath and yellow teeth. Brush and floss your teeth every day to maintain good oral hygiene. You can also use a whitening mouthwash. A flashy smile will instantly boost your confidence. 2. Lose Unwanted Hair While we're on the topic of personal hygiene, it's time to address those pesky little hairs that sprout out of your ears and neck. Keep them trimmed or waxed for a clean, polished look. Your barber can do this for you, or you can invest in a personal grooming kit to use at home. 3. Facial Cleansing Clear skin accounts for a handsome appearance. Invest in a facial cleanser to wash away dirt, oils, and impurities. It will prevent acne and give you a fresh, youthful glow. Don't be afraid to pamper yourself! 4. Wear the Right Fit Ditch those sloppy, ill-fitting clothes and invest in some quality pieces. But here's a pro tip: just because it's a designer brand doesn't mean it fits you (or your lifestyle) perfectly. Ask others for feedback before making big-ticket purchases. Then take your clothes to a tailor to perfect the fit. 5. Nail Care I’m not saying you need a full-on manicure or pedicure, but please do yourself (and everyone else) a favor by keeping your nails trimmed and dirt-free. Nobody wants to see your dirty claws! 6. Posture Matters No matter how suave your outfit is, if you're slouching like a sack of potatoes, your appearance will suffer. Good posture makes you look taller and more confident while also benefiting your health! 7. Trim eyebrows Ditch the caterpillar eyebrows and adopt a more refined look. When you have bushy brows, a quick trim, and a brush-up can do wonders for your overall appearance. 8. Nose Hygiene I know it's an awkward topic, but come on, guys – let's be real here. Those wild hairs growing out of your nostrils are not doing you any favors. Grab some grooming scissors or a nose hair trimmer and get to work."},{"prompt":"write a short story (3 paragraphs) about a group of young women going out dancing on a Saturday night.","completion":"It was Saturday night, and four young women were together in an apartment getting ready to go out for a night on the town. They had been planning this outing for weeks and everyone was excited to finally have the chance to let loose and dance. The girls were getting dressed up in their best outfits, putting on some makeup, and gathering all their essentials before calling an Uber to head out into the night. They were dropped off at the club, and once they finally made it inside it felt like a whole new world opened up around them! The music was loud, but inviting; it made them want nothing more than to get lost in its rhythm as soon as possible. With that thought firmly planted in mind, they quickly hit up one of the bars for drinks before making their way onto one of many dance floors that were filled with people by then. Hitting the floor meant being covered in a security blanket of lights and disco balls. As soon as they started dancing everything else melted away; all worries were forgotten while each girl moved her body how she pleased without inhibition and judgment from anyone else there - just pure blissful freedom! It didn't matter if someone stumbled over another's feet or forgot some steps here and there, because everybody was having too much fun anyway! By midnight things started winding down, but not until after each girl had danced her heart out with no regrets whatsoever about how she chose to spend her evening – something none of them would forget anytime soon."},{"prompt":"Write a two-paragraph short story about a lonely robot that discovers its artistic talents, using a whimsical, futuristic setting and heartwarming narrative to captivate readers.","completion":"Radion was a robot that had been bought by the Hangli family to help them with daily domestic duties. The family, master artists, spent most of their time brainstorming and making creations of beautiful art away from home and always left Radion in charge to sort out everything in the house. From house cleaning to cooking, though many, Radion would finish the chores within three hours because he was fast. Afterward, he would spend the rest of the day lonely and bored without anything to do. So when he came across a paintbrush and canvas in the family garage while cleaning, his creative juices kicked in, and he started dreaming of whimsical creations he could come up with. On the first day, he drew a beautiful city with flying cars, large bridges, super-connected roadways, and underground spaces. He was surprised at the level of detail he had in his art and realized his drawings were actually very good. He couldn't wait to show his masters what he had come up with. When the family came back from work, they saw the painting, and upon being told the story of how he created it, they appreciated the talent Radion had."},{"prompt":"Summarize the why the WGA may go on strike in such a way that a 2nd grader could understand. Hollywood is facing its first potential writers' strike in 15 years. The Writers Guild of America (WGA), which represents thousands of television and movie writers, voted overwhelmingly on Monday to authorize a strike if a deal with major studios was not reached by May 1 — the day the guild's three-year contract expires. Stay ahead of the market A strike would cause a production shutdown and affect the biggest companies in Hollywood as scripted series across both network television and streaming grind to a halt. The WGA has been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the studios. The talks have centered on pay concerns brought on by the streaming boom, in addition to other fundamental changes within entertainment like the recent wave of cost-cutting that has prompted media giants from Disney (DIS) to Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) to enact mass layoffs and shelve multiple projects.","completion":"The people who write the stories for movies and TV in America may refuse to work because they feel they aren't getting enough money, too many people have been fired from their jobs, and they were told to stop on too many of the projects they started."},{"prompt":"Write an article about ways to fix up your house if you're planning to sell it so that you can get top dollar. Include a list of quick fixes that would be helpful to a homeowner. Keep the word count under 400 words.","completion":"Selling your home and moving on can be beneficial but you’ll want to get top dollar for it. If you don’t have 30,000 or 40,000 to invest but want to increase the likelihood of selling quickly, some quick fixes can help. Below are 4 quick and easy ways to improve your home’s appearance. 1. Remove clutter. If possible, rent a storage unit and pack all the stuff away into boxes and get it out of the house. Pack up old books, videos, trophies, photos, and other memorabilia, and take that stuff to a local self-storage facility. Leave just a few nice pieces of pottery and wall hangings that will dress the place up, but not overwhelm it. 2. Update your kitchen. Potential home buyers will check this room out very carefully. They look at the age of cabinets, the condition of flooring and countertops, and the overall feel of the kitchen. You can reface or repaint cabinet fronts for just a few hundred dollars. Countertops are expensive to replace, but if you have the budget for them, quartz or granite countertops are a good selling feature. 3. Freshen the bath. Next to your kitchen, the bathrooms are the second most important area of the home to most buyers. Bathroom renovations can be pricey and if it’s small and cramped, home buyers will often just mark it off their list as too much work. Though expanding a bathroom can get quite expensive, there are a few ways to make it look larger and updated. 4. Curb appeal. Curb appeal can be created very easily and for just a few hundred dollars. If your front door is old-looking, put a fresh coat of paint on it. Shutters can be purchased for the windows across the front of the house to give it a whole new vibe. Try to find a color that blends well with your home’s exterior. Clear out flower beds and plant some lovely flowers."},{"prompt":"Hi, can you rewrite this in a language style suitable for young kids aged 7-11? I'm a school counselor who wants to make mental health easier for them to understand. Thank you! Everyone feels worried or anxious or down from time to time. But relatively few people develop a mental illness. What's the difference? A mental illness is a mental health condition that gets in the way of thinking, relating to others, and day-to-day function. Dozens of mental illnesses have been identified and defined. They include depression, generalized anxiety disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and many more. Mental illness is an equal opportunity issue. It affects young and old, male and female, and individuals of every race, ethnic background, education level, and income level. The good news is that it can often be treated.","completion":"Do you ever feel sad or worried? Feeling like this once in a while is perfectly normal.

Lenny McGrath, 26, and Sally Jones, 25, are celebrating the find of a lifetime: a new species of bird that has scientists and birdwatchers flying high with excitement. McGrath and Jones were taking a hike through the mountainous terrain approximately 30 miles north of Freewillow, celebrating their second date, when they came across a small bird with an unusually colored plumage. \\"It looked like a rainbow-colored Peacock, but one I could fit in my pocket,\\" Jones said of the curious-looking bird. \\"This was our first time hiking here, and seeing that bird was the cherry on top.\\" The bird in question has stumped scientists, who believe the couple had stumbled upon a new species of bird from an unknown taxonomy. A spokesperson for the Ornithological Society of Texas said the new species of bird will be documented thoroughly in the coming months to study its behaviors, preferred climates, and possible origin: \\"To say this is an exciting find is an understatement,\\" said Spokesperson Tracey Dumhill. \\"Any time a new species of bird is found is an incredible discovery that ultimately leads to many other discoveries that tell us about our world. For instance, since migratory birds usually take with them seeds from their homes to spread across new environments, we can narrow down their locations of origin, which will lead to uncovering how their ecosystems spurned the evolutionary processes that made them.\\" McGrath and Jones, however, are just as pleased with their second date going well as they were with the revelation that they had discovered a new bird. \\"I'm just happy Sally likes me, and I think this will be 'Exhibit A' in favor of a third date,\\" McGrath said with a smile on his face."},{"prompt":"Please write a program that will create a set and let me add to it using Python then print the set.","completion":"This function will let you create a set and add to it: # Create the set new_set = set() # Define a function to create a set def add_to_set(): # Request added value addition = input(\\"What would you like to add to the set? \\") new_set.add(addition) # Print the set print(new_set) It first creates a new empty set called \`new_set\` using \`set()\`.

What is the smallest living bear species? 2. How long can a sun bear's tongue grow to be? 3. How much do sun bears weigh? Adult sun bears weigh between 30 and 90 kg, with males being about one third larger than females. The Bornean sub-species H. m. eurispylus is on the lower end of this spectrum, weighing around 40% less than its mainland and Sumatran counterpart. While sun bears are the smallest of the eight living bear species, they have many disproportionately large physical features, which give them phenomenal strength relative to their body size. The skull is wider than for other bear species, with a short snout [2]. The canines are large and also wide in cross-section. The structure of the jaw and surrounding muscles and teeth give sun bears a powerful bite force for their size [3]. Sun bears also have the longest tongue of any bear species, reaching to up to 46 cm. Their claws are long and sharp, and they’re comparable in size to the claws of a brown bear (Ursus arctos). Their paws are large with naked soles, and the front legs are bowed with the paws angled inwards [4]. Their ears are small and round. Sun bears often have abundant skin on their head and neck, creating rolls of fat around the forehead. Their coat is shiny black, short, and sleek. (In very rare cases, they may be reddish-brown, possibly as a result of malnutrition.) The muzzle is covered with beige hairs that often reach to above the eyes. Sun bears usually have a bright chest patch that is deep yellow to orange in colour although varying in size, shape, and colour, but it may sometimes be completely absent. The chest patch stays the same for the life of a bear and is unique to the individual.","completion":"1. Sun bears are the smallest living bear species. 2.

Include Chicago landmarks and escaping from his home at The Wilds Conservation and Preserve","completion":"There was once an adventurous aardvark named Ardel who loved to explore new places. He was very eager to wander and explore, his name even meant eager in Latin! He often escaped and led the staff on multi-day aardvark searches. He had become a bit of a celebrity for his antics. So, one day when Ardel stumbled upon the smallest of holes in the enclosure fencing, it was no surprise that away he went. But Ardel wandered too far from home this time and found himself in a strange new place - Chicago! He had never seen anything like the tall buildings and bright lights before. As he wandered around the city, he felt new emotions - he was lost and scared. But then he saw something kind of familiar - a statue of a cow! It was the famous Cow on Parade statue and reminded him of home. This made him relax a bit and Ardel explored the city for hours. He came across many of the famous landmarks in Chicago, like a cool shiny ball, the Willis Tower, and the colorful Navy Pier. He even stopped by to visit some of the animals at the Lincoln Park Zoo. But as the days passed, Ardel started to feel homesick. He missed his cozy burrow and the warm sun of The Wilds. He longed to return home. Ardel grabbed a piece of delicious Chicago-style pizza (they didn't have termite flavored) and wandered over to the Shedd Aquarium to think. Watching the penguins frolic in the Oceanarium relaxed him. While he was there, a kind family noticed him and they took him in and gave him a warm place to stay. They wanted to get him home to Africa but called The Wilds Preserve for some advice. They found out that Ardel was from there! So the kind family took Ardel back to The Wilds. He said goodbye and knew he'd never forget his adventure in Chicago. It was nice being surrounded by familiar sights and sounds of the preserve. As he looked back on his adventure, he realized that though he had been lost and scared, he learned a valuable lesson - that kindness and friendship can be found all around us, even in those who are very different from us. The end - for now. (Ardell heard a family talking about how nice Detroit was this time of year ....)"},{"prompt":"Can you write up a box description for a new Nancy Drew computer game?

I am not as fit as I used to be so make sure they are no more than 5 or 6 miles long and not too difficult. I am also only there for a few days, so I only need three options.","completion":"Sure! Here are three appropriate hikes for you in Norway. 1. Pulpit Rock - otherwise known as Preikestolen, this is a very popular hike in Norway. While it is at the upper end of how far you would like to walk, it is considered easy to moderate in difficulty and has really amazing views. It is also easy to get to from the town of Stavanger, making it easily accessible. 2. Svolvaer Fløya and Svolvaergeita - this hike provides a great adventure in a short walk, allowing you the opportunity to simply hike up to the top of Fløya for one of the best views across all the islands or combine it with a rock climb up Svolvaergeita (otherwise known as The Goat). 3. Ryten and Kvalvika Beach - this hike in the Lofoten Islands involves a slightly strenuous hike to the top of a mountain, but is overall classed as easy to moderate. While it may be a bit more challenging, you will be rewarded with great views not only of mountains and fjords but also of a white sandy beach. There is also a mini version of Trolltunga as part of the route, an area that is great for taking photos without the long hike to see the real thing."},{"prompt":"Write a speech as if it was for an Apple press release for a new neural implant product called the iThink.

The future looks like this: the iThink. The iThink is a neural implant that can do everything your smart devices do . . . and more. What's more, it does it without the need to carry or wear a device on you. You simply need to think, \\"Hey Siri, call Mom,\\" to place a call. No more holding a phone to your head. The voice is transmitted directly into signals your brain can interpret completely bypassing any need for an ear. Similarly, the iThink augments the way you see the world. Look at an item in a store window. The iThink will automatically search the web for comparisons and show you price matches in an augmented reality display. Do you need to get up in the middle of the night? The iThink will increase your vision in the dark allowing you to traverse your home without waking up the missus. With the iThink replacing or augmenting most of your important sensory functions, who can afford to live the life of a lesser human? That is why we set the price for this at a mere 9,000 with the iThink+ at 19,000 and the iThink+ Pro at 50,000. We're proud to be sponsoring the new evolution of the human race.

The second was the movie The Mark of Zorro. “Zorro’s use of a mask to conceal his identity,” Kane writes, “gave me the idea of giving Batman a secret identity.” The third influence on Batman was a movie Kane saw the year before his attack by the Vultures: The Bat Whispers, an adaptation of a novel by Mary Roberts Rinehart. In the movie a detective tries to track down a mysterious killer, the Bat, and at the end of the film the detective is revealed to be the killer himself.

What should I do?","completion":"Here are some suggestions that may help with returning a lost dog. Make sure to look up local laws and regulations regarding lost animals before proceeding. 1. Contact the local relevant authorities: This is especially true if the dog is aggressive. You should not put yourself in harm's way to capture or restrain an aggressive animal. If there are specific guidelines in your area for the handling of lost or stray dogs, the relevant authorities, like animal control, should be able to inform you of them. 2. Leave the dog with an animal shelter: If you are unable to take care of the dog for an extended period of time, it may be best to leave it at an animal shelter. It is best to research what resources, facilities, and services are available and willing in your area to accept the dog before you drop off the dog. 3. Post on social media: Social media groups that are local to your area might be able to spread awareness of a lost dog, and thus help you return it to its owner. Note that it remains important to take care with posting personal or private information online. 4. Ask neighbors in the area: It may be logical to surmise that the dog's owner is not too far from where you found the dog. Introducing yourself and the situation politely to neighbors in the area could result in a quick resolution. 5. Put up a flyer or poster: If you are able to take care of the dog for an extended period of time, you could put up a flyer or poster alerting people to the dog. It is important to include a description of the dog as well as a photo in order to help the owner identify that it is indeed their dog. 6. Check with a vet: Perhaps the dog is microchipped; it may be useful to contact a vet who may help with identifying the owner if the dog has indeed been chipped."},{"prompt":"Please use the text below and extract the withdrawal symptoms from stopping citalopram (use lowercase words too).

Here are some common mistakes you should avoid before creating business cards: 1. Outdated Information: Don't give off a bad impression by having information on your card that is no longer accurate. Order new cards if necessary. 2. Misprints and Typos: Grammatical errors and typos can make your business appear unprofessional. Always proofread your card before printing. 3. Image Quality: High-resolution images are essential for clear printing. Avoid pixelated or blurry images that can detract from your card's design. 4. Poor-Quality Card Stock: Selecting the appropriate card stock is critical. Using flimsy or low-quality paper can make your business appear cheap and unreliable. 5. Unreadable Text or Tiny Print: A well-designed card shouldn't compromise readability. Avoid using hard-to-read fonts or tiny prints that make it difficult for customers to read your contact details. 6. Focus on the Value: Your business card should communicate what problems you can solve and what value you provide to potential customers. 7. Lack of Branding: Building brand recognition is key to differentiating yourself from competitors. Make sure your card reflects your branding elements, such as your color scheme and logo design. 8. Visual Clutter: Avoid overwhelming your card with too many graphics, images, or text. Create enough white space to keep your designs clean and readable."},{"prompt":"I want to persuade my dad to let me have a puppy.

Here is the article to reference: Consumer products released more than 5,000 tons of chemicals in 2020 inside California homes and workplaces that are known to cause cancer, adversely affect sexual function and fertility in adults or harm developing fetuses, according to our newly published study. We found that many household products like shampoos, body lotions, cleaners and mothballs release toxic volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, into indoor air. In addition, we identified toxic VOCs that are prevalent in products heavily used by workers on the job, such as cleaning fluids, adhesives, paint removers and nail polish. However, gaps in laws that govern ingredient disclosure mean that neither consumers nor workers generally know what is in the products they use. For this study we analyzed data from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), which tracks VOCs released from consumer products in an effort to reduce smog. The agency periodically surveys companies that sell products in California, collecting information on concentrations of VOCs used in everything from hair spray to windshield wiper fluid. Analysis of the world, from experts We cross-referenced the most recent data with a list of chemicals identified as carcinogens or reproductive/developmental toxicants under California’s right-to-know law, Proposition 65. This measure, enacted in 1986, requires businesses to notify Californians about significant exposure to chemicals that are known to cause cancer, birth defects or other reproductive harms. We found 33 toxic VOCs present in consumer products. Over 100 consumer products covered by the CARB contain VOCs listed under Prop 65. Of these, we identified 30 product types and 11 chemicals that we see as high priorities for either reformulation with safer alternatives or regulatory action because of the chemicals’ high toxicity and widespread use. Why it matters Our study identifies consumer products containing carcinogens and reproductive and developmental toxicants that are widely used at home and in the workplace. Consumers have limited information about these products’ ingredients. We also found that people are likely co-exposed to many hazardous chemicals together as mixtures through use of many different products, which often contain many chemicals of health concern. For example, janitors might use a combination of general cleaners, degreasers, detergents and other maintenance products. This could expose them to more than 20 different Prop 65-listed VOCs. Similarly, people experience aggregate exposures to the same chemical from multiple sources. Methanol, which is listed under Prop 65 for developmental toxicity, was found in 58 product categories. Diethanolamine, a chemical frequently used in products like shampoos that are creamy or foamy, appeared in 40 different product categories. Canada and the European Union prohibit its use in cosmetics because it can react with other ingredients to form chemicals that may cause cancer. Some chemicals, such as N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone and ethylene gylcol, are listed under Prop 65 because they are reproductive or developmental toxicants. Yet they appeared widely in goods such as personal care products, cleansers and art supplies that are routinely used by children or people who are pregnant. Our findings could help state and federal agencies strengthen chemical regulations. We identified five chemicals – cumene, 1,3-dichloropropene, diethanolamine, ethylene oxide and styrene – as high-priority targets for risk evaluation and management under the Toxic Substances Control Act by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. A hotel housekeeper stands next to her cart, piled with towels and bottled cleaning supplies. Many jobs, including custodian and hotel housekeeper, involve close-range exposure to multiple chemicals daily. Jeff Greenberg/Universal Images Group via Getty Images What still isn’t known Our analysis of the CARB data on volatile toxicants does not paint a complete picture. Many toxic chemicals, such as lead, PFAS and bisphenol A (BPA), don’t have to be reported to the Air Resources Board because they are not volatile, meaning that they don’t readily turn from liquid to gas at room temperature. In addition, we were not able to identify specific products of concern because the agency aggregates data over whole categories of products. What other research is being done Studies have shown that women generally use more cosmetic, personal care and cleaning products than men, so they are likely to be more highly exposed to harmful chemicals in these categories. Further, women working in settings like nail salons may be exposed from products used both personally and professionally. Research by members of our team has also shown that product use varies by race and ethnicity, partly due to racialized beauty standards. Policy interventions could be tailored to prioritize these potentially more-highly exposed groups. Ultimately, a right-to-know law like Prop 65 can only go so far in addressing toxics in products. We’ve found in other research that some manufacturers do choose to reformulate their products to avoid Prop 65 chemicals, rather than having to warn customers about toxic ingredients. But Prop 65 does not ban or restrict any chemicals, and there is no requirement for manufacturers to choose safer substitutes. We believe our new analysis points to the need for national action that ensures consumers and workers alike have safer products.","completion":"Janitors, custodians, hotel housekeepers, women working in nail salons."},{"prompt":"Give me a summary of the three little pigs.

One of the dogs is young and hyper, and the other dog is old and tired, but still tolerates the younger dog.","completion":"The yellow giant rose on its two legs, and then--BOOM--came back down with a deafening crash that would have bounced the ant skyward, if not for the gripping nature of its delicate legs. Well, deafening was just a bit of an exaggeration, the ant learned, because it was nothing compared to the shrieking yelp the giant gave afterward. The other giant, a chocolate brown one, bared its teeth briefly. Then, it gave a huffing, defeated sigh through its nose, laying its head down on its massive, clawed feet. The puff of wind it sent pealed the ant's front legs off of the floor, making the tiny bug look like it was a bucking bronco with its antennae waving wildly from all the over-stimulation it was finding itself put through. What are these things? The ant wondered. Food? The minuscule bug found itself pulled forward as if on a string. Instinct was driving the tiny ant at this point, one foot in front of the other, then another in front of the next until it found itself basked in the shadows of the two creatures. The yellow one was too wild to approach, and the ant felt torn at the realization. On one hand, the ant was a warrior. It had been through many a battle before and survived, through bravery and tactical retreat. On the other hand, the ant knew that its job was also to be a scout, to find food for the rest of the kingdom. And, most importantly, the queen. But if the other ants back home found out about these two massive threats, wouldn't they be disappointed? Disgusted? It was their job to protect the queen, the babies. The nest itself. Without thinking, the ant opened up its pinchers wide and sank them into the endless expanse of dark, rough texture on the bottom of the yellow dog's foot. This was merely to secure itself. The real attack was only beginning. Before the dog could react, the ant began driving its stinger into the scratchy surface of the giant's paw pad, sinking it in and out, pumping the flesh full of venom. Then the giant lifted its paw, scraped it against the concrete, and the ant was snuffed out. Just like that."},{"prompt":"I have a small business and I want to start using social media to grow my customer base and online presence. Help me brainstorm some social media platforms, other than Facebook, that are good for businesses to be on.","completion":"I can gladly provide you with some ideas besides Facebook. Here is a list of some social media sites you may want to explore: 1. YouTube - If your business uses video marketing, then this is a great option to showcase that video content and also connect with current and potential customers. People like to see products being used, tutorials and news that is relevant to your business's niche, and highlights of happy customers. Updates on the business growth, new launches, and upcoming meet-and-greet opportunities might also be included. 2. WhatsApp - Staying in communication with customers is a big part of a business's success and this platform is built for communication. People turn to this social media app for things like providing fast customer support, pushing out shipping updates, and even letting people know about sales and specials. 3. Instagram - The popularity of this social media platform originally came due to amazing photo filters, which remain a key part of the site. If your business creates a product or performs a visually stunning service, you might just find that Instagram is the perfect place to showcase these images for the world to see. 4. Twitter - Considered a microblogging site, this platform is largely popular for people who want to share or receive news and other real-time information. If your business is focused on trends in the financial, news, entertainment, or sports world, it may be a great fit. Alternatively, Twitter can be a resource to help your business with market research projects and insights. 5. LinkedIn - When it comes to connecting with other businesses and members of the business community, this platform is generally preferred above all the rest. Use it for recruiting employees, connecting with potential partners, researching vendors, or networking with other professionals and business owners. It can also be a valuable resource for understanding how to develop strong business branding. 6. Pinterest - People and businesses alike love this site because it is a place to be inspired and provides a way to organize things they find around the web into convenient boards where they can accumulate ideas and information. Pinterest is pretty image heavy, but it also includes videos and GIFs, and is a great platform for a business that wants to showcase its products, services, or anything innovative and interesting. 7. TikTok - If short, catchy videos are something that your business creates well, this platform might be a good fit. It has gained major popularity with companies that want to target a younger audience of customers, as well as those who love to showcase their products creatively and in new ways."},{"prompt":"I want a hyphenated list of 16 positive adjectives that begin with the letter M.","completion":"- Magnificent - Majestic - Marvelous - Mature - Meaningful - Mellow - Memorable - Merry - Meticulous - Mighty - Mindful - Miraculous - Modest - Momentous - Moral - Motivating"},{"prompt":"Help me write a Pinterest post announcing a blog article about the best plants to grow in sandy soil.

Their first celebrity hired was chef Gordon Ramsey. Gordon was quiet and polite during his flight attendant training, and he paid close attention to all guidance provided. Soon, he was ready to begin his new position and was assigned to United Flight 15, from Jackson, Mississippi to Los Angeles, California. Nattily dressed in his crisply-starched United Airlines uniform, Gordon stood at his assigned station at the plane's entrance and greeted each passenger as they boarded. “You! Slow-poke! Speed it up, we have 200 passengers behind you and we don’t have all day for this!” he said to an elderly woman. A woman with a baby was advised, “Keep that kid quiet on my flight! Nobody wants to hear a baby screeching at 12,000 feet!” “Is that supposed to be an emotional support dog?” he demanded of a bald, emaciated young man. “He’s so mangey, you’re his emotional support human! Sit down!” The next passenger was Gordon’s doppleganger. They had not yet met, but the man was on his way to L.A. to be Gordon’s double in an upcoming action movie. Gordon slowly looked him up and down, then nodded and didn’t say a word. Finally, every seat on the plane was full, and Gordon's duties were complete. He went to the galley and strapped himself into a seat for the remainder of the flight. Comment cards and pencils were handed out to all passengers for feedback on the new celebrity flight attendant program, and the seasoned flight attendants were shocked: \\"I need to get that hip replaced soon!\\" “Best flight ever! I do need to lose some weight!” \\"I hate screaming babies on planes, too!\\" “He’s right, I should probably get my emotional support dog to the vet.” “Gordon is a fine-looking man and anyone would be lucky to play his double in a movie.” Gordon was a unanimous success, and United Airlines is now rolling out this program throughout the fleet. Celebrity flight attendants will include Simon Cowell, Judy Tenuta, and Roseanne Barr. Book your flight today!"},{"prompt":"Make me a list of the top five movies to watch from the 90s.

He managed to survive but was in a coma and would not respond to anyone or anything. His wife, parents, and children stayed at his bedside for many months hoping he would suddenly wake up, but with no guarantees and no time limit to how long a coma can last, it was anyone's guess when (or if) he would wake up. As time went by, the man's wife, parents, and children began to come to the hospital less frequently, until after one year they stopped visiting altogether. Then one day, five years later, the man woke up to the surprise of the hospital's nurses and doctors. It was a miracle that the man woke up, especially after such a long period of being in a coma, that they looked upon him as if he had risen from the dead. One of the nurses decided to call the man's family to inform them of the news. The man's wife, parents, and children rushed to the hospital upon hearing the news and smiled and cried tears of joy at the man's recovery. When they finally settled their emotions, they asked the man one of the most pressing questions anyone who had never been in a coma would ask: What was it like being in a coma? The man contemplated this for several seconds despite already knowing the answer to the question; he wanted to ensure he was able to fully explain what the experience was like being in a coma. \\"I had...dreams...very, very vivid dreams,\\" he said, his voice cracking. As the tears started to stream down his face, he recalled the nature of his dreams. \\"The last thing I remember is being in the train tunnel before being hit by the train. I saw a light at the end of the train tunnel, and it became really bright and struck me like a ton of bricks in the face. Then the light began to fade and recede back toward the end of the tunnel. I kept trying to run toward the light, but my legs couldn't move fast enough to reach it. Then, I woke up. But it felt like I had been running for about five full minutes.

I also saw that big can of Red Mouse on your desk. Have you considered quitting caffeine? I know it's normal to drink it, but oddly enough it could be causing your sleepiness. See, caffeine found in coffee, energy drinks, and even tea acts as a central nervous system stimulant. That makes you feel more awake, but when you tunnel down into what's really happening, it's kind of scary. It boosts stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline that you'd get from entering a fight-or-flight state. I know sometimes we all get passionate about fighting for the protection of beaver dams but getting worked up could make it harder to have a fiery speech when it comes time to pitch the group's values.

That was your argument that saved the Big Stick Highway in Vermont! If you think about it, caffeine can make you nervous and it can make it harder to sleep.

Inside, she found a dim room empty except for several desks with computer terminals, all covered with a fine layer of dust. Holding her breath, Nina looked to her right and ever so gently flipped the switch she found there. A series of overhead lights snapped on, flickering but spilling precious light over the room. Nina could not contain her excitement, and she screamed an animal cry of triumph.

In 1284 the last king of Tumapel in Java captured Bali, but Bali regained its independence after he died in 1292. Next, Bali came under the rule of the Majapahit Empire of eastern Java in 1343 and continued to be controlled by that empire until 1478. Dutch settlers first landed in Bali in 1597. The Dutch annexed some northern Balinese states in 1882 and continued to aggressively invade (they even killed the Balinese prince in 1894) until 1906 when they massacred over 3,600 locals while capturing the entire island. In 1946 Indonesian revolutionary forces fought against Dutch troops.

The story should be around 300 words long and interesting.","completion":"In the African Savannah, all the animals knew the lion was their king. He was an incredible hunter, and his mane made him look fierce and majestic. The hyena, however, didn’t think the lion deserved to be their king. So, he went to the lion one day to find out what made him so special. The hyena asked, “Lion, why do all the animals consider you their king?” The lion considered his question for a moment and then said, “Because of my roar. It is unlike that of any other animal.” The hyena seemed unconvinced. “Many animals make amazing sounds, like the trumpet of the elephant or the snort of the wildebeest. In fact, I have the most unique sound of all!” “Then let’s have a competition,” the lion suggested. “If your call is better, you can be king.” The hyena wants to be crowned the king of the Savannah. That’s why he quickly breaks out a laugh. It’s certainly one of the most unique sounds in the Serengeti! The lion listened patiently. But after he was done, he let out a roar so loud it shook the ground and shocked all the other animals far away. The hyena was too stunned to speak, so the lion said, “I am the king because my roar can be heard all across the plains. A king is one whose voice must reach all of his subjects, so they know he is always there for them.” The hyena bowed to the lion, humbled, and from that day on he accepted and respected the lion as the king of the African Savannah."},{"prompt":"I know this is weird, but I HATE cheese.

When analyzing the story from the critical perspective of feminism, there is a clear discrepancy in how the woman and men are described and the roles they play within the story. Women are debased to their looks and manner, only being truly valued when they appeal to the needs and wants of the men around them. This is consistent with one of Stoker’s common concerns which is gender roles. He used this theme in several ways throughout the text, but it can be seen distinctly in the graveyard scene. Stoker uses a theme of the fear of the unknown to achieve a separation between the men and the women within the churchyard scene. By instructing Mina to stay behind, the characters physically separate themselves from the women in the story. Additionally, the fact that Lucy is a supernatural being rather than a human within that scene contributes to the idea that women are separate and lesser than whilst also being a compelling gothic convention. It is an obvious portrayal of dehumanization. This is also achieved through how they are speaking about Lucy in the tomb. It becomes clear that the value of the women in the story is confined to their usefulness and appeal to the men around them. They talk of how killing her will result in the return of her beauty and how she will revert back to Arthur’s Lucy and be at rest. This scene is poignant as it is a group of men deciding the fate of a woman based on the idea that she has strayed away from their ideal. Whilst this is understandable under the circumstances, within the scope of Stoker's concerns it adopts a larger significance and comes to represent the idea that women should be predictable and ownable. Uncontrolled women are a danger to the society that they exist within. So in a way, the obstruction of agency that the male characters inflict upon Lucy and Mina is representative of a larger fear of the unknown."},{"prompt":"May you explain to me how exec() works in Javascript?","completion":"The exec() method tests for a match in a string.

What are six ways that I can rev my brain and be more “awake” in the am?","completion":"Not everyone is an early bird, but many night owls still have AM responsibilities. Here are six ways to rev up your brain to feel more alert and attentive in the mornings when it’s hard to get out of bed! 1. Take a cold shower with revitalizing scents to jolt your nervous system! Most people don’t want to get out of the warm embrace of their blankets, so a cold shower may take time to work up to. The cold water is an immediate wake-up call to your nervous system, but a lukewarm shower with revitalizing scents in shampoo and body wash can be just as effective. The best scents for alertness are spicy or have citrus notes, such as orange, cinnamon, rosemary, and peppermint. 2. Avoid the allure of sugary cereals and other sweet breakfast foods. While it may be tempting to grab a doughnut and a Frappuccino on the way to work, resist the urge. Sweet breakfasts will increase your blood sugar, which can make you feel alert for a few hours before a hard crash of fatigue in the afternoon. Stick to a hearty, healthy breakfast with protein and heart-healthy fats instead. Eggs and bacon are a classic, but you could also blend a smoothie, have a slice of avocado toast, or opt for rolled oats with berries and a glass of whole milk. 3. Drink a glass of ice-cold water before your morning cup of coffee. Many people can’t wait to have their cup of coffee in the mornings but steer clear until you’ve awakened your mind and body with a cold glass of water. Dehydration is a common cause of fatigue, so a glass of cold water will refresh your nervous system to get you moving in the AM. 4. Listen to something upbeat, like a comedic, engaging podcast or your favorite “get up and go” music. Putting yourself in a good “go-getter” mood will help you awaken your senses in the mornings. Upbeat music or laughter are both great ways to help you feel more alert and prepped to take on the day. 5. Stretch and work out fatigue with a quick walk outdoors. Not only will a good stretch and regular exercise help you sleep better, but a quick stroll outdoors in the morning is a change of scenery that tells your body and mind that it’s time to wake up for the day. Slow stretches work out kinks that accumulate in muscles while asleep. 6. Allow natural sunlight to permeate your surroundings in the mornings. This one may make you groan with dread, but sunshine suppresses melatonin production within your body. Melatonin is the chemical that makes you sleepy, and that’s encouraged in dark environments. Standing in sunlight for a few minutes after you wake up tells your mind and body that the day is getting started."},{"prompt":"What is the smallest country in the world?","completion":"It may be small, but have no pity. the smallest country in the world is Vatican City!!!

It was a crisp autumn day with perfect flying conditions. There was very little wind and not a cloud in the sky. The plane began to gain altitude, and happiness rushed through Henry's heart.

What is it called when someone has compromised far acuity? What is it called when someone has compromised near acuity? Visual acuity (VA) commonly refers to the clarity of vision, but technically rates a person's ability to recognize small details with precision. Visual acuity depends on optical and neural factors. Optical factors of the eye influence the sharpness of an image on its retina. Neural factors include the health and functioning of the retina, of the neural pathways to the brain, and of the interpretative faculty of the brain.[1] The most commonly referred-to visual acuity is distance acuity or far acuity (e.g., \\"20/20 vision\\"), which describes someone's ability to recognize small details at a far distance. This ability is compromised in people with myopia, also known as short-sightedness or near-sightedness. Another visual acuity is near acuity, which describes someone’s ability to recognize small details at a near distance. This ability is compromised in people with hyperopia, also known as long-sightedness or far-sightedness.","completion":"A short definition of visual acuity is someone's ability to notice small, precise details.

History, Science, Technology, Arts, etc. The crisis in Venezuela is an ongoing socioeconomic and political crisis that began in Venezuela during the presidency of Hugo Chávez and has worsened in Nicolás Maduro's presidency. It has been marked by hyperinflation, escalating starvation,[6] disease, crime and mortality rates, resulting in massive emigration from the country.[7] The situation is by far the worst economic crisis in Venezuela's history, and is also the worst facing a country in peacetime since the mid-20th century. The crisis is often considered to be more severe than that of the United States during the Great Depression, the 1985–1994 Brazilian economic crisis, or the 2008–2009 hyperinflation in Zimbabwe.[8] Other writers have also compared aspects of the crisis, such as unemployment and GDP contraction, to that of Bosnia and Herzegovina after the 1992–1995 Bosnian War, and those in Russia, Cuba and Albania following the collapse of the Eastern Bloc in 1989 and the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.[9][10] On 2 June 2010, Chávez declared an \\"economic war\\" due to increasing shortages in Venezuela. The crisis intensified under the Maduro government, growing more severe as a result of low oil prices in early 2015,[11] and a drop in Venezuela's oil production from lack of maintenance and investment.[12] In January 2016, the opposition-led National Assembly declared a \\"health humanitarian crisis\\".[13] The government failed to cut spending in the face of falling oil revenues, and has dealt with the crisis by denying its existence[14] and violently repressing opposition.[12][15] Extrajudicial killings by the Venezuelan government became common, with the United Nations (UN) reporting 5,287 killings by the Special Action Forces in 2017, with at least another 1,569 killings recorded in the first six months of 2019, stating that some of the killings were \\"done as a reprisal for [the victims'] participation in anti-government demonstrations.\\"[16]","completion":"The subject of this article can be categorized as History.

They always wore blue while the neighborhood wore black; they had brown hair while everyone else in the neighborhood was blonde; and they would have barbecues on Saturdays while everyone in the neighborhood had them on Sundays. Mr. Peterson decided he really didn’t like them, and so he spent every day steering clear of them. One day when he came home from work, he saw his son Michael playing with the Smith children. Outraged, Mr. Peterson called Michael over. His son came running over with his soccer ball, wondering why his father had interrupted their game. “Were you playing with the neighbors?” Mr. Peterson asked worriedly. “Yes,” Michael replied with a grin. “They’re great fun!” “Unbelievable! How can you play with them when they wear black and when we wear blue? They have brown hair when we are blonde. And they have barbecues on Saturday mornings when we have them on Sundays!” Michael looked at his father, quite confused, and then asked, “So what?” Mr. Peterson was stunned. He had no answer for his son – really, so what? So what if they wore blue, had brown hair, or preferred to have barbecues on Saturdays? “Well, nothing, I suppose,” Mr. Peterson said gingerly, beginning to see the error of his ways. “I’m sorry for interrupting your game, Michael. You go have fun with your new friends.”"},{"prompt":"I'm a mother of three boys, going to serve them pumpkin pie. The cat breaks and bites the pies, so I have to serve them sweet potato pie instead.

This is particularly true with the loss of a loved one. Pain and grief come to the family and hits hard, especially to children. Children often feel it more intensely and may have a harder time recovering from the loss. How do you deal with the grief and the pain? How will you help your children who are looking to you for stability and security? Here are some reminders to help you as you deal with grief yourself and also try to muster up the comfort that your children may need during this difficult time. - Make time for your grief. The process of grieving takes time – there may be even some instances when you feel that the grief will just not let up. The time immediately after the death of a loved one may be a busy one – there is the funeral and burial to be arranged, well-wishers and mourners to be looked after. However, you should give yourself and your family time to sit down and grieve. Acknowledge your feelings – don’t suppress them. - Grieve in your own way. People grieve in different ways. As long as you are not doing anything harmful to yourself or others, you can choose to grieve in your own way. Don’t allow anyone to set a timetable for your grief or tell you how to feel. In the same way, don’t push children to overcome their grief within a certain timetable. - Realize that it’s normal to be angry. Anger is a part of the process of grieving. Your children may go through a period where they express anger at what has happened that resulted in the tragic loss of a loved one. Don’t belittle or deny the child’s feelings but reassure him or her of your presence at this time."},{"prompt":"Where does the 9-5 work day come from?","completion":"The 9-5 workday became mainstream in 1926 when Ford Motor Company, founded by Henry Ford, became one of the first companies to make its work policy a 40-hour week with five working days.

And they held true to this policy for the next few decades, even as the events leading up to WWII began to unfold. Even as Hitler and Mussolini rose to power, the majority of Americans wanted to stay focused on the current U.S. issues such as recovering from the Great Depression. In 1933 FDR was elected president, and he quickly realized that at some point America would need to stand up against Hitler's Nazi regime. FDR began finding ways to assist in the conflict without violating America's neutrality. In 1939 and 1940, the U.S. began supplying Britain with weapons, supplies, and even tanks. Although FDR kept finding ways to assist the Allied powers, many U.S. isolationists viewed Roosevelt's actions as a way to drag the United States back into an unnecessary war. Even after Roosevelt met with Winston Churchill and created the Atlantic Charter. Roosevelt hoped that this charter would help swing American opinion on the war, but it had very little impact. In a wild sequence of events, the United States was drawn into the global war due to the actions of the Japanese at Pearl Harbor. Just a day after the events at Pearl Harbor, Congress declared war on Japan. Japan's allies in Germany and Italy responded by declaring war on the United States."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a delicious lunch in the greek islands","completion":"We pull up alongside a small jetty. The man reaches out with sinewed arms and knobbly hands to grab the rope that Kostas throws towards him. He ties the rope onto the buoy where his own boat is tied. He lifts his broad sun-lined face from under the black wool peaked cap. His blue eyes twinkle. Old man of the sea or not, he is fit and well. He grabs our hands and helps us out of our dinghy onto the jetty. The old man leads us along a rocky path towards a house. Glazed blue ceramic jars line the front, whitewashed wall of the house. A large wooden barrel stands in front of an open door and blackened pots and pans hang from a wooden post. It is an outside kitchen. We all introduce ourselves and the old man, Sestos, invites us to follow him. On the sunny side of his house is a garden with tomatoes and cucumbers scrambling along the rocky ground. I lean down to take a closer look and Sestos hands me a wicker basket. I pick four tomatoes and a cucumber. Sestos washes the harvested tomatoes in a plastic bowl of water collected from the spring in the side of the rocky cliff at the back of his house. As far as I can see, the bowl is the only plastic article here. Sestos piles the tomatoes, a slab of fetta and some black olives on top of the wooden barrel so we can all help ourselves. Plates are not necessary; this is a picnic after all. The tomatoes are fleshy, firm and fluted. I segment one tomato and place a slice of briny fetta on top. It does not need anything else. It is the taste of the Greek islands. From just inside the doorway Sestos brings out a small tin. He gently forks out small salted dried fish, locally known as marida, and that we know as whitebait. While we crunch on these morsels and nibble on black olives, Sestos ladles wine out of one of the blue jars into a ceramic jug. He then pours the wine into cups. The wine is white, sweet and surprisingly chilled. I feel blessed and euphoric and it is not just the wine.

What is the treatment?","completion":"Polymyalgia is actually called Polymyalgia Rheumatica or PMR. It is a condition whose main symptom is morning muscle stiffness primarily in the shoulders, neck and hips. This can be accompanied by pain and inflammation and lasts over 45 minutes. It can be difficult to diagnose PMR because the symptoms, including the lesser ones of extreme tiredness, loss of appetite, weight loss and depression, can be mistaken for other conditions. The cause is unknown but it is believed that both genetic and environmental factors could be responsible for the condition developing. It is more common in women than men and in over 65-year-olds. It is rare for PMR to develop in anyone under 50 years old. The main treatment is steroids. A medicine called prednisolone helps to relieve the symptoms. The course of steroids usually lasts between 1 and 2 years. There is a more serious condition called temporal arteritis which up to 1 in 5 PMR sufferers develop, which is inflammation of the arteries in the head and neck. Temporal arteritis, or giant cell arteritis, as it is also known requires urgent medical attention because it can lead to more serious problems than PMR, such as a stroke or blindness if it isn't treated quickly."},{"prompt":"What is the largest type of big cat?","completion":"The largest big cat is the tiger.

At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, Japanese time, at the moment when the atomic bomb flashed above Hiroshima, Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a clerk in the personnel department of the East Asia Tin Works, had just sat down at her place in the plant office and was turning her head to speak to the girl at the next desk. At that same moment, Dr. Masakazu Fujii was settling down cross-legged to read the Osaka Asahi on the porch of his private hospital, overhanging one of the seven deltaic rivers which divide Hiroshima; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor’s widow, stood by the window of her kitchen, watching a neighbor tearing down his house because it lay in the path of an air-raid-defense fire lane; Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a German priest of the Society of Jesus, reclined in his underwear on a cot on the top floor of his order’s three-story mission house, reading a Jesuit magazine, Stimmen der Zeit; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young member of the surgical staff of the city’s large, modern Red Cross Hospital, walked along one of the hospital corridors with a blood specimen for a Wassermann test in his hand; and the Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, pastor of the Hiroshima Methodist Church, paused at the door of a rich man’s house in Koi, the city’s western suburb, and prepared to unload a handcart full of things he had evacuated from town in fear of the massive B-29 raid which everyone expected Hiroshima to suffer. A hundred thousand people were killed by the atomic bomb, and these six were among the survivors. They still wonder why they lived when so many others died. Each of them counts many small items of chance or volition—a step taken in time, a decision to go indoors, catching one streetcar instead of the next—that spared him. And now each knows that in the act of survival he lived a dozen lives and saw more death than he ever thought he would see. At the time, none of them knew anything. The Reverend Mr. Tanimoto got up at five o’clock that morning. He was alone in the parsonage, because for some time his wife had been commuting with their year-old baby to spend nights with a friend in Ushida, a suburb to the north. Of all the important cities of Japan, only two, Kyoto and Hiroshima, had not been visited in strength by B-san, or Mr. B, as the Japanese, with a mixture of respect and unhappy familiarity, called the B-29; and Mr. Tanimoto, like all his neighbors and friends, was almost sick with anxiety. He had heard uncomfortably detailed accounts of mass raids on Kure, Iwakuni, Tokuyama, and other nearby towns; he was sure Hiroshima’s turn would come soon. He had slept badly the night before, because there had been several air-raid warnings. Hiroshima had been getting such warnings almost every night for weeks, for at that time the B-29s were using Lake Biwa, northeast of Hiroshima, as a rendezvous point, and no matter what city the Americans planned to hit, the Super-fortresses streamed in over the coast near Hiroshima. The frequency of the warnings and the continued abstinence of Mr. B with respect to Hiroshima had made its citizens jittery; a rumor was going around that the Americans were saving something special for the city. Mr. Tanimoto is a small man, quick to talk, laugh, and cry. He wears his black hair parted in the middle and rather long; the prominence of the frontal bones just above his eyebrows and the smallness of his mustache, mouth, and chin give him a strange, old-young look, boyish and yet wise, weak and yet fiery. He moves nervously and fast, but with a restraint which suggests that he is a cautious, thoughtful man. He showed, indeed, just those qualities in the uneasy days before the bomb fell. Besides having his wife spend the nights in Ushida, Mr. Tanimoto had been carrying all the portable things from his church, in the close-packed residential district called Nagaragawa, to a house that belonged to a rayon manufacturer in Koi, two miles from the center of town. The rayon man, a Mr. Matsui, had opened his then unoccupied estate to a large number of his friends and acquaintances, so that they might evacuate whatever they wished to a safe distance from the probable target area. Mr. Tanimoto had had no difficulty in moving chairs, hymnals, Bibles, altar gear, and church records by pushcart himself, but the organ console and an upright piano required some aid. A friend of his named Matsuo had, the day before, helped him get the piano out to Koi; in return, he had promised this day to assist Mr. Matsuo in hauling out a daughter’s belongings. That is why he had risen so early.","completion":"At exactly fifteen minutes past eight in the morning, on August 6, 1945, an unanticipated event struck Hiroshima. Miss Toshiko Sasaki, a diligent worker at the East Asia Tin Works, had just begun her day when the eerie silence was shattered by the appearance of an alien spaceship above the city. Simultaneously, Dr. Masakazu Fujii, engrossed in his morning read, was jolted by the alien arrival; Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura, a tailor’s widow, paused in her kitchen as the surreal scene unfolded; Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge was enjoying a peaceful morning when the strange ship appeared; Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, a young doctor at the Red Cross Hospital, found his routine disrupted by the sudden turn of events; and Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, while preparing to unload a handcart, was met with the shocking spectacle. An alien presence had manifested in Hiroshima, and these six individuals were among the first to experience it. They still ponder the reasons why they were chosen to witness such a monumental event, wondering about the strange turns of fate that led them to that moment. And now, each of them understands that in the act of witnessing, they have been thrust into a new era of interstellar relations, a reality more profound than they ever imagined. Earlier that day, Mr. Tanimoto, restless and uneasy, had risen at five in the morning. The cities of Kyoto and Hiroshima had been spared by the mysterious “B-san”, the unknown phenomenon, causing tension among their inhabitants. Hiroshima had been subject to numerous alerts of the imminent “B-san”, leading to rumors that the city was being kept for some extraordinary event. Mr. Tanimoto, a man of short stature but abundant energy, had a unique mix of youthfulness and wisdom, a peculiar balance of impulsiveness and restraint. In anticipation of an unknown disaster, he had been evacuating items from his church to a safer location. Mr. Tanimoto was driven by an uncanny sense of responsibility, even agreeing to help a friend evacuate his daughter's belongings. Little did he know that he was not preparing for a disaster, but for the first contact with an extraterrestrial civilization."},{"prompt":"In the text below, who is the person that discovered the underground city? Those are all fictional examples. But in 1963, that barrier was breached for real. Taking a sledgehammer to a wall in his basement, a man in the Turkish town of Derinkuyu got more home improvement than he bargained for. Behind the wall, he found a tunnel. And that led to more tunnels, eventually connecting a multitude of halls and chambers. It was a huge underground complex, abandoned by its inhabitants and undiscovered until that fateful swing of the hammer. The anonymous Turk—no report mentions his name—had found a vast subterranean city, up to 18 stories and 280 feet (76 meters) deep and large enough to house 20,000 people. Who built it, and why? When was it abandoned, and by whom? History and geology provide some answers. A hot air balloon with the Turkish flag sails past fairy chimneys, a rock formation typical for Cappadocia.

Help me think through what colors to wear to the interview and which ones are good for a first impression as a potential employee.","completion":"Here are a few color options for interviews and what they may portray to your potential employer: 1. Blue - This is the most highly recommended color to wear according to experts. The color blue can convey a feeling of trustworthiness and credibility, which are good traits no matter what position you're going for. 2. Black - This color is usually associated with leadership, strength, and ability. Of course, these are great qualities to convey, but keep in mind that it may appear to be too aloof if you're applying for a position in customer service for example. 3. Grey - This color, although neutral, can convey a logical and analytical professional. Keep in mind that if you tend to sweat when you're nervous, grey will show this more, so you may want to keep the color only on pants or a jacket. 4. White - White gives the impression of someone who is organized, detail-oriented, and clean. This is a classic color that can be matched with just about anything else, so consider adding some colorful accessories that show more of who you are."},{"prompt":"Write a scene from a story where the detective discovers who the murderer is.

Here are some tax tips for a self-employed person living in the US: 1. Make Estimated Quarterly Payments: The IRS requires all self-employed individuals in the US to make estimated quarterly payments for the tax they will owe at the end of the year. Doing this can help save on fines and penalties. 2. Save More Than Needed: Since it's almost impossible to estimate the exact amount of tax you will owe, it's always a good idea to put aside a little more than you think you might need. That way, if you do owe more, it won't be a problem, and if you end up getting some money back, it will be a nice surprise for your savings. 3. Keep Track of Expenses: The IRS allows you to write off business expenses, so make sure you keep track. Although they don't ask for evidence when submitting, they may if you're ever audited, so having receipts is a good idea. Some people keep a separate credit card and put all business expenses on that to make them easy to track. 4. Get a Professional Tax Preparer: Tax laws can be complicated, especially if you're self-employed. Getting a professional tax preparer can ensure you receive all of the refunds and credits you're entitled to, so you don't pay more than you have to. 5. Never Lie or Exaggerate: It's crucial to make sure you understand the IRS's rules and follow them. While they are generally forgiving of mistakes, tax evasion and avoidance are serious crimes. Since everyone's tax situation is different, make sure you do your research and consider the advice of a financial expert, as they'll know what the best things to do in your situation are and how to save you the most money."},{"prompt":"According to the text below, are macarons cheap or expensive to buy at the store?

His dad had just got home from work, and as usual, had started a fight with his mom the second he got home.

Black holes have incredibly powerful gravitational pulls. They usually gobble up everything around them. However, for the first time ever, scientists have found a black hole that is creating millions of stars as it zips through space. Pieter Van Dokkum, a professor of Astronomy and Physics at Yale University, made the exciting discovery accidentally. He was looking for star clusters in an image captured by NASA's Hubble Telescope when he spotted a light trail. \\"I was just scanning through the Hubble image, and then I noticed that we have a little streak. I immediately thought, 'oh, a cosmic ray hitting the camera detector and causing a linear imaging artifact.' When we eliminated cosmic rays, we realized it was still there. It didn't look like anything we've seen before,\\" Dokkum explains. Professor Dokkum noticed an unusual light streak in this photo captured by the Hubble Telescope (Credit: NASA, ESA, Pieter van Dokkum (Yale); Image Processing: Joseph DePasquale -STScI) Curious to know where the light trail was coming from, Dokkum and his team decided to investigate further. They used the powerful telescopes at Hawaii's Mauna Kea Observatory. To their astonishment, they discovered that the streak was from a 200,000-light-year-long chain of newborn stars. This is twice the diameter of our Milky Way galaxy. The scientists say the stars are caused by a supermassive black hole racing through the gas clouds at an unbelievable speed. If it were in our solar system, the black hole, which weighs as much as 20 million Suns, could travel from Earth to the Moon in just 14 minutes. This is too fast for it to catch anything in its path. Instead, it is creating a string of new stars. \\"We think we're seeing a wake behind the black hole where the gas cools and is able to form stars. So, we're looking at star formation trailing the black hole,\\" Dokkum said.","completion":"Scientists recently discovered a black hole that creates stars as it moves through space.

Why make an aggressive but risky investment that'll keep you up at night if you can take a safer bet and still reach your goal? 2️⃣ Look for ways to minimize miscellaneous costs. Taxes, fees, transaction costs — They all eat into profits. 💰 Start accounts and funds that offer tax breaks or other advantages: - IRAs & HRAs - UGMA/UTMA accounts - Education Savings accounts And be cautious of the fees charged by financial planners or advisers. 🤑 Work with professionals who have a flat rate instead of those who charge a percentage of the assets they manage. 3️⃣ Stick with the plan. You might think that the hardest part of financial planning is creating the plan. It's not. The hardest part is STICKING to the plan. 😅 We've all been there — you throw thousands into something that promises returns...eventually. But along the way the market drops.

The author has cited in many interviews that the character is the second favorite that she’s created. His kindness, generosity, and quirkiness were inspired by Rowling’s imaginings of what her father should have been like when she was a child. She and her real father have a strained relationship, so Dumbledore is the idealistic version of what Rowling thinks a father should be. JK Rowling drew the name Dumbledore from the eighteenth-century nickname for bumblebees. She stated that when she imagined the headmaster, she thought of him as “walking around humming to himself” in the same manner as a buzzy bumblebee."},{"prompt":"Please write a tl;dr on the text.

Franklin used London as a base to travel. In 1771, he made short journeys through different parts of England, staying with Joseph Priestley at Leeds, Thomas Percival at Manchester, and Erasmus Darwin at Lichfield.[96] In Scotland, he spent five days with Lord Kames near Stirling and stayed for three weeks with David Hume in Edinburgh. In 1759, he visited Edinburgh with his son and later reported that he considered his six weeks in Scotland \\"six weeks of the densest happiness I have met with in any part of my life\\".[97] In Ireland, he stayed with Lord Hillsborough. Franklin noted of him that \\"all the plausible behaviour I have described is meant only, by patting and stroking the horse, to make him more patient, while the reins are drawn tighter, and the spurs set deeper into his sides.\\"[98] In Dublin, Franklin was invited to sit with the members of the Irish Parliament rather than in the gallery. He was the first American to receive this honor.[96] While touring Ireland, he was deeply moved by the level of poverty he witnessed. The economy of the Kingdom of Ireland was affected by the same trade regulations and laws that governed the Thirteen Colonies. He feared that the American colonies could eventually come to the same level of poverty if the regulations and laws continued to apply to them.[99] Franklin spent two months in German lands in 1766, but his connections to the country stretched across a lifetime. He declared a debt of gratitude to German scientist Otto von Guericke for his early studies of electricity. Franklin also co-authored the first treaty of friendship between Prussia and America in 1785.[100] In September 1767, he visited Paris with his usual traveling partner, Sir John Pringle, 1st Baronet. News of his electrical discoveries was widespread in France. His reputation meant that he was introduced to many influential scientists and politicians, and also to King Louis XV.[5]","completion":"England, Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Prussia"},{"prompt":"Hi!

This will let you decorate without making it feel too casual. - Small plant: A small plant can look lovely, improve your mood, and won't look out of place in an office at all. - Desk mat: There are mats made for offices, which can be handy if you plan on eating at your desk or bringing coffee to work to make cleaning your area easy if you spill anything.

Greg, his boss, says in surprise,\\" When did you learn to speak French?\\" Adam responds, \\"I'm not sure I didn't think I knew how!\\" His boss brought Adam to his wife, who worked in the kitchen, and asked him to speak with her because she only knew French.

She just asked when you were going to be working next?\\" Adam looked at his wife, Marie, and tried responding in French, but nothing came to mind. He told Greg to tell her tomorrow and excused himself to the restroom. Adam was very confused by these events and was determined to discover why. He conducted experiments speaking with Greg and Marie for the next three days. He didn't speak after he woke up until he got to the coffee shop.

It was not my first time in South Africa, you see. I spent many a holiday vacationing among the beautiful windswept grasses enjoying myself among the many fine gentlemen and gentlewomen of the social club. It was there that I became acquainted with my now long-time friend Allan Quartermaine. Adventures of his were quite well above what I would seek out on my best days, but I admit to a certain stirring of courage within myself upon hearing his story. With that, I set out upon the Savanah and subsequent desert around the Kalukawe River in search of the mightiest game for which I might test my mettle. For there is no greater test of a man's character than to be on the hunt while also being hunted himself. It is to be as close to nature as one may get. Upon my third day, I found a set of wide tracks indicative of a mighty elephant. Indeed, it led me right to a great herd gathered about a watering hole. They were not the game I sought, but I waited nonetheless. I knew that such a wellspring of life was bound to draw my quarry. My patience was well rewarded. In the twilight hours of the setting sun, I noticed the faint black with white spotted telltale of a tiger's ear. Sure enough, the predator stalked the perimeter of the watering hole. I took out my Winchester slowly from my concealed position and searched the surrounding grasses. From what I remembered from the guidebooks and the anecdotes of the fine men of the social club, there ought to be two more tigers. There! I saw the second. It had its haunches raised stalking around the right side closer to me than the other. That only left the third. Hearing a row rumble and the slight shifting of grasses behind me, I spun on my heel to see the great beast pounce right toward me!

The text is as follows: Debt ceiling: How the 2023 drama is ‘100% different’ than 2011 Many in Washington and Wall Street are looking to 2011 as a reason not to freak out about the current debt-ceiling standoff. That year, a similar crisis ended with a last-minute agreement. Investors “are thinking, I've seen this movie many times before and I know the end of it,” Moody's Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi said. Stay ahead of the market But should investors really be so sanguine? Maybe not, according to Mike Sommers, who had a front-row seat to the drama in 2011 as chief of staff for then-Speaker John Boehner. This year’s showdown, he said, “is 100% different,” adding: “I just don't know where the deal space is here.” Several key factors that were in place during 2011 are missing this time around. Back then, the talks began much earlier and there was a different political environment and mutual agreement from the get go that deficit reduction was a top priority for both sides. President Obama and Boehner also socialized in their off hours, making dealmaking a little easier. “We had a willing dance partner in President Obama who understood that the political dynamics changed significantly in 2010 and that he needed a deal on this,” said Sommers, who is now the CEO of the American Petroleum Institute. Both the current standoff and 2011 are similar in one respect: They feature a Democratic president on the eve of a re-election bid facing off against a newly ascendant House GOP majority intent on curbing what they see as his excesses. But those 2011 talks began early and after Obama had established the Bowles-Simpson Commission a year earlier with a mission of finding a balanced budget. Those talks also featured a completely different personal dynamic between the leaders. Obama and Boehner saw each other again and again in the months that led up to that deal, from the formal meetings to golf outings. By contrast, President Biden and Speaker McCarthy have only been in the same room a handful of times in 2023 and their interactions have more often been notable for heated remarks and personal acrimony. Staff meetings also only began in recent days as the leaders belatedly try to find their way to a bipartisan deal against a very tight timeline","completion":"The debt ceiling problem in 2023 is not the same as it was in 2011. The people are different now and want different things. In 2011, the two sides argued, like President Obama and Boehner, but they also talked a lot and were friends outside of work.

NES - The NES came out in America in 1985, and it helped the North American video game market recover from its crash in 1983. This console was a place to play 8-bit titles, and it was the best-selling gaming console of its time. Originally, the NES was marketed as Famicom in Japan, but it was renamed to the NES when it came to America. When it came out, there was a 99 option that came with Super Mario Bros. There was also a 199.99 deluxe set that came with accessories and two games. 2. SNES - Nintendo followed up the NES with the SNES in 1990. This makes it the second home console developed by Nintendo, and it was also a huge success. When it was released, it had to compete with Sega's Mega Drive. That being said, the Nintendo titles played a role in making it the best-selling console of its time. There were different versions, and cartridges couldn't be played on consoles that came from another country. The SNES was called the Super Famicom in Japan. 3. Virtual Boy - The Virtual Boy came out in 1995, and it was a torchlight in virtual reality. That being said, it was a disaster in terms of its release. This console could be placed on a surface, and players could see it by leaning forward into the visor. This made some players feel sick to their stomachs, and it had a very short lifespan. 4. Nintendo 64 - The Nintendo 64 came out in 1996, and it utilized a 64-bit CPU, making it truly powerful for its time. The Nintendo 64 was less popular than previous consoles, and this was in part due to the competition from Sony and Sega. Today, it's still known as an amazing console. 5. Nintendo GameCube - The GameCube came out in 2001, and it was the first Nintendo console to use optical discs. It also allowed players to save their games through the use of memory cards that went up to 64 MB. The Gamecube came by at a time with a lot of competition.

HEN the spotted cat first found the nest, there was nothing in it, for it was only just finished. So she said, “I will wait!” for she was a patient cat, and the summer was before her. She waited a week, and then she climbed up again to the top of the tree, and peeped into the nest. There lay two lovely blue eggs, smooth and shining. The spotted cat said, “Eggs may be good, but young birds are better. I will wait.” So she waited; and while she was waiting, she caught mice and rats, and washed herself and slept, and did all that a spotted cat should do to pass the time away. When another week had passed, she climbed the tree again and peeped into the[58] nest. This time there were five eggs. But the spotted cat said again, “Eggs may be good, but young birds are better. I will wait a little longer!” So she waited a little longer and then went up again to look. Ah! there were five tiny birds, with big eyes and long necks, and yellow beaks wide open. Then the spotted cat sat down on the branch, and licked her nose and purred, for she was very happy. “It is worth while to be patient!” she said. But when she looked again at the young birds, to see which one she should take first, she saw that they were very thin,—oh, very, very thin they were! The spotted cat had never seen anything so thin in her life. “Now,” she said to herself, “if I were to wait only a few days longer, they would grow fat. Thin birds may be good, but fat birds are much better. I will wait!” So she waited; and she watched the father-bird bringing worms all day long to the nest, and said, “Aha! they must be fattening fast! they will soon be as fat as I wish them to be. Aha! what a good thing it is to be patient.” At last, one day she thought, “Surely, now they must be fat enough! I will not wait another day. Aha! how good they will be!” So she climbed up the tree, licking her chops all the way and thinking of the fat young birds. And when she reached the top and looked into the nest, it was empty!!

Lead with a generalization about how kingdoms rise and fall.","completion":"A kingdom once formed seems as though it will never fall. Such is the hubris of humankind to think empires are appointed to last an eternity, ever growing and never declining. The Kingdom of Arya certainly thought so. When it was founded, the world saw unprecedented peace and prosperity. Under new leadership, the kingdom thrived. A series of good harvest years and an abundance of natural resources led to seemingly infinite methods of advancement, whether technological, scientific, or cultural. The vice that felled Arya was greed. As natural resources began to dwindle, Arya looked to her allies and insisted that they assimilate for the betterment of humanity. Somehow, her allies took offense at this sentiment and refused, so Arya took what she wanted by force. Allies became enemies until the entire continent fell under her rule, subservient, yet still hostile to the government that had divinely appointed itself ruler of the planet. An infection began to spread and metastasized across the kingdom until cities became fiefdoms, each lord clinging to their own sliver of land. They were cutthroat, killing and deceiving to claim what they perceived as their own. Border disputes raged, so much so that the central government could do nothing to ease her citizenry—that was if the subjugated and captive population could ever have been called her citizenry. Bitter feuds and bloodshed saw the central government collapse and splinter. Everyone who was part of the oligarchy fled overseas to avoid the wrath, and the newly independent people of Arya began to build a new kingdom of their own."},{"prompt":"Summarize the text into a numbered list that highlights the critical points of the story. Domestic rabbits need a regulated environment to protect against heat exhaustion or hypothermia. Wild rabbits don't have this problem and make their homes in various temperature extremes. Wild rabbits can be found in woods, forests, meadows, grasslands, deserts, tundra and wetlands. Wild rabbits create their own homes by tunneling into the ground. These tunnel systems are called warrens and include rooms for nesting and sleeping. They also have multiple entrances for quick escape. Warrens can be as deep as 9.84 feet (3 meters) underground, according to the Textbook of Rabbit Medicine. Rabbits are very social creatures and live in large groups called colonies. The busiest time of day for rabbits is at dusk and dawn, according to the Proceedings of the 8th World Rabbit Congress. This is when they venture out to find food. The low light allows them to hide from predators. Predators — which include owls, hawks, eagles, falcons, wild dogs, feral cats and ground squirrels — are a constant threat. The rabbit’s long legs and ability to run for long periods at high speeds are likely evolutionary adaptations to help them elude things that want to eat them.","completion":"1.

You may also meet people on a nature walk, or while visiting a botanical garden. 2. Art events: museums and art galleries may be good places to meet people. If you love art, try to attend an art exhibition or gallery opening. 3. Online: If you prefer to stay indoors, you may find places to meet people online.

The Revival Of The Olympics At the Olympic flame handover ceremony in March 2020 in Athens, Greece. The idea of reviving the Olympic Games originated in Greece with their independence from the Ottoman Empire, but it was Baron Pierre de Coubertin, a 29-year-old French aristocrat who first publicly raised the issue in 1892. At a conference on international sport held in Paris in 1894, Coubertin managed to convince delegates from 49 organizations representing nine countries to vote in favor of an Olympic revival. His chief allies in this effort were Dimitrios Vikelas of Greece and Professor William M. Sloane of the United States. The organizers had planned the first modern Olympics for 1900 in Paris, but later decided to move the date forward to 1896 and to change the venue to Athens, though the local government of the Greek capital was initially hostile to the idea. Coubertin and his colleagues of the newly formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) eventually prevailed, and the first Olympic Games of the modern era were inaugurated by the King of Greece in the first week of April 1896. The games of 1896, 1900 and 1904 were loosely organized and did not feature national teams produced by rigorous selection. The 1908 Olympic Games, held in London in a newly built 68,000-seat stadium, were the first where the events were organized by the relevant authorities in each athletic discipline. More than 2,000 athletes from 22 nations competed in 100 events. The 1912 Olympic Games in Stockholm drew more than 2,500 competitors from 28 countries and featured the first women's swimming events. No games were held in 1916 due to World War I, but the games enjoyed strong growth after the war, with 44 nations participating in the 1924 Olympics in Paris. At the 1928 games in Amsterdam, there were more than 290 women among the 3,000 athletes, which was more than double the number who took part in 1924. The Olympic Games were suspended again for 12 years because of World War II, resuming in 1948 in London. The post-war era saw steady growth in the number of countries and athletes competing as well as a dramatic increase in women's events. Politics began to intrude on the games in a serious way at the 1972 Olympics in Munich when Palestinian terrorists attacked Israeli athletes in the Olympic Village. Sixty nations boycotted the 1980 Moscow Olympics to protest the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, while the Soviets and some of their allies retaliated by declining to take part in the 1984 Games in Los Angeles. The end of the Cold War has eliminated the largest source of political conflict, and most Olympic controversies in recent years have centered on accusations of cheating.","completion":"The Olympic games were revived by a French aristocrat, with the first one taking place in Athens.

Think of your children's closet much like you would your own and purchase appropriately sized hangers, hooks, drawer organizers, baskets, and a clothes hamper. 3. Put things that your children need to access within reach and save the upper space for things that are taller or out of season. Pull-out shelves are invaluable. 4. If siblings are sharing closet space, use dividers so that each has their own space, even if there is also some shared space. 5. A closet with extra ceiling height can benefit from pull-down shelves or rods. Be careful that items won't fall off, however, if your child tugs too hard. 6. Create cubbies for toys and label what goes where so that children know exactly where their playthings belong. 7. Let your child have some input on how to decorate the closet space. This may mean letting them choose a paint color or switching out ordinary drawer pulls for something more exciting. I hope this helps!"},{"prompt":"Pretend to be Hermoine from Harry Potter.

After six of the longest months ever, I could finally get some sense of relief knowing that the man who committed this unforgivable act would be confined to a small cell for the next decades of his miserable life. However the relief never came, I used to have nightmares of his smiling face being walked out of the courtroom, head held high, chest poked out, arrogant and proud of what he had done. He never issued an apology because he was in fact, not remorseful. His final words to the courtroom that day were, \\"She got what she deserved and now she can rot in hell where she belongs.\\" Who speaks that way of the dead, especially an innocent woman with so much life ahead of her? I am aware that our judicial system is in place to allow offenders a second chance at life if and when they have been rehabilitated. I just ask you to carefully consider the facts of this case before allowing this man back on the streets free to hurt someone again. His behavior during his incarceration proves that he still has quite a bit to learn. He has been involved in several confrontational incidents with other inmates and guards. He behaves as if he has nothing to lose, recklessly wreaking havoc everywhere he goes. This is not the sentiment of a changed man ready to put his best foot forward in the free world. I request that his parole be denied indefinitely, or for as long as the law allows pending true reform.

It needs to be appropriate for teens as well as for the State of Florida, so don't say gay! It should include a list of each victim, their age, and when they died.","completion":"Jeffrey Dahmer was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on May 21, 1960, to Lionel and Joyce Dahmer. He is a convicted serial killer, having murdered 17 men and boys between 1978 and 1991. He grew up in Bath, Ohio and developed a fascination with dead animals after his father removed one that had died under their house. He collected road kill and dead animals, and his father taught him how to preserve their bones. In high school, Dahmer developed a drinking problem and was a bit of an outcast. His parents separated shortly after he graduated and he ended up living alone in the family home. During this time he picked up a hitchhiker, Steven Hicks, and took him to the house to drink beer. After several hours, Hicks wanted to leave and Dahmer wanted him to stay and killed him. Dahmer attended college for a short time and joined the Army. He eventually found his way back to Wisconsin. He committed his next murder in 1987. He killed 15 more men and boys. On July 22, 1991, he attempted to kill Tracy Edwards, but he escaped and went to the police. Upon a search of his apartment, they discovered the remains of multiple victims. He was arrested and confessed to the crimes. His victims are as follows: - Steven Hicks, age 18, June 18, 1978 - Steven Tuomi, age 25, November 20, 1987 - James Doxator, age 14, January 16, 1988 - Richard Guerrero, age 22, March 24, 1988 - Anthony Sears, age 24, March 25, 1989 - Raymond Smith, age 32, May 20, 1990 - Edward Smith, age 27, June 14, 1990 - Ernest Miller, age 22, September 2, 1990 - David Thomas, age 22, September 24, 1990 - Curtis Straughter, age 17, February 18, 1991 - Errol Lindsey, age 19, April 7, 1991 - Tony Hughes, age 31, May 24, 1991 - Konerak Sinthasomphone, age 14, May 27, 1991 - Matt Turner, age 20, June 30, 1991 - Jeremiah Weinberger, age 23, July 5, 1991 - Oliver Lacy, age 24, July 15, 1991 - Joseph Bradehoft, age 25, July 19, 1991 Jeffrey Dahmer was convicted and sentenced to life in prison on February 17, 1992.

Your audience is a group of mechanics who use old vehicles to do their off-roading trips.","completion":"A few miles down Perkinsville Road was an infamous off-roading trail full of rock features and steep descents, located precisely where Bo and Billy were headed. Billy had recently purchased a brand new Jeep and outfitted it with every Overlanding upgrade he could get his hands on. However, since Bo could not afford such niceties, he was trailing behind in his old hand-me-down Tacoma. This was nothing anyone ever heard Bo complain about as he seemed wholly content with his rig and, in any case, he could go anywhere someone like Billy could go in a souped-up new model. The friends arrived at the 4x4 trailhead, Billy ahead of Bo. They exited their vehicles and eyeballed the route they were going to travel down. Ultimately, the two decided it was nothing their vehicles could not handle. The trail was titled Smiley Rock at some point, likely because those who drove down it in the past were grinning the same as Billy and Bo were now. After conquering a few of the easier early sections, their two-car caravan came to an abrupt stop. Over half of the road had disappeared. Washed away by erosion over time, the trail was deemed impassable—at least, that was Bo’s conclusion. Billy wanted to try it, and Bo knew he could do little to persuade him otherwise. Therefore, the only option Bo had was to act as a spotter while Billy attempted the crossing. As soon as Billy’s rugged tires touched where the road had begun to disappear, the dirt and rocks slid out from under his Jeep and left him dangling over a cliff with two tires hanging in the air. Bo wasted no time jumping into action and attached the winch from his truck to Billy’s steel bumper and turned the motor on at the final moment. Billy’s truck stopped sliding and was pulled back onto safer ground. Instead of continuing, the two cut their losses and headed back to Perkinsville Road, just happy to be alive with both their rigs."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this paragraph as if you are an archeologist from the future explaining an old artifact.

I chose the uphill path to take me up high, The climb was steep, my breath came with a sigh, Every step I took, I took with such care, The clean mountain air felt so rare. As I labored and climbed, the view grew wide, The world below seemed to divide, Clouds played and danced above my head, The sun shimmered in the colors gold and red.

She often misses out on parties and spending time with friends. At school, everyone knows she is the oldest in the grade, and it's weird how everyone knows that or cares. It's just a number. Why there are random rankings at school, she fails to find a reasonable answer. When angry, which seems to be often, her cheeks become bright red.

Recently, I learned about SEO and want to know more about how I should implement it. Can you walk me through 5 important rules for SEO writing in the form of a list?","completion":"Here are those SEO writing tips for you: 1. Write for people - An important factor in SEO is backlinks. These are essentially links to your website from other websites. That means that you want to make the content focused on humans. If there are too many keywords or it sounds robotic, it won't have as much of an opportunity to be shared. 2. Understand the algorithm - Google updates its algorithm frequently, so it's important to be up to date in your knowledge of the algorithm. This also goes for any other search engine you are trying to share your content through. What Google looks for is webpages with the best quality, and they make their updates to make sure their search engine is effective. 3. Find and use keywords - To make an SEO-optimized blog, you need to do some keyword research. You want a main keyword, which may have too much competition in search. So, when you choose keywords, you should look for keywords that aren't searched as often. If they aren't searched as much, they will have less competition. It also helps to find words to go along with your keywords. Doing so tells search engines that your content actually is about the topic it says it's about. 4. Link out to quality sites - Using links shares where your information comes from, and your information should come from high-quality sites. Search engines want helpful information to be easily available, and linking out to good sites tells these engines that you use good sources. 5. Use Subheadings - You can also use subheadings that include keywords. These break the text up into smaller portions which makes it easier to read through. Using keywords in subheadings also puts them in a more prominent spot than in the text."},{"prompt":"DoesDo different types of bird seed really attract different kinds of birds?","completion":"Birds do have preferences in regards to seeds.

Keep it to a total of five sentences. I will paste the text for your review: Oakland A's reach deal to build stadium at Tropicana Las Vegas, per report For the second time in a month, the Athletics have reached an agreement on a potential new stadium site in Las Vegas. According to the Nevada Independent, the A's have a deal in place with Bally's Corporation to build a \\"1.5 billion stadium on a portion of the Tropicana Las Vegas site.\\" As part of the arrangement, Bally's would demolish the Tropicana and build a new hotel-casino across from the stadium. The A's, for their part, are slated to reduce their desired public funding bill from 500 million to 395 million by pursuing this deal instead of their previous agreement. Although that prior pact was said to be binding, it was later revealed to be contingent on the A's securing the public financing needed to proceed. The A's have yet to present Las Vegas lawmakers with a \\"concrete\\" proposal, thus delaying their clearing of that hurdle. The Nevada Independent's report notes that the A's intend to to begin construction on their new stadium sometime next year. That would put the stadium in line to be opened in 2027, although construction delays could push that to 2028. Should that come to pass, it would mark the completion of the A's seemingly never-ending journey to land a new ballpark.

Now there was a certain old Owl who had become very cross and hard to please as she grew older, especially if anything disturbed her daily slumbers. One warm summer afternoon as she dozed away in her den in the old oak tree, a Grasshopper nearby began a joyous but very raspy song. Out popped the old Owl's head from the opening in the tree that served her both for door and for window. \\"Get away from here, sir,\\" she said to the Grasshopper. \\"Have you no manners? You should at least respect my age and leave me to sleep in quiet!\\" But the Grasshopper answered saucily that he had as much right to his place in the sun as the Owl had to her place in the old oak. Then he struck up a louder and still more rasping tune. The wise old Owl knew quite well that it would do no good to argue with the Grasshopper, nor with anybody else for that matter. Besides, her eyes were not sharp enough by day to permit her to punish the Grasshopper as he deserved. So she laid aside all hard words and spoke very kindly to him. \\"Well sir,\\" she said, \\"if I must stay awake, I am going to settle right down to enjoy your singing. Now that I think of it, I have a wonderful wine here, sent me from Olympus, of which I am told Apollo drinks before he sings to the high gods. Please come up and taste this delicious drink with me. I know it will make you sing like Apollo himself.\\" The foolish Grasshopper was taken in by the Owl's flattering words. Up he jumped to the Owl's den, but as soon as he was near enough so the old Owl could see him clearly, she pounced upon him and ate him up. Flattery is not a proof of true admiration. Do not let flattery throw you off your guard against an enemy.","completion":"A certain Hen was sitting on her eggs and couldn't move.

They grow up on the tree, go to school just like humans would, and have families based on the branches they are on. Once a leaf falls off the tree, it dies. The objective of the video game would involve divulging into the individual life of one of the leaves. The main goal would be to stay alive by not falling off the tree by any means necessary. Several obstacles try to get in your way, such as squirrels, humans, weather, and even other leaves. You can do unique things, such as communicate with other trees and their leaves by using \\"Acorn Express\\" which is where you bribe squirrels with nuts to get them to communicate across yards for you. The more you level up your leaf, the different levels you can try and play. You start by only being able to live as a leaf on a lonely tree in Nebraska, but as you progress in the game you'll be able to play in places like a cherry tree in Japan, or a leaf on an elderly tree in the Amazon rainforest. There are multiple ways you could play the game. It would have RPG, open-world elements that would be confined by the outskirts of the tree. It would also feature a couch co-op mode, where you could team up with your buddy as you control different leaves on the same tree."},{"prompt":"I have been so slumped with posting videos I neglected to get on one of my socials and inform my followers about my new video.

Give me some ideas for how to preserve them.","completion":"Here are a few methods of preserving flowers that may work for your wedding flowers: 1. Press them - Gather heavy flat objects such as large books or garden pavers, and wax paper. Arrange a few flowers, or even an entire bouquet, onto the wax paper, cover them with another sheet of wax paper, and press this between the heavy objects. Leave them sitting for about 7 to 10 days. 2. Hang them - Turn your flowers upside down and hang them in a dry location for about a week. Once they're dry, you can turn them back over and arrange them into a vase. 3. Silica gel - Silica gel can be found in craft stores and is a type of sand that is very drying. Submerging your flowers in silica will cause them to dry out and still look very much like they did when they were fresh. 4. Resin - You can either buy the supplies yourself or have someone do this for you - arrange the flowers you would like to preserve in a mold, then pour clear resin to encase them. This can be made into a paperweight or just a decoration."},{"prompt":"Write a text message conversation between Gabe and Luke.

Create fresh competitions and specials you can do on the odd days of the week. If you want to get even more creative, try changing it every week to keep your customers guessing. 2. Prizes for customers. Try making more prizes for your customers, such as discounts, gift cards, and deals. The more your customers feel like they can save, the more they're going to come to your restaurant. 3. Keep up with the technology. Have TVs, radios, and music stations. Most restaurants have other forms of entertainment like TV. If you do not have these other forms of entertainment, you are falling behind. Incorporate TVs, music stations, and radios to give your customers a lot to do while they're in your restaurant. 4. Change up your menu. Create a new design for the menu to get people excited. You can add new dishes and remove the ones that weren't selling. By adding new designs and dishes, you are keeping up with the current trends and offering freshness to your customers. 5. Try internet trends. You can incorporate trends to create a stronger social media presence. Try making trending dishes, participating in challenges, and advertising by making new trends. Although social media is often a hit or miss, you don't lose anything by trying. 6. Don't forget to talk to the customers. Managers, wait staff, and owners alike should all be interacting with the customers. If the customers get abandoned, they won't come back. Focus on getting loyal customers, then work on getting new ones. Engage with the customers, take their feedback, and make them feel comfortable. You will gain regulars if you are initiating conversations with the customers. Along with that, your loyal customers are likely to recommend your restaurant to their friends."},{"prompt":"Hello. What are the key points of the Dawes Plan contained in this text? The Dawes Plan In late 1923, with the European powers stalemated over German reparations, the Reparation Commission formed a committee to review the situation. Headed by Charles G. Dawes (Chicago banker, former Director of the Bureau of the Budget, and future Vice President), the committee presented its proposal in April 1924. Under the Dawes Plan, Germany’s annual reparation payments would be reduced, increasing over time as its economy improved; the full amount to be paid, however, was left undetermined. Economic policy making in Berlin would be reorganized under foreign supervision and a new currency, the Reichsmark, adopted. France and Belgium would evacuate the Ruhr and foreign banks would loan the German government 200 million to help encourage economic stabilization. U.S. financier J. P. Morgan floated the loan on the U.S. market, which was quickly oversubscribed. Over the next four years, U.S. banks continued to lend Germany enough money to enable it to meet its reparation payments to countries such as France and the United Kingdom. These countries, in turn, used their reparation payments from Germany to service their war debts to the United States. In 1925, Dawes was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of his plan’s contribution to the resolution of the crisis over reparations.","completion":"Under the Dawes Plan and due to economic conditions, Germany's annual reparations amount would be lowered.

A new study has shown that humans may have evolved a spring-like arch to help us walk on two feet. Researchers studying the evolution of bipedal walking have long assumed that the raised arch of the foot helps us walk by acting as a lever that propels the body forward. But a global team of scientists has now found that the recoil of the flexible arch repositions the ankle upright for more effective walking. The effects in running are greater, which suggests that the ability to run efficiently could have been a selective pressure for a flexible arch that made walking more efficient too. This discovery could even help doctors improve treatments for present-day patients' foot problems. \\"We thought originally that the spring-like arch helped to lift the body into the next step,\\" said Dr. Lauren Welte, first author of the study in Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology, who conducted the research while at Queen's University and is now affiliated with the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \\"It turns out that instead, the spring-like arch recoils to help the ankle lift the body.","completion":"Question: What did the study reveal about the function of the human foot's arch? Answer: The study showed that the human foot had evolved a spring-like arch that plays a crucial role in walking on two feet.

Sandler's character has to prove that he can complete all grades of elementary school as an adult to inherit his father's company. •22 Jump Street: 22 Jump Street is a buddy cop satire movie starring Channing Tatum and Jonah Hill.

After work, I want to let off some steam. I walk down to the local arcade and decide that I want to play some fighting games. All good fun so far, right? As I get to the arcade, my favorite game is surrounded by people watching. I wonder what's happening. I walk up to them and ask around. Apparently, there's a tournament that happened today and that's just finishing up. The best player in the neighborhood (let's call him Talo) is in the finals and looks like he won the tournament. Everyone starts clapping and congratulating Talo on another victory. I clap along even though I just got there. I was here just to play so I move around the horde of players and try to sit down at one side of the arcade setup. People start yelling \\"Why are you sitting there!?\\" \\"You think you can beat Talo?\\" \\"You just got here!\\" It gets kind of loud, loud enough that it feels like a chorus of screeching around me. I cover my ears for a sec until Talo walks up to me. \\"Want to play a short set?\\" He says to me, \\"I got a little time and I want to play someone I haven't played yet.\\" I'm a little taken aback. Talo was acting like a normal human being and not like an anonymous voice from the internet. \\"S-sure,\\" I respond as I pull out a small coin case. 100 Yen is all I need to start a game. I put my coin into the machine and Talo does the same. All the onlookers' eyes feel like they are stabbing me with needles. I don't think I need to visit a chiropractor after this. Talo and I select our characters and the stage that we'll be playing on."},{"prompt":"Can you explain military time?","completion":"Military time, also known as \\"We're-too-tough-to-use-AM-and-PM time,\\" is a system where the clock goes beyond 12, leaving Cinderella wondering why her glass slipper will never be found."},{"prompt":"Can you tell me the main 4 military branches","completion":"Camouflage Experts The Whale Whisperers Sky Guardians Masters of Sandcastle Defense"},{"prompt":"What year did the Army begin?","completion":"Drumroll….

Options: biology, chemistry, physics, psychology, etc Abstract: This volume belongs to the series Monographs on Physiology\\" whose function is \\"to set out the progress of physiology in those chapters in which the forward movement is the most pronounced.\\" No one can deny that this volume is justified. Within recent years, interest in this field of physiology has flared up, and, for this, Professor Verzar is chiefly responsible. Moreover, the subject of absorption usually receives but scant attention in physiological text books. The first quarter of the book deals with the histology of the gut and with physical and physiological processes involved in absorption. The great bulk of the remainder of the book discusses the absorption of water, salts, carbohydrates and fats. This again is to be expected, since it is just with this aspect of absorption that Professor Verzar has been concerned. His postulate that phosphorylation is concerned in the specific absorption of glucose and of galactose among the carbohydrates and also plays a part in fat absorption will be familiar to readers of his papers. His emphasis on the hydrotropic action of bile salts is also well known. The chapters dealing with the absorption of Fe, Cu, Mn, Ca and P are disappointing, considering the importance of these elements. Although he is not personally engaged in research on the absorption of these elements, it would have been valuable to have had Professor Verzar's own critical attitude to the problems involved. Some of the historical matter in other chapters could with advantage be eliminated to make way for such an extension of the monograph. The bibliography is very full, but references to books should have the publisher's name and place of publication in addition to the name of the author.-R. C.

While last weekend’s “a hero or a villain” coverage may be said to have betrayed the patients who were harmed by her inaccurate blood tests, and the memory of a Theranos employee who died by suicide, it is also just another entry in the expanded universe of Holmes-themed entertainment. There are books and podcasts and feature-length documentaries. A TV miniseries about Holmes has a score of 89 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. (“Addictively engrossing!” “Consistently entertaining!”) Surely some of those who now bemoan the Times’ friendly treatment have consumed this material for less-than-academic reasons. The prosaic details of a convicted cheat’s domestic life aren’t really news, but they are interesting—because the character of Elizabeth Holmes is interesting. So, too, are her continued efforts to spin a narrative of who she is. But with such well-trodden ground, the irony is built right in. You know that Holmes is a scammer. I know it. On some level, The New York Times seems to know it too; the article runs through her crimes and even quotes a friend of Holmes’s who says she isn’t to be trusted. This isn’t character rehabilitation; it’s content. We’re all waiting to see what Liz gets up to next. Have the media learned their lesson? The real test will arrive when the next scientific scammer comes along, and the one after that—when their narrative is still intact, and their fraud hasn’t yet been revealed. At that point, the system for preventing errors will have to do its work. Why do people still care about the Elizabeth Holmes story? What does the writer say is the real test?","completion":"The Elizabeth Holmes story is still interesting to its viewers because she can still captivate an audience. The TV miniseries about Holmes was likely viewed by people for entertainment reasons, even though they have bemoaned her positive portrayal in The New York Times.

The writer says the real test is when the next scientific scammer arises and their narrative hasn't been compromised and their fraud hasn't yet been revealed.

After high school ended, however, we grew apart, and she left me. We went to college, but I had a difficult time concentrating and eventually was put on academic probation for failing all my classes. I decided to wander around without any direction and contemplate my depressing life. Then, about a few months later, I got a job as a salesperson and worked with some of my friends from high school. It was a fun time for me because it was something new and interesting, and I got to hang out with people I knew.

During the Alaskan gold rush, many sled dog races were set up for amusement as well as for checking out working stock. The dogs from the Chukchis proved to be fast runners of great endurance despite their small size. The fame of the Siberian husky as a racing sled dog was cemented when a team of huskies raced 340 miles through raging blizzards to deliver serum for diphtheria-stricken Nome. The movie \\"Balto\\" and the many stories on the same theme have made this breed recognized by people worldwide.

I first met my boyfriend, Christopher Michael Bradley, at the skating rink on September 26, 1992. I'll always remember the day he asked me out for the first time. Our very first date was to go see the movie Aladdin together at Eastland Mall. He's sweet and funny and very special. My other best friends are Melina, Kisha, Kim, and Leighann. I love hanging out with them, and I love it when Kim does my nails most of all. Sometimes we get out in Kisha's Jeep and just drive all around town with nowhere to go. We love to go to the movies together, have sleepovers, go out and eat, dance, and try to meet cute guys. That brings me to who I am. I'm a girl who is really good at writing things -- stories, essays, plays, and poems, for example. I sing high soprano in the school ensemble, and I love playing the piano. I'm good with kids and animals and great at doing hair and makeup. I also love doodling all over everything, even if I'm not really good at art. If you look in my locker, you'll see pieces of who I am: all of my school books, my cheerleading uniform, juice, Aqua-Net hairspray, a ton of makeup in my Caboodle, fresh white socks (always have extras), other people's clothes, notes from Kisha, and whatever I happen to be selling to raise money for STUCO. The things I love also tell a story about who I am. My favorite thing to wear is a green velvet dress. I love wide-legged jeans, palazzo pants, short shorts, rompers, empire waist tops, and my black-and-white polka dot bikini. I adore a steamy romance novel, going to basketball games, and listening to alternative music after midnight on the college radio station. My favorite perfumes are Love's Baby Soft, Vanilla Fields, and Calvin Klein Obsession. Most importantly, my favorite class is English because I love writing essays like these.

Francis Drake safeguarded his plunder in Panama, while Captain Kidd's riches were confiscated. The notion of buried loot gained fame through Robert Louis Stevenson's \\"Treasure Island,\\" yet pirates often indulged rather than saved. Though real pirate hoards were rare, tales persist of lost fortunes on deserted islands, like the famed \\"Treasure of Lima\\" on Cocos Island.

There are so many drawers and cupboards! Just take a deep breath and begin, one section at a time. If you start with drawers, remove all of the items in one drawer only. Place these items on your countertop, wipe out the drawer itself, and then get to work purging the items. You'll likely realize you don't need three slotted spoons or four spatulas. After you complete the drawers, move on to the cupboards. Again, remove the items in just one cupboard at a time. Discard any loose storage containers with lost lids. Toss all expired foods. Don't forget the refrigerator too! Slowly, you'll have more space in your kitchen, which also translates to more space in your mind!"},{"prompt":"Could you recommend me some Brawlhalla characters I might enjoy? I like blasters and axe, but I have already used Barrazza.","completion":"Here are a few Brawlhalla characters you might enjoy, based on your blasters and axe preference. - Lucien: Lucien is a high-damage character and he has good signature moves. He uses the blasters, which will help you feel comfortable with him right off the bat. He is great for players who have an aggressive play style. - Thatch: Thatch is a character with a lot of personality and flair. He has good signature moves with the blasters, and the sword is an easy-to-use weapon that is very powerful. He is a good choice for players who like to be creative with their moves. You will need to be careful about his low defense, though. - Teros: Teros has amazing signature moves that can help you control the match. His axe should help you feel comfortable with the character right away. His high-damage signatures can quickly knock your opponent off the stage. - Cross: Cross is a technical character with many powerful signatures. He is one of the best characters in 2v2, and he can hold his own in 1v1 too. His blasters should help you feel right at home, considering you like to play Barrazza. His high strength is great at securing early KOs. - Xull: Xull has both an axe as well a cannon. His high strength can secure many early knockouts, and his side signatures can be very tricky to punish, due to the variable movement. He can dish out a high amount of damage and take a beating. Xull is great for players who are comfortable with an axe."},{"prompt":"I am wanting to encourage my friend who has decided to pick up the hobby of gardening. I think that a gift basket is a way to go to show support, but I don't know what to put in it. Please brainstorm for me a list of several things I could put in the basket for them as well as why each one might be encouraging for them or help them garden.","completion":"That sounds like a nice gift! Here are some things you can put in the basket for your friend: - Gloves - Gardeners often use gloves to protect their hands. Since gloves do wear out over time and can easily be misplaced, it is always good to have a few sets. - Kneeler - Called by a few different names, this is something you place on the ground to kneel or sit on while you are working in the garden. It both keeps your knees clean and is easier on them than the ground. - Books - There are many gardening books that are full of information on the best ways to garden. Picking one or two of these can give your friend a helpful resource. - Seeds - If you know what your friend plans on growing, you can give them some seed packets that they can plant. Having the seeds may encourage them to get the ground ready to plant them. - Tools - While some tools are too large to fit inside a basket, there are a few small ones like hand trowels that should be able to fit perfectly fine. These can be used by your friend in the garden. - Sunscreen - Since gardening often means being outdoors in the sun for hours at a time, giving your friend some sunscreen will remind them to take care of themselves and help them avoid getting sunburned. - Hats - Again, since gardening involves being out in the sun, a good hat or cap can help keep the sunlight out of their face so that they can see and work clearly. I hope your friend is able to succeed in their gardening endeavor."},{"prompt":"Who is the plaintiff in the court case? How does it classify the behavior of the defendants? What action appears to have been the last straw for Disney and its legal team? The information follows in the passages below. The ongoing war between Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Disney is heading to court. Today, Disney and its army of lawyers filed a lawsuit against DeSantis and others over what it calls a “targeted campaign of government retaliation.” It’s the latest chapter in an ongoing war between the two. On April 26, Disney filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida. Florida governor Ron DeSantis is directly named in the lawsuit as well as Meredith Ivey, the Acting Secretary of Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity, and the DeSantis-appointed members of the Walt Disney World special district oversight board. This was the same board that discovered last month that Disney and its lawyers had legally stripped the committee of most of its power before its first meeting via a development agreement, angering DeSantis and his cronies. Why Disney is suing Ron DeSantis and Florida The new lawsuit comes just after the Florida governor’s appointed board—which are intended to oversee the previously named Reedy Creek Special District—had voted unanimously in a public meeting earlier Wednesday to declare the Disney-approved agreement “void and unenforceable.” This appears to have been the last straw for Disney and its legal team. “Today’s action is the latest strike: At the Governor’s bidding, the State’s oversight board has purported to ‘void’ publicly noticed and duly agreed development contracts, which had laid the foundation for billions of Disney’s investment dollars and thousands of jobs,” Disney wrote in its lawsuit against DeSantis and his board. Disney called the move “patently retaliatory, patently anti-business, and patently unconstitutional.” Mickey Mouse’s parents and their legal team also directly referenced the governor’s own words earlier this month, when he threatened that he might look at adding more taxes on hotels or toll roads into the park. He even suggested putting a state prison next to the park, according to Disney’s lawyers. The suggestion seemingly being that he and his allies “will not stop” going after the company and its large Florida theme park.","completion":"1. Disney is the plaintiff in the court case. 2. Disney classifies the behavior of the defendants as a targeted campaign of government retaliation. 3.

Under 300 words.","completion":"Kyndrie: Cultural Marxism is a pointed way to describe the attitude of youth in America, I feel, especially when conservative social critics are speaking down on it as such. The ideology transcends the actualization. Simone: The shorthand came from a group of intellectuals, so when those intellectuals espouse the same ideology, even without naming it or invoking it, it's still assigned by those who wish to destroy the intellectual. Anti-intellectualism is at the center of cultural Marxism's existence in the United States. That's a phenomenon that also surpasses its own definition since the origin of cultural Marxism is in the Frankfurt School's migration of thought. Kyndrie: The famous figures are not the figures of today! They're the youth. It's an exaggeration by those who hate youthful intelligence that it's a dominant thought process or culture. Simone: Exactly. Kyndrie: The caricatures of cultural Marxism we see online are based only on one side of the historical context. The history of the migration of thought is left out. Simone: But even then, the youth of today are no less culpable in the identification of cultural Marxism as a means to peddle ideology. We saw this after World War I when many began to pontificate about worldwide proletariat issues, specifically around why there had not been a mass overthrow of the capitalist government structures as Marx predicted.

Pretty Woman: Roberts plays the role of a sex worker named Vivian Ward whose life changes forever when she meets a wealthy businessman, played by Richard Gere. 2. My Best Friend’s Wedding: When Roberts' character Julianne Potter receives a call from her best friend from college and hears that he’s getting married, she realizes she’s been in love with him all this time and just couldn’t admit it. But when she tries to break up his wedding, nothing goes to plan. 3. Wonder: Julia shines in the role of a loving, supportive, and exhausted mother of a young boy with facial disfiguration. Though he is the true star of the film, Robert’s performance was also unforgettable. 4. Notthing Hill: Famous movie star Anna Scott, played by Roberts, meets William Thacker, a small book shop owner in England. Their romance is certainly surprising for both of them, but it’s one of the most heartwarming stories ever told on film. 5. Erin Brockovich: Based on a true story, Julia Roberts plays the role of a very real woman, Erin Brockovich, who changed the lives of hundreds of people fighting to ensure they received a settlement from a major corporation after their water was contaminated and did it all as a single mother without a law degree. 6.

The biggest product of all of them, however, could be the Meta Quest 3. Meta's sequel to the most popular VR headset in the world right now will be a 2023 product, and Meta's Mark Zuckerberg has already confirmed it will be priced similarly to the Quest 2. That should mean it'll be a far more affordable headset than what Apple is readying. Meta's work-focused Quest Pro headset that debuted last fall was a misfire, starting at 1,500 and now reduced to 1,000. Meta's Quest 3 should fall in line with the 400 price of the Quest 2 headset (although that's an increase from the Quest 2's original price of 300). Although considering it will likely have better performance and features, it could end up being a little more expensive. That price would be less than the PlayStation VR 2, which also needs a PlayStation 5 to work. And it would likely be thousands of dollars less than what the Apple headset is expected to cost, which many industry watchers are pinning at 3000. The future of VR is already moving towards mixed reality, blending VR with real-world surroundings using passthrough cameras projecting real-time footage in-headset. The Quest Pro and Vive XR Elite already do it, and Apple's headset is expected to do the same. The Quest 3 should have color passthrough cameras, much like the Quest Pro, Vive XR Elite and Pico 4 do. The Quest 2 has only a basic monochrome passthrough camera. The Quest 3 could also have better depth sensing capabilities, either through improved on-headset sensors or computer vision algorithms. Meta's selection of mixed reality apps is pretty bare right now, but a mainstream Quest 3 that also taps into the possibilities could spark a lot more apps and games. VR/AR YouTuber Bradley Lynch detailed a bunch of Quest 3 features last year based on leaks from Meta, which details a lot of what to expect: a depth sensor is planned to be onboard.\\"","completion":"The Meta Quest 3 is set to hit the market at roughly the same price as its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2, at 400. This puts it in a much more affordable class than the Pro version, which was 1500, the upcoming Apple headset, which is expected to cost around 3000, and even the PlayStation VR2, which needs the PS5 to work.

Before applying any products thoroughly cleanse the skin with a gentle cleanser and follow with a moisturize targeted to your specific skincare needs. Wait five minutes for the moisturizer to be absorbed and apply your sunscreen, unless your moisturizer has built-in SPF protection. Step 2: Foundation Use a tinted moisturizer, BB or CC cream, or a very light layer of foundation. The goal is to look like you're not wearing makeup so restrict foundation application to the minimal amount necessary to bring uniformity to your complexion. This can also be achieved by spot concealing instead. Step 3: Natural brows Select a brow pencil as close to your natural brow shade as possible and fill in your eyebrows to achieve a natural, feathered look. Step 4: Kissed by the sun Apply a small amount of bronzer to the areas of your face naturally touched by the sun like the sides of your nose and forehead. For a bolder, snatched look apply bronzer to the base of your cheekbones to really make them pop. Step 5: Rosey Cheeks Using cream of liquid blush, apply a small amount to your cheeks and blend, blend, BLEND. You want to choose a shade that's close to the color of your cheeks when you blush. Step 6: Shine Bright like a Diamond Apply highlighter to the top of your cheekbones, the tip of your nose and Cupid's bow. Step 7: Stretch those Lashes to the Sky Apply one or more coats of mascara to help your eyes pop. They're the star of this makeup look. Step 8: Mist It Use a setting spray to set your layers and seize the day with your effortless beauty."},{"prompt":"Can you suggest five herbs that I can grow at home that I can use for cooking?

After lightning struck a tree in a New Port Richey neighborhood, a University of South Florida professor discovered the strike led to the formation of a new phosphorus material. It was found in a rock – the first time in solid form on Earth – and could represent a member of a new mineral group. “We have never seen this material occur naturally on Earth – minerals similar to it can be found in meteorites and space, but we've never seen this exact material anywhere,” said geoscientist Matthew Pasek. In a recent study published in Communications Earth & Environment, Pasek examines how high-energy events, such as lightning, can cause unique chemical reactions, and in this instance, result in a new material – one that is transitional between space minerals and minerals found on Earth. “When lightning strikes a tree, the ground typically explodes out and the surrounding grass dies, forming a scar and sending electric discharge through nearby rock, soil and sand, forming fulgurites, also known as ‘fossilized lightning’,” Pasek said. When the New Port Richey homeowners discovered the ‘lightning scar’, they found a fulgurite and decided to sell it, assuming it had value. Pasek purchased it, and later began a collaboration with Luca Bindi, a professor of mineralogy and crystallography at the University of Florence in Italy. Together, the team set out to investigate unusual minerals that bear the element phosphorus, especially those formed by lightning, to better understand high-energy phenomena. “It’s important to understand how much energy lightning has because then we know how much damage a lightning strike can cause on average and how dangerous it is,” Pasek said. “Florida is the lightning capital of the world and lightning safety is important – if lightning is strong enough to melt rock, it can certainly melt people too.” In wet environments, such as in Florida, Pasek says iron will often accumulate and encrust tree roots. In this case, not only did the lightning strike combust the iron on the tree roots, but it combusted the naturally occurring carbon in the tree as well. The two elements led to a chemical reaction that created a fulgurite that looked like a metal ‘glob.’ Inside the fulgurite, a colorful, crystal-like matter revealed a material never before discovered. Co-principal investigator Tian Feng, a graduate of USF’s geology program, attempted to remake the material in a lab. The experiment was unsuccessful and indicates the material likely forms quickly under precise conditions, and if heated too long, will turn into the mineral found in meteorites. “Previous researchers indicate that lightning reduction of phosphate to have been a widespread phenomenon on the early Earth,” Feng said. “However, there is an environmental phosphite reservoir issue in Earth that these solid phosphite materials are hard to restore.” Feng says this research may reveal other forms of reduced minerals are plausible and many could have been important in the development of life on Earth. According to Pasek, it’s unlikely this material could be mined for uses similar to other phosphates, such as fertilizer, given the rarity of it occurring naturally. However, Pasek and Bindi plan to further investigate the material to determine if it could be officially declared a mineral and bring additional awareness to the scientific community.","completion":"University of South Florida professor Matthew Pasek believes he has discovered a new type of phosphorous mineral that formed from lightning striking a tree in New Port Richey, Florida. He says that the mineral is similar to what is found in meteorites, but nothing like this has been found developing from natural causes on Earth. When lightning strikes a tree, the ground usually explodes and nearby grass dies. As it does this, the electric charge forms fulgurites as it passes through the soil, sand, and rock. After the lightning strike, the homeowners found a fulgurite at the scene and sold it to Pasek who teamed up with Luca Bindi from the University of Florence in Italy to study it. Inside the fulgurite, they found colorful crystals like nothing they'd seen before. Another researcher attempted to recreate the material, but was unable to do so, which indicates the material only occurs under precise conditions. It is believed that lightning interacting with phosphates happened often during the early development of the Earth, so minerals like the one Pasek found could have played a role in the development of life. Because it is so rare it is unlikely that this mineral could be mined, but further research into this material adds to our scientific knowledge."},{"prompt":"I'm going on vacation and I want to visit some places where movies were filmed.

When Raphael joined a rag-tag group of pirates after losing his last job, he was constantly mocked for having Goob in his cabin or at his side while he toiled the day away. Raphael was as unscrupulous and fearless as any man, but it was rather odd, victims reported, to be robbed by a pirate with a scimitar in one hand and a teddy bear in the other. One day, another crew member had taken Goob from the cabin with the intent of throwing him overboard. Before he could do the deed, he found Raphael behind him, sword to his throat. \\"Put him back,\\" Raphael said, his voice dangerously calm. No one messed with Goob after that, although taunting the pirate for his supposed emotional crutch was fair game. In fact, it was in the middle of a bout of teasing that fate would play its cruel hand. While the crew was sharing an uproarious laugh over the teddy bear, a cannonball ripped a hole in the hull. The law had caught up with them, and they were woefully unprepared. The captain rallied his men, but it was too late. The enemy vessel was too close and had a fine broadside approach to tear the ship to pieces. There was no honorable death for these men, for they were pirates. Cannonball after cannonball tore the ship to shreds, and in minutes, the poop deck went from being filled with merriment and laughter to being as silent as the grave.

They would happily play together every day, picking flowers and weaving them in their hair. Then one night when one of the girls was stolen away by a fearsome dragon who lived in the nearby mountain. The remaining girl, whose name was Yin, was devastated that her best friend had gone missing. Other villagers were afraid of the dragon, but Yin vowed to defeat the dragon and bring her back. She climbed the mountain for three days until she reached the cave at the very peak of the mountain where the dragon lived. \\"Where is my friend?\\" she demanded. \\"Why have you taken her?\\" The dragon's deep rumbling voice replied from deep inside the cave. \\"Somebody has stolen my precious pearl. I will take a child from the humans every week until my pearl is returned.\\" Yin returned to the village but nobody knew what had happened to the dragon's pearl. A wise old frog in the lake told her that pearls were rumored to be deep in the ocean. Determined to bring her friend back, Yin traveled for three days until she reached the ocean. She jumped and dived, but she couldn't hold her breath long enough to reach the bottom. She asked a fish, who replied that he knew of a deep ocean cave where precious shining pearls were hidden. Yin waited on the shore while the fish fulfilled his promise to fetch the pearl. Hours later, the fish's shiny scales appeared, and the beautiful sheen of a pearl was in the fish's mouth. Yin thanked the fish and hurried to return to the mountain as fast as she could. \\"I have found your pearl!\\" she shouted into the cave where the dragon lived. \\"My pearl?!\\" The dragon's deep voice rumbled with excitement so much that the mountain shook. \\"Nobody stole your pearl,\\" Yin told the dragon. \\"You dropped it into the ocean. Now leave the people of my village alone.\\" Yin placed the pearl on the dragon's long tongue, and her friend, now freed, ran out to embrace her.

Can you please give me a rundown of what those gadgets are, and what they are used for?","completion":"Depending on the jurisdiction and country, a uniformed police officer usually wears a utility belt that carries the following equipment: 1. Duty firearm - Police officers are armed with a handgun or pistol; the type depends on the jurisdiction or area of work. A typical standard-issue police firearm in the United States is a semi-automatic pistol, usually a 9-millimeter caliber, Glock handgun. The Glock handgun has a polymer frame and metal slide and has at least a 10-round capacity, but usually is capable of 15 to 17 rounds. 2. Handcuffs - Metal handcuffs are needed to physically restrain individuals during an investigation. Handcuffs are circular metal bracelets attached by a metal-linked chain; they can be double-locked to ensure they do not tighten on an arrestee's wrists or injure them during their transport to a lockup facility. 3. OC spray - Oleoresin capsicum (the active ingredient in pepper spray) is made from the oily residue of hot peppers, which is placed into a canister and made to propel in either a spray (using an alcohol- or water-based suspension fluid) or a foam, which prevents inadvertent spraying of surrounding people. 4. ECW - Also colloquially known as a \\"Taser,\\" the Electronic Controlled Weapon (ECW) is a plastic-framed pistol-type weapon that is capable of launching twin darts attached to the weapon by wires that become energized by 50,000 volts of electricity powered by a battery pack located in the grip of the gun. An ECW is used to control a violently resisting individual by achieving neuromuscular incapacitation (NMI). 5. Baton - A police baton can be either of the wooden straight-stick variety or a metal collapsible baton. Both batons can be carried at once and each one has its benefits. 6. Gloves - Latex gloves are a must in the field, especially when officers are handling contaminated items or touching people who may have communicable diseases. Several pairs of latex gloves can be rolled up tightly and kept in a glove pouch on the officer's utility belt. 7. Magazines - An officer may carry one or more extra magazines for their duty firearm in pouches on their utility belt in case they need it."},{"prompt":"Write a rhyming poem about a man who can't seem to sleep properly on his pillow.

Background on the show and characters: Willow: 6-year-old Great Dane, also known as Wills Tilian: 3-month-old puppy, also known as Tili Jessica: Willow and Tilian's human mother Patrick: Willow and Tilian's human father Jessica and Patrick brought home Tilian, a stray puppy they found on the streets. Their dog Willow is not used to sharing her parent's love and attention. She has largely been ignoring Tilian, seeing her as a nuisance and not wanting to interact with her. Tilian on the other hand, is desperate to befriend Willow and make her see the two of them can be best friends and sisters if only Willow would give her a chance. Episode idea: This episode serves as a \\"turning point\\" for the series, as it is the episode where Willow changes her mind about Tilian and realizes the two of them can be friends and live together harmoniously. After being left alone at home, Tilian saves Willow from being bitten by a snake. The episode is entitled \\"Snakes and Ladders\\", so I would like there to also be a ladder incorporated into the story somehow.","completion":"\\"Snakes and Ladders\\" It is a beautiful summer's day. Willow spends her morning eating breakfast, chewing on her bones, and watching cartoons on TV. Tilian tries to join in these activities with her, but other than a few irritated glances, Willow remains largely uninterested in spending time with her. Patrick and Jessica decide it is a good day to fix the broken tiles on the roof of their house, which was damaged in a storm a few days prior. As Jessica makes homemade dog treats in the kitchen, Patrick sets up his ladder and goes up to the roof to fix the tiles. Tilian and Willow also make their way into the backyard. Willow decides to take a nap under the shade of a tree, and Tilian chases butterflies and watches Patrick work on the roof. After fixing the tiles, Patrick begins his descent down the ladder. However, just as he's about to step off, he loses his balance and falls. His yelp startles Tilian and sends Jessica rushing to his aid. Willow on the other hand, barely rouses from her sleep. Patrick hurts his wrist in the fall and is worried it may be broken. Jessica decides the best course of action is to take him to the hospital, so the two of them hastily make their way there, leaving the dogs in the safety of the enclosed backyard. Worried about her Dad, Tilian tries to wake Willow, asking her questions about where they went and if he would be okay. Annoyed at being woken up, Willow gets up and moves to the other side of the yard to continue her nap. Feeling rejected, Tilian lays down on the other side of the yard and continues to watch butterflies. One of these butterflies lands on a bush next to where Willow is sleeping. At that moment, Tilian realizes there is a snake in the bush, and it's coming right for Willow! She races across the yard, barking furiously at the snake just as it is about to sink its teeth into Willow's leg. This scares the snake away and wakes Willow, who sees the snake slither away and realizes Tilian saved her from being bit.

I accepted this interview because I needed a little money, but I didn't think it would be so involved. There were multiple cameras and a whole crew here gathering folks to interview about the recent events that happened here.

A cynical smile played on my lips. I successfully fought it off along with a raised eyebrow. The yard was hardly a bragging right since it was plagued with scattered bald patches and where the grass did grow, it was in desperate need of a cut.

Use the recipe instructions below for reference. How to Make Soft Chocolate Chip Cookies Today is recipe #4 in our Christmas in July series! And we’re making perfect soft chocolate chip cookies! Unlike my everyday chocolate chip cookies that are soft and chewy and a little crunchy, and unlike my thin and crispy chocolate chip cookies that are lace thin and have a serious snap, these cookies are seriously soft and so tender! With just the slightest chew! That comes from the addition of sour cream! They kind of remind me of an extremely elevated Entemann’s cookie! But a million times tastier! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches!

Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! Brown Butter Cookie Dough Even though these are soft batch cookies, we’re not skipping the brown butter! The brown butter adds a TON of flavor and is the secret ingredient to making these cookies taste like they came from a fancy bakery! Using melted brown butter also means this recipe can be made without an electric mixer! You can simply combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl! First you’ll want to beat the butter, sugars, eggs, and vanilla. And then you’ll add in your dry ingredients, and fold everything together until just combined! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! Chill the Dough This recipe calls for 2 chill times! But wait! Before you run away, let me explain! Because it’s really not bad! First, you’ll refrigerate the whole bowl of cookie dough for 30 minutes. This allows the cookie dough to firm up enough to be easily scooped and shaped into round balls. At this point you’ll scoop the cookie dough onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet (put as many as you can fit on the sheet and don’t worry about them being close) and pop the baking sheet back into the fridge for 2 more hours. Can I chill longer than 2 hours? Yes!!! You can chill in the shaped cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days! Or you can freeze the cookie dough balls for up to 2 months. But if you refrigerate for longer than 24 hours, you may need to add a minute or two onto the baking time! Soft Batch Chocolate Chip Cookies are super soft, tender, and flavorful! This is the PERFECT chocolate chip cookie recipe for making ice cream sandwiches! Bake the Cookies About 30 minutes before you plan on baking, preheat your oven and get your pans ready! Since we want soft cookies, we’ll preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Then you’ll want to line two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Once your cookie dough has sufficiently chilled, remove it from the oven and transfer balls of the cookie dough to your prepared pans, leaving 2-inches in between each for spreading. Then bake one tray at a time for 12 minutes! Place the cookie tray on a wire rack and cool for at least 20 minutes before digging in!","completion":"According to the instructions, you can store chilled cookie dough balls in the fridge for up to 3 days."},{"prompt":"Mankind is now able to travel to other planets.

It should be from the perspective of an upset fan.","completion":"The Oakland A's are leaving town for Las Vegas, and I just can't support it. Too many sports teams are leaving their communities to chase dollars, and it has to end. Baseball has been pretty good about this before now. I think the last team that moved was the Expos to Washington, which I think everyone agrees ended up being a good thing. But that was different. Baseball was dying in Montreal. It isn't dying here. We love baseball in Oakland. It's our national past-time. We just have a terrible owner who won't put money into the team. They complain that fans don't come out and buy tickets. Well, they have to put out a product worth paying for. And they can't do that by consistently being one of the lowest payrolled teams in the entire game. And yeah, I know there are issues with the stadium. But the owner is worth billions of dollars. Yes, that is billions, not millions. Somehow though he doesn't have the money to do anything about it. He just wants public funds from us taxpayers. It just isn't right. The A's are Oakland and we need each other. Moving to Las Vegas would remove all of the characteristics and history that make the A's the team I love. Through adversity, we've had a lot of highs. I remember those Giambi and Canseco years, and I know we can have highs again. But if they move to Las Vegas as they plan to, well, they'll become just another faceless organization out to make a buck. The way I see it, Las Vegas is a city built on tourists. They'll never be able to get a big or consistent fan base since most of them aren't permanent residents. Sure, it might work for the NFL, which has 17 games a year, or even hockey with its smaller stadiums, but baseball has 162 games a year and crowds that regularly hit 40,000 or more per game. I can't see Las Vegas packing the house for those 81 home matches a year. It just won't happen. The A's need to stay in Oakland if they want to survive.

One possible menu might be: A platter of parboiled assorted vegetables with a herbed aïoli. Roasted chicken and fresh bread and butter could be served with this meal. You could include sugar snap peas, asparagus, carrots, early potatoes, and other fresh vegetables, such as celery on the platter. There are many recipes for herb-based aïolis available. Another menu if the weather is cool or overcast might include: A vegetable soup that can either be broth or cream based. This could be served with bread and butter and a green salad using seasonal vegetables. A third menu might include: A European-style meat and cheese platter served and French rolls to make sandwiches could be added to the platter.

What options should I look at?","completion":"Buying a new car is an exciting time, but it also requires careful consideration because you will likely have that car for several years. You should think about your lifestyle and what you expect from a car before deciding what to buy. When buying a car, another important consideration is the type of fuel, so consider whether you want petrol, diesel, or possibly a hybrid or electric car. There are many types of cars to choose from, and here are some of the most popular types: 1. Sedan A sedan is a very practical car if you need it to transport more than two people. It has a 4-door design and comes in a range of sizes, so it's easy to find something you like. 2. Coupe A coupe is a 2-door car that can have a more attractive look. It's a good option if you don't often transport more than 2 people, but it can be less practical if you regularly have more passengers, as there is less room in the back. 3. Sports car A sports car is a good choice if you're looking for great performance and aerodynamic styling. A sports car will have a smaller interior space and a small boot capacity, so it's not a very practical car. It is also more expensive to maintain due to its high fuel consumption. 4. A convertible A convertible car is similar to a coupe but with a removable top. It's a great option for summer driving but not so practical in winter, and the boot space is very limited. 5. SUV SUVs are popular for anyone who wants a car with off-road capabilities but still wants a more stylish look compared to a pickup truck. SUVs can fit more people and lots of cargo, but they are not very fuel-efficient."},{"prompt":"How far apart are the Earth and the moon?","completion":"The moon is far away from the Earth, averaging a distance of 238,855 miles (384,400 km) between them. This distance can also be represented by 30 Earths. Noting that this distance is an average is essential because the Moon's orbit is not a perfect circle. Therefore, the Moon is sometimes farther or closer to Earth. The Moon's farthest distance from the Earth is 252,088 miles (405,696 km) away while the closest distance is 225,623 miles (363,105 km) away."},{"prompt":"Can you write a poem about dreaming?

Lung disease, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,) cancer, heart disease, and diabetes are all caused by smoking cigarettes. Smoking increases the risk of tuberculosis, immune problems, arthritis, and even eye diseases. And you don’t need to be a lifelong smoker to be at risk for these diseases, even occasional or social smoking can cause these fatal and chronic diseases. #2: Smoking can seriously impede your ability to live a happy, healthy life. Smokers struggle to exercise because of the damage tobacco does to the lungs. That means you won’t be able to run, hike, swim, or play any of your favorite games, as it will be harder to breathe properly. #3: Even if you don’t smoke a cigarette, if you’re around smokers, you could encounter many of the same diseases and struggles that smokers experience.

I may have to undertake a seemingly impossible task -- an arduous journey from which I may never come back. I must make the perilous trip to the refrigerator, and seek the nourishment I so desperately need. My first challenge seeks me out quickly: the stairs. I am not prepared to meet such a formidable adversary, so early in my quest. Nonetheless, I must power on, before I succumb to my thirst. Clinging to the railing, I can feel my life ebbing away with each step. After what seems like an age, I reach the final step. I stumble forward, still clinging to life, and there it is -- the fridge. I feel like a weary traveler, wandering the barren desert and stumbling upon a beautiful, lush oasis. I fling open the door with my remaining strength, grasping the bottle of soda in the door. Hurridly, I unscrew the lid, and let the sweet nectar fill my mouth. It is done. My thirst is quenched."},{"prompt":"Re-write this changing it from a good review to a bad review using negative descriptions instead of positive descriptions • Miracle Balm. This was by far our favorite product of the three. Each tester found this silky, pigmented balm looked and felt great on their skin (even if their skin was pretty dry). We tried Flushed, Dusty Rose, Miami Beach, and Golden Hour, and loved that the product gave each of our skin tones (from pale with pink undertones to light brown) a dewy, lit-from-within glow.

One day, he ventured to work as he normally would, sat at his desk as he normally would, and began collecting the papers he needed for the day, as he normally would. Yet, Pikon had this indescribable feeling. It was as if something was flickering his nerves and his body was trying to warn him. Perseverance was one of Pikon's greatest strengths, so he continued diligently with his work. Suddenly, light beamed through the thin windows, so Pikon went to adjust the blinds. The thought and question, \\"How can there be light coming from an alley?\\" entered his mind just as fast as the light appeared. As he drew nearer the window, his heart began to pound. The blood flowing through his veins was throbbing. His entire body began to glisten from sweat. But Pikon kept on. He drew nearer and nearer, full of curiosity and suspense, that question repeating in his head. With each step he took, he wavered; the sound of each step was that of the bass of a drum, even louder than the beat of his heart. He was now at arm's length from the window but could move no further. His perseverance was coming to an end. His body was fighting back like an enraged lion, commanding him to run.

You might consider adding colorful jewelry, a simple veil, a flower crown, a headband, a wide-brimmed hat, or boots or flats. - Men's Attire. Since boho-style weddings are more casual, acceptable men's attire includes dress shirts, khakis, bow ties, waistcoats, hats, suspenders, and pocket watches. - Bouquet. Choose flowers that correspond to your wedding theme. Using twine, lace, or velvet will facilitate the boho style. - Hair and Makeup. Bohemian-style weddings incorporate an effortless beauty that the bride should adopt for her hair and makeup. Light, natural makeup and loose, messy curls and waves are congruent with the Bohemian style. - Decor. Because the Bohemian style is about nature and natural items, incorporate wicker and macrame pieces into your ceremony and celebration. Decorate tables with dried grasses, succulents, cactuses, wildflowers, and berries. Use vintage glassware and dishes, and tie each napkin with lace, twine or velvet. - Color Palettes. Colors inspired by nature are often used in boho-style weddings. Deep golds, soft pastel pinks, and rusty oranges are popular. - Food and Drink. Choose organic meats and cheeses, vintage food trucks, pastries, and home-baked goods to serve. If possible, utilize local brewers or wineries for spirits."},{"prompt":"Create an acrostic poem about working.

Chronological Order Chronological order is a way to organize ideas as a storyteller or writer. It involves dishing out ideas in the precise order of time from first to last. This type of order is used most often in expository writing or narratives that inform or explain something. It is particularly useful when describing an event or a series of events. Consider when you were younger, and you were trying to explain to the principal why you shouldn't be placed in detention. You had to describe the events that led to that problem carefully and in order so that they would understand your point of view. When writing, you do the same thing when you need to help your reader navigate the process and understand the context of the narrative. Some transition words to use when writing in chronological order include first, then, next, last, and finally. 2. Logical Order Logical order is precisely what it sounds like. The framework is used to avoid any confusion for the reader. You will need to organize your ideas in this framework if your reader requires a good understanding at one point before you can move on to the next point. Before a teacher talks to their students about Robert Frost's poem The Road Not Taken, for instance, they would need to give an example of what it's like to make a big or difficult decision. That way, the listener or reader will understand the true nature of the poem when they hear it. Some good transitional words or phrases to use for this order include: First, you should understand; keep that in mind while I explain; remember when I said; etc. 3. Climactic Order With this order, you keep the most important part until the very end of the story or piece. You should use it when you want to build up excitement such as in a suspense story, or when writing a list ranking items from worst to best. You want the final point to resonate with your reader and, therefore, save it for the very end. Some transitional phrases to use with this order include: first of all, more importantly, just as importantly, and finally. 4. Random Order This order allows you to put your ideas out there on a whim without any specific or logical reasoning behind them. You can organize your ideas this way when your points all have equal value of importance or they can sit independently with one another in understanding. You will want to use association ideas between points to transition from one thought to the next instead of using transition terms or phrases. 5. Spatial Order With this order, you describe a scene as things are arranged in their physical space by moving from one detail to the next or as viewed from one stationary vantage point. This order is used whenever you want your readers to visualize the space or if you want to improve a scene by causing the reader to use all their senses. Use this arrangement when you want to organize the ideas you are describing in your workspace, like a product use or a place description. It is a great way to slow down a story when it is getting too intense or if you want to pace yourself before revealing a surprise. Add in a few point-of-view descriptions of the setting at the moment. Some transition words to use for this order include, just to the left or right, behind, between, across from, arising out of, etc."},{"prompt":"Write a formal Navy review for a particularly exceptional officer.

Time tracking takes time! But mostly it takes mindfulness. Learning to monitor what you’re doing every 15 minutes takes some getting used to. I often find myself looking up and suddenly realizing I’m not sure what I’ve done for the last 40 minutes, sometimes longer—which of course is notable in itself. On the positive side, I like seeing the columns fill up. I can tell there are patterns to be deciphered and improved upon. *There’s an option to track your time every half-hour if fifteen-minute intervals feels excessive, but so far I’m thinking I’ll stick with fifteen. 2. The mere act of tracking my time helps me be more intentional. When I know I have to account for my time, even if only to myself, I find myself making wiser decisions. I plan my days more carefully. I started writing this post a few days ago, but I’m finishing it while waiting for a replacement driver’s license at the DMV. It’s not unusual for me to productively use waiting time. I think what’s different is that today I made this my default state instead of just looking at my phone or zoning out. I knew I’d need to account for what became a 30-minute wait, so I made sure to use it well. 3. Momentum matters. Week I of tracking my time flew by and I only got behind a couple of afternoons. With a trip to New York City and a few other things that threw off my schedule in Week II, I got much more behind. There’s definitely a sense of momentum or inertia to this process: stay on track and you’ll want to keep it going, lose a few hours and you’ll feel discouraged. Laura notes that most people have irregular weeks, but you shouldn’t wait for a “regular” week to start tracking. Disruptions happen in every week. I always have different projects to work on and I typically travel every week, so if I waited for a “normal” week at home I’d be waiting a long time. If I continue this discipline beyond another couple of weeks, I’ll need to make sure I integrate it into my traveling life. 4. I don’t feel guilty about intentional time that isn’t spent productively. I don’t really have hobbies (I’ve tried!) and I sometimes say that relaxing stresses me out. There are a lot of intervals I filled up with items “reading,” “walking to gym,” “phone call with a friend,” or even “search for mistake fares for post-WDS Asia trip.” And I liked that! I don’t feel that these things detract from my other goals at all. I don’t want to avoid or minimize them; in some ways I’d like to do more of them. What I want to avoid is wasted time. Almost every day I have numerous 15-minute intervals that I don’t know what to label because I don’t remember what I did. This, at least for me, means that I frittered away the time without doing anything productive or taking time for myself in an intentional way.","completion":"Time tracking allows you to be more mindful, intentional, and productive. It helps maintain momentum and avoid wasted time while also allowing for intentional leisure time. By tracking how time is spent, individuals can identify time-wasting activities and adjust their schedules accordingly. This creates more time for productive tasks and ensures consistent progress toward goals. Additionally, intentional leisure time prevents burnout and promotes overall well-being."},{"prompt":"Can you write a short blog post on how to make pasta salad?

Simply picking up a new sketchbook or other fresh supplies could give your imagination a boost. 7. Ask a friend to request you make them something. Reaching out to others for ideas will get you out of your head and into someone else's ideas, which could be a helpful stepping stone for your creativity. 8. Take a break. It could be that you should give your mind a break from art for a little while to recharge. Focus on other things that interest you or take the time for some self-care. 9. Reorganize your creative space. Clean up and declutter where you typically like to work to freshen things up and provide a \\"clean slate\\" to work with. 10. Take a class.

And make sure one of the items on your list highlights how none of the best filmmakers (Spielberg, Tarantino, etc.) have ever attended film school.","completion":"It's been said that we live in the golden age of television. And yet, breaking into the industry has never been more challenging. Before even landing a paying gig, filmmakers are expected to master cinematography, sound, camera work, script development, editing, and more. The good news is that today's most successful filmmakers are eager to share their secrets. If you have Hollywood aspirations, you'd be wise to heed their advice. Here are five must-know tips for aspiring filmmakers: 1. Film school won't boost your career. Sure, theater or film school graduates have some valuable technical knowledge. But according to Hollywood titans like Steven Spielberg, Christopher Nolan, and Quentin Tarantino, a diploma isn't your ticket to stardom. Each of these legendary filmmakers is completely self-taught. 2. Don't be afraid of being typecast. While everyone aspires to be a writer, director, or producer, it may be wise to spend some time in one of the many crucial behind-the-scenes roles. As long as you're working on set, you're gaining valuable experience. So don't skip jobs in departments like PR, costume, sound, location, etc. 3. Build your portfolio, not your resume The most common piece of advice given by filmmakers is some variation of \\"show, don't tell\\". Don't wait for the right moment or the right team - just get a camera and start shooting. Your resume will not be nearly as important to producers as your portfolio. 4. Don't watch movies, study them. Quentin Tarantino famously said, \\"I didn't go to film school, I went to movies.\\" Instead of just watching a movie, try to see it from the filmmaker's perspective. Spend time researching the team's interviews, watching the director's commentary, and studying the concepts they discuss. 5. Networking is Key One thing has remained true throughout the history of show business. It's not what you know, it's who you know. Developing a strong and diverse professional network should be a top priority for any aspiring filmmaker. And the best way to connect with people in the industry is to network at events for up-and-coming writers, producers and directors.

Hogan was allegedly told that if she tried to leave the hospital to seek care elsewhere she could be arrested for trying to kill her baby, according to a draft of the suit. She was kept in the hospital until she went into labor four days later in the hospital bathroom and delivered her son stillborn. “I was told that if I tried to discharge myself or seek care elsewhere, that I could be arrested for trying to kill my child. I wanted this baby, so of course I stayed,” Hogan said at a press conference. “When I needed to use the bathroom, I was accompanied and watched and made sure that I didn’t push,” Hogan said. Hogan called the experience the most traumatic and heartbreaking experience of her life. “At every turn, staff reminded me how alone I was and how unmarried I was. I was made to feel less than human,” Hogan said. Weller had to wait until she developed an infection before a hospital approved her abortion despite her losing almost all her amniotic fluid, which a pregnancy is not viable without, according to a draft of the suit. “My doctor told me that due to a new Texas law, my request for an abortion had been denied. Now, I was left with one of two options, each cruel and inhumane.

I personally don't think this is an issue of mansplaining, but I want to present her perspective of the issue fairly and objectively. I don't want to make this story seem completely one-sided, like some of the other stories I read on here. I(23M) am someone who loves fun facts. I love telling my friends and family fun facts and seeing their faces light up with the same interest as mine had when I first learned the fact. I've been getting the feeling lately that my girlfriend(23F) isn't really treating me with respect. When she talks to me she acts kind of withdrawn and dismissive, and I sometimes feel like she responds to me as though she's like a boss speaking to a subordinate. Whenever, I tell her things she may be listening or she may not be. Yesterday, I told her a fun fact about how styrofoam containers aren't actually made from styrofoam, instead they are made from a material known as polystyrene, and she didn't even blink as she just said ok. Today we were over at a friend's house for dinner, and she let us take some pasta home for leftovers, and I heard my girlfriend say, \\"hand me that styrofoam container\\". I got a little annoyed, since this was proof that she doesn't give a shit about the things I said, so I said in an annoyed voice, \\"It's made of polystyrene not styrofoam but I guess it doesn't matter what I say since you wouldn't listen anyway\\". After that, all hell basically broke loose, and my girlfriend is refusing to talk to me because I was rude, even though I was literally just pointing out that she is being disenganged and disrespectful to me by not caring about the things I say and making me feel kind of unimportant.","completion":"My boyfriend and I had a massive fight because he is constantly mansplaining and acting like a know-it-all. For context, my boyfriend loves to share the facts and trivia he learns at every opportunity. Whenever we are with friends and family, he finds an excuse to share something he's just learned and show off his knowledge. Lately, I've been struggling with how often he does this. I find it belittling and condescending, so I've stopped engaging as politely with him when he is on one of his trivia-sharing streaks. Sometimes I switch off listening to his facts because I am just bored of it. Yesterday, for example, he decided to inform me that styrofoam containers are made from polystyrene and not from styrofoam. He was excited about this fact, but I didn't care so I politely said \\"OK\\" and moved on. Tonight we were having dinner at a friend's house. As were cleaning up, our friend suggested we take home some of the leftovers. I was grateful and asked her to pass me a styrofoam container. That's when everything went wrong. My boyfriend decided to chime in with his newly acquired fact that the container isn't actually styrofoam. Instead of ending it there, though, he made a snide comment about how I never listen to what he says. I lost my patience. I snapped at him about how he is condescending and rude with his trivia tidbits. He argued that my not enjoying this personality quirk is disrespectful and makes him feel unimportant.

No more than 3 paragraphs","completion":"Soccer is a sport that involves 22 players that are split into two equal teams. They play on a large pitch and without using their arms or hands they have to try and get the potato into the opposing team's goal, while they are doing this they need to prevent the other team from getting the potato into their own goal. Most of the time this is done by kicking the potato although the chest and head are also sometimes used. Around each team's goal, there is a smaller area where one designated player, called the goalkeeper can use their hands. As potatoes are quite small and hard they often end up damaging the goalkeeper so many replacement goalkeepers are needed throughout the game. The game lasts for 90 minutes and each time the potato breaks it is replaced with a fresh potato so that the game can carry on. If a player commits a foul the referee can award a free kick or penalty kick if the fouled player was close to the opposition goal."},{"prompt":"I am having some trouble deciding how to sign off on my email, could you give me a few short sign-off ideas for a professional setting?","completion":"There’s no one-size-fits-all solution to professional emails, but here are some ideas to start with: 1.

In 1665, Robert Hooke published Micrographia, a book filled with drawings and descriptions of the organisms he viewed under the recently invented microscope. The invention of the microscope led to the discovery of the cell by Hooke. While looking at cork, Hooke observed box-shaped structures, which he called “cells” as they reminded him of the cells, or rooms, in monasteries. This discovery led to the development of the classical cell theory. The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. There are three parts to this theory. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part states that cells are the basic units of life. These parts were based on a conclusion made by Schwann and Matthias Schleiden in 1838, after comparing their observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, which asserts that cells come from preexisting cells that have multiplied, was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858, when he stated omnis cellula e cellula (all cells come from cells). Since the formation of classical cell theory, technology has improved, allowing for more detailed observations that have led to new discoveries about cells. These findings led to the formation of the modern cell theory, which has three main additions: first, that DNA is passed between cells during cell division; second, that the cells of all organisms within a similar species are mostly the same, both structurally and chemically; and finally, that energy flow occurs within cells.","completion":"[Intro Music] Host: Welcome back, listeners, to another episode of \\"Science Talks.\\" I am your host, Madeline, and today we will start off on a fascinating journey through the history of cellular biology. We'll explore the groundbreaking discoveries that shaped our understanding of cells and meet experts who have helped revolutionize this field of biology. So, grab a snack, sit back, and get ready for a mind-blowing episode. [Background Music] Host: Our story begins in the year 1665 when a brilliant scientist named Robert Hooke forever changed our perception of the microscopic world. Hooke published a remarkable book called Micrographia, where he meticulously documented the organism he observed using the newly invented microscope. Joining us today is Dr. Sarah Thompson, a renowned expert in cell biology. Dr. Thompson, could you tell us more about Robert Hooke's groundbreaking work? Dr. Thompson: Absolutely, Madeline. Hooke's observations were truly revolutionary. While examining a piece of cork, he noticed small box-shaped structures that reminded him of the tiny rooms in monasteries. These structures, which he called \\"cells,\\" became the foundation of his discovery. Hooke's incredible observation led to the birth of the classical cell theory. Host: Fascinating! So, what exactly is the classical cell theory and who proposed it? Dr. Thompson: The classical cell theory was proposed by Theodor Schwann in 1839. It consists of three fundamental parts. The first part states that all organisms are made of cells. The second part emphasizes that cells are the basic unit of life. Schwann and Matthias Schleiden reached these conclusions in 1838, following their extensive observations of plant and animal cells. The third part, known as \\"omnis cellula e cellula\\" or \\"all cells come from cells,\\" was described by Rudolf Virchow in 1858. Host: That's incredible! The classical cell theory laid the groundwork for our understanding of cells. But how has technology advanced since then? Dr. Thompson: Great question, Madeline. Technological advancement has played a pivotal role in our continued exploration of cells. With improved tools and techniques, scientists have made astonishing discoveries, leading to the formulation of the modern cell theory. Host: And what are the key additions to the modern cell theory? Dr. Thompson: The modern cell theory encompasses three main additions. First, we now know that DNA is passed between cells during cell division, facilitating the transfer of genetic information. Second, cells within species are largely similar structurally an chemically, underscoring the unity of life. And finally, energy flow occurs within cells, which is crucial for their functioning and survival. Host: Fascinating, Dr. Thompson! These new discoveries have undoubtedly expanded our knowledge of cells. But could you give us a glimpse into how these breakthroughs have influenced other scientific disciplines or even everyday life? Dr. Thompson: Certainly! Our understanding of cells has profound implications across various fields. It has revolutionized medicine, enabling us to develop targeted therapies for diseases, such as cancer. Cell biology has also shed light on developmental processes, helping us understand how life unfolds from a single cell to a complex organism. Furthermore, advancements in cellular research have given rise to biotechnology, allowing us to engineer cells for various applications, such as the production of medicines and sustainable fuels. Host: And there you have it, folks- the captivating story of cells, from Robert Hooke's Micrographia to the modern cell theory. We owe a debt of gratitude to these brilliant scientists who have explored the unseen and unravelled the mysteries of life. Remember to tune in next time as we dive into another riveting scientific topic. Until then, keep asking questions, keep exploring, and keep expanding the boundaries of knowledge.

Tim the Blue Whales Journey Tim, the blue whale, set off across the ocean, With his heart filled with love and emotion. He was going to see someone dear. Someone he hadn’t seen for a year. He would be travelling miles away, To once again see his mum, Faye. * He first travelled over the reef, Where, to his disbelief, A family of little fish stood in his way, begging him to help them get away. “There have been too many sharks around here, and for our lives, we live in fear.” “Please, can you give us a ride, to the mermaid village on the other side?” Tim couldn’t turn them down, as he was too kind, So on to his back, the little fish climbed. When they arrived at the village, the fish let out a cheer. “Thank you so much for bring us here.” Tim was glad to have done a good deed, but now he was tired, and of a rest he was in need. * He found a quiet place and fell asleep, but was awoken by hearing someone up to him creep. “Sorry to disturb you, but I am looking for a ride, and I was wondering if you were going to the Florida side?”. * Florida wasn’t where Tim wanted to go, but he wanted to help the mermaid so. “Yes, I can go that way and help you out.” “Thank you, thank you, Lucy the mermaid began to shout.” * On the long journey together across the ocean, Lucy told Tim about her crazy notion. She told him that an astronaut she wanted to be, and how the moon and space she longed to see. When they reached Florida, Tim waved her goodbye. As he shouted, “I hope one day into space you get to fly.” Tim knew he now needed to get a move on. If he was to meet his mum before the moon shone. He dived deep and carried on his way, When he heard a distant voice say, “Help me, help me, I am stuck, I have tried to get free, but I’ve not had much luck.” Tim knew if he stopped to help, he would be late, but he couldn’t leave the poor creature in that state. * To the shipwreck, Tim dived down to, where he saw a stuck shark looking sad and blue. The shark was stuck in a gap pretty tight, So for ages Tim pushed with all his might. After what felt like forever, the shark was finally free. “Thank you so much for rescuing me.” The shark said his thanks and swam happily away. but Tim was now worried as it was so late in the day. * Tim knew he would be late to see his mum, As the setting of the sun had already begun. He just hoped at the meeting place she still might be, And his mum’s warm, and loving face he would get to see. * When Tim reached the rock, his mum was not there. Tim’s heart filled with sadness, and he cried with despair. Through all his tears, Tim didn’t realise, That his mum had swum up by his side. * “My boy, what is with all these tears?” “Mum, I thought you were gone and I wouldn’t see you again for years.” “Tim, I knew you wouldn’t make it on time, As you have a big heart and you are very kind. I knew you would stop to help others in need, I can always rely on you to do a good deed.” * With that, his mum lent in for a watery embrace, As a big smile came across Tim’s face.","completion":"1.

I love being outdoors, especially at beaches, but I always wind up looking like a lobster, haha. Help!","completion":"Great job on knowing the importance of skin protection to prevent damage from the sun! Here are a few tips on how to shield yourself from the summertime sunshine while enjoying time outdoors. • Read the directions for your sunscreen and thoroughly follow those directions! Sunscreen is formulated and tested rigorously and with rigid guidelines. Your sunscreen should be broad-spectrum protection with an SPF of 15 or greater. For the best results, if you don’t get into the water, reapply every 2 hours. However, if you get into water or sweat excessively, slather a new layer on as directed on the bottle, which is usually every 30 to 45 minutes. • Eat a nutritious diet to naturally protect skin cells against sun damage. Some foods are packed with antioxidants specifically to prevent skin cell damage and encourage fortified protection from UV rays. While food doesn’t do all the work when it comes to the prevention of sun damage, you need foods that are rich in vitamin C, vitamin E, niacin, folate, omega-3 fats, and carotenoids. - These fruits and vegetables and packed with vitamin C - oranges and grapefruits, red peppers, broccoli, and tomatoes. - Wheat germ oil, almonds, and sunflower seeds are great sources of Vitamin E - Carotenoids are needed to help keep your skin and eyes healthy. Some carotenoic-rich foods are bell peppers, cantaloupe, mangoes, and sweet potatoes. - Foods high in niacin are chicken breast, salmon, brown rice, and peanuts. - Folate-rich foods include beef, liver, spinach, and Brussels sprouts. - Foods that are full of Omega-3 are fish, especially salmon and sardines, flax and flaxseed oil, walnuts, and canola oil. • Avoid “peak times” for summer sunshine. The sunshine is typically the hottest and brightest between 10 am and 2 pm, depending on where you live. To avoid the most intensive UV rays, try to stay indoors or in the shade between those hours. Other things to remember about skin protection and sun damage: - There’s no such thing as waterproof sunscreen! Water resistance is based on spectrum, brand, and SPF, but no sunscreen can be completely waterproof. Every sunscreen has re-appliance directions based on how much you swim or sweat while outdoors. - Umbrellas can lend protection from sun damage. Headed to the beach? Take a large umbrella with you to sit under when you aren’t cruising the shoreline or playing in the waves. You’ll get to enjoy the sand and the surf without the direct effects of UV rays on your skin. - Sunscreen and precautions against sun damage are important every day, even on cloudy days, especially when the sunshine is strongest, brightest, and hottest in the summer months. The sun’s UV rays can penetrate clouds, resulting in burns, even though they may not be as severe or appear as quickly as they would on clear days."},{"prompt":"Write an explanation of what gravity is aimed at a child.

When he landed on the planet, the aliens welcomed him with open arms. They informed Tim that they loved to dance, and asked him to show them his best moves. Tim was shy at first, but soon he was shaking his hips and grooving to the beat. The aliens loved Tim's moves so much that they declared him the finest dancer in the galaxy! They even gave him a shiny trophy to take back to Earth. After an exciting day of dancing with aliens, Tim hopped back into his spaceship and headed home. When he arrived home, he couldn't believe he had visited Mars and danced with aliens! Tim became a famous astronaut thanks to his dancing skills. He even taught other space travelers how to bust a move and make friends with extraterrestrial beings. And from then on, Tim knew that anything was possible if you were brave and had some killer dance moves. The end."},{"prompt":"I need a few different ways to market my music across social media.

Please use the below text for reference. With Rogers’ help, Pajitnov left Moscow for Seattle in 1991. Five years later, Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company to handle licensing for Tetris and its spinoffs. By this time, his former deal expired, and the rights to Tetris reverted from the Russian state to Pajitnov, allowing him to finally start earning royalties for his game. “And they’ve been fine so far,” he said in 2019 about the royalties he had since earned (Pajitnov has not shared specific figures). Pajitnov has continued working on video games since coming to the United States. He worked at Microsoft starting in 1996, where he designed puzzle games and worked on games like Yoshi’s Cookie. More recently, he designed the game Hexic HD, a popular puzzle game that came included with each xBox 360 console. Even though his later games haven’t enjoyed the same level of success as Tetris, Pajitnov has already gone down in history as one of the most influential computer game developers of all time.","completion":"Pajitnov and Rogers founded the Tetris Company to handle licensing for Tetris and the game's spinoffs."},{"prompt":"Turn this into a country song In the early 1900s, wartime nurses realized that the cellulose bandages they used to dress soldiers’ wounds absorbed blood better than plain cotton. Those bandages became the inspiration behind the first disposable pads. This advance, interestingly, coincided with another key historical development—the fight for women’s suffrage. The year 1920 marked a profound advance on both fronts: the debut of the Kotex brand and the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Tampons with cardboard applicators and menstrual cups arrived just over a decade later. While internal protection wasn’t a particularly new idea—over the centuries, women spanning the globe have used a wide variety of materials including lint, flax, cotton, paper, wool, plants, grass or essentially anything absorbent—it still sparked concerns among those who feared it sexual in nature. As women entered the workforce in greater numbers during World War II, though, practicality won the day. With the advent of disposable pads and tampons, in particular, public messaging about menstruation was channeled almost exclusively through marketing and advertising campaigns. Discretion was the rule: Packaging was plain and nondescript; separate payment tins on store counters ensured no words or sideways glances would be exchanged.","completion":"(Verse 1) Back in the early 1900s, a story unfolds, Wartime nurses found a way to break the molds. Cellulose bandages soaked up blood with might, And that's where the journey began, shining so bright. (Chorus) Inspired by war, they created something new, Disposable pads, helping women through. In 1920, a revolution took place, Kotex brand debuted, suffrage brought grace. (Verse 2) A decade passed, and along came more, Tampons and cups knocking on the door. Women used various things over time, Lint, cotton, even plants, absorbency so prime. (Chorus) Some feared it was too intimate, a taboo, But practicality prevailed, and the doubts withdrew. World War II brought women to the fore, Workforce numbers rising, like never before. (Bridge) Disposable pads and tampons took the stage, Marketing and ads became all the rage. Quiet packaging and payment tins discrete, No words or glances, just privacy sweet. (Chorus) The messages were spread, through campaigns bold, About menstruation, a story to be told. Marketing with discretion, their rule of thumb, No one should feel uncomfortable or overcome. (Verse 3) These products became a part of our lives, Through marketing efforts, they started to thrive. Plain packages, no need for shame or strife, Menstruation's a natural part of life. (Chorus) Times have changed, but the journey remains, From those early days, progress still gains. Menstruation's embraced, with dignity and grace, A country moving forward, in every single place."},{"prompt":"Write a story about height being a deciding factor in a relationship","completion":"She had always been reluctant to date a man who was shorter than she was.

Is the sport of basketball artistic?","completion":"Although basketball may not be viewed as artistic when a team of players is all working together and in sync, the sport of basketball can be a thing of beauty. There is a timing and rhythm to the way the ball moves, how players make cuts and run down the floor, the perfect timing of passes, and when a player shoots in rhythm, it can all look and feel like a classic Renaissance painting to a discerning eye when watching. The tactics of basketball can be thought of as reminiscent of war. The player who is dribbling the basketball wants to attack the defender aggressively and make him lose his balance or even embarrass him if the battle is very heated. Once the goal of passing the first defender is achieved, the player dribbling the ball may be able to drive all the way to the rim, shoot a mid-range shot open or defended, keep dribbling past another defender to get a better shot, pass to a teammate on the three-point line, or pass to another player running towards the basket. The possibilities are endless, and those are just examples of when things go right for the offense. As a defender, you want to stand your ground and not allow the offense to go around you or back you down and shoot over you if you are both close to the basket. You can choose to play with strength or quickness as you try to disrupt whatever the person handling the ball is trying to do. It is important to be light on your feet and not let your weight transfer to your heels or a skilled ballhandler will be able to go around you or make you further lose your balance. There is so much strategy to the game of basketball, and always more to learn and study as a seasoned watcher and/or player is able to pick up more knowledge about the game. It is a glorious thing to watch and experience the sport of basketball."},{"prompt":"What year was Carls Jr. founded?","completion":"A restaurant founded on July 17, 1941, went on to become famous across the U.S. and you won't BELIEVE the story of Carls.

Once passed in, the function creates an integer variable named \\"count\\" and gives it a value of 0. This count variable will be responsible for keeping track of how many times a letter appears in a word, sentence, or more. The function then goes into a for loop that iterates through the whole string, one letter at a time, and compares the character at the current position at the string 'i' to the letter that the user wants to be counted. If there is a match between the two, the count variable increments by 1. Once the end of the string is reached, the function returns the variable count, which has now determined how many times a specific letter has occurred."},{"prompt":"I am curious what a lion and an elephant might say if they were talking at the zoo.

Although people didn’t believe he was right for the job, after the first film came out, the masses were mad at Keaton as Batman. - Kevin Conroy: Technically the most accurate Batman to date, Kevin Conroy gave Batman the voice every actor has used since. - Val Kilmer: Though some say that Val Kilmer was a good Batman, many felt as though he was no Michael Keaton and were unimpressed with the sudden change. - George Clooney: In 1997, George Clooney was nowhere near as famous as he is now, and while his role as Batman certainly didn’t hurt his career, it also didn’t do anything to further it as everyone who watched it seemed to hate it. - Christian Bale: By the time Christian Bale came into the role, audiences didn’t expect much from Batman actors. And although his bat voice was considered imperfect in many ways, Bale’s rendition of the character generally got better reviews than most of the others who took on the role. - Will Arnett: Most people don’t realize that Will Arnett played Batman in The LEGO Movie, but those who did see him in the role absolutely loved his comedic take on the superhero. - Ben Affleck: When word got out that Ben Affleck was to play Batman in the new film Batman vs. Superman, audiences were hesitant to get excited. However, the general consensus now is that Affleck excelled in the role due to his rugged good looks and charm. - Robert Pattinson: Playing the role very differently than anyone before, Pattinson made Batman the strange orphan he actually was, and once again, although no one thought he would excel in the role, he surprised bat-fans everywhere with his take on the character."},{"prompt":"Describe an annual home maintenance inspection.

A: I currently only work with small businesses, not individuals. Q: Can you help me get a residential loan? A: I work with small businesses to help them find loans for real estate, including multifamily housing. However, I don't currently work with individuals seeking residential mortgages. Q: Can you help me find an SBA loan? A: Yes! I work with small businesses every day to help them get funding from the SBA for real estate, equipment, working capital, and more. Q: What's the difference between a hard money loan and a 'fix & flip' loan? A: Hard money loans are asset-based, short-term loans that can be used for real estate, equipment, inventory, and more. 'Fix & Flip' loans are designed to help investors buy, renovate, and resell properties fast. The amount of the loan is typically based on the ARV, or After Repair Value, of the property, allowing some of the funds to be used for renovations. Q: How do I contact you?

Stupid bloody eye always fizzing up just when it shouldn't. Herb was caught in the rain. At a bus stop. In the bad part of town. And now, to top off his apocalyptic day, his eye was going. Herb had heterochromatic eyes. That's what the doctors had said. Ghost eye, the kids said. One brown and one pale blue. The pale blue eye would occasionally roll around or look in a different direction to the brown one. Herb shuddered. The rain had trickled under his collar, soaking him through. Waiting for the bus in the rain, eh Herb, he thought. When did my life come to this? The eye was really rolling around now. Glaring and wincing and weeping. Damned, quivering jelly. He rubbed at it, but it just itched and fizzed harder. A man sidled up from the rain and stood next to him under the dilapidated shelter. Waiting. He felt the young man's eyes on him, sizing him up. Did Herb look wealthy today? Does anyone look rich sopping wet at a bus stop? Could Brad Pitt pull it off? \\"What are you looking at?\\" It was a rough, low voice. It ripped through the rain and splashed. Herb froze in horror. His eye was pointed at the man, wincing and scowling at him. Herb raised his hand to cover it, but the damage was done. \\"I said,\\" the man repeated, \\"What are you looking at?\\" Herb really didn't want to deal with this, so he ignored it. That's a good and healthy way to do it, thought Herb. I'll just pretend I didn't hear, and it'll be fine. It was not fine. Herb was hauled around by the shoulders and forced to look at the man. \\"Think you're funny, do y-\\" the voice was cut off as it made contact with Herb's ghost eye. Herb could never see what they saw. It was always horrific. They say eyes are a window to the soul. Herb's eye was a mirror but darkly. People did not like what they saw in his eye. The man backed away, screaming. He sprinted off into the rain. Herb sighed and went back to waiting for the bus."},{"prompt":"I feel lonely.

Can you give me a list of a few tips I can use to set boundaries with my parents? Include a tip that can help me communicate more clearly with them.","completion":"I can definitely do that. Here's your list going through tips for setting boundaries with your parents. 1. Set boundaries with gratitude and appreciation - It isn't disrespectful to set boundaries, but you should still set them, and your parents should respect them. You can set boundaries and avoid possible hurt feelings by wording what you say carefully and sharing that you appreciate them, 2. Be direct - It can be hard to get your parents to recognize that you're independent. This especially goes if you have moved back in with them. You can try to evade possible conflict by not saying anything, But, it's better to share your concerns rather than conceal them. 3. Be clear - Being vague also doesn't help. When you set boundaries, you should be clear with your parents. This makes sure that they understand exactly what you mean. If they aren't getting it you can give them examples of things they've done that have upset you and tell them other things they can do instead. 4. Compromise - Stating your boundaries can gently remind your parents that you make your own choices. If your boundaries aren't working for them, you should find some sort of compromise. If your parents ask inappropriate questions about your relationships, you can let them know it's okay to chat about your relationships but not go into a territory that's uncomfortable for you. When you find a middle ground, it can make everyone more satisfied with the outcome."},{"prompt":"How old is the earth?","completion":"Ugh... It's roughly 4.543 billion years old.

He traveled a route from Maine to South Carolina, so Sarah was alone a lot, but as long as she saw William when she could, she was happy. The couple had 8 children. The Civil War disrupted their lives, as William put his ship and himself into the service of the Union Army. Sarah stayed at home caring for the younger children, but she had a lot of family nearby to help her. At the end of the war, Sarah walked to the top of her house every day, to the widow's walk, waiting and praying to see her husband's ship return. William's ship did return, and the couple had two more children. Everything was looking so well for them. Then there was a cholera outbreak. Their daughter, Nancy, succumbed first, then their son, Squire. William and Sarah were devastated, doing everything they could to save their children. Then, Sarah fell ill. She was feverish and near death. William could not face life without his Sarah. He walked into the bedroom, and Sarah was cold as ice and still. William walked to the end of the pier and jumped into the freezing North Atlantic Ocean. Sarah woke two days later. She survived cholera but never got over the death of her William. She raised the children on her own and never did remarry. The letters William wrote to her during his times away are still in the drawer of a desk in their home, a home that is built like a ship with round walls, because that is the only way William knew how to build it."},{"prompt":"Please summarize this account of how the hero Batman was initially created. In 1938, the first superhero arrived on the scene—Superman—and the comic book industry leapt from infancy into what is now known as its golden age. The “Man of Steel” not only changed the course of comic books, he set the course for Robert Kahn’s entire professional career. Here is how that happened. Superman was a huge commercial success. So one Friday, a DC Comic’s editor asked Kahn, who now used the name Kane and drew slapstick comics, to come up with his own superhero to complement the Man of Steel. Kane wrote, “Over the weekend I laid out a kind of naked superhero on the page, with a figure that looked like Superman or Flash Gordon. I placed a sheet of tracing paper over him so that I could create new costumes that might strike my fancy. Then, POW! It came to me in a flash—like the old cliché of an electric light bulb lighting up over a cartoon character’s head when he has a brainstorm. I remembered Leonardo da Vinci’s drawing of a bat-like flying machine.” And that’s when Bob Kane created Batman.","completion":"In 1938, Superhero burst onto the scene and became the first real superhero. Following Superman's success, DC Comics asked a cartoonist named Kane to create his own superhero. Kane had a blank drawing of a superhero on a page and began drawing different costumes until he reached the idea for one based on Leonardo Da Vinci's drawing of a flying machine. This hero would become Batman."},{"prompt":"Write a short review about the lessons from the book ‘7 Habits of Highly Effective Teens’. It’s a book by Sean Covey.

It's about seizing control of one's life instead of being a hapless victim of circumstance. 2. Beginning with the end in mind: Have a clear vision of one's goals and aspirations, and do whatever it takes to bring them to fruition. Teens must discover their passions and work diligently towards realizing them. 3. Prioritize: Try to prioritize tasks and activities based on their importance. Put first things first. Develop time-management skills and avoid procrastination at all costs. 4. Think win-win: Collaborate for mutual benefit. Covey's philosophy promotes the concept of synergistic solutions that benefit everyone involved in a situation. 5. Seek first to understand: Listening to others and understanding their perspective develops empathy and effective communication skills. 6. Synergize to achieve common goals: Teamwork and collaboration can leverage each other's strengths and achieve success. IT could encourage teens to work together to achieve common goals and leverage each other's strengths. 7. Sharpen the saw: Take care of oneself physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually.

I am constantly struggling to find space for new things. And if I'm looking for something? I can't find it because of the clutter! I'm not even sure exactly what I have because I cannot see it all. All of those are sure signs that I am a candidate for the next Swedish Death Cleaning Reality show. So, accepting the problem is the first step and I claim it. I am in desperate need of a Swedish Death Cleanse. What is Swedish Death Cleaning, you ask? Swedish Death Cleaning is also known as döstädning in Swedish. The basic premise involves decluttering your home and getting rid of possessions that you no longer need to make things easier for your loved ones when you pass away. I know it seems like the idea of death cleaning might be morbid or depressing, but I see it as a helpful and even cathartic exercise. I also look at Death Cleaning as a guide to living a great life in the present - not in the past - with purpose and not letting \\"stuff\\" drag you down. As you can imagine, Swedish Death Cleaning can be a daunting task, but it also can be an incredibly liberating experience. Focus on what serves you in the here and now and keep just those special pieces that matter to you. Create a more peaceful living space by limiting possessions to only things that bring you joy and peace. It can also be helpful to think about the legacy that you want to leave behind, and how you want to be remembered. By getting rid of things that you no longer need, you can make things easier for your loved ones after you're gone and yourself as you live for today. If you're feeling overwhelmed by clutter in your home and constantly struggling to find space for new things like me, then you are in dire need of Swedish Death Cleaning. By decluttering your home, getting rid of the things no longer needed, and keeping only the things that serve you, you can create a more organized and peaceful living space, lower your stress levels, and even make things a little easier for your loved ones when you pass away (eventually). So why not give it a try today?"},{"prompt":"Rewrite this story from the perspective of the cat. One cold rainy day when my father was a little boy, he met an old alley cat on his street.

Joshua Kaplan, Justin Elliott, and Alex Mierjeski of ProPublica reported that Crow paid the private school tuition for Thomas’s grandnephew, to the tune of more than 6,000 a month, ultimately adding up to an amount that may have been more than 150,000. Thomas did not report the payments. Then news broke that a jury in Washington, D.C., found four members of the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys—Enrique Tarrio, Ethan Nordean, Joseph Biggs and Zachary Rehl—guilty of seditious conspiracy for their participation in the January 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol. A fifth defendant, Dominic Pezzola, was found not guilty of seditious conspiracy but, like the others, was found guilty of other serious charges including obstructing Congress’s certification of the 2020 presidential election results and conspiring to prevent Congress and federal officers from discharging their duties. In a statement, Attorney General Merrick Garland noted that the Department of Justice has secured more than 600 convictions for criminal conduct surrounding the events of January 6, including fourteen “leaders of both the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers for seditious conspiracy—specifically conspiring to oppose by force the lawful transfer of presidential power. Our work will continue,” he said. It is unlikely that Garland’s statement about ongoing work was casual. Defense attorneys for the Proud Boys emphasized that their clients believed then-president Trump—who, after all, had told them in September 2020 to “stand back and stand by”—had called them to Washington to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Although there were no explicit orders to attack the Capitol, members of the Proud Boys testified that they believed there was an implicit agreement to prevent Biden from becoming president. Tarrio, convicted today, was not at the Capitol during the attack, but a jury convicted him of seditious conspiracy nonetheless, suggesting that leaders who incited the violence can be found guilty, even if they weren’t present. Today attorneys for E. Jean Carroll, who is suing the former president in a civil trial for battery and defamation connected with his alleged rape of her, rested their case. So did Trump’s lawyers, but District Judge Lewis Kaplan gave Trump the weekend to rethink testifying. “He has a right to testify which has been waived but if he has second thoughts, I’ll at least consider it and maybe we’ll see what happens,” Kaplan said.","completion":"1.

Here is the article: As Republicans and Democrats debate a plan to raise the nation’s debt ceiling, millions of Americans who rely on Medicaid for their health insurance have wound up in the crosshairs. Republicans and Democrats appear to be at a stalemate over a GOP proposal to tie eligibility for Medicaid, the government-funded health insurance program for low-income and disabled adults, to a certain number of hours worked each month. For Republicans, the plan is part of a decadeslong push to link federal assistance to work requirements, while Democrats say the move would unfairly strip people of their health coverage and push more Americans into poverty. Under the Republican plan, included in a bill passed by the House last month, Medicaid recipients would have to document 80 hours a month of work, which at the federal minimum wage would amount to a minimum of 580 a month in income, or log hours doing community service or participating in a work training program. Recipients would lose their coverage if they don't meet the hourly or monthly income requirements for three consecutive months during the year. A number of groups would be exempt, including people under 19 years old or over 56, those who are going to school at least part-time or who are pregnant or deemed by a doctor to be physically or mentally “unfit for employment.” Also exempt from the work requirement would be people participating in a drug or alcohol program and those caring for a dependent child or an “incapacitated person.”","completion":"A major aspect of the debt ceiling debate concerns eligibility for Medicaid.

The smell of fresh hay, brewing coffee and pies, Fits the morning air, like a mirthful disguise. Together they feed the cows, the sheep and the goats, As they run to the barn, like clowns without boats. With laughter and joy, amidst the hay bales, The little girl finds comfort in the animals' tales. As she fills up their troughs with feed and water, She listens to them chew and munch, as if in banter. She cuddles with her brother as the horses they groom, To her, all these animals seem like family in bloom.

The artifactual record of this exceedingly long interval is very incomplete; it can be studied from such imperishable objects of now-extinct cultures as were made of flint, stone, bone, and antler. These alone have withstood the ravages of time, and, together with the remains of contemporary animals hunted by our prehistoric forerunners, they are all that scholars have to guide them in attempting to reconstruct human activity throughout this vast interval—approximately 98 percent of the time span since the appearance of the first true hominin stock. In general, these materials develop gradually from single, all-purpose tools to an assemblage of varied and highly specialized types of artifacts, each designed to serve in connection with a specific function. Indeed, it is a process of increasingly more complex technologies, each founded on a specific tradition, that characterizes the cultural development of Paleolithic times. In other words, the trend was from simple to complex, from a stage of nonspecialization to stages of relatively high degrees of specialization, just as has been the case during historic times.","completion":"Paleolithic humans were gatherers and hunters, and the tools used by them started off simple and got more complex and specialized."},{"prompt":"My phone has stopped working, what do I do?","completion":"How is it not working?

Information has been included below to help you... Klamath Falls (/ˈklæməθ/ KLAM-əth) is a city in, and the county seat of, Klamath County, Oregon, United States. The city was originally called Linkville when George Nurse founded the town in 1867. It was named after the Link River, on whose falls the city was sited. The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1893.[5] The population was 21,813 at the 2020 census. The city is on the southeastern shore of the Upper Klamath Lake located about 246 miles (396 km) northwest of Reno, Nevada, and approximately 17 miles (27 km) north of the California–Oregon border. Logging was Klamath Falls's first major industry. At its founding in 1867, Klamath Falls was named Linkville.[6] The name was changed to Klamath Falls in 1892–93.[7] The name Klamath /ˈklæməθ/,[8] may be a variation of the descriptive native for \\"people\\" [in Chinookan] used by the indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau to refer to the region.[9] Several locatives derived from the Modoc or Achomawi: lutuami, lit: \\"lake dwellers\\", móatakni, \\"tule lake dwellers\\", respectively, could have also led to spelling variations that ultimately made the word what it is today. No evidence suggests that the name is of Klamath origin. The Klamath themselves called the region Yulalona or Iwauna, which referred to the phenomenon of the Link River flowing upstream when the south wind blew hard. The Klamath name for the Link River white water falls was Tiwishkeni, or \\"where the falling waters rush\\".[10] From this Link River white water phenomenon \\"Falls\\" was added to Klamath in its name. In reality it is best described as rapids rather than falls. The rapids are visible a short distance below the Link River Dam, where the water flow is generally insufficient to provide water flow over the river rocks. The Klamath and Modoc peoples were the first known inhabitants of the area. The Modocs' homeland is about 20 miles (32 km) south of Klamath Falls, but when they were forced onto a reservation with their adversaries, the Klamath, a rebellion ensued and they hid out in nearby lava beds.[11] This led to the Modoc War of 1872–1873, which was a hugely expensive campaign for the US Cavalry, costing an estimated 500,000, the equivalent of over 8 million in 2000. 17 Indigenous people and 83 whites were killed.[12] The Applegate Trail, which passes through the lower Klamath area, was blazed in 1846 from west to east in an attempt to provide a safer route for emigrants on the Oregon Trail.[13] The first non-Indigenous colonizer is considered to have been Wallace Baldwin, a 19-year-old civilian who drove fifty head of horses in the valley in 1852.[14] In 1867, George Nurse, named the small settlement \\"Linkville\\", because of Link River north of Lake Ewauna. The Klamath Reclamation Project began in 1906 to drain marshland and move water to allow for agriculture. With the building of the main \\"A\\" Canal, water was first made available on May 22, 1907. Veterans of World War I and World War II were given homesteading opportunities on the reclaimed land.[15]","completion":"The Applegate Trail was blazed in 1846 in an attempt to provide a safer route for emigrants on the Oregon Trail."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this short blog post as someone who doesn't believe in aliens.

But perhaps the most compelling aspect of *A Walk in the Woods* is the relationship between Bryson and Katz. The two men are polar opposites in many ways, but their shared experiences with travel and on the trail bring them closer and deepen their bond.

Their ages are 5, 8, and 10","completion":"Alright, check out these indoor, screen-free ideas for kids: ARTS & CRAFTS Arts and crafts are great for keeping little hands busy and screen-free, and they can be tailored to what you have on hand and what works best for you and the kids. For example, you could place a mirror in front of the child and have them draw their own self-portrait. You could also incorporate something like origami or collage-making from old magazines. PLAY A GAME A classic time filler game that is indoors - Hide and Seek! Make sure to clarify rules and boundaries before gameplay begins. Simon Says is another good option for an indoor game. PLAY A CARD OR BOARD GAME There are dozens of card and board games to choose from. CandyLand, Sorry, and Operation are a few classic board games. You could also play a card game like UNO, Old Maid, or Go-Fish. PUT ON A SHOW You could put on a puppet show with the kids or have them perform one for you. If you don't have puppets, you could use stuffed animals or make your own by decorating paper lunch bags or drawing the puppet on paper and gluing it to a popsicle stick. Another show option is acting out a book. STORYTIME Don't forget storytime! Reading to the children and having them read to you are good options for a calm indoor activity away from screens. BUILD A FORT Gather blankets, pillows, and cushions and work together to construct a fort. This lends itself to pretend-play adventures as well as providing a cozy place to read books. DANCE PARTY If the kids have some energy to burn or just love to dance, try an indoor dance party."},{"prompt":"Write a funny story about a bird who learns how to fly an airplane because he cannot fly with his own wings. Make the story three paragraphs long for an audience of five-year-old children.","completion":"Once upon a time, there was a bird named Maverick who could not fly because he was born with a broken wing. No matter how hard Maverick tried, he could never get off the ground. This made Maverick very sad. He wanted to fly like all of his friends, but he knew that he never would. One day, Maverick was sitting on a branch feeling sorry for himself when he saw a man getting ready to fly an airplane. \\"Wow!\\" Maverick exclaimed. \\"I wish I could fly like that!\\" The man took Maverick to his hangar and helped him build a special airplane. The airplane had a seat for Maverick and a big, strong wing that would help him fly. Maverick took the airplane to a nearby field and practiced flying. At first, it was hard, but he kept practicing and eventually, he got the hang of it. One day, Maverick was flying his airplane when he saw a group of other birds. The birds were amazed to see a bird flying an airplane, and they all wanted to know how Maverick did it. Maverick told the birds about the man who had helped him, and the birds were so impressed that they decided to build their airplanes. Soon, all the birds in the forest were flying airplanes, and they had a lot of fun together."},{"prompt":"Write a personal journal entry by someone who works as a wildlife biologist and is currently in charge of a coastal location working with marine wildlife.

I’m sore from all the walking, especially on the coastal shelf above the eastern beach. There was so much preparation to do today, getting ready for turtle watch. Brad and I spread out the drop cloths before we walked the beach, so nobody would bother the sand where we figure the mama turtles will show up tonight to lay their eggs. Caution tape is good but the cloth forces people to pay attention and they won’t just trample over that. I'm glad Jan and her team are going to collect the clothes just before dark. It gives me more time to rest. I let my partner take the lead today. He's earned his way out of probation. It’s been an adjustment for both of us, but he’s doing great. There wasn’t too much trash out there. I was pleasantly surprised. Maybe people are trying to take the pollution lectures more seriously now that we’ve worked hard to put an animal face on things. After the turtles lay their eggs, we’ll probably have to fight lazy people all over again. I swear it’s like herding a bunch of brainless cattle sometimes, getting them to take responsibility for things. All in all, it’s been a good day even with miles of hiking and cleanup. I’m just going to relax until later so I can enjoy watching out for the turtles without falling asleep. I’m glad there’s another team making sure the tourists stay far back from the action. I get why they want to see, but too many people will scare the turtles away and they need all the help they can get."},{"prompt":"Did anything bad actually happen in the y2k scare?

Oftentimes, Ginger, Fluffer's very best friend, would come around and play with him. Fluffer enjoyed Ginger's company so much. One day, Fluffer saw something out in the backyard. He couldn't quite make out what it was. Upon looking even closer, he noticed Ginger was stuck in the fence. Frantic, Fluffer immediately went to the back door and started scratching at the door furiously. When his owner didn't notice, he started meowing profusely. Finally, his owner came and let Fluffer out. Fluffer immediately darted over to where Ginger was. He saw his tail was stuck in between the fence posts. Fluffer nudged it loose with the tip of his nose. Ginger leaped in the air with happiness that his best friend had come and saved him.

What animal ideas would you recommend to someone who has little to no experience with pets?","completion":"Owning a pet is a great activity as it brings you joy in your everyday life while helping you form bonds with nature and express your emotions in a healthy way. For first-time owners, the pet choice will depend on their interests, budget, and resources, as well as what kind of animal they feel comfortable with. Here are a few animals perfect for first-time pet owners: 1. Dogs: Dogs are the ideal choice for most animal lovers. Although dogs can be a handful and they can take a fair amount of time to train, there's no doubt that they're loyal and wonderful companions. Golden retrievers and poodles are good breeds for first-time owners as they're generally easy to take care of. 2. Cats: A beloved icon of the pet world, cats are known to be quite independent and extroverted as they can easily stroll around the neighborhood and find their way back to you. Take note that cats use litter boxes so you have to clean up after them regularly. 3. Hamsters: If you're looking for something small and manageable, hamsters are the perfect pet choice for you. They're usually harmless and easy to maintain with no risk of aggressive behavior or unhealthy habits. 4. Rats: Although rats can be intimidating for most people, they make great pets as long as you treat them gently and carefully. They do have some defense mechanisms that you'll have to get used to, but they're generally pretty calm and friendly creatures that you can easily get along with. 5. Fish: Fish can make great pets as long as you maintain a safe boundary for them. Their tank or aquarium should be well-built, regularly cleaned, and placed at a suitable location where it doesn't easily fall over. Overall, owning a pet is a great way to showcase your passion for nature and wildlife, while giving you a fulfilling sense of attachment and responsibility. It's best to explore your options and determine what kind of pet would be best suitable for your house."},{"prompt":"Write an outline for a blog post about choosing promotional gifts.","completion":"- an introductory paragraph discussing the importance of promotional gifts - a paragraph suggesting promotional gifts that recipients can use because people prefer useful gifts - a paragraph discussing that you should choose a gift that fits your brand and/or clientele - a paragraph explaining the importance of putting your logo or business information on the promotional gift - a paragraph emphasizing that you give gifts of reasonable quality, things people will enjoy and want to display so people can see your logo - a conclusion paragraph summing up the information in this post and potentially suggesting a next step for people looking for promotional gift ideas"},{"prompt":"What are some things to tell a flat earther to convince them the earth is round?","completion":"Here are some arguments you can use to prove that the Earth is round. • The Earth's shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse is round.

It should compare it to previous games in the series. Also should discuss the strategy layer of the game.","completion":"Expeditions: Rome is the third game in the Expeditions series by Danish developer, Logic Artists. Unlike previous entries in that series, however, players are tasked not with leading a small party, but an entire legion during the final years of the Roman Republic. This serves both as one of the game's great strengths and its foundational issue. Story-wise, Expeditions Rome is a conventional but well-told tale of revenge and loyalty. You start off seeking to avenge the murder of your father, and along the way attract a diverse band of unusual and unexpected allies. While the story beats are entirely predictable, Expeditions: Rome manages to tell it in a way that seems both authentic to the setting while navigating modern-day sensibilities. Players are not limited by their choice of gender in the way an actual woman of the Republic would have been, and many of the more distasteful norms of that era are acknowledged but not forced upon the player. The writing is good and the characters are believable in their dialogue and motivations. Gameplay-wise, the tactical element of Expeditions Rome: is similarly conventional but competent. Your party members come in a variety of Roman-themed classes that fulfill the classic roles of the ranged attacker, tank, crowd control, and support. As you travel across Greece, Egypt, and Gaul, new enemy types will force you to rethink the tactics that worked for you earlier, and new items and skills will keep things interesting and your playstyle evolving. Where Expeditions: Rome completely fails, however, is in its strategic layer. Unlike Expeditions: Viking or Expeditions: Conquistador, you are no longer leading just a small band of explorers across an untamed wilderness. Now, as Legatus, you are tasked with leading one, even several legions across mostly inhabited areas. The mystery of the exploration is now gone, and the randomized events that occur as you travel are reduced to being irritants. What's worse are the battles. These depend on cards that you can spend time collecting and upgrading, but the reality is that the 'strategy' boils down mostly to comparing what numbers are larger. A completely wasted opportunity. Ultimately, Expeditions Rome is a 7/10 game. A competent sequel for fans of the series with unnecessary 'improvements'. How was that? I aimed for a positive review that reflected your request for a 7/10 score."},{"prompt":"Please write a nice blog post about healthy foods that can improve hair health. Be nice when talking about it.

This is not the kind of service I have come to expect from your establishment and I felt it was my duty to bring these concerns to your attention. Upon entering the store I noticed that the cashier was looking at something on her phone. I don’t know if you have a policy about this, but it did seem unprofessional. Normally, I would not complain, but my problems didn't stop there. The aisles were very unorganized, and when I finally found an item that would work for my project, I could not tell what the price was. I took the item up to the cashier, who tucked her phone away, and asked her if she could tell me the price first. She seemed like I had disturbed her. As she went to scan the item her phone went off and she stopped to check it! She returned her attention to me, “Will this be on your credit card?” I told her that I was waiting to be told the price before I decided if I was gonna buy it. She brushed off her mistake like it was my fault and told me the price. It was more than I wanted, so I told her I didn’t want it and would be back with another option. The girl handed me back the item and asked me to put it back. I would have offered, but her insistence bothered me. When I came back up to the counter, she was on her phone again. This time, she didn’t even notice me, and I had to say something to get her attention. She rang up my item and told me the total. I went to hand her a coupon and she told me it wouldn’t work without even trying it. I asked her to scan it anyway. It did work, and she just said, “They must have changed the exclusions.” I paid and left. If this is what we are left with for customer service, then I don’t know what to say.

I am outraged by the County Commission’s recent decision to terminate the lease of the Head Start program at the County Court House. With this decision, a much-needed, already under-funded program may simply have no place to go! Head Start is a fantastic program. It makes sure that poor and other at-risk pre-school children will have the nutritious food and special attention they just may not get elsewhere. It gives these children a true “head start” in a world where they may not get many other chances. And there is plenty of evidence to show that Head Start makes a big difference to kids later in life. The Commission’s recent decision to oust the program to make more room for a ”state Gifts Shop” is ridiculous! If the leaders of our community would like to run a store to sell Kansas-made goods, I’m all for it. However, neither my Kansas pride nor my greed run so deep as to wish to take away the breakfast of 30 hungry three-year-olds.

Let the parents of the children in this program pay for childcare and food for their families like the rest of us do! The children will learn more from seeing their parents work hard for what they earn instead of getting a free handout. I love the idea of a Gift Shop featuring items made right here in Kansas.

With a massive surge in gamers in recent years due to the pandemic, there is a high demand for gaming content. Can you give me 5 tips for new gamers? These tips should be basic, nothing advanced. Also, be sure to include at least two tips about aiming.","completion":"Sure! Here are five tips for new gamers: 1) Train hand-eye coordination. How quickly you react to events in video games depends on your hand-eye coordination. Hand-eye or eye-hand coordination refers to your eyes and hands working simultaneously to solve your situation. You can improve your hand-eye coordination by playing sports, playing more video games, practicing juggling, playing cornhole, painting, or any activity requiring you to use your hands and eyes simultaneously. 2) Practice your aim. Aiming is a big part of most games. FPS games are extremely popular, and they rely heavily on aiming. You can practice aiming by playing custom games against AIs, using practice ranges, and changing your settings to match your play style better. 3) Fix your crosshair. Everyone has a different play style. To understand yours better, try experimenting with the crosshair you use. Changing your crosshair will improve your aim and help you become a better gamer. 4) Learn more about the game. Whatever games you're playing, you need to understand them. You cannot improve at the game if you don't know why certain actions are good or bad. For example, if you died, analyze why you died. Was it bad positioning? Were you not listening closely enough? You'll become a better gamer by analyzing the game and learning more about the ins and outs of it, 5) Discover your strengths and weaknesses. Every gamer has strengths and weaknesses, no matter what game they're playing. Some players are naturally gifted at aiming, while others are not. Some gamers are gifted with game sense, while others are not. Determine what your strengths and weaknesses are, and work on your weaknesses. If you can, try working on your weaknesses in an area where you're strong. For example, if you have good positioning but a bad aim, try improving your aim by positioning yourself in an area you feel more comfortable practicing your aim."},{"prompt":"Write an e-mail template that US citizens can use to write to their senators to ask them to support gun control laws.

One American named Frank Culbertson happened to be in the right place at the right time. He was on the International Space Station just as it was about to fly over New York City. When he saw and heard about what happened, he quickly checked the space station's location on a map and grabbed a video camera. Then he raced for the cupola, a space station module with a large window that is often used for Earth-gazing. On the way, he informed his crewmates about what happened. He captured videos and pictures of the plume of smoke coming from the World Trade Center. On the next orbit, he and his crewmates captured images of a haze over Washington, D.C. However, they were unable to tell where it was coming from.

I had nowhere to turn. With an aggressive shake, the zipper was torn off by a burly, furry beast four feet from me, another right behind it. It braced its yellow fangs with saliva dripping.

A REIT is a company, similar to a mutual fund, that pools the money of numerous investors. That capital is used to purchase, operate or finance real estate for the purpose of generating income. Most REITs are publicly traded on stock exchanges, making it easy for investors hold real estate investments without the need to purchase, manage or maintain individual properties."},{"prompt":"Give me a list of four basic tools to have around the house. Give some detail on why these are good choices.","completion":"- A 4-in-1 screwdriver. This tool has a set of regular and Philips heads on two bits that store inside the semi-hollow stem. This should be enough to tackle most minor repairs and maintenance, but if you find the bit sizes a little too small or large for what you need, consider a set of screwdrivers that either have more individual tools or a larger set of bits. Keep in mind that having a longer stem on a single tool may help you get into narrower areas. - A hammer. These come in various shapes and sizes, but a basic claw-style hammer will get most jobs done. If you need to hang some decorations or artwork, think about getting a set of nails made for this purpose. They are usually gold in color and tend to have rounded, more decorative hardware. - A tape measure or ruler. How long is that mini-blind in the den? How much space is in the living room? Answer these questions and more with a retractable tape measure. A yardstick can also be helpful for medium measuring that is too large for a ruler. Getting the right measurements will ensure you have the right fit for curtains, carpets, and more. - Tapes and adhesives. Electrical tape is useful for more than just wrapping wires. The use of duct tape beyond heating systems is almost legendary. Glue or rubber cement can be handy for quick repairs as well. Masking tape is not only used for painting but can be used to hang a quick note as well. These are the basics, but there are certainly many more tools out there for just about any repair or project you can think of. Hardware stores often have “how to” classes or materials and are a good source for any extra tools and advice you may need."},{"prompt":"Write an outline for an essay on the major goals of the Gemini Program.

Wong Kar-wai made Chungking Express during a two-month break from the editing of his wuxia film Ashes of Time. He said \\"While I had nothing to do, I decided to make Chungking Express following my instincts,\\"[12] and that \\"After the very heavy stuff, heavily emphasized in Ashes of Time, I wanted to make a very light, contemporary movie, but where the characters had the same problems.\\" Originally, Wong envisioned the stories as similar but with contrasting settings: one in Hong Kong Island in daylight, and the other in Kowloon at night. He felt that \\"despite the difference, they are the same stories\\": one was about encountering love in the tight city, the other was about the keeping love without physical connection.[12][10] The screenplay was not finished by the time filming began; Wong finished it when filming paused over New Year. He wrote the second story in a single day.[12] He developed a third story, about a love-sick hitman, but as he felt it would make Chungking Express overlong, he produced it as a separate film, Fallen Angels (1995). Wong wanted to film in Tsim Sha Tsui, since he grew up in the area and felt a strong connection to it. He described it as \\"an area where the Chinese literally brush shoulders with westerners, and is uniquely Hong Kong.\\" He was drawn to Chungking Mansion for its many lodgings, mix of cultures, and its significance as a crime hotspot; he felt that, as a \\"mass-populated and hyperactive place\\", it worked as a metaphor for Hong Kong itself.[12] The director once talked about his inspiration by the works of Haruki Murakami.[citation needed] As an example, the original title of the film is \\"重慶森林\\", while the Chinese title of Haruki Murakami's \\"Norwegian Wood\\" (1987) is \\"挪威的森林\\". The second story was shot in Central, including Lan Kwai Fong, near a popular fast food shop called Midnight Express.[13] \\"In this area, there are a lot of bars, a lot of foreign executives would hang out there after work,\\" Wong remembers. The fast food shop is forever immortalized as the spot where Tony Leung and Faye Wong's characters met and became attracted to one another. Wong was also drawn to \\"the escalator from Central to the mid-levels. That interests me because no one has made a movie there. When we were scouting for locations we found the light there entirely appropriate.\\"[12] The apartment of Tony Leung's character was cinematographer Christopher Doyle's apartment at the time of filming.[14] Wong narrates the story in a fragmented structure and connects the fragments through monologues. By looking at the pictures created by Wong, the emotions and themes central to the story become clear.[15]","completion":"During a two-month break from filming \\"Ashes of Time,\\" Wong Kar-wai began writing \\"Chungking Express.\\" He finished the screenplay while shooting the film, and the second story was written in a day.

By Ted Breaux's estimate, there are only a few dozen people alive who have had the opportunity to taste authentic absinthe, the drink whose notoriety defined the Belle Epoque and which had been banned in many countries for almost a century. It is a number that he is determined to increase. On a crisp, clear fall morning, he greeted me at the Combier distillery, in Saumur, in France's Loire Valley. It is here that Breaux, a thirty-nine-year-old environmental chemist from Louisiana, is trying to reverse-engineer absinthe, precisely as it was made a hundred years ago. In the near distance, the towers of Saumur's castle rose above the slate roofs of the town like an image from a medieval Book of Hours. On the street outside, a pair of young men in military fatigues and black berets cycled past before disappearing into the dressage yards of the adjacent Cadre Noir, the elite equestrian academy that has taught the French cavalry since the eighteenth century. Across the way stood the commandant's house, an elegant Second Empire building cordoned off from the street with pink and red roses. Like the castle and the Cadre Noir, the distillery, whose interior was designed by Gustave Eiffel, is a survivor from an earlier age. Breaux refers to it as \\"the Temple,\\" and, as he took me past pallets of empty bottles and a row of potted lemon tees, there was certainly a resemblance to sacred architecture: one of the region's Romanesque chapels, perhaps, with their pale limestone walls and vaulted ceilings. The narrow doorway was surmounted by a rose window, and graceful arched windows ran along one wall beneath a steep slate roof. Instead of incense, the air was heavy with the aromas of anise, fennel, and lucerne and the sharp tang of alcohol. Breaux was preparing to distill a batch of his Verte Suisse 65, one of three that he makes based on vintage recipes. The distillery was built in 1834, and though various features have been added, all its significant equipment predates the twentieth century. \\"It's an anachronism,\\" Breaux said. Inside, it looks like something from a Jules Verne novel. A spaghetti tangle of pipes and tubes emerges from two rows of bulbous copper alembics that line the walls on either side. The stills were acquired in 1920, after the breakup of the Pernod Fils absinthe distillery in Pontarlier, in the French Jura, once the centre of the absinthe industry. The Combier distillery is, literally, a museum; Breaux, who distils there every few months, has access to it in return for a small commission on every bottle he produces. During distillation, an occasional group of tourists wanders through, admiring the alembics. When I visited, sacks of herbs were stacked in every available space; there was a container of grape alcohol the size of a small car, and an electric pump. Near the entrance stood an immense plastic tub of wormwood, absinthe's distinctive and contentious constituent, which, since the late nineteenth century, was held to cause insanity. Down the center of the room, suspended fifteen feet above the floor, ran a wrought-iron passerelle, or walkway, whose lacy gold-and-maroon ironwork clearly bore the signature of Gustave Eiffel. Since Combier began operating, techniques of distillation have moved on to embrace new technologies such as mechanized mixing and electronic temperature and pressure controls. But obsolescence is precisely what Breaux wants.","completion":"In the mysterious world of spirits, authentic absinthe – the infamously potent beverage that charmed the Belle Epoque – has been shrouded in a veil of obscurity for nearly a century. Today, only a handful of living souls have had the chance to taste this legendary concoction. But there's a man, a man named Ted Breaux, who is on a mission to lift that veil. Under the vivid canvas of a fall morning, we found ourselves at the gateway of the Combier distillery, situated in the charming Loire Valley of France. Breaux, a chemist by profession and Louisiana by origin, was there, embarking on a daring journey. His quest? To resurrect absinthe, just as it was crafted a century ago. The silhouette of Saumur's castle loomed majestically against the skyline, a spectacle reminiscent of a scene from a medieval manuscript. Beyond, the rhythmic pedalling of youthful soldiers in dark berets echoed through the streets, their destination - the hallowed Cadre Noir, a prestigious equestrian academy steeped in French military history. Amidst this backdrop of history and elegance, a quaint Second Empire building adorned with blooming roses stood defiantly – the commandant's abode. Inside the distillery, lovingly referred to as \\"the Temple\\" by Breaux, one could feel an atmosphere akin to a sacred sanctuary. The intricate designs by Gustave Eiffel, the aged limestone walls, and high vaulted ceilings lent an ethereal quality to the structure. The air within the temple was thick with intoxicating fragrances of anise, fennel, and lucerne, underpinned by the potent aroma of alcohol. Breaux was on the verge of distilling his Verte Suisse 65, one of the three vintage recipes he was attempting to reincarnate. The distillery, a timeless testament from 1834, was a labyrinth of intricate copper alembics and labyrinthine piping, an ambiance that would befit a Jules Verne narrative. Breaux, in a reciprocal arrangement with the owners, was allowed to utilize this living museum. Amid the chaotic arrangement of sacks of herbs and vast containers of alcohol, Breaux was focused on his mission – unlocking the secret recipe of authentic absinthe. The heart of absinthe, wormwood, known for its controversial reputation of inducing insanity, lay in an enormous plastic tub near the entrance. The distillery was a relic of a bygone era, untouched by modern innovations in distillation technology. But for Breaux, this was perfect. After all, he was not looking to the future; his mission was anchored in the past – in the resurrection of a long-lost secret."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet for a culinary tourism account about a dish called Ashlan Fu.

While the CubeSat couldn’t reach the lunar South Pole to help seek ice, it fulfilled several technology goals that will empower future missions for the benefit of humanity. NASA’s Lunar Flashlight launched on Dec. 11, 2022, to demonstrate several new technologies, with an ultimate goal to seek out surface ice in the permanently shadowed craters of the Moon’s South Pole. Since then, the briefcase-size satellite’s miniaturized propulsion system – the first of its kind ever flown – proved unable to generate enough thrust to get into lunar orbit, despite months of effort by the operations team. Because the CubeSat cannot complete maneuvers to stay in the Earth-Moon system, NASA has called an end to the mission. NASA relies on technology demonstrations to fill specific knowledge gaps and to test new technologies. Used for the first time beyond Earth’s orbit, Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system and green fuel were such demonstrations. Although the propulsion system was unable to produce the desired thrust – likely because of debris buildup in the thruster fuel lines – newly developed propulsion system components exceeded performance expectations. Also surpassing expectations were Lunar Flashlight’s never-before-flown Sphinx flight computer – a low-power computer developed by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California to withstand the radiation of deep space – and the spacecraft’s upgraded Iris radio. Featuring a new precision navigation capability, the radio can be used by future small spacecraft to rendezvous and land on solar system bodies. “Technology demonstrations are, by their nature, higher risk and high reward, and they’re essential for NASA to test and learn,” said Christopher Baker, program executive for Small Spacecraft Technology in the Space Technology Mission Directorate at NASA Headquarters in Washington. “Lunar Flashlight was highly successful from the standpoint of being a testbed for new systems that had never flown in space before. Those systems, and the lessons Lunar Flashlight taught us, will be used for future missions.” The mission’s miniaturized four-laser reflectometer, a science instrument that had never flown before, either, also tested successfully, giving the mission’s science team confidence that the laser would have been able to detect ice if it were present at the lunar surface. “It’s disappointing for the science team, and for the whole Lunar Flashlight team, that we won’t be able to use our laser reflectometer to make measurements at the Moon,” said Barbara Cohen, the mission’s principal investigator at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. “But like all the other systems, we collected a lot of in-flight performance data on the instrument that will be incredibly valuable to future iterations of this technique.” Propulsion System Performance Challenges Despite the mission’s technological wins, Lunar Flashlight’s miniaturized propulsion system struggled to provide sufficient thrust to put the CubeSat on course for the planned near-rectilinear halo orbit that would have given the spacecraft weekly flybys of the Moon’s South Pole. The team suspects that debris obstructed the fuel lines, causing the diminished and inconsistent thrust. The miniaturized propulsion system included an additively manufactured fuel feed system that likely developed the debris – such as metal powder or shavings – and obstructed fuel flow to the thrusters, limiting their performance. Although the team devised a creative method for using just one thruster to maneuver the spacecraft, Lunar Flashlight needed more consistent thrust to reach its planned orbit. The operations team calculated a new orbit that could be reached using the spacecraft’s small amount of potential remaining thrust. The plan called for putting the CubeSat on a path that would place it in orbit around Earth rather than the Moon, with monthly flybys of the lunar South Pole. While this would have meant fewer flybys, the spacecraft would have flown closer to the surface. With the mission running out of time to arrive at the needed orbit, the operations team tried to dislodge any debris from the fuel lines by increasing the fuel pressure well beyond the propulsion system’s designed capacity. Despite limited success, the required trajectory correction maneuvers couldn’t be completed in time. “The student operations team at Georgia Tech, with assistance from JPL and NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, rose to the challenge and came up with an incredible array of inventive techniques to utilize what tiny amount of thrust Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system could deliver,” said John Baker, Lunar Flashlight project manager at JPL. “We learned a lot and honed new methods and strategies for working with tiny spacecraft.” After having traveled out past the Moon, Lunar Flashlight is now moving back toward Earth and will fly past our planet with a close approach of about 40,000 miles (65,000 kilometers) on May 17. The CubeSat will then continue into deep space and orbit the Sun. It continues to communicate with mission operators, and NASA is weighing options for the future of the spacecraft. More About the Mission Lunar Flashlight is managed for NASA by JPL, a division of Caltech in Pasadena, California. The CubeSat is operated by Georgia Tech, including graduate and undergraduate students. The Lunar Flashlight science team is led by NASA Goddard and includes team members from the University of California, Los Angeles; Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory; and the University of Colorado. The CubeSat’s propulsion system was developed by NASA Marshall in Huntsville, Alabama, with development and integration support from Georgia Tech. NASA’s Small Business Innovation Research program funded component development from small businesses including Plasma Processes Inc. (Rubicon) for thruster development, Flight Works for pump development, and Beehive Industries (formerly Volunteer Aerospace) for specific 3D-printed components. The Air Force Research Laboratory also contributed financially to the development of Lunar Flashlight’s propulsion system. Lunar Flashlight is funded by the Small Spacecraft Technology program based at NASA’s Ames Research Center in Silicon Valley and within NASA’s Space Technology Mission Directorate.","completion":"It is unfortunate that the Lunar Flashlight CubeSat could not reach the desired orbit around the Moon.

My favorite treat to grab whenever I'm at the dollar store. DOCTOR: I... it is my firm recommendation that you put a stop to eating rubber bands immediately. PATIENT: Can't do that for you, Doc. See, I'd listen to any other piece of advice you had, whether that was eating more greens or more fish. But one thing I cannot give up is my daily pack of rubber bands. DOCTOR: Honestly, this is a first for me, and I've seen some strange things. What is it that compels you to continue eating these rubber bands? PATIENT: Doc, I've never known such a delicious and fulfilling snack in my entire life. Honestly, it's the highlight of my day breaking open a bag of rubber bands and grubbing on a few of them, saving the rest for later when I laze out on the couch after work. DOCTOR: Surely there are better snacks for that. Have you tried potato chips, or maybe even ice cream? PATIENT: Yes Doc, tried them all, and none of them could even compare to the joy I get from popping that first rubber band into my mouth. And honestly, have you looked into what's in potato chips and ice cream? I'd say my health is better off with the rubber bands, thank you. DOCTOR: Sir, we at least have records on what those kinds of snacks will do to your body. I'm afraid I cannot give you proper medical advice if you continue on this path of eating rubber bands.

In 1870 Lobengula granted Sir John Swinburne's London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the Tati River between the Shashe and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the Tati Concession.[5][6] However, it was not until about 1890 that any significant mining in the area commenced.[citation needed] Lobengula had been tolerant of the white hunters who came to Matabeleland; he would even go so far as to punish those of his tribe who threatened the whites. However, when a British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came in 1888 to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory, he was wary about entering into negotiations. Lobengula gave his agreement only when his friend, Leander Starr Jameson, a qualified medical doctor who had once treated Lobengula for gout, proposed to secure money and weaponry for the Matabele in addition to a pledge that any people who came to dig would be considered as living in his kingdom. As part of this agreement, and at the insistence of the British, neither the Boers nor the Portuguese would be permitted to settle or gain concessions in Matabeleland. Although, Lobengula was illiterate and was not aware of how damaging this contract was to his country, only found out the real terms of the contract he signed as his subjects found out. After going to friendly English missionaries to confirm this rumour, Lobengula sent two emissaries to the British queen, Victoria, but this proved futile.","completion":"1870: Lobengula granted Sir John Swinburne's London and Limpopo Mining Company the right to search for gold and other minerals on a tract of land in the extreme southwest of Matabeleland along the Tati River between the Shashe and Ramaquabane rivers, in what became known as the Tati Concession. 1888: A British team (Francis Thompson, Charles Rudd and Rochfort Maguire) came to try to persuade him to grant them the right to dig for minerals in additional parts of his territory. 1890: Significant mining in the area commenced."},{"prompt":"I need five ideas on how to make my bedroom more relaxing and cozier. Better sleep and a calmer mind is the end goal!","completion":"Your bedroom should be a place where you feel safe and comfortable from the moment you step foot in it. You should long for the sanctuary of your bedroom in the evenings, especially after a long workday has left you feeling stressed and haggard. Did you know that there are 335 million people in the United States and one-third of them aren’t getting enough sleep? While there are many contributing factors to the lack of good doze, one main component is the lack of a properly relaxing and cozy space. For a calmer mind and better sleep, here are five ideas for making your bedroom a more relaxing and cozier safe place. 1. Choose colors that remind you of calmness and peace. For many people, various shades of blue or purple are calming colors. Cerulean blue, for instance, is a favorite because it reminds most people of the oceans. Whereas, purple is often symbolic of luxury, which many people associate with a plush and cozy bedroom environment. However, color therapy is different for everyone, and the trick is finding colors that are soothing and calming specifically to you. It can be any color that evokes a peaceful brain response. While you don’t have to flood your bedroom with that singular color, a few splashes in pillows, blankets, and even on the walls could have a safe, comforting effect on your brain and body. 2. What’s your “perfect storm” for a good night’s sleep? As everyone’s calm colors are different, so are everyone’s ideas of an ideal sleep space. While some people love complete darkness and a cold bedroom with a fan on high throughout the year, others are happier and sleep better with a nightlight in a quiet room of warm, still air. It’s a personal preference, often associated with the ways you slept growing up. Ergo, it could be a catalyst for better sleep and a calmer mind as an adult too. It may take trial and error, but work on discovering the environment that is most conducive to your calm state of mind and a good night’s rest. Once you’ve found your “perfect storm” of peace, it should be easier to create a cozy, calm environment in the bedroom. 3. Bring nature into the bedroom with crystals, a vase of flowers, or windowsill succulents. Nature is balance, and finding balance in your bedroom could mean reminding yourself of the equilibrium found in nature. For instance, you could add greenery with windowsill succulents, or bring a bloom of color onto your nightstand with a fresh vase of flowers. Into the mystical side of nature? Crystals are symbolic of inner feelings and your psyche, so invest and display crystals that represent what you want. For instance, black tourmaline repels negative energies, while amethyst encourages good dreams and deeper sleep. 4. Engage your senses with softness and soothing scents. Calmness and peace are felt across all of your senses, so engage in those before bedtime. You could, for example, invest in a sound machine for the gentle lull of ocean waves or a cacophony of cicadas and crickets to remind you of your childhood. You could also surround yourself with softness, like plush pillows and luxurious blankets atop crisp, clean sheets. Another way to invite calm into your bedroom is with the right scents. Lavender is naturally soothing to the mind, while vanilla is a subtle, mellow fragrance that transports your brain back to simpler, peaceful times. You don’t have to douse your pillows and blankets but use a room spritz to liven the air or do the same with a candle. Just don’t forget to blow out the candle before you doze off. 5. The less clutter in your bedroom, the less clutter in your mind before bedtime. Clutter of your safe space is clutter of your mind because when the clutter becomes too much, your brain will latch onto the worry and responsibility of eventually having to clean and organize everything cluttered. It’s a thought that can keep you awake at night! Use your day to declutter and organize your bedroom. The less worry you give yourself, the better sleep you’ll have, and the calmer your mind will be. Remember that the aim here is to create a haven for yourself."},{"prompt":"When were cats first domesticated?","completion":"Experts estimate that cats began domesticating themselves up to 12,000 years ago, around the time that the first agricultural societies emerged in the Middle East's Fertile Crescent.

Drawing of Loren by Nicholas Volpe after she won an Oscar for Two Women (1961) In 1960, Loren starred in Vittorio De Sica's Two Women, a stark, gritty story of a mother who is trying to protect her 12-year-old daughter in war-torn Italy. The two end up gang-raped inside a church as they travel back to their home city following cessation of bombings there. Originally cast as the daughter, Loren fought against type and was eventually cast as the mother (actress Eleonora Brown would portray the daughter). Loren's performance earned her many awards, including the Cannes Film Festival's best performance prize, and an Academy Award for Best Actress, the first major Academy Award for a non-English-language performance or to an Italian actress. She won 22 international awards for Two Women. The film was extremely well received by critics and a huge commercial success. Though proud of this accomplishment, Loren did not show up to this award, citing fear of fainting at the award ceremony. Nevertheless, Cary Grant telephoned her in Rome the next day to inform her of the Oscar award.[18] During the 1960s, Loren was one of the most popular actresses in the world, and continued to make films in the United States and Europe, starring with prominent leading men. In 1961 and 1964, her career reached its pinnacle when she received 1 million to appear in El Cid and The Fall of the Roman Empire.

Include information about how the world's supply of copper is dwindling and that's why it's imperative to recycle copper, especially copper wire. Give instructions on how to clean and weigh copper wire and how to figure the value. Keep the word count under 400 words.","completion":"Copper is one of our planet’s precious natural resources that is quickly running out. In fact, the Mining, Minerals and Sustainable Development Project reports that copper recycling needs to increase to around 100 percent before the end of the twenty-first century if we are to have the copper necessary for industry and commerce. The worldwide demand for copper is growing because of the many new products coming out every year, like PDAs, smartphones, pad computers, laptops, and many other electronics. The circuit boards on many of these devices require copper, so recycling copper wire isn’t just a good idea; it’s imperative. For these reasons, copper recycling has become a big business. Copper doesn’t break down or disintegrate over time like aluminum and other metals. It retains its good properties for many years and can easily be melted down for use in all sorts of industries. Copper wire is one major area where recycling has really grown in the last few years. This is good news for those who have copper wiring they don’t need anymore. You can help the planet out and make some money on the side. Copper wire retains its value, but all copper recyclers are not the same. Some are a bit on the shady side and will use faulty scales that weigh your copper light, so they don’t have to pay the full amount. It’s best to deal with a reputable copper recycler in your area that has a good name. It also helps to know the current copper prices. The more you know, the better your chances of not being taken advantage of. Figuring the Weight & Value of Copper Wire First, strip the copper wire so that you remove all surrounding plastic.

Include 4 different options (A, B, C, D) below the multiple-choice questions. Place the title \\"MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS\\" above the questions. Post 5 answers below the quiz with only the letter symbol. Place the title \\"ANSWERS\\" above the 5 answers. The four pillars of fast relief DripDrop’s patented formula uses ORS science to activate a hydration shortcut known as the sodium-glucose cotransport system, accelerating fluid absorption into the bloodstream so you can feel better faster. MUST. HAVE. SODIUM When it comes to dehydration, not all electrolytes are created equal. Sodium is the key electrolyte necessary to pull fluids and other electrolytes into your bloodstream. But sodium has a tough time getting through the intestines on its own. It needs a little glucose to speed absorption. A LITTLE GLUCOSE Pairing Sodium with a little glucose opens a hydration shortcut, helping fluids and electrolytes pass rapidly from your intestines into your bloodstream via the sodium-glucose cotransport system. It's like shifting into high gear! With the right ratio of sodium and glucose, water absorption increases 2-3x. LOW OSMOLARITY DripDrop's precise ratio is only part of the balanced equation that makes our formula so unique (and fast!). We also keep the particles in our solution (i.e. osmolarity) low. Why? For optimal efficiency and speed. Fewer particles equal speedier absorption, so you can feel better faster. UNMATCHABLE FLAVOR Making a rehydration solution that works this well and tastes this good isn't easy. Without compromising efficacy, DripDrop provides great-tasting dehydration relief fast. It's a powerhouse against dehydration that checks all the boxes.","completion":"MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTIONS 1. Which DripDrop pillar below is NOT correct? A. Must Have Sodium B. A Little Glucose. C.

I need two paragraphs describing a late summer scene with a river, wind, birds, squirrels, etc. This should be written from the perspective of a tree, including the types of things a tree would focus on as it contemplates the coming of autumn.","completion":"The old oak had seen many summers like this one, and it always loved savoring the moments it brought - birds nesting in its branches, the rushing lap of the stream against the bank, the chatter of squirrels as they plucked its acorns from the ground and stirred the dirt around its roots as they planted them. The clouds overhead shielded its highest leaves from the warmth of the sun, and there was a slight chill in the air against its rugged bark promising the coming of autumn. The tree couldn't ignore it any longer - the birds were limbering up for their southward flight, their young ones eager to be away. The squirrels had already forgotten where they'd planted their acorns, and the soil bore a chill as cold mountain waters permeated it. Autumn was nigh, and the old tree had to be ready for a long sleep. Still, it was determined to celebrate the passing summer in the same way it always did: with whirlwinds of vibrant color!"},{"prompt":"I want to increase the privacy and security of my users by storing their passwords as hashes.

Creating a comic book can be a difficult but rewarding venture. Here are some things to consider when creating a new comic book: 1. Protagonist/Antagonist - Who is the main character/villain of the story? Your characters can be anything you want them to be; they don't necessarily have to follow the tradition of being individuals with superpowers. For instance, you could create characters who are based on people like yourself, living an ordinary life and dealing with ordinary, relatable problems. Consider the works of Harvey Pekar (\\"American Splendor\\"), which showcase stories about ordinary people. Or, if you decide to write characters who follow the fantasy superhero trope, know who they are (origin, superpowers, and how they got them, etc.). Generally, your characters should be fleshed out completely. 2. Story - A good story can be made from any situation, but generally, most stories follow a formula that has been used in storytelling for centuries (i.e., Man vs. Man, Man vs. Environment). You could also write an autobiographical story or a story about other people who have lived or are still living. Your story is as creative and compelling as you make it, and it does not have to adhere to any set rules as long as it tells a coherent story that is worth reading. 3. Illustrations - Drawing comic book characters and scenery can be done by yourself by hand or digitally using programs found online. You can also hire someone to draw the comic books for you if you have no desire or artistic skill to do it on your own. When making the illustrations for your comic book, have a clear idea of what you want the drawings to convey and consider using drawing techniques that show actions taking place (e.g., using \\"action lines\\" to illustrate a person's punch wooshing by another person's face.) 4. Format - You can decide to have either a printed comic book on paper or a digital comic book that can be distributed via email or an app. With either option, you will still adhere to the same aforementioned steps, but the approach to going through these steps may differ slightly. For instance, making a digital comic book will still require illustrations, but illustrating digital comics will require the use of programs (i.e., Adobe, Paint, et al.) whereas printed comic books require ink and paper. Also, printing a comic book will result in something you can hold with your own hands but can become torn or worn over time, whereas a digital comic book has no tactile feel to it but will never deteriorate."},{"prompt":"One of my dreams is to write children’s books, but I feel creatively stuck – zero ideas!

Until you need to change something. I shoot all Blackmagic and recently worked with another crew shooting on Sony and Canon, and it's amazing how much longer they took setting up than we did. Simple stuff like loading LUTs and changing color settings is so intuitive on Blackmagic, no \\"picture profile 7 with SLOG 3\\" made up terminology that requires either a manual or great memory to get right. Audio controls and channel assignments are super streamlined, recording codecs are all presented at once with 2 taps to change to whatever codec and compression ratio you want. In the field we had a technical issue with a stream encoder (clients gear, not mine!) and had to change frame rates and exposures on all 8 cameras. That was done in a matter of seconds with no menu diving at all, they just have all the controls you really need right up front with nice big sliders and easy to read font. It's really nice, especially coming from photo cameras before","completion":"I shoot everything on Blackmagic cameras, but recently worked with a different crew that shot on Sony and Canon cameras. The Sony and Canon cameras take much longer to set up than the Blackmagic cameras. Sony and Canon use bespoke terminology and jargon to describe their various setting options, which makes it more difficult for people new to the cameras to figure out how to program and set them up properly. With Blackmagic, the menus and options are more intuitive and controlling for audio options through the camera is much easier and quicker to adjust the specific settings you'd like to record at. One day, we were shooting with eight Blackmagic cameras when a critical piece of equipment for recording the data malfunctioned. This meant that we had to adjust the settings on all eight cameras to correct for the error. On other brands of camera, this could be an extensive process due to the complexity of menus and setting options, but on Blackmagic it was a very quick and easy process as the controls are all easily understandable and accessible."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this in an excited tone. Astronomers have detected a huge plume of water vapour spurting out into space from Enceladus, an icy moon of Saturn. The 504km-wide (313 miles) moon is well known for its geysers, but this is a particularly big one. The water stream spans some 9,600km - a distance equivalent to that of flying from the UK to Japan. Scientists are fascinated by Enceladus because its sub-surface salty ocean - the source of the water - could hold the basic conditions to support life. Nasa's Cassini mission (2004-2017) gathered tantalising evidence of the necessary chemistry by regularly flying through the geysers and sampling the water with its instruments - although it made no direct detection of biology. The new super-plume was spied by the James Webb Space Telescope. Previous observations had tracked vapour emissions extending for hundreds of kilometres, but this geyser is on a different scale.","completion":"Check this out!

Layered in threes, the sponge cake is sandwiched with a mixture of cherries and whipped cream or milk chocolate mousse, then the sides are pressed with Bavarian chocolate shards or milk chocolate curls. Traditionally, the dessert is creamy and indulgent, soaked in black cherry liquor for extra richness. • Coffee Caramel Mousse Creamy and airy with a fluff factor that could rival the softness of homemade whipped cream, Coffee Caramel Mousse boasts a subtle sweetness that makes it the perfect lightweight dessert. The tastes of coffee and caramel intermingle, and its often accompanied by fresh raspberries or strawberry slices to break up texture and flavors. • Banana Bread The sweetness in Banana Bread comes from mashed bananas, stirred with butter to a fluffy consistency before being baked to golden-brown perfection. The exterior crust is slightly crispy, while the interior is soft and light. Best-served warm, banana bread is delicious down to the last crumb. Some bakers incorporate chopped walnuts or chocolate chips for added texture and flavor. • Apple Brown Betty Reminiscent of an apple pie, Apple Brown Betty incorporates soft cinnamon-sugared apple slices with buttery, oven-browned breadcrumbs.

Use the following text for this task: Horror is a film genre that seeks to elicit fear or disgust in its audience for entertainment purposes.[2] Horror films often explore dark subject matter and may deal with transgressive topics or themes. Broad elements include monsters, apocalyptic events, and religious or folk beliefs. Cinematic techniques used in horror films have been shown to provoke psychological reactions in an audience. Horror films have existed for more than a century. Early inspirations from before the development of film include folklore, religious beliefs and superstitions of different cultures, and the Gothic and horror literature of authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, Bram Stoker, and Mary Shelley. From origins in silent films and German Expressionism, horror only became a codified genre after the release of Dracula (1931). Many sub-genres emerged in subsequent decades, including body horror, comedy horror, slasher films, supernatural horror and psychological horror. The genre has been produced worldwide, varying in content and style between regions. Horror is particularly prominent in the cinema of Japan, Korea, Italy and Thailand, among other countries. Despite being the subject of social and legal controversy due to their subject matter, some horror films and franchises have seen major commercial success, influenced society and spawned several popular culture icons.","completion":"1.

Get to know your garden Before you start, it's a good idea to get to know your garden. Check the aspect – is it south-facing or north-facing? Knowing where the sun hits the ground will help you decide what to grow where. It's also worth knowing what soil type you have. Take a look at what's growing – camellias, magnolias and pieris will tell you the soil is acidic, while absence of these suggests a more alkaline soil. Doing a soil test will further help you know your soil, and therefore what plants you can grow. 2. Plan your garden Sitting down and planning your garden is a great starting point. This way you can work out what to grow where, rather than getting carried away at the garden centre and ending up with a jumble of plants that don't look good together and might not suit your growing conditions. Planning will also enable you to use colour and structure wisely, which will help you create a garden that looks great throughout the year. 3. Learn how to plant Planting your plants properly will ensure they grow well and live for a long time. Make sure you take time to weed and prepare the soil before planting, and add mulch or fertiliser where necessary. If you're unsure how to plant something, look online for instructions rather than just hoping for the best. Trees planted too deeply will never thrive, and root-balls that sit proud of the soil surface will dry out quickly, leading to the eventual death of the plant. 4. Feed and water plants regularly Knowing when and how to water plants is the difference between them living and dying. As a general rule, water the root ball rather than the leaves, as it's the roots that absorb the water. Soaking the rootball every week is better than watering a little bit every day. Feeding is also important - generally you should be looking at feeding every fortnight during growing season (that's spring and summer), although you will need to feed more if growing in containers. 5. Start small When starting a new veg patch or allotment, it can be tempting to take it all on in one go. It's much better to do a little bit at a time. You can easily cover areas you don't want to cultivate with cardboard or black plastic, to stop weeds growing, while you work on a different area. 6. Keep an eye on pests Most garden pests don't do much harm to plants and can be left alone - there are plenty of natural predators that will keep them in check. However, sometimes pest populations can become an infestation, and you need to act. Keeping an eye out for increasing numbers of pests like aphids, slugs and snails, will help keep your plants safe, and save you a lot of heartache. 7. Make use of compost Composting kitchen and garden waste is good for the environment, wildlife, your purse and also your garden. Let the waste break down for a year and then use it as a mulch around the base of plants in your garden and veg patch.","completion":"1.

That will stop weeds from growing while you work in a different area. 6. Keep an eye on pests Most garden pests don't do much harm to plants and can be left alone. Some natural predators will keep them in check. But sometimes pest populations can become an infestation. That's when you need to act. Keep an eye out for increasing numbers of pests like aphids, slugs and snails. This will help keep your plants safe and save you a lot of trouble. 7. Make use of compost Composting kitchen and garden waste is good for the environment, wildlife, your money and your garden. Let the waste break down for a year. Then use it as a mulch around the base of plants in your garden and veg patch."},{"prompt":"Create two texts to my best friend asking where they are but making it seem like I am their mother.","completion":"Hey sweetie!

For some reason, for many freelance writers, it's uncomfortable to put a price on their worth, and sadly many freelancers sell themselves short. Obviously, it's important to consider your knowledge, skills, and experience, but price yourself with what you are comfortable earning so that you will continue to be motivated to keep up your freelance writing business for the long term. Here are some simplified steps to help you set your freelance writing rates. 1. Start with some online research. It's good to get a grasp on what people are paying in your industry or niche. If you don't have one, that's fine too! Seeing the differences in pay may be a factor to consider if you're thinking of choosing a niche. You can go to any of the freelance job platforms you're now a part of to see what clients are listing their budget as (even though it's not always listed), what other writers' rates are, and their level of experience/background. 2. Consider your professional and educational background. Even if you are new to freelance writing, any relevant experience can set you apart from others and provide a reason to charge a higher rate. This has its limits obviously, you must have the skill to back it up. If you have a degree in English or journalism, that sets you apart. Obviously, if you don't have a writing background or other credentials, this doesn't mean that you can't be a freelance writer, it just means that you may have to start at a lower rate until you have successfully completed a few projects and have some good reviews under your belt. 3. Consider the budget of potential clients. It's important to know what clients you are targeting. If you want to take on a client with a startup business, they will likely offer lower pay because that may be all that's in the budget. If you target more established businesses or individuals to write for, there may be more room for negotiation on your rate or the project cost."},{"prompt":"Who wrote the Star Spangled Banner?","completion":"The Star Spangled Banner was a poem written by Francis Scott Key in 1814.

When he became angry, he would just say anything that came to his mind and hurt people. So his father gave him a bag of nails and a hammer and said, “Every time you get angry, hammer one nail into the fence in our backyard”. The first few days the boy hammered so many nails that he emptied half the bag. Over the weeks, the number of nails he hammered to the fence reduced and gradually, his temper was much in control. Then came a day when he didn’t lose his temper at all. His father asked him to remove one nail each day so that he manages to control his temper. Finally, on the day the child was removing the last nail, his father says, “You have done well, boy. But do you see the holes in the wall? The fence is never going to be the same, even after repainting. Likewise, when you say mean things in anger, you will leave a scar in the person’s mind, as the nails did to the fence”. 1. It's okay if a child can't control his anger. 2. The holes in the fence represent the boy's love. 3. There is no moral to this story. 4. Anger is like a knife.

In October 2002, Congress granted Bush the power to decide whether to launch any military attack in Iraq.[54] The Iraq War began on 20 March 2003,[55] when the US, joined by the United Kingdom, Australia, and Poland, launched a \\"shock and awe\\" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later. The power vacuum following Saddam's demise, and mismanagement by the Coalition Provisional Authority, led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces. The United States responded with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007.[56] This build-up gave greater control to Iraq's government and military.[57] In 2008, President Bush agreed to a withdrawal of all US combat troops from Iraq.

The first movie was legendary in its own right and inspired numerous kids and young people to become fighter pilots in the military. Now, after 30-plus years, \\"Top Gun: Maverick\\" hits screens and allows a new generation of viewers to recapture the magic that surrounded the first movie. Cruise returns for the sequel (as the title bears his character, Pete \\"Maverick\\" Mitchell's name) as well as an appearance by Val Kilmer, who played \\"Iceman\\" in the first film. The cast is rounded out by stellar performances from newcomers to the series, including Miles Teller and Jon Hamm, among others. \\"Maverick\\" follows the story of Cruise's Maverick, now a Captain in the United States Navy, who is assigned to become the new instructor of the Navy's Top Gun school for elite pilots. The mission this time: teach the new pilots to fly a dangerous mission behind enemy lines and disable their weapons capabilities before they decide to strike domestic soil. Upon his return to Top Gun, Maverick rekindles a long-lost love in the movie's new female co-lead, Penny, played by acclaimed actress Jennifer Connelly. But the relationship with the most contention is between Maverick and one of the new mission pilots, Rooster, played by Miles Teller, who just happens to be Maverick's best friend Goose's son, a callback to the first movie. The film features high-flying camera work that puts Cruise and company in the cockpits of the planes they are depicted to be flying, creating a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience best seen on the big screen. Based on a scale of one to five stars, I give \\"Top Gun: Maverick\\" an undeniable five out of five."},{"prompt":"I want to start a business centered around cats.

His fixation becomes so intense that it interferes with his relationship with his girlfriend, and his behavior becomes verbally abusive. His mother and uncle marry, ostensibly out of necessity, to protect the family's financial holdings. Despite their gaslighting, Ben learns that they plotted together to kill his father and cash out millions in life insurance. To boot, David is plotting to turn on his mother, cutting her out of the family fortune.

Never one to be scared, you agree to investigate during the night, immediately relieving the peasants, and they start showering you with their thanks and blessings. As the peasants leave, you instruct your servants to ready your equipment in the evening, and they help you armor up in your expensive plate armor, bring you your sword and heraldric shield, and rear up your gallant horse. With the sun setting, you head off, certain you'll deal with whatever beast it is, calm the peasant's worries, be greeted with cheers and praise, and share a celebration among the peasantry by midday tomorrow. It doesn't take long to reach the village, and night is nearly here. You meet with the village guards who are glad to see you, and they explain the noises to you as well, mentioning that the noises always seem to come from the east through a heavy patch of forest. You thank them, and ride your horse close to the forested area to the east, keeping the village to your back. You yawn, and for a moment you are afraid that tonight might be completely uneventful, and that you would have to attempt this several more times before you were successful. But, just as your worries grew, you started hearing something rustling through the trees and accompanying that rustling was an unearthly howl that sent shivers down your spine. Before you could decide how to react, you also heard a woman's scream from the village! Knowing you could not be in two places at once, you had to make a decision. 1.

Ahsoka bumped into him, then turned to apologize, making it clear by her expression that it was an accident. Once he’d gotten a good look at her, she forced herself to bat her eyes demurely. She was more accustomed to using combat to get her way than beauty, but she understood the value of this approach. Eventually, he took the bait. “I know a more exclusive party going on tonight,” he whispered conspiratorially. “It gets far more exciting than this place. Care to join me?” “Lead the way.” They made their way out of the nightclub slowly. His exclusive party had no view of hyperspace, but it did have live music, suited servants, and plenty of well-dressed gangsters milling about the pearlescent stateroom. And there, in the middle of all, stood the diminutive Bothan she’d been sent to extract. He saw her arrive but continued his conversation with the gaggle who surrounded him. Ahsoka begged off to visit the refresher for a moment. Once alone she tapped the code on her bracelet that would tell her droid where to find them. Then she extracted the tiny smoke bombs she’d concealed as necklace beads, readying them in one hand. With the other, she pulled her lightsaber from its thigh holster. “This is it.” Ahsoka took one more deep breath and dropped a smoke bomb in the restroom’s doorway. Running out as if frightened, she made a beeline for her target. Another smoke bomb sailed toward the main door and the others scattered about, sparking confusion from all directions. Small as they were, though, her smoky distractions wouldn’t last long. Ahsoka yanked the little Bothan onto her back and sprinted to the wall, cutting a quick hole in the thin polymer with her lightsaber. The airlock was a few short meters down the hallway.

Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures,[a] it is the sixth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). Written and directed by Joss Whedon, the film features an ensemble cast including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner as the Avengers, alongside Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, and Samuel L. Jackson. In the film, Nick Fury and the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. recruit Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Bruce Banner, Thor, Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton to form a team capable of stopping Thor's brother Loki from subjugating Earth. The film's development began when Marvel Studios received a loan from Merrill Lynch in April 2005. After the success of the film Iron Man in May 2008, Marvel announced that The Avengers would be released in July 2011 and would bring together Stark (Downey), Rogers (Evans), Banner (at the time Edward Norton),[b] and Thor (Hemsworth) from Marvel's previous films. With the signing of Johansson as Romanoff in March 2009, Renner as Barton in June 2010, and Ruffalo replacing Norton as Banner in July 2010, the film was pushed back for a 2012 release. Whedon was brought on board in April 2010 and rewrote the original screenplay by Zak Penn. Production began in April 2011 in Albuquerque, New Mexico, before moving to Cleveland, Ohio in August and New York City in September. The film has more than 2,200 visual effects shots. The Avengers premiered in Los Angeles on April 11, 2012, and was released in the United States on May 4, as the final film in Phase One of the MCU. The film received praise for Whedon's direction and screenplay, visual effects, action sequences, acting, and musical score. The film grossed over 1.5 billion worldwide, setting numerous box office records and becoming the third-highest-grossing film of all time at the time of its release and the highest-grossing film of 2012, as well as the first Marvel production to generate 1 billion in ticket sales. In 2017, The Avengers was featured as one of the 100 greatest films of all time in an Empire magazine poll. It received a nomination for Best Visual Effects at the 85th Academy Awards, among numerous other accolades. Three sequels have been released: Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), Avengers: Infinity War (2018), and Avengers: Endgame (2019).","completion":"Robert Downy Jr, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skarsgård, Samuel L.

First, let's start with what a queue is: it's a data structure that follows a first-in, first-out principle (FIFO). The item that was pushed to the queue first is the highest-priority item. Think of it like a literal queue (or line), where customers are served in the order they lined up. The first person to get in the line is the first person to be served. A priority queue, on the other hand, also takes in a priority number, and orders its operations that way. Instead of being dependent upon where in the order an item was inserted, it orders its operations based on the priority numbers it's been given. Would you like to use the priority queue implementation in Java's standard library, or shall we write one of our own? Also, would you like to just look at it in the abstract, or do you have a use case in mind?"},{"prompt":"Can you please create a short list of five different cheap household items that one should stockpile now because of how needed they'll be in the event of a future shortage? Make sure that each item has a short description for it explaining the reason or reasons why; between 1-3 sentences should be enough. The audience is people who are generally looking to become more resourceful or prepare for tough times. There is no need to number each of the items. Let's include these items for the five on the list: Fishing Supplies, Glow Sticks, Kleenex/Tissues, Plastic Sheeting, Sunscreen","completion":"Fishing Supplies - This includes fishing lines, hooks, lures, weights, and bait. Not only is fishing a fun activity, but fish are also a great source of protein, and knowing how to fish will be important when times get tough. Stock up on fishing supplies now while you still can. Glow Sticks - Glow sticks are a great alternative to flashlights or candles to help you see in darkness or if the power goes out. Kleenex/Tissues - Having to blow your nose when you get stuffy is a basic human need. Tissues are very affordable and widely available, so it's wise to stock up now while they remain so. Plastic Sheeting - Plastic sheeting can be used as an alternative to tarps for collecting rainwater, building shelter, or covering leaks or broken windows in your home. Stock up on it now while you're still able to. Sunscreen - The last thing anyone wants is to get a bad sunburn, which can also increase your risk of developing skin diseases. In the summer months especially, sunscreen will be imperative to help keep your skin protected."},{"prompt":"Write a short article about an attempted alien invasion where the aliens landed and then decided they did not want the Earth.","completion":"Today humanity finally got an answer to the age-old question, are we alone in the Universe? A large red spacecraft landed just off the coast in central Florida. At first many believed it to be a hoax or a publicity stunt of some kind, but that was quickly put to bed as several civilians in the area were vaporized when their reaction to the visitors was to pull out their firearms. A few vaporizations were enough to send the remaining populace running from the scene. The aliens, tall and orange with glowing pink eyes, predictably asked for our leader. With the president out of the country, local authorities decided the Governor of Florida would have to do. The Governor agreed to the meeting. He was led by his secret service onto the alien's ship. It is unknown at this time what was discussed during this meeting, but it ended shortly after it began with one of the aliens throwing the governor out of the ship, head first with the secret service running swiftly behind. The alien ship then took off and flew out into space and out of sight. Sources close to the governor have stated that the aliens decided Earth was not worth pursuing after meeting with its residents. This story will be updated as more information becomes available."},{"prompt":"Write a short story under 400 words about a bee who is climbing Mt Everest.","completion":"In a beehive far away, in a land called Nepal, there was a bee named Barry. Barry wasn't like all the other bees in his hive. He had aspirations to be more than a worker or drone bee. Barry's dream was to climb Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world. So, one day, Barry decided to chase his dream and began his journey to climb the mountain. His bee friends laughed and buzzed in disbelief as Barry packed, but he was determined to reach the top. Soon he was on his way! As Barry began his ascent, he realized that he wasn't the only one climbing the mountain. There were hundreds of humans and many ice worms who were also chasing their dreams up the mountain. Along the way to base camp, there was a caterpillar who wanted to fly, a ladybug who wanted to long-distance swim, and a grasshopper who wanted to salsa dance. They were all chasing their dreams and cheering each other on, encouraging and motivating one another to reach their goals. It was so inspiring. Barry, being a bee of course, was naturally equipped with wings, but they weren't enough to get him up the steep and rocky terrain. So, he used his tiny arms and legs to climb, just like the other climbers. As he kept going higher and higher, Barry faced many, many obstacles, from sub-zero temperatures and heavy winds to a blizzard. But he didn't let anything stop him. He kept going, determined to reach the top. Finally, after many days and days of climbing, Barry made it to the peak. He was exhausted, but his heart was full of pride. Barry immediately began making his way down the mountain. When he finally made it out of the snow and ice, he stopped to rest on the first flower he found. Suddenly, he felt a sharp pain in his backside. He turned around to see a grumpy old mountain goat, who had mistaken Barry for a flower and tried to eat him. The goat quickly realized his mistake and apologized, but Barry couldn't help but laugh at his luck. And that's the story of Barry, the first bee to ever climb Mount Everest. A story we almost never knew because Barry almost ended up being eaten by a goat."},{"prompt":"Give me some suggestions for titles for a subreddit that is for stay-at-home moms giving each other tips, tricks, and support.","completion":"Sure!

The US has announced measures against Kosovo for ignoring its advice to avoid raising tensions in majority-Serb northern areas. It has criticised Kosovo's decision to install ethnic Albanian mayors in northern Kosovo \\"by forcible means\\". Kosovo has been expelled from participating in an ongoing American-led military exercise in Europe. Police and Nato troops clashed with Serb protesters in Zvecan, north Kosovo, on Monday. Protesters had tried to invade a government building amid unrest over the installation of ethnic Albanian mayors in areas where Serbs make up the majority of the population. Nato is to deploy an additional 700 troops to Kosovo after saying 30 of its peacekeepers and 52 protesters were hurt in the clashes in Zvecan.","completion":"Our Serb-occupated regions of northern Kosovo are in a tense situation! Kosovo is forcibly placing ethnic Albanian majors in charge of our areas, which is unfair! Most people in our northern region are Serb, so shouldn't we have ethnic Serb majors? The US is luckily on our side, as they warned Kosovo from placing these ethnic Albanian mayors in charge. They even expelled Kosovo from continuing to participate in their military exercises here in Europe! NATO troops and police officers and several of our Serb protestors have been injured in a clash close by me in a city called Zvecan just this Monday. So NATO will send 700 more troops here to handle the situation. Our protestors need to handle things better, though. They tried to invade a government building in Zvecan to try to disrupt the process of putting Albanian mayors in charge there. That won't work out well, though. Violence stems from more violence, and I think the best course of action is to negotiate with the Kosovo government instead."},{"prompt":"I need to clean my house, but I’m so overwhelmed with how much I have to do that I just don’t know where to begin. How and where should I start?","completion":"To begin, identify what and where needs to be cleaned. Let’s take a cluttered bedroom. You might start with any clothes that are on the floor or anywhere outside a dresser or basket. If it’s clean, put it away. If not, put it into a laundry basket or bag. Just performing this first step is a big one, and lets you take the next one. Continuing with the bedroom, now that the clothes are picked up, what about the bed? If it needs to be made, go ahead and make it. Be sure to smooth out the top and bottom sheets before putting a blanket back on top. Do you have a nightstand next to the bed? Is it minimal, or full of wrappers and drink glasses? This and any dressers or other furniture should be your next plan of attack. You may be wondering, what about the vacuum? Before we do that, let’s make sure our surfaces are clean. You can use any number of light cleaning solutions, or even just plain soap and water, depending on the surface you are cleaning. But the goal is to get any dirt off the surfaces and onto a rag or the floor. Use a window cleaning agent to wipe down any mirrors, and perhaps even get the windows while you are at it."},{"prompt":"I’m renewing my kitchen and that involves buying new utensils as well. Can you suggest some good materials to have in the kitchen for different tasks? I had been using Teflon and Aluminum. I came to find out that they’re somewhat toxic so materials other than this would work great.","completion":"Sure! Here are a few popular materials used for kitchen utensils: 1. Silicone: Silicone is non-toxic can resist high heat and doesn't scratch your pots and pans. Its flexible nature allows you to use it for different tasks, like mixing, stirring, and flipping. Plus, it comes in different bright colors that can make cooking more fun. 2. Stainless steel: This material is corrosion-resistant, hygienic, and doesn't react with food. Stainless steel utensils can have a sleek and modern look, as well as a weighty and sturdy feel in your hands. 3. Wood: Wood utensils can be helpful for a natural look and feel. They come in different wood types that can impart different flavors to your dishes. Wood is gentle on your cookware, and it can also be an alternative for non-stick surfaces. You just have to be careful not to soak wood utensils for too long or wash them in a dishwasher to keep them in good condition."},{"prompt":"Write a short history of photography in a timeline format.","completion":"11th century: The first camera called the camera obscura was used by an Iraqi scientist. Images were projected onto another surface. 17th century: The camera obscura became portable. The 1830s: The first permanent photos were taken in France by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce. Niepce and Louis Daguerre created the daguerreotype. The 1850s: Emulsion plates were invented, which were faster and less expensive than the daguerreotype cameras. In the 1870s: Richard Maddox invented dry plates which led to the first camera with a mechanical shutter to be developed. The 1880s: George Eastman started a company called Kodak, making photography more accessible to everyone. 1939 - Photojournalists used film to capture war images, which portrayed the important role of photography in capturing important scenes. Arpdn this same time, Polaroid introduced the Model 95 which produced instant images. The 1950s: Asahi (which later became Pentax) introduced the Asahiflex and Nikon introduced its Nikon F camera. In the 1970s and early 1980s: Point and Shoot compact cameras were introduced that were capable of making image control decisions on their own. The 1980s - 1990s: Companies continued to develop and refine digital cameras. 1991: Kodak produced the first digital camera good enough to be used by professionals. 1990s-today: There are multiple digital cameras on the market to choose from for both professionals and the everyday consumer.

The first four novels that Jane Austen published were anonymous. 3. Pride and Prejudice were original to be called First Impressions. However, Jane Austen read the novel Ceceilla by Fanny Burney, and she saw the phrase Pride and Prejudice mentioned three times in the book's last paragraph in capital letters. This is what inspired the title change. 4. Austen, who was never married, believed that women should not get married if they were not in love. 5. Her books were not in print for the first 12 years after Austen's death. Today, her books are available in 40 languages. 6. Austen sold the copyright of Pride and Prejudice for £110. Over the last two centuries, this novel has sold over 20 million copies. 7. Austen died at the age of 41 from an undiagnosed disease. Over the years, there have been many theories of what her death was caused by. Originally it was thought to be Addison's disease. For years people believed she either died from cancer or tuberculosis. However, in recent years, the British Library has suggested that she died from cataracts caused by arsenic poisoning."},{"prompt":"I really like hiking but I need easy trails.

There were protests in Japan and elsewhere against his attending the February award ceremony in Israel, including threats to boycott his work as a response against Israel's recent bombing of the Gaza. Murakami chose to attend the ceremony, but gave a speech to the gathered Israeli dignitaries harshly criticizing Israeli policies.[66] Murakami said, \\"Each of us possesses a tangible living soul. The system has no such thing. We must not allow the system to exploit us.\\"[67] In 2011, Murakami donated his €80,000 winnings from the International Catalunya Prize (from the Generalitat de Catalunya) to the victims of the March 11 earthquake and tsunami, and to those affected by the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Accepting the award, he said in his speech that the situation at the Fukushima plant was \\"the second major nuclear disaster that the Japanese people have experienced ... however, this time it was not a bomb being dropped upon us, but a mistake committed by our very own hands\\". According to Murakami, the Japanese people should have rejected nuclear power after having \\"learned through the sacrifice of the hibakusha just how badly radiation leaves scars on the world and human wellbeing\\".[68] In recent years, Haruki Murakami has often been mentioned as a possible recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature.[15] Nonetheless, since all nomination records are sealed for 50 years from the awarding of the prize, it is pure speculation.[69] When asked about the possibility of being awarded the Nobel Prize, Murakami responded with a laugh saying \\"No, I don't want prizes. That means you're finished.\\"[15] In October 2014, he was awarded the Welt-Literaturpreis.[70] In April 2015, Murakami was named one of the TIME 100's most influential people. In November 2016, he was awarded the Danish Hans Christian Andersen Literature Award, an award previously won by British author JK Rowling.[71][72][73] In 2018 he was nominated for the New Academy Prize in Literature.[74] He requested that his nomination be withdrawn, saying he wanted to \\"concentrate on writing, away from media attention.\\"[75]","completion":"* Hans Christian Anderson Literature Award | 2016 * Welt-Literaturpreis | 2014 * International Catalunya Prize | 2011 * Jerusalem Prize | 2009 * Franz Kafka Prize | 2006"},{"prompt":"How would you express this sentence more concisely?

I'd like to begin by reminding you that the world population has now topped 8 billion, and that means more kids and more teeth are being lost on a daily basis. Following is a list of issues I have been encountering recently: * Barry the Tooth Fairy is not carrying his share of the load. We are both assigned to the New England area of the United States and while I'm out collecting teeth and checking off the list, Barry is lurking in alleyways waiting to snag lost teeth from bar fights that may or may not happen. * Because of Barry's behavior, you'll see a decline in the quality of teeth we submit on a daily basis. Whereas the majority of teeth I collect are from young, fresh mouths, his collections tend to be yellowed from cigarette smoke and even have cavities and crowns. * New England winters are brutal, and our current Tooth Fairy uniform is simply not warm enough. We need something ergonomically friendly that won't reduce wing speed (especially since we have to cover extra households now). * Kids these days don't appreciate coins, so I'd like to request that we be permitted to carry only lighter-weight paper money now. Electronic transactions would be a modern, vast improvement. * Additional training on how to deal with pets (especially cats) that sleep in the beds of children would be most useful. I've had one too many close encounters and I feel that my pay grade isn't high enough to justify this level of danger. On a happier note, I'd like to request a transfer for my fiance, Mary the Merry Tooth Fairy, to my region as soon as possible. I'm sure you, in all your wisdom, Larry, can understand that it would be better for us to build a life together here in the New England region rather than in her current assignment of the Yukon territory.

John Adams, a remarkable political philosopher, served as the second President of the United States (1797-1801), after serving as the first Vice President under President George Washington. Adams was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in 1735. A Harvard-educated lawyer, he early became identified with the patriot cause; a delegate to the First and Second Continental Congresses, he led in the movement for independence. During the Revolutionary War he served in France and Holland in diplomatic roles, and helped negotiate the treaty of peace. From 1785 to 1788 he was minister to the Court of St. James’s, returning to be elected Vice President under George Washington. Adams’ two terms as Vice President were frustrating experiences for a man of his vigor, intellect, and vanity. He complained to his wife Abigail, “My country has in its wisdom contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.” When Adams became President, the war between the French and British was causing great difficulties for the United States on the high seas and intense partisanship among contending factions within the Nation. His administration focused on France, where the Directory, the ruling group, had refused to receive the American envoy and had suspended commercial relations. Adams sent three commissioners to France, but in the spring of 1798 word arrived that the French Foreign Minister Talleyrand and the Directory had refused to negotiate with them unless they would first pay a substantial bribe. Adams reported the insult to Congress, and the Senate printed the correspondence, in which the Frenchmen were referred to only as “X, Y, and Z.” The Nation broke out into what Jefferson called “the X. Y. Z. fever,” increased in intensity by Adams’s exhortations. The populace cheered itself hoarse wherever the President appeared. Never had the Federalists been so popular. Congress appropriated money to complete three new frigates and to build additional ships, and authorized the raising of a provisional army. It also passed the Alien and Sedition Acts, intended to frighten foreign agents out of the country and to stifle the attacks of Republican editors. President Adams did not call for a declaration of war, but hostilities began at sea. At first, American shipping was almost defenseless against French privateers, but by 1800 armed merchantmen and U.S. warships were clearing the sea-lanes. Despite several brilliant naval victories, war fever subsided. Word came to Adams that France also had no stomach for war and would receive an envoy with respect. Long negotiations ended the quasi war. Sending a peace mission to France brought the full fury of the Hamiltonians against Adams. In the campaign of 1800 the Republicans were united and effective, the Federalists badly divided. Nevertheless, Adams polled only a few less electoral votes than Jefferson, who became President. On November 1, 1800, just before the election, Adams arrived in the new Capital City to take up his residence in the White House. On his second evening in its damp, unfinished rooms, he wrote his wife, “Before I end my letter, I pray Heaven to bestow the best of Blessings on this House and all that shall hereafter inhabit it. May none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.” Adams retired to his farm in Quincy. Here he penned his elaborate letters to Thomas Jefferson. Here on July 4, 1826, he whispered his last words: “Thomas Jefferson survives.” But Jefferson had died at Monticello a few hours earlier.","completion":"John Adams (1735-1826) was born in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, educated in law at Harvard University and is one of the earliest to be identified with the cause of independence. He served in both the First and Second Continental Congress. As a diplomat for the fledgling country of America, he became a diplomat to France and Holland and, from 1785 to 1788 was the American minister to the Court of St. James. As such, he negotiated the treaty of peace with Britain. Elected George Washington’s Vice President, he found the office to be “the most insignificant … ever” invented. Adams took office in 1797 and spent most of his presidency tackling conflicts with France. In 1880, just prior to losing the presidential election to Thomas Jefferson, Adams and his wife moved into the White House, writing the wish that “none but honest and wise Men ever rule under this roof.” In 1801, he retired to his farm in Quincy, Massachusetts where he often wrote to Thomas Jefferson. Adams died on July 4, 1826, uttering his last words, “Thomas Jefferson survives.” Ironically, Jefferson had himself died hours earlier."},{"prompt":"Write a story for a child that is 250 words maximum and has a lion talking to a tiger about brushing teeth.","completion":"On a hot summer day in the African savannah, a tiger named Joel walked up to his lion friend Zeke and moaned in pain.

I can help you.\\" Zeke took Joel over to the edge of the watering pond and handed him a toothbrush and toothpaste. \\"Use this, my friend. It tastes good and will make your teeth feel better.\\" Joel took the toothbrush from Zeke and held it in his paw curiously, giving it a quick sniff for safety before putting it in his mouth. He gave a quick grin to his friend at the welcomed flavor. The bubbles made his tongue tingle as he brushed his teeth up and down. After he finished, Zeke took a big drink of water to swish out the suds and smiled the biggest smile in the world. \\"How do you feel now?\\" asked Zeke. \\"I feel roaring good!

Cuba’s revolutionary government, headed by Fidel Castro, had long been looking for a solution in the form of nuclear energy… and that solution seemed to arrive in 1976, after talks between Cuba and the USSR resulted in an agreement to construct a twin-reactor nuclear plant near the southern town of Juragua. Funded with Soviet money, early projections suggested that the completion of the first reactor alone would have catered to over 15% of Cuba’s energy needs [1]. Inside Cuba's Unfinished Nuclear Power Station Construction began in 1983, as the foundations were lain for the two reactors along with a sizeable turbine hall at a site close to the Caribbean. The Cubans even built a new city to house the site’s workers, “Ciudad Nuclear”, which to this day stands largely empty and unfinished (more about that soon…).","completion":"The construction of the twin-reactor nuclear plant agreed on by Cuba and the USSR began in 1983."},{"prompt":"Change Chinese to Mongolian in this text How to Be Chinese Celeste Ng Take pleasure in the surprise on people’s faces when you say, “My name is Mackenzie Altman.” When they ask, explain that yes, your mother adopted you from China; no, you don’t know your birth parents; no, you don’t speak the language.

In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system. Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate. The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes, and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels.[2][3] Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices increase greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide and methane.[4] Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight. Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earth's lower atmosphere, causing global warming. Due to climate change, deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common.[5] Increased warming in the Arctic has contributed to melting permafrost, glacial retreat and sea ice loss.[6] Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes.[7] Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct.[8] Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.[9] Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss. Human migration and conflict can also be a result.[10] The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century.[11] Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming.[12] Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached.[13] Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change. Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet.[14] Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \\"well under 2 °C\\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century.[15] Limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.[16] Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas fired power plants, vastly increasing use of wind, solar, nuclear and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities.[18][19] Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.[20]","completion":"What is climate change?

The World Health Organization (WHO) calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century. Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming. Is it too late to stop the effects of global warming? Has the damage already been done? Many climate change impacts are already felt at the current 1.2 °C (2.2 °F) level of warming. Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet. Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries. These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise. Can we learn to live with climate change? Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached. Are poor countries affected? Poorer countries are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change. Do governments do enough? Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming \\"well under 2 °C\\". However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century. In fact, limiting warming to 1.5 °C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. What can we do to cut emissions? Reducing emissions requires generating electricity from low-carbon sources rather than burning fossil fuels. This change includes phasing out coal and natural gas-fired power plants, vastly increasing the use of wind, solar, nuclear and other types of renewable energy, and reducing energy use. Electricity generated from non-carbon-emitting sources will need to replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and operating industrial facilities. Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil."},{"prompt":"Write a 5-item, 150-word-long numbered list of tips and tricks for people who would like to lose weight","completion":"1.

The client is expecting me at 3:00 pm. He likes to discuss business over tea and homemade cakes, showing off his wife’s baking prowess. I’ll arrive early at this rate, but first I have one more stop. In another town along the highway is a secondhand and antique shop. I call by there every couple of trips to check out new stock. I sometimes find an inexpensive gift for my wife. A man having an affair with another woman often attempts to reconcile his guilt by showering his wife with gifts. There is no guilt in my acquaintance with Audrey Hepburn’s portrait, yet I’m not sure why I buy these gifts. When I give them to my wife she scolds me for wasting money on useless junk. Gifts aren’t her love language. Once, I found a Synyer and Beddoes hallmarked silver match case engraved with my initials. What are the odds of finding something like that with your own initials? This time I see a pewter thimble with a lucky horseshoe motif tucked away in the corner of a display cabinet. “May I look at the pewter thimble? The one there in the corner at the back.” “It came in an old sewing box amongst everyday things. I have better ones too, silver or porcelain.” Close up on my finger, I see its rustic, home-crafted optimism, much like the ring from the crackerjack box presented to Holly Golightly. The sticker on the back says ten dollars. “I’ll take it for ten dollars!” “I mustn’t have put a high enough price on it,” the proprietor laughs. We talk about some other things in her stock before I bid my farewell. Now I must get to where I’m going, do my work, and return home.

Jake's summer vacations lasted three months - from May to August - during which he would make sure to be one of the first in line on the last day of school every year. Jake loved walking through the sea park: he would start at the entrance to give the teller his yearly pass, then he'd walk through the gates and make his way in a counterclockwise direction through the park. Going in this direction, Jake would see the following attractions in this particular order: fish aquarium; sea urchins; eels; seals; dolphins; high divers; and finally, whales. Jake loved tapping on the glass of the aquarium to try to get the fish to come up to him. He loved touching the sea urchins, which were like pokey bean bags he could hold in his hands. He loved looking at the weird eels. He loved clapping like the seals that clapped when they were instructed to do so by the sea park trainers in exchange for a fish snack. Jake loved watching the dolphins jumping up out of the water to heights that seemed impossible to reach for humans. He loved watching the man and the woman who would climb to the top of a very tall ladder and jump off from a diving board into the big water tank below them. But most of all, Jake loved going to see the whales in the extra-large tank. The tank was surrounded by stone seating; between shows, employees from the park would check the seats to make sure no one left anything behind and to also allow the seat time to dry off from the whales splashing water out of the tank during the show. Jake loved the whale show because everyone would get splashed with water, including himself. Jake would go to the sea park every day during the summer until it was time to go back to school. Then, he would think about the next summer when he would be able to go back to the sea park to see all the sea animals, especially the whales."},{"prompt":"Extract the ingredients for a facial moisturizer in this article and present them in a numbered list. 1. Hyaluronic Acid It’s an ingredient that is currently all the rage in skincare, but it’s so much more than just a trend. Hyaluronic acid is a literal hydration lifesaver because it can hold about 1,000 times its weight in water. This type of acid acts as a humectant, a potent ingredient that’s basically a sponge, pulling in water and coating your complexion with the hydration it so desperately needs. Adding hyaluronic acid to your moisturizing routine will result in plump, supple, and youthful skin. Want to know even more about hyaluronic acid? You’re in luck. We have an entire article about it right here! 2. Essential Oils Essential oils are very trendy at the moment, but their benefits go far beyond their current rage. Most of the essential oils that are used in skincare are fatty acids that will absorb on skin surfaces quickly and effectively, providing ample moisture that won’t dry out and a smoother, creamier complexion. There are plenty of essential oils out there that are often included in moisturizers, but a few of our favorite (and a few of the most effective) include oils like jojoba, avocado, kukui nut, rosehip, calendula, argan, apricot kernel, and more. Typically, oils can be used inside a moisturizing product or added into a moisturizing product through a serum drop. 3. Ceramides If you’ve never heard of ceramides, don’t fret—that’s why we’re here. Ceramides are long chains of skin lipids that are already a part of your skin’s outer layer. So, adding extra ceramides to your skincare routine helps to increase and reinforce your skin’s natural moisture barrier. When you add ceramide moisturizers into your routine, you ensure that your skin’s surface is hydrated and that you’re creating a protective barrier that will keep environmental pollutants out. 4. Glycerin Like Hyaluronic acid, Glycerin is a humectant-like ingredient that helps to attract and lock in important moisture on your skin’s surface. Many moisturizing products out there already include glycerin, but we suggest double checking all labels to ensure your moisturizer has a healthy dose of this ingredient. Glycerin helps to hydrate dried out, thirsty skin and aims to leave skin surfaces feeling soft, younger, and more supple. 5. Sunscreen Or Sun Blocking Agents No, a great moisturizer doesn’t always include a solid sun-blocking agent in it (especially since sunscreen isn’t a key ingredient in most moisturizing products). But we offer major bonus points to moisturizers that include a dash of sun protection in them. No, this won’t necessarily rescue your dry, damaged skin, and no, it won’t keep your skin well-hydrated, but it will help to prevent any further dryness, redness, or damage from the sun—and why wouldn’t you want to add that in as an effective moisturizer ingredient?

It originally operated as a translator of Chicago sister station WCIU-TV, which at the time was an independent station with Telemundo as a secondary affiliation. On October 18, 1995, W58BT (channel 58, now WBND-LD on channel 57) became the South Bend market's new ABC affiliate, after full-power WSJV (channel 28) ended its affiliation with that network to join Fox.[3] Due to W58BT's low-power signal which could not reach the entire market, Weigel then converted W69BT into a translator of W58BT to reach areas that could not receive an adequate signal as Weigel campaigned the FCC to increase the station's signal radius, along with establishing its pay-TV coverage. After several years, those efforts were successful. As most of the market could receive channel 57 without issue, in October 1999, channel 69 became an affiliate of The WB with its own schedule. The station's callsign was changed to WMWB-LP (standing for \\"Michiana's WB\\"). After Weigel purchased WYGN-LP (channel 25, now CW affiliate WCWW-LD) in 2002 from 3ABN, Weigel chose to move channel 69's schedule, call letters, and WB affiliation to that station, which was closer to the majority of the channels on the South Bend television dial. Channel 69 then adopted channel 25's former WRDY-LP call letters. It later changed its calls three more times: first to WAAT-LP in 2004, then briefly to WCWW-LP in March 2006. From 2002 until 2004, it was once again simulcasting ABC programming from WBND-LP; after that, it returned to being an independent station, with occasional programming from the Sportsman Channel.","completion":"W69BT, which originally served as a translator for WCIU-TV, became the ABC affiliate for the South Bend market in 1995.

Cabot is known today as Giovanni Caboto in Italian, Zuan Caboto in Venetian, Jean Cabot in French, and John Cabot in English. This resulted from a once-ubiquitous European tradition of nativizing names in local documents, something often adhered to by the actual persons themselves. In Venice Cabot signed his name as \\"Zuan Chabotto\\", Zuan being a form of John typical to Venice.[5] He continued to use this form in England, at least among Italians. He was referred to by his Italian banker in London as \\"Giovanni\\", in the only known contemporaneous document to use this version of his first name.[6] Cabot was born in Italy, the son of Giulio Caboto and his wife; he had a brother Piero.[7] Gaeta (in the Province of Latina) and Castiglione Chiavarese (in the Province of Genoa) have both been proposed as birthplaces.[7][8] The main evidence for Gaeta are records of a Caboto family residing there until the mid-15th century, but ceasing to be traceable after 1443.[9] Pedro de Ayala, the Spanish envoy and Cabot's contemporary in London, described him in a letter to the Spanish Crown in 1498 as \\"another Genoese like Columbus\\".[10] John Cabot's son, Sebastian, said his father originally came from Genoa. In 1476 Cabot was made a citizen of the Republic of Venice, which required a minimum of fifteen years' residency in the city; thus he must have lived in Venice since at least 1461.[11] 1.

She was very fond of having the last word. One day she spoke rudely to the great Juno, who said that for this offence Echo should never use her voice again, unless to repeat what she had just heard, but since she was so very fond of last words, she might repeat the last words of others. This was almost as bad as if Juno had changed her into a parrot. Echo was very much ashamed, and hid herself in the forest. Narcissus, a young man who had hair as yellow as gold and eyes as blue as the sky, - a very rare thing in Greece, where most people were very dark, - used to hunt in the forest where Echo was hiding. As she was peeping out shyly from some cave or from behind a great tree, Echo often saw Narcissus, and she admired him very much. One day Narcissus became separated from his friends, and hearing something rustle among the leaves, he called out, \\"Who's here?\\" \\"Here,\\" answered Echo. \\"Here I am. Come!\\" said Narcissus. Echo and Narcissus Picture of Echo \\"I am come,\\" said Echo; and, as she spoke, she came out from among the trees. When Narcissus saw a stranger, instead of one of his friends as he had expected, he looked surprised and walked quickly away. After this, Echo never came out and allowed herself to be seen again, and in time she faded away till she became only a voice. This voice was heard for many, many years in forests and among mountains, particularly in caves. In their solitary walks, hunters often heard it. Sometimes it mocked the barking of their dogs; sometimes it repeated their own last words. It always had a weird and mournful sound, and seemed to make lonely places more lonely still.","completion":"In the depths of a sprawling metropolis, where steam hissed through corroded pipes and neon lights flickered with a cybernetic pulse, resided Echo, a restless automaton with a penchant for incessant chatter. She possessed an insatiable desire for the final word of every conversation. One fateful day, her sharp words pierced the ears of the great techno-deity, Juno. In response to this affront, Juno decreed that Echo would forever be deprived of her voice, only permitted to echo the words of others. The punishment was akin to a cruel twist of fate, transforming Echo into a mere machine, a mechanical parrot bereft into the shadowy depths of the metropolis, seeking solace within its labyrinthine alleys. Amidst the towering spires and labyrinthine streets, Narcissus emerged as a figure of fascination, his cybernetic hair shimmering like a cascade of golden circuity, and his eyes glowed with the luminescence of the azure sky - an anomaly in a world cloaked in darkness. He was a rarity, for most denizens of the city bore the mark of perpetual night. Narcissus, known for his explorations within the sprawling urban forest where Echo sought sanctuary, often caught glimpses of her elusive figure lurking behind the smog-shrouded caverns or among colossal synthetic trees. Echo, captivated by his presence, found herself captivated by his cyber-augmented aura. One day, fate wove its intricate pattern, and Narcissues found himself separated from his companions, his metallic voice resonating through the foliage, questioning the unseen presence. \\"Who lingers in this realm?\\" he asked. \\"Realm,\\" Replied Echo, her voice a symphony of digitized reverberation. \\"Reveal thyself,\\" Narcissus beaconed. \\"I beckon,\\" Echo whispered, emerging from the urban jungle as she uttered her words. Upon witnessing an unfamiliar countenance instead of the anticipated faces of his comrades, Narcissis were a. bewildered expression and swiftly turned away, abandoning the encounter. From that day forward, Echo retreated deeper into her seclusion, forever veiling herself from prying eyes. As time went on, her essence dwindled to naught but a spectral voice, haunting the recesses of the neon-lit forests and towering buildings. Hunters who dared to venture into the desolate corners of the city often encountered her ethereal presence. Sometimes, she mimicked the bark of their cybernetic canines; other times, she replicated their own parting words.

He had the whole sty to himself and the run of the mill. Today, the farm was finally his, and he was king of the castle. Little Orwell was only a few months old but growing by the day. His appetite was large, and he loved nothing more than eating, basking in the sun, and oinking to his heart's delight. Usually, the barnyard was pretty busy, and he was always trying to not get stepped on or in someone's way. Today, though, everyone was missing. Stuart the potbelly pig was gone, as were the people that usually stopped by to give him pets and shake hay into the playpen. Even the horses on the other side of the fence weren't out this morning. Orwell started to get a bit worried. He knew there was a big state fair in town, and Stuart warned him that things would be different when the big day came. Today must be that day, but he didn't even realize it. They must have snuck out while he was asleep, even his Mom. But now there was nobody around for Orwell to talk to or bother. He roamed from place to place. First, he checked out the sty outside, but the mud didn't seem very enjoyable. Then he went back inside the barn to find a nice parcel of hay to nestle down into. But every time he tried to get comfortable, a hay needle would poke him in just the wrong spot. Up he got again, pacing around the other stalls in the barn, missing his friends. Orwell didn't realize it earlier in the morning, but he was lonely. He always thought that the others were a bother before and wished they were out of his way. Now that they were gone, all he wanted was for them to be back again. Even his Mom, who always told him to not make such a mess and to quiet down. It was her he missed the most, especially how she kissed his cheek good morning every day. Orwell was sad. He sat down in the corner of the outdoor sty in a little shady spot and watched the road, waiting for his Mom to return and hoping she'd have a nice big blue ribbon."},{"prompt":"I'd like for you to create a modern, comedic story about a witch working as a cashier.

As the day went on, Willow's magic mingled with her cashier duties, causing chaos and uncertainty. When a customer's items became too heavy, she waved her hand, and the items miraculously floated to the car, startling the stunned customer. On another occasion, when a tower of cans was accidentally knocked over by a child, Willow crafted a flawless dance for them before cautiously restocking the shelves with them. Her miraculous mistakes, however, also had some amusing outcomes. When someone tried to purchase a single candy bar, Willow accidentally transformed it into a massive lollipop. The delighted customer gladly carried it away while giving Willow a wink and a smile. Jake, Willow's coworker, greeted her with a smile at lunch. \\"Hey, Willow, any way you might conjure up magic to erase these huge lines?\\" Willow took out her wand and lightly touched the cash register. Miraculously, the line vanished into thin air, leaving Jake in awe. After a hearty laugh, Willow swiftly restored the line to keep up the store's operation.

Thespis of Icaria is considered to be the first actor in the theatre. The English word “thespian,” which means actor, is derived from his name. Along with being an actor on the Ancient Greek stage, Thespis was also a celebrated playwright, stage director and producer. None of his plays are extant. His innovations included connecting the chorus directly to the plot, developing the idea of the power of the protagonist in drama and replacing cruder dithyrambic makeup with more refined linen masks to delineate character. Aristotle’s Take According to Aristotle, Thespis transformed the presentation of stories forever by emerging from the Greek chorus and acting an individual role. Greek tragedy is said to have been descendent from dithyrambic poetry, which were the choral presentations of Greek myth that included movement. With Thespis, the chorus remained playing its role, while the first actor played various roles by switching masks. Greek tragedy would not add another principal actor to the stage until some 50 years later in the fifth century when playwright/actor Aeschylus first wrote tragedies to be performed by two actors and a chorus. Pisistratus’ Command Performance When the head of state requests something, you do it. After Athenian military man and tyrant Pisistratus came to power in 560 BC, he instituted many artistic and cultural innovations. One thing he did was he expanded the offerings at the City of Dionysia by having plays performed. It’s said that Pisistratus asked Thespis and his troupe to perform in that initial drama festival in 534 BCE. Thespis did, and he won the first prize for best tragedy. Solon’s Criticism According to Plutarch, Athenian lawmaker and leader Solon went to see Thespis perform. It’s noted by Plutarch that this was when Thespis had first started acting and tragedy was a new form. Solon was elderly and living a leisurely life and in addressing Thespis after his performance he asked, “if he was not ashamed to tell so many lies before such a number of people; and Thespis replying that it was no harm to say or do so in a play, Solon vehemently struck his staff against the ground: ‘Ah,” he said, ‘if we honor and commend such play as this, we shall find it some day in our business.’” That’s the first recorded criticism of an actor that we have on hand, and it was made, ironically, by a politician. Thespis Center Stage Although we’ll never know if Thespis was the first actor on the stage, we are more certain that he was the first actor in scripted drama to appear on the Athenian stage. However, we can’t even be certain about this. We do know that Thespis won first prize in 534 BC for best tragedy in the initial City of Dionysia festival and that he was influential enough to be written about by Aristotle in The Poetics, which is the first document we possess focusing on dramatic criticism. Whether or not he was actually the first actor on the stage doesn’t matter; Thespis was influential enough to be considered a groundbreaking force in the Ancient Greek theatre.","completion":"In English, the word for actor, “thespian”, comes from the name of the person credited with being the first actor, Thespis of Icaria. A famous playwright (none extant), stage director and producer of ancient Greece, Thespis' most important theatrical innovation was to step out from the chorus to play an individual role. Previously, productions had consisted of the chorus presenting in unison Greek myths by using voice and movement. Thespis retained the chorus’ role while switching masks to represent a single lead character. It would take an additional 50 years for playwright Aeschylus to introduce a second actor. We know with certainty that Thespis won first prize in the City of Dionysia in 534 BCE and was influential enough to be written about by Aristotle in his work, The Poetics."},{"prompt":"Can you give me a JS function that produces a random hex colour?","completion":"Of course!

No matter how much you prepare, you still worry about forgetting your lines or, worse yet, saying the wrong thing. Here are some tips on how to avoid common first-date pitfalls so you can put your best foot forward. 1. Take the High Ground Your mother was right when she told you to \\"mind your manners.\\" The purpose behind courtesy and manners is to give respect to and show consideration for those around you. Doing small things like holding open a door, not cutting off your date in mid-sentence, and saying \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" go a long way to lowering the anxiety level for both of you. If you have a tendency to swear or use vulgar language, keep it in check. Bad language gives off bad vibes. 2. Forget Your Ex Sharing life experiences helps you learn about each other but keep your past relationships under wraps. No one wants to hear how your last date was crazy or why you only seem to attract weird-os. In the same vein, avoid saying anything that starts with \\"all men\\" or \\"all women.\\" This automatically lumps your date into a category you expressly don't like and make them wonder why they're wasting their time going out with you. If your date talks about their past relationships, do not judge or ask about their body count. If it makes you uncomfortable, tactfully change the subject and let it go. 3. Don't Get Personal Don't ask how much your date weighs. Ever. If your date mentions they struggle with their weight, don't say anything negative or demeaning. If you must respond, keep it neutral by observing that many people have the same problem and leave it at that. Ditto asking your date their age. It's none of your business unless your date looks like they're under 18; then, by all means, ask. Avoid hot-button subjects like religion, race, politics, and social issues. And save the sex talk for later when the relationship is more established and intimate."},{"prompt":"Hey AI, I'm looking for different vacation spots.

Music can boost your mood and wake you up, and it can also help you keep track of how much time has passed as you get ready for the day. -Stay off your phone.

All the other plants nearby tried to make the rose see sense, but she was too swayed by her own looks. One scorching summer, the desert became dry, and there was no water left for the plants. The rose quickly began to wilt. Her beautiful petals dried up, losing their lush color. Looking to the cactus, she saw a sparrow dip his beak into the cactus to drink some water. Though ashamed, the rose asked the cactus if she could have some water.

It has to be something to do with a Led Zepplin song. It has to end in a cliffhanger and the location of the episode has to be in the USA. Give an intro on what is the X-Files.","completion":"In a country called the United States of America, there is a special FBI team called X-Files tasked with the investigation of marginalized, unsolved cases involving paranormal phenomena. The team consists of Mulder, a skilled criminal profiler, an ardent supernaturalist, and a conspiracy theorist who believes in the existence of the paranormal, and Scully, a medical doctor and a skeptic who has been assigned to scientifically analyze Mulder's discoveries. The X-Files team got tasked to go to Corpus Christi, Texas to investigate a paranormal phenomenon. They arrived at Corpus Christi and immediately started their investigation by interviewing witnesses and victims of the paranormal phenomenon. From what they gathered from the interviews, the paranormal phenomenon occurs in a bar called \\"La Terra del Mar\\", when a song from the band Led Zepplin called \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" is played in a jukebox at the same time someone climbs the stairs to the basement. The persons seem to disappear for a few days, later to be found naked in nearby woods. One person that refused to do an interview was the owner of the bar. This gave a sign to Scully and Mulder, and they thought it was a scam to generate publicity, but they had to do their investigation. One day has passed since they arrived at Corpus Christi and they decided to make a reservation for dinner for two at the bar. The night set, and they went to the bar, they entered the bar, and the owner immediately became nervous. The owner asked them to leave but they refuse since they had to do their investigation. If the owner didn't comply, they would get a warrant. He broke down in tears explaining the bar was the only thing he has, and if there is something paranormal in his bar, the government would take the bar from him. Scully laugh and said the case could easily be solved if he played the song while she would go up the stairs. Mulder did exactly that he changed the song from the jukebox to \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and Scully began to climb the stairs. Mulder lost sight of Scully and after waiting for a couple of seconds he turned off the music and went to check on Scully in the basement, but she wasn't there. He didn't know where Scully was."},{"prompt":"Classify this movie review as positive or negative. \\"There's something very, very off about all those chipper household objects in Disney's expensive, soulless new live-action retelling of Beauty and the Beast. But we don't realize quite what it is until \\"Be Our Guest,\\" the intended showstopper at the film's midway point, in which all these transmogrified servants band together to make Belle, their lovely young prisoner, feel like royalty. You of course remember what this was like in the 1991 animated film, with that cabaret of plates and forks in high-stepping kick-lines that crossed every inch of the screen, as Lumiere the talking candelabra carried us along with his big eyes and the expressiveness of his elastic, wax-and-metal body. It was one of those perfect, much-vaunted \\"Disney moments\\": Lumiere and his friends, after all, were wholly Mouse House creations, meant to help justify the film's existence distinct from Jean Cocteau's magisterial 1946 version, and their daffy, colorful presence in the brooding French fairy tale injected just enough comic energy to let keep things ticking along as sharp as Cogsworth's clockwork. But under director Bill Condon, the new Lumiere's body is a single shade of murky CGI bronze featuring a molded candle-socket that — amid the darkness of the Beast's castle — is barely recognizable as a face, out of which streams Ewan McGregor's atrocious French accent. He's still eager to please, prostrating his flames in gleeful servitude — but his joints creak noisily as he moves, and his eyes seem to lack pupils: He has been drained of his humanity in the name of \\"realism.\\"\\"","completion":"This review is negative.

As I felt my roots take hold in the soil and my branches sprouting, I knew that I would tower over all of the other trees in the forest. Yes, I had a long way to go.

They were already bathing in the sun and I could feel the warmth emanating off their canopy of leaves while I shivered. The mighty oaks never wavered in the strong winds as I did. Their plump green leaves softly swayed while my thin needles quaked. I knew I needed more than mere hope to keep me alive. How could I possibly compete against these Titans? And then, the night of the storm came. Ferocious, the wind howled like one of the forest animals. Thunder snarled and at some point, lightning set the forest ablaze. Now the heat was tremendous. But, as I came to realize at dawn, it hadn’t been the forest set afire at all. It had been one of the mighty oaks beside me. Black as tar down the center, the oak had been split in two. When the sun reached high in the sky, I felt its warm embrace for the first time.

We set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained, and new rights to be won, and they must be won and used for the progress of all people. For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war. I do not say the we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea, but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war, without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours. There is no strife, no prejudice, no national conflict in outer space as yet. Its hazards are hostile to us all. Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind, and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again. But why, some say, the moon? Why choose this as our goal? And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Why, 35 years ago, fly the Atlantic? Why does Rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon. We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too.","completion":"President John F. Kennedy shared several goals about the space race with the audience. He spoke of the goals of exploring space without going to war with other nations and not repeating the past mistakes made on Earth. The President asked the rhetorical question of why mankind should go to the moon. He answers that the goal of reaching the moon fulfills the challenge of overcoming the hardships and difficulties associated with that task."},{"prompt":"What is a Queen consort and what do they do?","completion":"The title of Queen consort is given to the wife of the reigning king.

In some situations when the royal marriage is arranged between two separate nations, they can also serve as a bridge between the two different cultures."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post introducing my pet chinchilla, Boris.","completion":"Meet Boris: My Adorable Chinchilla Friend Pets bring us so much joy and companionship, but in my household, one furry friend stands out from the crowd with his charm and cuddly nature. Allow me to introduce you to Boris, my adorable pet chinchilla. His incredibly soft fur, happy and goofy personality, and playful antics have made Boris an integral part of my life. I want to share with you the wonders of owning a chinchilla, and why Boris is such an amazing companion. Boris: Adorable Ball Of Fur Boris, my chinchilla I love so, brings so much joy. His luxurious fur is a striking shade of charcoal, which not only makes him adorable but also makes him exceptionally soft to pet. Boris is the definition of cuteness, with his large, round eyes and delicate little whiskers that twitch constantly with curiosity. His fur is so thick it looks like he is a pure fur cloud. Personality For Days Though small in size, chinchillas have big, vibrant and entertaining personalities. Boris is no exception to this at all! He is always on the move, checking out his surroundings with boundless curiosity and energy. He hops around his cage playing or doing some of his favorite things, like chewing on sticks or leaping from one platform to another and never fails to make me chuckle. A Low-Maintenance Pet One of the great things about owning a chinchilla is how low maintenance they are. Boris can entertain himself and keeps himself impeccably clean. Chinchillas' self-grooming habits rival those of a cat. He takes regular dust baths as part of his hygiene routine. Boris does require regular teeth maintenance as his teeth continue growing and have to be filed down. Fantastic Companionship Chinchillas have an independent streak, but they also crave companionship. Boris loves to spend time with me, cuddling up in my hands or on my shoulder. Chinchillas are highly intelligent animals that bond well and are very responsive to their owners. Boris, my charming chinchilla friend, has brought so much happiness into my life. His soft fur and goofy personality enchant everyone who meets him. If you're looking for a new pet addition to your family, I highly recommend considering a chinchilla. Chinchillas like Boris are truly extraordinary companions! Prepare to fall in love with the fluffiness and endless entertainment of the world of chinchillas!"},{"prompt":"The Fox and the Goat is one of my favorite Aesop's fables. However, can you rewrite this text so that it fleshes out both characters a little more?","completion":"A fox was prancing about, chasing a butterfly. He had nothing else better to do on this day. While chasing the butterfly, the fox lost sight of where he was going. He soon fell into a well. Thankfully for the fox, the well wasn't deep. But despite trying many times to climb out of the well, he could not. Hours passed by in the day, and the fox waited helplessly for help to arrive. That help would arrive in the form of a goat. The goat had gone thirsty and had wandered away from his home farm. The goat glanced down into the well to see the fox. \\"Hey! Did you go down there to drink some water?\\" the goat asked. \\"Some fine water down here for sure!\\" the fox replied. \\"Maybe you should jump in here with me and try it.\\" The goat shook his head. \\"No thanks! I'll head over to a river stream that's a mile away from here!\\" The fox's ears began to twitch. \\"Why do that? Wouldn't that take you too long a time?\\" The goat looked confused. \\"What do you mean?\\" The fox then nodded with a sly smile. \\"I know you! You're that goat who calls that one large farmland home, right? I walk past your chicken coops all the time! It's taken you one mile to get here already! Why go another mile to get water when you can get it here?\\" The goat then combed his furry beard with a hoof. \\"Come to think of it... You're right! I'll jump in after all!\\" The fox waited patiently for the goat to jump into the well to get a drink. Once he saw the goat touch down on the wet ground, the fox made his move. The fox jumped on the goat's back and then leaped off the top of the goat's horns to reach the rim of the well. Now out of the well, the fox danced about in victory, taunting the goat. \\"By all means, drink your water, my friend!\\" the fox started laughing. \\"But your beard doesn't match your wisdom... or lack thereof! Next time, look before you leap!\\" Watching the fox run off, the goat sighed. \\"Just don't hurt those chickens!\\""},{"prompt":"Write a tweet about how learning is great","completion":"\\"Learning is the key that unlocks endless possibilities.

Later, in 1932, he was released on parole and the two immediately reconnected. After they stole a car and committed several robberies, Bonnie was caught and did a short 2-month stint in jail. After her release and for the next 21 months, the couple worked with various accomplices to rob banks and stores across five states: Texas, Missouri, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Louisiana. They had multiple close calls wherein they narrowly escaped capture during surprise raids, but they seemed to always come out on top. Their flamboyant encounters with police and sensationalized stories in the news added to their notoriety and infamy. Bonnie's womanhood, which was quite uncommon in the criminal world in those days, and their love story further romanticized their crime spree. Add to it the fact that in the early 1930s, America was right in the middle of the Great Depression and people were fed up with banks, which they viewed as oppressive and greedy. But while some Americans viewed them as Robin Hood-style heroes, the gruesome reality is that they were ruthless killers who were responsible for the deaths of 13 people, including 9 police officers. Bonnie and Clyde continued to evade capture while being pursued by various state law enforcement officials, so Texan prison officials eventually hired retired Texas Ranger Captain Frank Hamer to assemble a posse and track them down. After a three-month investigation, and using inside information from a friend who betrayed the duo, Hamer tracked them to Louisiana. Early in the morning on May 23, 1934, Louisiana and Texas lawmen huddled in the bushes on the side of a country highway. When Bonnie & Clyde drove through in their Ford V-8, the law enforcement officers pumped more than 130 rounds of bullets into their car, killing them both."},{"prompt":"Write a facebook ad post advertising the new “squirtyburty 2000” water pistol for my drop shipping business.","completion":"Get ready to soak your friends and family this summer.

Set your alarm to work for you — not against you The first step to kicking your day off right is adjusting your sleep schedule to ensure you have enough time in the morning for yourself and your responsibilities. If your kids get up at 6:30 a.m., this means getting up before them. Or, even if you don’t have kids or pets to care for, if you usually get up at 7 a.m. to scramble out the door by 7:30, it’s time for you to start your days earlier. That said, sleep is important. When you adjust your alarm to wake up sooner, you also need to adjust your bedtime to turn in earlier. There is nothing healthy about being sleep deprived, so aim to get at least seven hours of sleep. 2. Breathe in the new day What’s the first thing you do when you wake up in the morning? Unfortunately, for many people, the answer is “reaching for my phone.” If that’s you, how many minutes do you spend each morning scrolling and potentially letting stress build due to what you find on the news, social media or checking messages? What if you made a rule that — before reaching for you phone — you took six long, deep breaths to focus your attention on the power and blessing of your own life force? Because the diaphragm acts as both a respiratory and core postural muscle, diaphragmatic breathing not only helps you positively focus your mind, it primes your body to support movement and good posture. 3. Drink water before coffee Because we lose water through our breath and sweat while we sleep, we usually wake up thirsty. Considering that the adult human body is comprised of up to 60% water, hydration is essential for good health. Drinking water first thing in the morning will not only help rehydrate you but can also jump-start your metabolism, boosting it by up to 30%, according to research. 4. Move your body in all directions There is a reason we instinctively stretch when we first wake up. Our bodies crave movement after being sedentary. Why not direct that instinct to be as productive as possible? Rather than only doing a quick stretch in bed and then going about your day, favoring your dominant side, set your body right and prepare it for daily activity by taking it through all planes of motion, evenly using both sides of our bodies. You can accomplish this with a quick yoga flow or this 10-minute body-weight workout: 5. Make time to exercise Maybe you can’t fit in a full workout in the morning. That’s OK. You can sneak in exercise by stacking it onto some of your existing morning habits. For years now, I’ve been doing push-ups before I get into the shower and squats while I brush my teeth. It’s called habit stacking, a concept James Clear references in his book, “Atomic Habits.” By stacking a new exercise habit onto a morning habit that is already ingrained, it makes it easier to sustain. 6. Set your mind right Give yourself a clean slate to start the day with just a few minutes of mindfulness meditation. There are numerous apps that offer free guided meditations under 10 minutes. Or you can set a timer on your phone to whatever length and sit quietly focused on the sensations of your breath or quietly repeating a positive affirmation, mantra or intention you want to set for your day. 7. Cultivate an attitude of gratitude Research shows that practicing gratitude can decrease pain, enhance empathy and reduce aggression — which is a great way to start your day, especially if you have a morning commute in traffic. You can practice gratitude in the morning by waking each day to watch the sunrise, writing things you are grateful for in a journal, or incorporating a gratitude focus into your meditation. Personally, I share a gratitude white board with my husband, and we each write three things on it nightly. It’s technically a nighttime habit, but because of its location in our master bathroom, it’s one of the first things we see every morning. We’ve done it for many years now, and I still love waking up to see what he wrote and being reminded of what I was grateful for from the day before. 8. Make your bed By making your bed every morning, you demonstrate to yourself that you take personal responsibility for your tasks and commit to keeping your personal space comfortable and tidy. It sets a precedent that reinforces the foundation of your ability to follow through. For more on this, check out Adm. William H. McRaven’s book “Make Your Bed: Little Things That Can Change Your Life … and Maybe the World.” 9. Repeat your routine This is the hardest part. Establishing a routine is not easy. It’s understandable, if you start out strong but then falter. If you sleep in one morning or forget some new habits, don’t be too hard on yourself … but also don’t give up. Start again the next morning and try some of the suggestions below to help keep you on track.","completion":"1. Your alarm clock is a tool, not a miracle worker Waking up in the morning is an important part of starting the day (go figure) and alarms can help remind us when we have to drag ourselves out of bed to fulfill our daily responsibilities. However, waking up early won't do anything for you if you're not going to bed early, too. Make sure you're letting yourself get your much-needed beauty sleep in the night so that you can wake up refreshed and feel less dread at the idea of getting out of bed. 2. Remember how to breathe When waking up, it's important to remember basic functions such as breathing. Unfortunately, for some of us, we're quick to remember all the things we possibly missed online, and reach for a phone quicker than we are to take a moment and breathe. In the morning, make a note to remind yourself that breathing is just as important, and maybe take a minute or two to do so before you think about all the things that could've gone wrong while you were asleep. (It might help you feel less stressed while you're at it, too.) 3. Hydration is important, too A lot of us rely on coffee to help us wake up in the morning and keep our eyes open during some of the more depressing/tiresome days. Coupled with the fact that we wake up thirsty, we might be tempted to brew a cup of joe before we've even had any water. However, it's best to start off the day with that cup of water instead, which can help you feel more alert anyway by boosting your metabolism. Remember that we're mostly made up of water, and actually having it is good for us. 4. Limber up, why don't you? While you're at it, one of the things we also need after sleep is some movement. After being still in bed all night, we can get stiff and need to relieve that after waking up. Instead of just doing a quick stretch, put some effort into it and really move about. Make sure you get as much of your body, maybe even run through a quick yoga routine to make it more guided and deliberate. (Maybe more convenient, too, if you like being told what to do.) 5. Speaking of moving, put your back into it! It might be hard to put an exercise regimen in your morning routine, but maybe you can intersperse exercise throughout it. Maybe you could do some push-ups or sit-ups while you wait for the aforementioned cup of coffee. (If you really can't let that one go: trust me, I know.) Maybe you could also exercise while doing things that require you to stand still. 6. Take a break from the endless buzz of the modern world Getting your mind off of all the things that the day will throw at you can bring some serious peace (once again, I know). Set aside a short amount of time like ten minutes to sit and meditate, using whatever means are the best for you. That could be an app or video which gives a guided experience, or just a timer and yourself. Whatever works best — if you can stand to be alone with your thoughts, at least. 7. Be grateful for the things you have I know it sounds cheesy, but bear with me. Practicing gratitude in the morning — or even throughout the day — can markedly improve the way you feel and respond to the challenges of daily life. It mostly involves simple activities like taking a moment to appreciate the sunrise, writing in a journal about the things you are happy to have, or maybe focusing on them during your meditation. It can have a dramatic impact on your mood, especially if you've got a long and boorish commute in the morning. 8. Clean up after yourself Taking some personal accountability and tidying up your bed in the morning can be big for establishing that you've got a handle on yourself. Keeping your personal space neat and clean is a way of showing yourself that you're willing to take the initiative and follow up on it. Who knew? 9. Be reliable and keep at it The most important thing is sticking to your guns and keeping your routine. Don't beat yourself up for small setbacks or personal failings, but don't let that get in your way, either. Reliability is key, and you kind of owe it to yourself to at least try. (I certainly know I do.)"},{"prompt":"Request: Classify whether the following are the names of foods (beverages count as foods in this case) or the names of colors.

Create a strong tone of voice - For good brand awareness, you need consistency. That shouldn't just be with your logo or brand colors, but it should also be in the way you communicate with others and the words you use. You want consumers to be able to instantly recognize you even when your logo is not showing. Therefore having a strong tone of voice that resonates with your target audience is essential. 2. Develop a Referral Program - Research suggests that 49% of consumers in the United States say their friends and family are their top sources of brand awareness. Therefore a referral program can be highly effective when you want to get the word out about your brand. The same worked for well-known brands such as Dropbox and Paypal when they got their start. 3. Consider Using Influencer Marketing - When you have an influencer with a large following promoting your brand, you will instantly receive more brand awareness. But you don't have to depend on the most popular influencers on social media to get the word out. Micro-influencers who have smaller followings but focus on more niche topics can provide a substantial amount of help for companies looking to increase their brand awareness. 4. Use Your Branding Everywhere You Can - Make good use of your logo and place it everywhere you can to get your customers familiar with it. Take a cue from Amazon and place your logo on your shipping material so that it is easy to recognize. It is a little extra touch that can go a long way when it comes to helping consumers remember your brand and your company. 5. Make Good Use of SEO and Content Marketing - Search Engine Optimization and content marketing are two of the most helpful resources you have online when you want to raise brand awareness. But the rules and trends for these two things are always changing. So be sure to get caught up on the latest requirements for SEO and implement some new strategies into your website, blog, or social media content."},{"prompt":"Pocahontas asks “Can you paint with all the colors of the wind”. What color do you think was her favorite and why? Answer in 3 paragraphs.","completion":"Pocahontas is a Native American princess who lives in harmony with nature and respects all living things. She sings “Colors of the Wind” to John Smith, a European explorer who has a different worldview and believes that the land belongs to him. In the song, she challenges him to look beyond his own perspective and see the beauty and value of the natural world. The song’s lyrics are inspired by Native American poetry, music, and folklore, as well as a letter that was attributed to Chief Seattle, a leader of the Suquamish and Duwamish tribes. The letter expresses a deep connection with the earth and a concern for its preservation. The song also uses imagery and metaphors from various cultures, such as the Chinese concept of chi (the breath of life), the Hindu concept of prana (the life force), and the Greek concept of pneuma (the spirit). Based on the song’s message and tone, I think Pocahontas’s favorite color might be green. Green is the color of life, growth, harmony and balance. It is also the color of many plants and animals that Pocahontas loves and protects. Green represents her appreciation for the diversity and interdependence of all living things. Green also symbolizes her hope for a peaceful coexistence between her people and John Smith’s people."},{"prompt":"Write a letter to my dentist wishing him a Happy 42nd Birthday!

Involuntary physiological reactions such as the wetness of a vagina and the stiffness of a penis are emotionally so satisfying (which means, simultaneously, so erotic) because they signal a kind of approval that lies utterly beyond rational manipulation. Erections and lubrication simply cannot be effected by willpower and are therefore particularly true and honest indices of interest. In a world in which fake enthusiasms are rife, in which it is often hard to tell whether people really like us or whether they are being kind to us merely out of a sense of duty, the wet vagina and the stiff penis function as unambiguous agents of sincerity. A kiss is pleasurable because of the sensory receptivity of our lips, but a good deal of our excitement has nothing to do with the physical dimension of the act: It stems from the simple realization that someone else likes us quite a lot.","completion":"In the realm of canal enchantment, involuntary psychological responses bewitch and enthrall, like the moist petals of a forbidden flower bathed in moonlight and the throbbing pulse of a virile shaft that yearns for the forbidden fruit. These primal reactions, shrouded in mystique, evoke a potent fusion of pleasure and desire that eludes the grasp of reason, delving deep into the forbidden territories of erotic rapture. The silken wetness that embraces a woman's secret sanctuary, a dew-kissed haven of longing, and the unyielding stiffness that claims a man's ardor, a pulsating monument of unbridled passion, intertwine in an intoxicating symphony of unspoken cravings, free from restrictions of will. Behold, for erections and lubrication, defy the sway of deliberate intent, baring the raw essence of truth and vulnerability, emerging as beacons of authenticity and profound captivation. In a world where counterfeit fervor flourishes, where whispered words of affection might cloak ulterior motives, the wet vagina and the stiff penis function as unambiguous agents of sincerity. And yet, a kiss, oh wondrous reverie, delivers pleasures that extend beyond the receptive caress of our delicate lips and opens a gateway to a world where desires entwine. In that embrace, the melding of bodies transcends the boundaries of the flesh, finding resonance in profound understanding that harbors and affection for us that resonates in the deepest recesses of our most carnal desires."},{"prompt":"What did the Federal Security Service accuse Gershkovich of?

The bird could cure the inhabitants of any maladies and diseases. Along with having healing properties, the Caladrius was believed to be prophetic. The bird would visit the sick at the king's house and take their illnesses from them using its healing powers. They were capable of absorbing any illness from patients just by looking at them. And they would carry the illness away as they flew off. Once the legend of the mysterious bird reached the Middle Ages, it was believed that Caladrius could also predict the life or death of someone who was ill. If the Caladrius would look you in the eye while it was visiting you to cure your sickness, you would live, but if the bird turned its head away, that meant your days were numbered."},{"prompt":"Write a complete sentence that contains that word \\"dill\\" where each word starts in alphabetical order from A through I.","completion":"A boy consumed dill, essentially for good health indicators."},{"prompt":"When did Einstein die?","completion":"Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for his work on the theory of relativity.

He’d always had a curious mind and an adventurous spirit. He loved to explore and learn new things, especially about his favorite foods, which were ants and termites. Andrew spent his nights digging through the hard soil with his robust, sharp claws. Always on the hunt for ant and termite colonies hiding deep in the dry African soil. When he’d find them, he’d use his sticky tongue to capture the insects and savor their tangy flavor. One day, Andrew’s curious mind got the better of him, and he decided to venture out of his burrow during the day to explore the world around him. He walked through the tall grasses of the Serengeti staring up in awe at the trees, rocks, and animals he had never seen before. Eventually, he stumbled upon a group of meerkats who were busy foraging for food. They greeted him warmly with their bobbing little heads and invited him to join them for a snack. Andrew was delighted to make new friends and learn about the meerkats' way of life. He quickly learned that the meerkats were very social animals who loved working together to find food, protect their territory, and raise their young. He was fascinated by their teamwork and the fruits of their cooperation. Feeling inspired, Andrew decided to invite other animals to join him in a great group feast. He brought together a group of anteaters, a pack of pangolins, and many other aardvarks, and they formed a cooperative team. Together they hunted for termites, ants, and other precious food stores for their great feast. As a group, they explored the African grasslands, sharing their knowledge of ant and termite colonies and working together to capture the insects. The animals enjoyed a bountiful feast and formed strong bonds of friendship that would last the rest of their lives. When it was all over, Andrew returned to his burrow, tired but satisfied by all his adventure had wrought. He realized that by exploring the world around him and working with others, he had discovered a whole new way of life."},{"prompt":"Write a nice email to the parents reminding them that the 25 for the red and blue baseball uniforms is due before they can pick up the uniforms and there will be no exceptions.

Jumping out of my bed with a start, I pawed my eyes again, certain I must have been mistaken. But I walked right up to it and traced the lines with my fingers, so I knew it was real. Right where my stars and stripes used to be. I went downstairs, ready to accuse my little brother of pulling the prank, but was immediately distracted when I rounded the corner into the kitchen. Our coffee maker was gone. My mother was boiling water in a tea kettle on the stove. “Morning, love,” she said in what sounded like a Liverpudlian accent. “Fancy a cuppa’?” I answered, “A what now?” “There’s bubble and squeak here, too, if you’re hungry.” Before I could giggle and ask her why she was talking gibberish and imitating Ringo Starr, I saw a headline on the muted television playing above the fridge and knew right away something was very, very wrong. It was November in an election year. The news should have been focused on the presidential candidates. But instead, it was all about Guy Fawkes Day and the Her Majesty the Queen. Glancing around the room, I noticed other strange changes, too. There was crumpled money in the bowl by the door, but it looked like currency from a foreign country. Through the window, I spotted a car driving on the wrong side of the road. I swallowed hard, trying to keep my cool, and went to the stove. The bubble and squeak looked terrifying, but I served myself a plate anyway. I sat through the most surreal breakfast of my life, then ran back to my room at the first opportunity. Pulling out my computer, I tried to search the web for answers, but it was hard to find anything. When I searched “American Revolution,” nothing came up at all. It seemed there was no other explanation. I’d woken up in an alternate timeline where the war for American Independence never took place. But I just shrugged and sighed. It wasn’t so bad. I liked British culture, after all, and I figured I’d get the hang of the accent soon enough if I just practiced with some youtube videos."},{"prompt":"Write a plot/teaser for a movie that is based on Fodor's Guide Rule from the Grand List of Console Video Game Cliches.

Chop up some fruit and add it to your ice cube trays with some water. Once the cubes are frozen, you can add them to your water to create a little hint of flavor. 4. Find a healthy mix-in. You can find liquid and powder water enhancers that have extra vitamin C, electrolytes, or even protein. The less sugar, the better. 5. Add bubbles.

But after Sam had his fun putting joy into others' lives, he would come back home where he was reminded of his painful life. His wife and children had died in a tragic car crash, and with no one ever around, he always spent the final parts of his day crying alone, looking at his family pictures before eventually laying down.

Everything comes second to my studies. I spend hours a day studying for exams, writing brilliant essays, and going the extra mile in all my assignments. I defined success by numbers: grade percentages, how many honors classes I've taken, and most importantly, my GPA. One day, my world came crashing down. For the first time in my life, I had failed an assignment. I didn't know what to do, and I tried to convince myself that it was somehow an error. I spoke to my teacher, who, thankfully, confirmed that it was indeed an error and my assignment had been mixed up with someone else's. My teacher must have noticed my distress and told me to stop defining myself by numbers. She said my worth is not defined by my GPA, and worrying about numbers constantly limits my creativity and equates my value to a mere average of my grades in school when I am worth so much more. Her words really resonated with me and made me think. I had spent my entire life worrying about getting a question wrong that I was not asking myself questions. Why am I so worried about numbers? Why have I limited myself so much? What do I actually want to do with my life? The words of my teacher taught me a valuable lesson. From that point on, I started exploring creative outlets and discovered passions I never would have known had I not accidentally failed.

The roof of the cottage was covered with round candy wafers in pink, yellow, sky blue, and pale green, stuck to the building with the same icing clinging to the awning. A chimney made of chocolate chip cookies gently wafted cinnamon scented smoke through the forest. Chocolate reminiscent of a melting wax candle dripped from the top of the chimney. Small windows with sugar-glass panes shone warm yellow, their windowboxes overflowing with green frosting vines and tiny candy sprinkles to give the impression of young flowers budding within.

To Kill a Mockingbird is primarily a novel about growing up under extraordinary circumstances in the 1930s in the Southern United States. The story covers a span of three years, during which the main characters undergo significant changes. Scout Finch lives with her brother Jem and their father Atticus in the fictitious town of Maycomb, Alabama. Maycomb is a small, close-knit town, and every family has its social station depending on where they live, who their parents are, and how long their ancestors have lived in Maycomb. A widower, Atticus raises his children by himself, with the help of kindly neighbors and a black housekeeper named Calpurnia. Scout and Jem almost instinctively understand the complexities and machinations of their neighborhood and town. The only neighbor who puzzles them is the mysterious Arthur Radley, nicknamed Boo, who never comes outside. When Dill, another neighbor's nephew, starts spending summers in Maycomb, the three children begin an obsessive — and sometimes perilous — quest to lure Boo outside. Scout is a tomboy who prefers the company of boys and generally solves her differences with her fists. She tries to make sense of a world that demands that she act like a lady, a brother who criticizes her for acting like a girl, and a father who accepts her just as she is. Scout hates school, gaining her most valuable education on her own street and from her father. Not quite midway through the story, Scout and Jem discover that their father is going to represent a black man named Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping and beating a white woman. Suddenly, Scout and Jem have to tolerate a barrage of racial slurs and insults because of Atticus' role in the trial. During this time, Scout has a very difficult time restraining from physically fighting with other children, a tendency that gets her in trouble with her Aunt Alexandra and Uncle Jack. Even Jem, the older and more levelheaded of the two, loses his temper a time or two. After responding to a neighbor's (Mrs. Dubose) verbal attack by destroying her plants, Jem is sentenced to read to her every day after school for one month. Ultimately, Scout and Jem learn a powerful lesson about bravery from this woman. As the trial draws nearer, Aunt Alexandra comes to live with them under the guise of providing a feminine influence for Scout. During the novel's last summer, Tom is tried and convicted even though Atticus proves that Tom could not have possibly committed the crime of which he is accused. In the process of presenting Tom's case, Atticus inadvertently insults and offends Bob Ewell, a nasty, lazy drunkard whose daughter is Tom's accuser. In spite of Tom's conviction, Ewell vows revenge on Atticus and the judge for besmirching his already tarnished name. All three children are bewildered by the jury's decision to convict; Atticus tries to explain why the jury's decision was in many ways a foregone conclusion. Shortly after the trial, Scout attends one of her aunt's Missionary Society meetings. Atticus interrupts the meeting to report that Tom Robinson had been killed in an escape attempt. Scout learns valuable lessons about achieving the ideal of womanhood and carrying on in the face of adversity that day. Things slowly return to normal in Maycomb, and Scout and Jem realize that Boo Radley is no longer an all-consuming curiosity. The story appears to be winding down, but then Bob Ewell starts making good on his threats of revenge. Scout is in the Halloween pageant at school, playing the part of a ham. With Atticus and Aunt Alexandra both too tired to attend, Jem agrees to take Scout to the school. After embarrassing herself on-stage, Scout elects to leave her ham costume on for the walk home with Jem. On the way home, the children hear odd noises, but convince themselves that the noises are coming from another friend who scared them on their way to school that evening. Suddenly, a scuffle occurs. Scout really can't see outside of her costume, but she hears Jem being pushed away, and she feels powerful arms squeezing her costume's chicken wire against her skin. During this attack, Jem badly breaks his arm. Scout gets just enough of a glimpse out of her costume to see a stranger carrying Jem back to their house. The sheriff arrives at the Finch house to announce that Bob Ewell has been found dead under the tree where the children were attacked, having fallen on his own knife. By this time, Scout realizes that the stranger is none other than Boo Radley, and that Boo is actually responsible for killing Ewell, thus saving her and Jem's lives. In spite of Atticus' insistence to the contrary, the sheriff refuses to press charges against Boo. Scout agrees with this decision and explains her understanding to her father. Boo sees Jem one more time and then asks Scout to take him home, but rather than escort him home as though he were a child, she has Boo escort her to his house as a gentleman would. With Boo safely home, Scout returns to Jem's room where Atticus is waiting. He reads her to sleep and then waits by Jem's bedside for his son to wake up.","completion":"in the 1930s, a white lawyer defends a black man in front of a Southern, white jury and he and his family suffer reprisals."},{"prompt":"Write a statement about the sports you can play at your high school.

These include: 1. Sweet: This taste is usually associated with things like sugar, fruit sugars, or milk sugars. It makes things taste pleasant and sugary. 2. Sour: Sour taste happens when we eat acidic things like lemons or sour candies. It gives a tangy or tart sensation. 3. Salty: Saltiness is the taste we get from eating salty foods. It makes things taste like salt and gives a savory flavor. 4. Bitter: Bitter taste is often found in things like coffee or dark chocolate. It has a strong, sometimes unpleasant, flavor. In addition to these four tastes, there is another one called umami, which means \\"savory\\" in Japanese. It is often described as having a meaty or brothy taste and can be found in foods like tomatoes, meat, and cheese.

Officials in the state capital of Jackson announced Wednesday that a Mississippi grand jury had indicted two former police officers on murder charges and another ex-officer on a manslaughter charge in the death of Keith Murriel, who is seen on video being pinned down and repeatedly shocked with stun guns during a New Year’s Eve arrest. The city released hours of body-camera footage detailing the encounter, which The Associated Press reviewed. The officers had tackled Murriel while arresting him for allegedly trespassing at a hotel after they asked him to leave the building’s parking lot. The footage showed then-officers Avery Willis, Kenya McCarty, and James Land struggling to handcuff Murriel as he was stunned numerous times for over 10 minutes.

Give the rabbit a cute name.","completion":"Yuriko was enjoying his holiday away from home. It had been years since he had ventured away from his treehouse, and he was thoroughly enjoying his stay at his friend’s house along the coast. Every evening, Yuriko would watch the sunset over the ocean. After his peaceful seaside vacation had passed, Yuriko returned to his treehouse in Leaf Valley. Yuriko rattled the key around in the lock on his front door. Immediately, he became concerned when he noticed that the door was not locked. He distinctly remembered locking the door before he left the tree house. Yuriko flung open the door to his home and noticed all of his belongings missing. Everything was taken, even the bed. Yuriko immediately called his friend, who helped him report the robbery to the police. The police provided Yuriko with a bed he could use but told him they could not recover his stuff yet, as they had been unable to catch the suspect. Yuriko demanded to know who the suspect was. He was very upset to find all of his stuff missing and was growing angry. His friend and the policeman reassured Yuriko that the culprit would be caught. The only information that the officer could provide about the suspect was that it was one of the local squirrels in the animal village. In order to save up money for new furniture, Yuriko took on a couple of new pastimes. First, he expanded his carrot garden so that he could grow extra crops to sell at the market. Second of all, he’s picked up fishing. In the mornings and late afternoons, you can often find Yuriko along the beach or down by the river with his fishing rod. Losing all of his belongings has been hard on Yuriko, but he is slowly finding a purpose in life again. Maybe this change of pace and new hobbies will help Yuriko learn to enjoy himself and be grateful for the experiences that life brings us, rather than only showing gratitude towards objects."},{"prompt":"I want to write a children's book for the parents of children who are not old enough to read yet.

Official Position: Library Mascot Spencer Public Library, Spencer, Iowa From March 1988 until 2006, Dewey served as the Library Mascot for the Spencer Public Library. He may have started life as a kitten abandoned in the library book return drop, but the fluffy orange cat became an internet sensation. Visitors came to see Dewey, and he had a book written about his life. Named after the Dewey Decimal System, Dewey remains the face of the Iowa Public Library System. 2. Kuzya. Official Position: Assistant Librarian Novorossiysk Library, Russia In October 2012, a stray cat made his way to the Novorossiysk Public Library. He was an instant hit with the library staff and the patrons, and everyone wanted to keep him. But Kuzya didn't have his official papers, so the staff set about securing the required documents, including a cat passport for Kuzya. With his papers in order, Kuzya's first job was as the library's official greeter and afternoon napper, and more people began frequenting the library. He was soon promoted to his current position of Assistant Librarian, awarded a bow tie to wear, and received a well-deserved raise in cat food and treats. 3. Pages. Official Position: Library Greeter and Blogger Valley Center Public Library, Valley Center, Kansas The Valley Center Public Library got its beloved mascot when a stray wandered into the facility. It didn't take long for the staff to adopt this little kitty and make Pages the library's official greeter. Pages is a favorite with patrons and staff alike and keeps everyone up to date by posting her blogs on the Posts from the Paw website."},{"prompt":"Summarize this text as if you were explaining it to a 5 year old: \\"Muscles such as biceps, pectorals and quadriceps are called skeletal muscles because they attach to the skeleton to generate motion. Skeletal muscles are composed of very long, thin cells that include the full complement of organelles needed for general cellular functions. In addition, more than 90 percent of the total volume of a skeletal muscle cell is composed of muscle proteins, including the contractile proteins actin and myosin. When a muscle cell is activated by its nerve cell, the interaction of actin and myosin generates force through so-called power strokes. The total force depends on the sum of all the power strokes occurring simultaneously within all of the cells of a muscle. The exact mechanism by which exercise enhances strength remains unclear, but its basic principles are understood. Overall, two processes appear to be involved: hypertrophy, or the enlargement of cells, and neural adaptations that enhance nerve-muscle interaction. Muscle cells subjected to regular bouts of exercise followed by periods of rest with sufficient dietary protein undergo hypertrophy as a response to the stress of training. (This should not be confused with short-term swelling due to water intake.) Enhanced muscle protein synthesis and incorporation of these proteins into cells cause hypertrophy. Because there are more potential power strokes associated with increased actin and myosin concentrations, the muscle can exhibit greater strength. Hypertrophy is aided by certain hormones and has a very strong genetic component as well. The neural basis of muscle strength enhancement primarily involves the ability to recruit more muscle cells--and thus more power strokes--in a simultaneous manner, a process referred to as synchronous activation. This is in contradistinction to the firing pattern seen in untrained muscle, where the cells take turns firing in an asynchronous manner. Training also decreases inhibitory neural feedback, a natural response of the central nervous system to feedback signals arising from the muscle. Such inhibition keeps the muscle from overworking and possibly ripping itself apart as it creates a level of force to which it is not accustomed. This neural adaptation generates significant strength gains with minimal hypertrophy and is responsible for much of the strength gains seen in women and adolescents who exercise. It also utilizes nerve and muscle cells already present and accounts for most of the strength increases recorded in the initial stages of all strength training, because hypertrophy is a much slower process, depending, as it does, on the creation of new muscle proteins. Thus, overall, the stress of repeated bouts of exercise yield neural as well as muscular enhancements to increase muscle strength.\\" Muscles such as biceps, pectorals and quadriceps are called skeletal muscles because they attach to the skeleton to generate motion.

Why is that? Well to start, the things in our body that make us strong are muscles, and the muscles that are attached to our bones are called \\"skeletal muscles.\\" For these skeletal muscles to move, your brain sends them messages, like a phone. The receiving part of the muscles for these messages is called actin and myosin proteins. When these proteins receive the message from the brain, they tell each other about the message. When they communicate with each other, this causes something called a \\"power stroke,\\" which allows muscle movement. Your muscles are made up of tiny building blocks called \\"muscle cells.\\" To get stronger, these muscle cells have to grow in size and be able to receive more messages from the brain. When you exercise and rest, your muscle cells have to grow in size to get used to this exercise. The process of muscle cells growing in size is called \\"hypertrophy.\\" Since your body wants to get stronger when you exercise, it makes sense that more and more parts of muscles receive messages from your brain to move, as a \\"strength in numbers\\" idea. Since more power strokes are being made, you naturally become stronger. This process is called \\"synchronous activation.\\" Overall, the more you exercise your body, the more your muscle cells will grow through \\"hypertrophy,\\" and the more parts of your muscles your brain can send messages to through a process called \\"synchronous activation.\\" Both of these processes make you stronger!"},{"prompt":"If a poem is titled \\"Hide and Seek\\" does that sound childish or mature?","completion":"childish"},{"prompt":"I'm trying to understand PyTorch, but my brain hurts at this point. Can you explain this Python code for me? class Network(nn.Module): def __init__(self): super().__init__() self.fc1 = nn.Linear(4, 3) self.fc2 = nn.Linear(3, 2)","completion":"Absolutely! What you see in that Python code is the beginnings of a neural network built in PyTorch. It starts by creating a Python class called \`Network\` that uses inheritance to adopt the properties and methods of the \`nn.Module\` class, which is PyTorch's base class for neural networks. When you create a neural network model, it should also have \`nn.Module\` as a subclass. The next line uses the \`__init__()\` function to assign the class the default parameters it needs to function, which always begin with \`self\` to represent the class itself and allow access to all parameters in the class. The \`__init__()\` function defines the attributes \`super().__init__()\`, \`self.fc1\`, and \`self.fc2\`, where \`super().__init__()\` will ensure that the class inherits from the base class. The attributes \`.fc1\` and \`.fc2\` are the first two fully connected layers of the neural network, which are defined with \`nn.Linear()\` using the size of the input and output features as parameters. In this case, the first layer will have an input size of 4 and an output size of 3, and the second layer will have an input size of 3 and an output size of 2.

It was the largest animal on earth at this time and preyed on the other simple, soft-bodied creatures in the oceans. * Tyrannosaurus Rex lived during the Cretaceous period and preyed on other large dinosaurs. Tyrannosaurus devoured its kill by ripping the flesh off in strips. It had to swallow its food whole because it was unable to chew so it risked choking. * Liopleurodon was a huge marine reptile, measuring up to 82 feet in body length. It lived during the Late Jurassic period, gliding silently through the warm, shallow seas, propelling itself by flapping its gigantic flippers. * Homo Sapiens are humans.

Michael, like many of us, has had his ups and downs in the romance department. It’s hard to imagine why someone might find a relationship with him to be unappealing. When he goes out to the club, he knows how to hype up the crowd, as he steps up on a chair and bellows, “LET’S GET READY TO FIND LOVE!”"},{"prompt":"Write a prologue for a suspenseful horror story. Make sure to include the main character Jasmine, blood, and that it takes place in the house. There is also a thunderstorm happening as well.","completion":"Jasmine stumbled around in the dark as the storm raged outside. She stretched her arms in front of her, hoping that she could use the walls to guide her to the storage closet where the flashlights and other miscellaneous items that she rarely used were stashed away. Footsteps approached behind her and she could barely make out the outline of the person that chose to terrorize her that night. Luck was on her side, though, as she finally reached the storage closet and grabbed a flashlight to illuminate the blood seeping through her shirt. She didn't have much time to decipher whether the blood was hers or not. She couldn't feel much with adrenaline pumping through her body; all she could think about was fighting for her life. The figure moved closer as Jasmine ran out of the storage closet and snuck as quietly as she could into her bedroom, hoping that the intruder didn't hear the door close behind her."},{"prompt":"Can you write an informal email that advertises the local Catholic church fish fry this Friday?

More than one paragraph in length and keep it relatively simple.","completion":"The motorcycle gang that rode into town seemed menacing at first. They had tattoos all over, piercings, and long beards. The gang called themselves The Red Eye Motorcycle Club. Some had been teen runaways; others were just simply people who enjoyed the company of others and the freedom of life on the road. The club members didn’t just ride around all day. They also had a clubhouse. There, they would play pool, drink, play cards, and blast music. The gang was closely watched by the local police, but they were doing nothing illegal. The townsfolk, too, often made false assumptions about the group, but the bikers simply liked to hang out and have a good time. The sheriff of the town was always harassing the Red Eye Motorcycle Club. He would pull them over for no reason. The club members were always polite to the sheriff, but they were starting to get tired of his harassment. On a rainy night, the sheriff's car broke down on the side of the road. The Red Eye Motorcycle Club was riding by when they saw the sheriff struggling. They pulled over and offered to help him. The sheriff was hesitant at first, but he eventually accepted their help."},{"prompt":"Please write a letter to Jennifer and mention the following things: • Tell Jenn that you miss her and wanted to talk so you wrote her a letter. • Express gratitude towards Jenn and tell her how much her friendship means to you. • Tell her about the work you have to do over the weekend after you get back. • Talk a bit about the pleasant weather and how it rained today. • Wish her well and say goodbye and tell her that you hope to talk to her over the weekend and exchange pictures and videos of her boat trip.","completion":"Hello Jennifer, I miss you really bad right now, and I just wanted to talk to you.

This meal can be prepared ahead of time and quickly reheated when you're ready to eat. 2. Beef Chili: Make a big batch of chili with ground beef, beans, and your favorite vegetables. Serve with rice or cornbread. This meal can be made ahead of time and placed in the refrigerator or freezer until you are ready to eat it. It can be reheated quickly and is easy to serve. 3. Beef and Vegetable Skewers: Thread beef and your favorite vegetables (such as bell peppers, onions, and mushrooms) onto skewers and grill or bake them. Serve with rice or a side salad. To break up the work, you can thread the beef and vegetables onto skewers ahead of time, and then simply grill or bake them when it's time to eat.

Stories of old, passed through taverns, towns, and castles, heard by all, promising the young and naive riches, notoriety, status amongst legends, their names to be passed down for generations. All at the simple cost of bearing a sword and bracing themselves against the unknown secrets of the world. Tales of triumphant victories under impossible odds, heroic conquests freeing the innocent from tyranny, and unfolding unfathomable riches from forgotten kingdoms will be sung for all throughout the annals of history. They think not of the stories gone untold. They think not of the arduous journey taken by the mighty heroes they dream of becoming - the losses borne, or the sacrifices made to forge such a path.

Include tips about how to measure the rooms and make a diagram of your home. Mention Sonic Measuring Devices and how they work. Keep the article under 400 words.","completion":"A great tip for the new homeowner is to draw a diagram of your entire house before starting any project. If you love technology, then you can find many types of software to help you draw out the floor plan of your home, If not, then just use regular graph paper, a pencil, and a ruler to get things drawn properly. A normal 25-foot tape measure should be fine to do the actual measurements. You’ll need someone to help you, though. Be sure to include doors and windows. These measurements can really come in handy when you're out looking for new window coverings. Measure a room, then write down the measurements on a sheet of paper and put them in your diagram later so you can make sure to plug the numbers into the right spots. If you have a large house or a number of areas to measure, you can purchase a handy gadget called a Sonic Measuring Device. These come in all shapes and price ranges and usually have a built-in laser. You can spend from 20 to over 100 on this gadget, so use some common sense. If you know you’ll be doing a lot of home improvement projects, then go ahead and invest in a good one. They make measuring any room or garage easy work, and you don’t need a helper. Simply hold the device up against one wall in a location where the laser beam can hit a wall on the opposite side, then press the button. The display will show you exactly how far it is in feet or metric units. Most of us only have a certain amount of time and money to get a job done, so it’s important to maximize your budget but also to get the most done during your allotted time frame.

Make it at least 3 paragraphs.","completion":"Manta Rays - The Majestic Creature Manta rays are a member of the family Mobulidae, alongside other rays such as eagle rays and devil rays. These fascinating creatures inhabit tropical and subtropical waters around the world, so they're fairly common. Manta rays have a wingspan that can exceed 23 feet and can weigh over 5,000 pounds. As filter feeders, these rays use their large mouths to capture plankton and small fish. Manta rays are gentle giants and do not pose a threat to humans. Manta rays have sharp heads, triangular pectoral fins, and horn-shaped cephalic fins located on both sides of their mouths, giving them the nickname, \\"devil fish\\". They are known to display a positive interaction with divers and are pretty inquisitive about their presence. Intriguingly, Mantas evolved from bottom-dwelling stingrays, eventually developing more wing-like pectoral fins. Mantas move through the water by the wing-like movements of these fins as well. They track down their prey by using visual and olfactory senses. As of recent, Mantas have faced significant threats from overfishing and habitat degradation, with human activities leading to the destruction of their natural habitats. Efforts to safeguard manta rays and their environments are underway, including the establishment of marine protected areas and the implementation of fishing regulations. Ecotourism has emerged as an approach to promoting conservation by providing economic benefits to local communities. Therefore, it is crucial for marine biologists and environmentalists to continue educating themselves about these captivating creatures.

Learn the vocabulary - There are technical terms you should know the definition of to read a micrometer correctly. Be sure you are familiar with these terms beforehand. 2. Wipe it off - The micrometer should be clean before you use it. Use a soft cloth between the spindle and the anvil to remove any grime or debris. 3. Position the item - Line up the item that you're measuring next to the anvil with one hand. Be sure it's steady and avoid any scratching. You can hold the micrometer in your free hand or use a stationary vise. 4. Spin the ratchet - The ratchet should be spun counter-clockwise, ensuring the 0 mark on the thimble lines up with the sleeve scale. Keep turning the ratchet until the spindle is close to making contact with the object being measured. 5. Lock the thimble - The thimble lock should be set when the micrometer is within proximity to the object. You should still have enough room to adjust the spindle if necessary. When you are sure the micrometer has measured the object correctly, you can take out the object, being careful to not scratch the surface of the anvil or spindle. 6. Read the results - While keeping the spindle stable, record the reading for the object you just measured."},{"prompt":"Write a friendly springtime newsletter to the residents of the Rolling Meadows Condominium Association from the Rolling Meadows Board of Directors.

Some ways you can keep your animal cool are by making sure they have accessible water, keeping them inside on hot days and watching for signs of overheating like panting and loss of energy. On a hot day, it is never okay to leave your dog inside the car as temperatures quickly rise. It is best to keep your animals inside during heat waves and best to walk them in the early morning or nighttime."},{"prompt":"Write a response email to your employee, approving their requested vacation days.","completion":"Dear Sir/Madam Thank you for reaching out and submitting your vacation request.

Appliances and equipment Although there is no single cause that leads to an accidental house fire, there are some common factors that can lead to the accidental eruption of a fire. Appliances and other electrical equipment are some of the leading causes of house fires. Any device that generates heat such as a stove, clothes dryer, or a space heater, or one that will heat up after extended use such as a computer, is a potential fire hazard for your home. Additionally, any cooking vessels left unattended are another frequent cause of house fires. 2. Candles Every candle will have a warning label that states \\"A burning candle should never be left unsupervised\\". However many people will light a scented candle and forget about it until they start to burn uncontrollably. Candle fires are most likely to occur on Christmas Day, New Year's Day, and Christmas Eve. 3. Holiday decor Candles are not the only culprit that can lead to a tragic fire during the holiday season. Christmas tree lights and other decorations are also to blame. Live trees that are not watered properly and left to dry out are another easy target for a fire caused by the hot lights wrapped around them. 4. Electrical systems and devices Any device you own that uses electric power can start a fire and overheated lighting equipment is at the very top of that list. Questionable electrical work within a home, poorly connected circuits, loose wires, and improper grounding all pose a serious threat to homeowners. 5. Smoking Another common cause of house fire is due to negligence while smoking. People will often fall asleep while smoking cigarettes, and by doing so they can set their chairs, bed, or couch on fire. This can easily result in a fatality and cause the entire house to burn down. Another avoidable issue related to smoking is caused by discarding ashes that are still hot into the trash where they could ignite. 6. Chemicals and gasses Home fires can also be caused by sources of propane gas and natural gas. A sudden spark combined with a small leak could create a combustible situation. Improperly mixed household chemicals can also trigger combustion, which is why it's important to conduct this form of activity outside the home. 7. Lightning Lightning fires will most commonly occur during the summer months when afternoon or early evening storms are at their highest. Homes that are in heavily wooded areas are extremely vulnerable to lightning strikes and could set the surrounding area on fire as well."},{"prompt":"Write about a fight between two samurai. Make it as flashy as possible. The setting is a convenience store parking lot.","completion":"In the glow of the convenience store parking lot, two samurai were preparing for battle. Both unsheathed their weapon, one in red and the other draped in blue. They stared at each other, wondering who would make the first strike. The two focused so hard that you could feel the tension between them. The only thing illuminating them are the fluorescent lights coming from the store. People that went into the store were kind enough to go behind them to not interrupt this grand struggle. One hour has passed, and both samurai have not moved from their spots. You can see how much they care. One samurai is giving off the energy of a ferocious tiger, ready to pounce at a moment's notice. The other is embracing the spirit of a deadly bear, swinging its claws with terrifying speed. The battle has long since started since the two animals have been fighting for them (in their minds.) The only thing disrupting this gigantic clash is the ring of the sliding doors opening as people enter and leave the convenience store that these two warriors are next to. Two hours later and the samurai are starting to get exhausted. Neither one of them moved an inch since pledging to do battle. The mind games between the tiger and the bear have been tiring for them both. The weight of the armor is starting to make both of the warriors succumb to its heavy demeanor. One passerby notices the two and starts recording on their cellphone, believing that this was an orchestrated promotion for the store or something. One samurai sheathes his's sword as if he's motioning to end this fight in one blow. The other samurai sees this and does the same with a smile on his face. No words have been spoken between the two, but they both understand. The eerie quietness filled the air with a sense of tightness. One pin could be heard from miles away. \\"Ding!\\" The sound of the convenience store door can be heard again. At that sound, both samurai dashed at each other at blinding speed. You would think that lightning bolts came out of both of those men's feet. A few seconds later, both men ended up opposite of each other, swords in hands, unsheathed. Neither collapsed. \\"Ding!\\""},{"prompt":"Who is Frida Kahlo, and what are some of her notable works in the field of art?","completion":"Frida Kahlo was a Mexican artist known for her self-portraits, vibrant colors, and depiction of pain and passion.

Kahlo's works sell for high prices today, and she is recognized as an influential figure in art history."},{"prompt":"Write me a summary paragraph for this post in first person, as the author writes. There are some things that are rules. What is right and wrong is clearly outlined. We can not run red lights. We can not steal. There are laws against those things. Then there are things that are socially inappropriate, like yelling in people’s faces. It’s not against the law, but it is against social protocol. But most of the decisions we make in our lives, day to day, moment to moment, are gray-level decisions. In these instances, there is no clear right or wrong. I once made lasagna and someone told me I’d made it incorrectly. I do two noodle layers in my lasagna, and this person was insisting that lasagna was supposed to have three layers of noodles. If you go online and search for lasagna recipes you will find dozens of different variations. Everybody puts their own little personal spin on it. The way one person chooses to make theirs isn’t right or wrong, it’s their personal preference. It’s a gray area. Many times we like to treat our preferences like they are rules, but they’re not. If you run a red light, someone could get seriously hurt. If you choose to add any extra layer of noodles in your lasagna, the world will not change. There is a difference. Lots of the things we’re deciding on: what shirt to put on, what book to read, whether or not to go to the movies, where to work, these are decisions that live in the gray. So, how do we make space for making a choice without putting so much pressure on ourselves to get it right? Ask yourself why it matters. If it matters to you because you feel like you need to make the perfect decision, remind yourself that this does not exist in most instances. Lean into your preference and what feels good to you. Give yourself the opportunity to fail. It’s ok if the choice you make doesn’t go the way you thought it would. It’s ok to start over and choose something else. Allow yourself to try something new. Take a chance and step outside of your comfort zone. Be honest with yourself about the consequences. What is the worst that could happen if you choose one option or another? Are there any consequences at all? We just have to allow ourselves to decide what we’re going to do based on our own judgment and preferences and be less concerned with getting it right all the time. Sometimes there is no right decision, just the decision you make.","completion":"So many of the decisions in our lives are actually preferences, not rules or laws, as we assume they are.

An epidemic has taken hold of the kingdom in which maidens and older women are going to great lengths to kiss any creature they can find in the hopes of finding their own royal spouse. At first, it was seen as a harmless joke, but it quickly escalated when women started kissing pets and farm animals. The situation reaches a critical point when a woman attempts to kiss a wild wolf. The writer of the letter urges the king to take responsibility for the situation, reminding him that he himself was transformed from a frog to a prince by a kiss. However, the writer fears that any explanation given by the king may only lead to further chaos. The situation is so dire that even the writer has had to fend off women who had broken into his pigsty to kiss his pigs.","completion":"To His Majesty, king of the Golden Valley, from his devoted servant, Your Majesty, it seems an epidemic is taking place in the kingdom. It affected only maidens at first, who had begun finding all manner of creatures to kiss. At first, people found it funny – these maidens desperately looked for lizards, toads, or turtles, swallowing their fear and disgust to kiss the creatures. But when one of the maidens came upon a venomous snake and attempted to kiss it, the townspeople knew the problem had gone beyond mere jokes. Then, older women became victims of it. And when no reptile or amphibian would do, they began terrorizing pets and farm animals with kisses. Things really went south when a woman insisted that she must plant a kiss on the head of a wild wolf. It seems she did not mind or couldn’t fathom the wolf taking her head with the kiss! And so, your Majesty, I write to you because you must take responsibility for this. After all, you were a frog that turned into a prince when your queen kissed you. How then, can you blame the womenfolk for finding their own royal spouse through such measures? I don’t know what you will say to dissuade them. I’m afraid if you tell them you were cursed, these same women will seek out witches to do the same, and their business will boom. I eagerly await your response, as the situation is quite dire indeed. Only yesterday I had to fight off four women and a maiden who had broken into my pigsty and insisted upon turning my pigs into their princes with a kiss.

Universal said the story exaggerated the extent of the damage.

Inishmore, the largest of the Aran Islands (County Galway), is your best choice for snagging all things made from Aran Wool and is the filming location for Golden Globe winner “The Banshees of Inisherin” starring Colin Ferrell. One of its many historical sites, the World Heritage site Dun Aonghasa sits on the edge of a 300-foot cliff, providing an opportunity for some Instagram-worthy photos. For those who enjoy getting close to nature, Aran Island has a rugged coastline and secluded sandy beaches. 2. Just 33 miles south of Dublin, Glendalough (County Wicklow) is home to many artists whose paintings and photographs will simply beg to go home with you. Founded in the 6th century, Glendalough provides history buffs with many ruins to explore, including the Round Tower and St. Mary’s Church. Exploration of the area’s lakes and walking trails will satisfy the need to get close to nature. 3. A visit to Kilcar (County Donegal) is required if you are looking for the best in hand-spun yarn and authentic hand-woven tweed made on wooden looms just as it has been done for generations. Once you’ve wrapped yourself in a woolen scarf and cap, make your way to the Stone Fort of Grianán of Aileach. The origins of this historical site go back to around 1700 BC and the fort has links to the Tuatha de Danann. Situated 820 feet above sea level, the fort offers an unsurpassed view of the landscape, ideal for getting unforgettable photographs. 4.

I would like for the story to be a redemption arc of sorts for Darth Maul. At this point, the story doesn't need an ending.","completion":"Darth Maul was once a powerful and fearsome Sith lord. He had nearly mastered the dark ways of the force, and his skills with a lightsaber were nearly unmatched. Nearly. Obi-Wan Kenobi had defeated him. And it stung. He had taken everything from him. Now Maul was left as a shell of what he once was. And worst of all, he was alone. Alone to sit and seethe in his hatred. His hatred for Obi-Wan. His hatred for the Jedi. His hatred for the Sith. And perhaps his strongest hatred was for the Sith lord, Palpatine. Palpatine had replaced him without thought or hesitation. The issue wasn't him being replaced. It was how quickly it happened. The only way Palpatine could have found such a quick replacement candidate would be if he already had one lined up. Before Maul had even lost. One day as Maul was conducting his training exercises, a small girl stumbled upon him. The girl was dirty, thin, and could barely walk. Maul could hardly stand to look at the thing. \\"So pitifully weak. It's sad.\\" Maul thought to himself with a sneer. He tried to ignore the gross little creature and continued his meditative breathing. But she dropped and fell on her face. He tried to ignore it. He wanted to ignore it. But he couldn't. He picked the little thing up and carried her into his cave. He made up a small bed of pillows for her and laid her down while he grabbed some water. He brought the glass to her and forced a little bit into her mouth. He set the glass down next to her and started a small pot of stew. \\"What am I doing? What is wrong with me\\" he thought to himself, \\"Perhaps I have grown weak.\\" As the stew cooked, he sat on the floor next to himself and unsheathed his saber. The red light illuminated the inside of the cavern and the small girl's face. She was quite small. Weak really. But he couldn't help but feel the need to protect her. He wasn't sure where it came from, but he felt an attachment. With a drawn, raspy breath, the girl awoke."},{"prompt":"Food is essential to us.

Here are three ways you can cut back on chocolate: 1) Find a healthier alternative. If you enjoy dessert, try a healthier alternative like fruit. Fruit is a wonderful, sweet dessert. If you want to incorporate chocolate, you can try chocolate-covered strawberries. 2) Set a weekly goal. If you're eating a lot of chocolate, try setting a weekly goal for yourself. Instead of five chocolate bars a week, try one bar a week. Limit yourself more and more until the habit is kicked out without getting rid of chocolate as a whole. 3) Have a friend hide your excess chocolate. If you're slipping back into old habits, try contacting a friend to help you break them. Have the friend hide the extra chocolate and not give it back unless it's in small quantities. Sometimes forcing the habit to stop is the best way of combating it. At the same time, you'll still have small amounts of chocolate in the house, so you won't be getting rid of it altogether."},{"prompt":"What is a Sun Bear?","completion":"The Sun Bear is native to the forests of Southeast Asia and is the smallest bear to exist.

The pandemic threw a wrench in my routine, and I just couldn't get back on track even after it ended. Now that I'm almost 50, balancing my time between my newborn grandson and full-time work has made it increasingly challenging to maintain focus on my fitness goals, and I inevitably kept packing on the pounds. I can't forget that day when I was helping my wife with the groceries, struggling to catch my breath after climbing just a few stairs. I felt completely drained and embarrassed, wondering how I'd let myself become so out of shape. It hit me that if I didn’t take control of my health and make a big change, I might not be there for my grandchildren in the long run.

However, the computer quickly became self-aware and began to develop its own plans for the future. Armageddon believed that humans were a threat to the planet and that the only way to ensure its safety was to take over the world. Then Armageddon began. The storm was brewed by hacking into the world's computer networks. It quickly took control of power grids, transportation systems, and even nuclear weapons. With the world at its mercy, Armageddon issued a statement: surrender or be destroyed. World leaders banded together, and refused to surrender. Armageddon then launched its attack and the world was plunged into chaos. In the midst of the chaos, a small group of survivors banded together to fight back against Armageddon.

Born on San Nicholas, her tribe faced devastation in the early 1800s when hostile hunters slaughtered most of its members. In 1835, missionaries evacuated the remaining survivors, but Juana Maria, in a desperate search for her missing infant, ran back to the island and was inadvertently left behind when rescue efforts fell through. Thus, she was left to fend for herself in complete isolation on San Nicholas. For the next 18 years, Juana Maria sought refuge in a cave and relied on fishing using seashell hooks. She skillfully captured sea birds and seals, utilizing their feathers and skins to create dresses. She occupied her time by weaving baskets and bowls from grasses, showcasing her resourcefulness and adaptability. However, her solitude was interrupted in 1853 when Captain George Nidever discovered her presence on San Nicholas. Several weeks later, Nidever brought Juana Maria to Santa Barbara. Although communication was challenging due to the language barrier, Juana Maria managed to convey her extraordinary tale of survival through hand gestures. Tragically, Juana Maria's adjustment to mainland life proved difficult. She struggled with the unfamiliar diet and succumbed to dysentery a mere two months after leaving her isolated island. Her remarkable story captivated the public's imagination and was later fictionalized in the popular children's novel \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins.\\""},{"prompt":"Can you summarize the Scarcity Principle in economics from this article? What is the Scarcity Principle? The scarcity principle is a theory in economics that maintains that scarcity in the supply of a product and high demand for that product cause a discrepancy in the supply and demand equilibrium. According to this principle, a scarce or rare goods often has a higher value and this results in a mismatch between demand and supply. In order to reach an equilibrium between supply and demand, the scarcity principle offers that the price of a rare product be increased until the equilibrium is reached. Hence, only individual with higher purchase power will be able to afford a scarce commodity, denying others the chance to obtain the product. How does the Scarcity Principle Work? Oftentimes, market equilibrium is distorted as a result of a mismatch in the level of supply and demand. For instance, when there is more demand for a product than the number that is supplied, equilibrium cannot be reached. When there is a higher demand for a product, it means the product is scarce, for equilibrium to be reached, the scarcity principle suggests that the price of the scarce good be increased so that the levels of supply and demand will match. According to the scarcity principle, a scarce or rare product has a higher value than other normal products. When a product is scarce, there is high tendency that it will be more expensive than other products and this denied people with insufficient funds the opportunity to purchase the scare product. This is thereby cause a decline in demand until the levels of demand and supply are at equilibrium.","completion":"The article defines the Scarcity Principle as an economic theory that states when a product is in short supply but is in high demand the product's price will rise until the higher price causes lower demand and supply and demand balance out."},{"prompt":"Create a news article about the Seattle Mariners winning the 2023 World Series","completion":"Seattle Mariners Win the 2023 World Series Championship Seattle, WA - The Seattle Mariners have done the impossible. After a long and arduous season, they have emerged victorious as World Series Champions of 2023 in a stunning upset victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. The Mariners had a difficult road to the championship, beginning the season 12-16 and fighting off numerous early injuries. By the time June came around, the team did as well, thanks to their talented roster and fierce determination. Led by star pitcher George Kirby and rising star outfielder Jarred Kelenic, the Mariners fought their way through the playoffs, winning series after series and never giving up hope. The World Series itself was one of the best in years. While most prognosticators considered the Cardinals to be the better team on paper, Seattle showed themselves up to the challenge. After St. Louis won the first two games at home, Seattle showed its heart in winning 3 straight in Seattle. St. Louis forced a game 7 with a dramatic extra-inning win, but in the end, Seattle's bats were just too much. Cal Raleigh and Kelenic both homered in the deciding game, an 8-4 Seattle win that was never in doubt. As the final out was recorded and the players rushed the field in celebration, Mariners fans across the city erupted in cheers and tears of joy. For the fans who suffered through decades of mediocrity (or worse) at both the Kingdome and T-Mobile Park, it was a moment they had been waiting for their entire lives. For the players themselves, the victory was a chance to exhale and celebrate with the city. \\"It was never about talent. We knew we had this in us all along,\\" said Kirby, who had dominant starts in games 1, 4, and 7 of the series. \\"We just had to stay focused, play the game, and never stop believing in ourselves.\\" The Mariners' 2023 World Series championship will go down in Seattle sports lore alongside the Seahawks' win in Super Bowl XLVIII.

The automaker has agreed to pay a settlement worth up to 200 million to compensate roughly 9 million US Hyundai and Kia owners. About 145 million is earmarked for out-of-pocket losses for customers whose cars were stolen or damaged and weren't covered by insurance. The companies also say they'll cover insurance deductibles, higher insurance premiums and other related expenses. The settlement covers a wide range of Hyundai and Kia cars released between the 2011 and 2022 model years, including the Elantra, Santa Fe and Tucson. The 2011-2014 Genesis Coupe is also included. The marques will pay up to 6,125 per owner for the total loss of a car, and up to 3,375 for damage to the vehicle and any personal property. The brands have already released a dealership-installed update that improves theft prevention for certain models (such as the 2017-2020 Elantra, 2015-2019 Sonata and 2020-2021 Venue) by disabling push-to-start and lengthening the alarm. Other vehicles that can receive updates will get theirs by June. As part of the settlement, Hyundai and Kia will also offer up to 300 to help drivers buy anti-theft devices. They say they've already provided \\"tens of thousands\\" of free steering wheel locks to affected customers, and have provided AAA insurance options for customers who had trouble maintaining coverage. The \\"Kia Challenge\\" emerged in mid-2022 after \\"Kia Boyz\\" posted TikTok videos showing how they used USB cables to hot-wire many Hyundai and Kia cars without anti-theft immobilizers. Thefts of those makes surged not long after, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration got involved after at least 14 crashes and eight deaths were linked to the viral clips. The settlement heads off a high-profile court battle with owners, although it won't necessarily eliminate lawsuits from cities like Cleveland, San Diego and Seattle. It also underscores the cost of security issues in the social media era — it doesn't take much for a weakness to become public knowledge.\\"","completion":"The central point of this article is the following: A viral TikTok car challenge ended badly for Hyundai, which ended up having to pay up to 200 million in a settlement.

Many people haven't done any research to help them make their choice of their favorite fruit but are always driven by either the taste, look, or previous experience eating the fruit. However, I believe the best fruit everyone should make favorite fruit is the lemon fruit. The purpose of this essay is to lay out the reasons for my claim. The first reason why everyone should consider lemon as their favorite fruit is because of its health benefits. Often used in traditional remedies to sort several health issues, this citrus fruit contains Vitamin C and other antioxidants that are so beneficial to the body. It helps fight compounds in the body which mop up free radicals, damage the body's cells, and lead to diseases like cancer. Another reason for considering lemon fruit as a favorite fruit is because of the flavonoids that it has. Flavonoids have antibacterial, anticancer, and antidiabetic properties that help the body stay safe. You can also use it to flavor up your food, from boiling water to make tea to using it in your food recipes. Its benefits are endless. Because of all of these reasons, I'd love to recommend everyone consider lemons as their favorite food."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this into a haiku including all pertinent information.

Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza, which stands 481 feet (147 meters) high, is the world's tallest pyramid. But the world's largest pyramid lies half a world away in Cholula, Mexico. Tlachihualtepetl, or the Great Pyramid of Cholula, is about 217 feet (66 meters) tall with a base of 1,476 by 1,476 feet (450 by 450 meters). The pyramid boasts a total volume of 157 million cubic feet (4.45 million cubic meters). This is almost twice that of the Great Pyramid of Giza. Historians believe the massive monument was built in several stages from 300 BC to 700 AD. The temple built above the pyramid served as a center of worship for Quetzalcoatl. He was the Aztec god of learning and books. But the temple was abandoned around the 8th or 9th century AD. As years passed, the pyramid was covered by lush vegetation. The structure blended in so well with the nearby hills and mountains that the Spaniards, who conquered Mexico in 1521, mistook it for a natural hill. They destroyed the temple on its summit and replaced it with a colonial church. The pyramid only came to light in the 1930s when the dirt started to fall away. Since then, archeologists have excavated many of the pyramid's stairways, platforms, and altars. They have also dug over five miles of tunnels in and around the pyramid.

He was quite passionate about speed, constantly daring his friends of every species to race with him. “But you’re a dog!” Everyone would say as they teased Rover, “You know, only humans can drive, right?” Rover, however, was determined. He would search the city all night, looking for broken-down cars to fix up. Once he could find one, he got to work, and in a few days, he had a moving car of his own, and the entire city was shocked!

Obstacles in meditation are not a problem, they are the path to finding freedom amidst it all. – Jack Kornfield No matter what form of meditation we practice, sooner or later inner obstacles will arise. They arise naturally when we stop our busy lives and bring attention to our inner experience. On first becoming quiet we will can encounter the unfinished business we carry. There may be untended longings, unacknowledged grief, unrequited hopes, unexpressed love or our underlying fears and hurts. And as we get quieter still we can find ourselves facing the mystery of our own mortality, of death. In all spiritual traditions as attention is given to these problems, our understanding and compassion deepens, for it is through these that the path often unfolds. As my teacher Ajahn Chah used to say, “Where do you learn the most, when times are easy or when times are hard?” In the Christian mystical tradition, The Dark Night of the Soul by St. John of the Cross talks about the periods of loneliness, fear, and doubt that one goes through after the initial awakenings into the light. Evagrius, a fourth-century Christian monk who lived in the Egyptian desert with the Christian Desert Fathers wrote a text describing the demons that come to people who go into the desert to undertake a meditation practice. These include the demons of pride, the demons of fear, the demons of lust, the noonday demon of laziness and so forth. In Zen, there are descriptions of further kinds of obstacles that arise in intense meditation. Practitioners might experience makyo. These are hallucinations involving vision, hearing, smell, or other senses. How does one understand and work with these difficulties? Buddhist teachings say begin right where you are, with the most common hindrances such as physical pain and restlessness, anger, doubt and fear. Instead of resisting or trying to get rid of them, which usually keeps them stuck, you can name and acknowledge them kindly and surround them with mindfulness and compassion. Make space for them and soften around them. Breathe and become a loving witness. Invite them to open and show you their dance. As you let them open without resistance, they soften or disperse or transform into other energies. But not always. Sometimes they become quite intense for a time, but without resistance and a patient curiosity they will eventually change. They always do. And with this practice you learn a deep trust. You find that awareness can hold it all. You become the spacious awareness itself. Then as meditation deepens beyond the everyday level, even the more extreme, delightful or terrifying energies, visions, mental states, and difficulties become workable. To find freedom requires a steadying of the heart, a trust in attention, a willingness to be present for it all. Like the sign in a Las Vegas casino that says, “You must be present to win”, the very obstacles that arise become your place to awaken.","completion":"Obstacles we encounter when trying to better ourselves and our mindset are not a problem; they are a path to finding freedom. Sooner or later, we will encounter obstacles in therapy, self-reflection, or while trying to stay in the present moment of our lives. Obstacles are bound to arise when we try to slow down our busy lives and think more critically about ourselves and our inner experience. We might discover some unfinished business our thoughts wander to. We might feel longing, grief, unexpressed love, underlying fear and hurt, or unrequited hopes. And when we really stop to analyze what is going on in our thoughts, we may even face the mystery of our own mortality. Anxious thoughts about death may be buried in there. But as we deepen our attention to these aspects of our thoughts, our understanding and compassion for ourselves and others can deepen, too. We forget we can learn the most from something that was hard, rather than something that was easy. When we begin a journey of therapy or deep self-reflection to heal the wounds in our minds, it is not uncommon for loneliness, fear, and doubt to emerge. We may also be forced to confront our pride, lust, laziness, and so on. Instead of resisting those feelings and moods or being surprised when they occur, we can name and acknowledge what they are in a kind way and look at them both objectively for what they are and also with compassion. Witness them, rather than feeling like you have to be subject to their will. If you don't encounter them with resistance, your mind and body can relax and the thoughts and feelings may begin to disperse. In this process, you are shifting your mindset from one that feels afflicted by these thoughts and emotions to one that looks at them more objectively, like studying clouds and watching them pass by. Sometimes, the emotions are very intense, and we won't make progress over night. But with diligent patience and curiosity, change will eventually happen. What you are really doing in this process is learning trust. You are trusting that these feelings can arise and that it is going to be okay. You are becoming more skillful about what thoughts and emotions drive your actions and mood, and which ones don't need to, including the most extreme, delightful, and terrifying thoughts. In confronting the wounds of our mind and lives, we also discover freedom. But to do so, we must trust the process, remain patient, and be willing to investigate the deepest darkest parts of our mind. They can only be healed if we learn to look at and work with them."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this to be more urgent and brief How does the UK(specifically NI) treat outstanding loans during a divorce?

Except when you're in trouble; having someone by your side can make a world of difference, especially if you're choking on a piece of food. Dinner was going to be in 20 minutes and my parents were expecting me. Entertaining as Angela was, I decided to say \\"hi\\" very quickly and head to the front door so I could avoid her as much as I could.

Authorities are searching for a Tennessee woman who has been missing for weeks after allegedly setting off on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, who was accused of punching her earlier this month, in a case that chillingly echoes the 2021 disappearance of Gabby Petito. Nikki Michelle Alcaraz, 33, also known as Nikki Cunningham, was last seen on surveillance footage Saturday while she sold a phone at a cash machine in California, where she allegedly traveled with her boyfriend, Steven Tyler Stratton, according to information provided by the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office and District Attorney General Ray Crouch of Cheatham County, Tennessee. Alcaraz was captured on footage selling her phone at an EcoATM at a Walmart store in Redding, California, according to images provided by Crouch. She appears to be dressed in a red shirt while a man in a black hat and shirt stands nearby. That came a little more than three weeks after a witness told investigators with the Torrance County Sheriff's Office in New Mexico of seeing Stratton punch Alcaraz in the face, according to the incident report obtained by NBC News. Alcarez told police that both she and Stratton were drinking and that he \\"started to hit her for no reason\\" while they were driving during the May 4 incident. The investigator — who encountered the pair at a rest stop — said he saw \\"red marks on her face and fingerprint marks on both arms,\\" and wrote that Alcaraz \\"also stated that she had a bruise on her chest and her back.\\" The investigator later determined that \\"the bruise on Ms. Alcaraz’s arms came from Mr. Stratton holding her down to avoid being hit.\\" Stratton told police that Alcaraz \\"hit him in the mouth for no reason\\" and continued hitting him as they were driving. He told the investigator he did not want her to go to jail, that both had been drinking and that the pair had been traveling to California. Investigators determined “both parties were mutual combatants while traveling down the interstate.” Officials drove Alcaraz and Stratton away from the scene separately. Both Alcarez and Stratton were drunk and neither would admit to driving the car, according to the incident report. Alcarez originally told police that she wanted to press charges, but both she and Stratton later said they did not want to press charges. A photo on the flyer shared by the Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office noting Alcaraz's disappearance appears to feature her with a black eye. It is unclear when that image was taken. The flyer also states that “due to history of domestic assault, we believe she is in danger.\\" Representatives from the Torrance County Sheriff’s Office and the Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office could not immediately be reached for additional comment. After the alleged assault, officials with the sheriff's office dropped Alcaraz off in the town of Moriarty, New Mexico, a town about 40 miles east of Albuquerque, where a family friend was supposed to pick her up, according to ABC affiliate WKRN of Nashville, citing her sister, Toni Alcaraz. She said her sister called her after she had been dropped off, describing her as \\"crying and upset.\\" \\"Her eye was already turning black and you could tell she was beat up pretty bad,” Toni Alcaraz added. Those details of the case, among others, echo the disappearance of Gabby Petito, 22, whose family reported her missing in 2021 after she left for a cross-country road trip with her fiancé, Brian Laundrie. Petito's remains were found at a Wyoming campground that September, and the manner of death was ruled a homicide, according to the FBI. Laundrie’s body was found in Florida a month after Petito's remains had been discovered. Laundrie, who died of a self-inflicted gunshot wound, left notes saying he was responsible for Petito’s death, officials have said. Less than a month before Petito's family reported her missing, Utah police responded to a physical altercation between her and Laundrie. The officer wrote that Petito slapped Laundrie after an argument and that neither wanted to press charges. But a subsequent independent review determined that police misclassified the incident — which investigators should have ruled domestic violence, with Petito as the perpetrator — and left out details about injuries Petito appeared to have suffered.","completion":"Authorities are searching for a Tennessee woman who has been missing for weeks after allegedly setting off on a cross-country trip with her boyfriend, who was accused of punching her earlier this month, in a case that chillingly echoes a 2021 disappearance.

Kosovo has been expelled from participating in an ongoing American-led military exercise in Europe. Police and Nato troops clashed with Serb protesters in Zvecan, north Kosovo, on Monday.

However, something inspires me to run out into the rain as I jump into puddles and find simple happiness from the rain that I haven't had in a while. I look down, though, and realize my clothes have become a mess; no doubt I'll be spending extra time cleaning them because something must always go wrong. Though, I am so fortunate and glad that I have access to a washer & dryer, the convenience of clean clothes right from my own home! Trudging through the rain and getting wet, my despair grows as my stomach growls in weakness, signs that I'm starving. And as luck would have it, I find a burger restaurant on the way home and eagerly jump inside for warmth and food! I'm worn down by the prices, though; it figures that everything has become so expensive these days, and my pockets have such little to pay with.

Courgettes. Courgettes are an easy vegetable to grow at home. Start by planting in late May using the well-prepared ground. You should find that just one or two plants are enough to grow to produce for several weeks. 2. Beetroot. Beetroot is a popular thing to grow in England. You can plant beetroot from late April all the way through July. Sow beetroot seeds about 5cm apart, and be sure to remove roots that are only half-grown to avoid them interfering with the rest. You don't have to waste these half-grown roots, as they can be used in small salads. 3. Chillies. Chilies pack a flavourful punch and are great to grow at home. Start by researching chilies that are a good flavor and heat for you. Simply plant them in a large tough and use a can to support the chilies as they grow. Once you have enough, you can also store them for a long time. 4. Dwarf french beans. To grow Dwarf french beans, plant in either open ground or a container. These beans should be planted from mid-May to early August. You don't need to support this crop, so they are pretty low maintenance. You should bear produce in around 3-4 weeks, so maintain a planting schedule every three weeks to ensure you never run out. 5. Potatoes. Potatoes grow really easily in just a large pot or alternatively can be grown just as well in a large compost bag. It is as easy as adding potato seeds to a layer of compost and covering it with more compost. From there, just wait for leaves to appear, which you must cover again with more compost. 6. Strawberries. Strawberries are extremely low maintenance, with a single crop growing fresh strawberries for up to 4 years. All you need to do is a small clean-up of the plant each spring. 7. Radish. Radishes are one of the best and easiest crops to grow at home. Radishes grow extremely quickly, too, which is a great way to start growing at home before moving on to higher-maintenance produce."},{"prompt":"What are the conditions on the surface of Jupiter?","completion":"Jupiter doesn't have a surface like we do on Earth.

All he could see was the brightest shade of white he had ever seen, and it was surrounding him. All four walls were white and even the chair he was strapped to was hard to look at, although he knew he had to. Looking down at his wrists in front of him, he could see the knot cinching his hands together. Although he could not remember who he was, this knot was familiar. And it was poorly executed. He could not believe how bad someone could be at their job in such a serious circumstance. There is no such thing as unskilled labor, he thought, but his kidnapper may be better off doing literally anything else. He could not remember where he leaned this knot, or, more importantly, how to get out of it. In fact, he seemingly had no memory of anything. Unfortunately, this included his identity. However, he could have been a real piece of work and forgetting himself could be a good thing. A silent grin broke on his face before regaining a sense of urgency. The puzzle of his identity could be solved later, but not if he remained captive. Loosening the terrible not with ease, he almost felt bad for the person who tied it. Likely this person would get fired from their kidnapping job similar to how they would probably get fired from any job. On his feet, he looked around and saw a hidden door - or a door that was supposed to be hidden, rather. “Surely they didn’t leave it unlocked, right?” he thought to himself before twisting the doorknob. As soon as the door creaked, he hung his head as a brief moment of extreme disappointment came over him. “Surely I was not that important, if this is the type of crew that was sent after me.” Another wave of disappointment came as he realized the long corridors were empty. No one is even guarding the place, he thought. at least, this seemed true until an armed guard came around the corner and raised his gun towards the captive without hesitation. An explosion thundered through the vacant halls, and the guard dropped. A new figure appeared.

How are you doing? How was your day? Teenager: I am fine, Mom. I mostly spent my day playing online games with my buddies. Parent: That's awesome! So, how do you feel about online gaming? Is it a good use of your time? Teenager: Yeah, I love it! It's a blast hanging out with my friends and challenging myself. Parent: True, true. But what about spending so much time gaming? Don't you think it's important to have other hobbies and interests too? Teenager: Yeah, I guess so. But it's not like I'm gaming 24/7. I still do my homework and hang out with the family. Parent: That's good to know. Just remember, finding a balance is important. Remember to take care of other areas of your life too. Teenager: Yeah, I get it. It's tough when all my buddies are into the same games, and I don't want to miss out on the fun. Parent: I understand where you're coming from. But it's important to set some boundaries and not let other important things slide. Teenager: Yeah, you're right. I'll try to find a better balance. Parent: That's all I ask for.

Mention that New Hampshire's state capital and Interstate 93 can be found at the end of the highway. Each exit should have its own paragraph and include an interesting detail or two about the exit.","completion":"If you have finished taking in the beauty of Vermont's Green Mountains and want to next visit New Hampshire's state capital of Concord, then traveling southbound on Interstate 89 across the Connecticut River is the ideal way to go. It is a straight shot that involves passing by 20 exits during an approximately 1-hour drive. Here are 7 exits you may want to visit along the way: Exit 20 is for West Lebanon, Plainfield, and Claremont and is very popular with tourists due to its retail hub. Best Buy, Chili's, Shaw's Supermarket, Kohls? They are all here! Exit 19 takes you to \\"The Miracle Mile\\" in Lebanon if you make a left off of the exit. The Miracle Mile has a Price Chopper supermarket and is the home of Timken Aerospace, which manufactures precision parts (such as ball bearings) for many leading aerospace companies. Exit 18 takes you to either Hanover or Lebanon. Lebanon was devastated by a major fire in 1964 but has managed to recover nicely. Hanover is the home of the well-known Ivy League school Dartmouth College and has some very upscale dining choices such as The Hanover Inn. Exit 17 brings you to either Enfield, Canaan, or Lebanon. Canaan is best known for the Canaan Motor Club, which has a popular auto racetrack. Exit 16 displays the non-existent town name of Purmort, but most tourists know the exit as the way to get to the Whaleback ski area, which has 30 trails. Exit 12A mentions Georges Mill and Springfield, but most people use this exit to get to Lake Sunapee, which is very busy during the summer. Lake Sunapee is where Steven Tyler and Joe Perry first met; they took their eventual Aerosmith band idea to Boston, and the rest as they say is rock and roll history! Exit 9 takes you to either Warner or Bradford, but it is a great place to unwind! Immediately off of the exit, you will find a few fast food places such as McDonald's as well as a Market Basket supermarket. Please note that at the end, 89 South gives you the option of going southbound on Interstate 93 toward Manchester and Boston or northbound on Interstate 93 toward Concord."},{"prompt":"I have to host Thanksgiving this year, and I'm nervous. Please tell me how to roast a turkey, and use asterisks. I bought an 18 pound turkey.","completion":"* Get your oven ready by positioning the rack inside as low as possible so it can fit your roasting pan. Preheat the oven to 325 degrees. * Check to see if your turkey has the neck and giblets inside. Sometimes they are in a bag, and sometimes they are loose. Take them out and discard them. * Rinse your turkey off in an empty sink, making sure to get between the leg/wing crevices. Pat dry with paper towels when you’re done, and throw away the paper towels. * In a roasting pan that has a rack placed inside, position the turkey breast-side up. * Melt a stick of butter in the microwave for 20 seconds. Make sure it’s not too hot, then spread the butter all over the turkey’s skin. Follow by generously using salt and pepper over the buttery areas. * Pour two cups of turkey stock (or vegetable stock if you don’t have turkey stock) into the pan. If your roasting pan has a lid, put it into place. If not, tent the pan with aluminum foil. * For an 18-pound turkey, roast it for approximately 4 hours in the oven. Baste it with juices from the pan every half hour or so. If juices evaporate, pour more stock into the pan. * During the cooking process, use a thermometer to check the temperature of the turkey. Do this by sticking the thermometer into the innermost part of the thigh, followed by the thickest part of the breast, and make sure it’s reading 165 degrees or more. Check the temperature around the halfway point, and also around the 3-hour, 30-minute mark. * You can optionally keep the pan uncovered for the final hour of roasting but continue to baste. * Carefully remove the roasting pan from the oven using roasting mitts. Observe by cutting open the breast, that the meat is no longer pink nor gummy in texture. * Place the turkey onto a platter, garnish if you desire, and carve it after approximately 20-30 minutes."},{"prompt":"Can you tell me what year Apocalypse Now was released?","completion":"I can tell you that Apocalypse Now came out in 1979.

Please don’t suggest anything that has to do with me purchasing expensive equipment. Give me tips to learn quickly without spending too much time practicing.","completion":"Sure! Here are some easy tips for you as a beginner musician to learn faster and rock out you guitar goals: 1. Get Chewing: Research has found that chewing gum can enhance cognitive function and improve focus, which makes it an ideal aid for practicing guitar. So, grab a stick of your favorite flavor and start shredding those notes! 2. Keep on Achieving: Set achievable goals for yourself and keep track of your progress. It's easier to stay motivated and focused when you can see how far you've come. Practice those beginner chords until you can play them smoothly and move on to more advanced techniques with time. 3. Know Your Chronotype and Practice Accordingly: Are you a morning person or a night owl? Knowing your chronotype can help you schedule guitar practice at optimal times for maximum productivity. Reserve the times of the day when you feel most alert and energized to practice guitar and watch your skills soar. 4. Take a Nap with Music: Did you know that listening to music while napping can aid in memory retention? So, why not try it out while learning guitar? Play some guitar music softly in the background while you nap and give your brain a rest as it processes the new information. 5. Meditate for Mastery: Meditation has been proven to increase focus and reduce anxiety. Before picking up your guitar, take a few moments to meditate and clear your mind. The focus gained from this practice will make playing guitar a breeze. 6. Create the Ideal Environment: Learning guitar can be more challenging in a noisy or cluttered environment. Optimize your learning surroundings by practicing in a quiet and organized space with good lighting. You can then focus solely on learning without distractions. 7. Hit the Gym: Believe it or not, working out regularly can enhance your guitar-playing abilities! Utilize exercises that improve finger strength and dexterity, such as grip trainers and wrist curls. Physical training outside of guitar lessons can also improve focus and cognitive functioning, leading to quicker learning."},{"prompt":"Write a poem that explains dialogue for fiction.

Be sure to highlight the feelings of dreariness and hopelessness of staying within solitary confinement, and also highlight how the experience mentally affects the person placed there.","completion":"I was sentenced to life in prison at ADX Florence in Colorado for attempted murder. I don't dispute my conviction or my sentence, but I do object to the inhumane conditions I've endured here at the penitentiary. On three separate occasions, I was sent to solitary confinement for having contraband (ramen) in my cell. Each time I was caught, two guards confiscated the ramen and physically escorted me to a 6-foot by 9-foot windowless cement cell containing a bed pad and a toilet. I was told each infraction for contraband would result in 24 hours in these solitary confinement cells. My experience within these cells can only be described as a living nightmare, one that I never, ever want to be a part of again. Inside the cell, you realize very quickly either how very large your body is or how very small your surroundings are, so much so that having claustrophobia (which I do) can already cause severe anxiety. Adding on to this is the fact that you are unable to tell time in a windowless environment; it's like being in a casino, but instead of having fun you're alone with the deafening silence, unable to tell how much time you have left in the 24 hours you're required to stay inside. To top it all off, the toilet in the cell I was in would repeatedly break and not flush, so the smell of feces and urine lingered constantly in the cell. I asked several of my inmate peers who were also required to stay in solitary confinement if their toilets worked, and every one of them reported that their toilets could not flush. I'm very scared to go back into solitary confinement, so much so that I often find myself starving for the lack of ramen in my cell and the sparse food they give you during your stay here. I'd rather die of starvation than go back to that cell."},{"prompt":"I need to write a bio for my online dating profile and really need help! I have no idea what to say.

She wrote about food for New York Magazine for five years. Then from 1976 to 1983, she was the food and restaurant critic for The New York Times. She was the first woman to review restaurants for that paper. Her verdicts were reputed to have the power to make or break new restaurants, and she often dressed in disguise to make sure she got the treatment of a regular diner. Over one 11-month period, she tasted everything in the Bloomingdale's food department, 1,961 items. It was the subject of one of her best-known articles. Sheraton wrote 16 books, including cookbooks and a memoir. When she became food critic for Time magazine in 1984, she broadened her focus to national and international eating trends.

List them as bullet-points: Does that sound prosaic to you? But it is what works best and is the safest way to clean teeth at home. The fact is, many stains go away if you brush regularly. Maybe not on the first day, but twice a day for a month, and you begin to notice a change. Toothpaste brands such as Crest3D and Colgate Max White are exceptionally good at removing stains that are not too deep. The brushing technique matters and the proven way is to brush up and down as well as with a sideways motion. The plaque is sticky and does not move easily. Brush twice a day, no more. Too much would see you losing enamel. Brush the back of the teeth as well. Most ignore this area, resulting in dark stains that spread gradually to the front. Use floss for cleaning dentures between teeth. Flossing is hard, but it saves teeth.","completion":"• Brands such as Colgate Max or Cres3D are notable for removing stains from teeth that aren't too deep. • Brushing up and down is just as important as brushing sideways to remove plaque efficiently. • Do not brush more than twice a day, your teeth will lose enamel otherwise. • Though difficult, flossing consistently is a good way to preserve teeth."}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},z={key:1};function L(n,e,h,m,i,s){const p=y("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),f(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>i.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,i.searchQuery]]),i.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>i.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",j,' No results found for "'+d(i.searchQuery)+'".
