Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. If heat is not trapped by our planet, it means that the greenhouse gases are not retaining heat effectively within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to a decrease in global warming. Greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, are responsible for trapping the sun's heat within the Earth's atmosphere. If these gases are less effective, then there would be less heat retained, thereby reducing the overall global temperature and the effects of global warming. When less heat is trapped, it leads to a cooler planet, which in turn can help to alleviate some of the negative consequences associated with global warming, such as melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events, among others. However, this does not mean that we should rely on this possibility to mitigate the effects of global warming.

UPDATED:. 12:13 EST, 8 November 2012. A microlight pilot killed minutes into his first solo flight had had no formal training, air accident investigators reported today. Adrian Paterson, 49, from Clackmannan, Scotland, died when his craft plunged to the ground, probably after stalling following a steep climb, the Department for Transport's air accident investigation branch (AAIB) has revealed. The investigation concluded the crash, in which he is believed to have plummeted up to 300ft in his Gernini Flash IIA, happened because Mr Paterson had attempted a solo flight without the required training. The scene: Adrian Paterson, 49, from Clackmannan, Scotland, died when his craft plunged to the ground, probably after stalling following a steep climb. The investigation concluded the crash happened because Mr Paterson had attempted a solo flight without the required training. Microlight pilots are required to hold a licence that takes a minimum of 25 flight hours to achieve. The crash, in a field in the Carse of Clackmannan near Kennet on April 12, happened after Mr Paterson took off, leaving two friends on the ground. One of them was an experienced microlight pilot, although not an instructor, who helped taxi the aircraft into position. The AAIB said Mr Paterson had bought the microlight last autumn, but the Civil Aviation Authority was not notified and it was deregistered in December. The 23-year-old aircraft was in good condition, despite not having been officially inspected for three years. The AAIB also found no record of Mr Paterson taking a formal flying training course and he did not have the required medical declaration for flying a microlight. The AAIB said: 'There was some anecdotal evidence that the owner had taken lessons, but the provider was not traced and it is not known how many lessons were undertaken or if the person delivering them was a| qualified instructor.' Mr Paterson was also not a member of a microlight club. The AAIB said he may have had 'only limited experience of flying as a passenger'. He had flown in another microlight before buying his own, but had not operated the controls. The AAIB report stated: 'Immediately after takeoff, the weight-shift microlight entered a steep climb. 'The nose then dropped (probably as a result of a stall) and the aircraft struck the ground in a steep nose-down attitude. 'It is probable that the owner did not vise the correct takeoff technique and allowed the wing to remain in a high angle of attack. 'The rapid nose drop probably occurred as the result of a stall, which may have been exacerbated by the reduction in power. 'The resulting nose-down attitude, with the possible subsequent addition of power so close to the ground, would have made recovery difficult.' The investigation also found no ballast on the rear seat, which is recommended by the aircraft manufacturer when the micro-light is flown solo. The report said a post-mortem examination found Mr Paterson died of multiple injuries, but there was no evidence of drugs, alcohol or natural disease. An ambulance spokesman said at the time of crash: 'Paramedics at the scene estimated that the microlight had come down from a height of between 200ft to 300ft.'","completion":"A fatal crash involving a microlight pilot in Scotland has been attributed to the lack of formal training of the pilot, Adrian Paterson.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Wash each quince in cool water. Stem and core the fruit and cut each one into chunks. Leave the peel intact. Place the pieces in a large soup pot or stew pot. Add enough water to cover all of the pieces by about an inch. Bring the water to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook the quinces for 45 minutes or so, until the pieces are soft. To test whether the quince pieces are done, poke them with a fork. If the fork slides in easily, the quince is ready. Overcooking the quince will affect the flavor, so make sure it is simmering, not boiling, as it cooks. Use a potato masher to mash the quince into pulp, leaving no large lumps. The mashed quince should be slightly runny, like loose applesauce. Add a little water if it seems too thick. Set out a large bowl. Place a mesh strainer over it, and cover the strainer with a large piece of cheesecloth. Pour the quince pulp into the cloth-covered strainer. The juice will begin to run into to the bowl, while the pulp stays in the cloth. Let the pulp strain for about 4 hours. Check the juice in the bowl every so often.

Given the question: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Two neighboring towns had different demographics.

Groups of about a dozen students each, led by an experienced guide, will go on ten-day camping trips to the mountains to study the plants and animals that grow and live there. Students carry their own things, which includes sleeping bags, warm clothing, food and water, and other useful tools. And what do the students do all day? Well, as soon as the sun comes up, they eat breakfast and start climbing up the mountain trail to the next campground, which is five to ten miles away. As the students take notes, the guide points out different plants and animals alongside the trail. The climb is usually over by early afternoon, so the group spends the rest of the day resting or swimming in a mountain lake. Before dinner each night, they all come together and discuss the day's activities. At the end of the course, the students write reports using the information they have collected. But they don't mind at all. What they do mind is leaving the beauty of the wilderness and the good friends they've made to return to their normal lives in the city.

Each day, students cover a distance between five to ten miles.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answer the question \\"Were any of Tocqueville's books written while he was active in french politics?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Yes\\" correctly answers the question \\"Were any of Tocqueville's books written while he was active in French politics?\\" Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Tocqueville was active in French politics during the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and the Second Republic (1849-1851). His book Democracy in America had its first volume published in 1835, followed by the second volume in 1840. These publications occurred during his active political life under the July Monarchy.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ottawa takes 1st steps to offer cable choice Heritage Minister Shelly Glover has taken the first steps toward meeting a Conservative throne speech promise to provide more choice for Canadian cable customers. In an announcement Thursday in Vancouver, she said the federal government has asked the broadcast regulator to prepare a report on how pick-and-pay television service might work and what steps might have to be taken to unbundle TV services. “We are convinced that this is something that Canadian consumers want,” Glover said. “We want to give them choice and we have indicated very clearly that we will require television channels to be unbundled.” The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission has until April 30 to deliver a report to the minister, who was appointed in July as former heritage minister James Moore moved into the industry portfolio. While most cable providers offer a range of packages with stations bundled together, Vidéotron, Bell and Rogers also offer consumers the option of selecting individual stations to bundle with their basic package. Louis Audet, CEO of Montreal-based cable distributor Cogeco, said the industry is a “full and willing participant” in the process to change how TV is distributed in Canada. “This is a totally normal evolution,” Audet said in an interview with CBC-TV’s Lang & O’Leary Exchange. “We’ve been battling with our program suppliers now for two years to bring more freedom to be able to meet our customer’s demands, which is for more targeted smaller packages.” He said the cable and satellite providers entered arbitration at the CRTC to ask for the freedom to provide a pay-per-channel option. In October, the CRTC announced a new consultation with Canadian consumers, asking what they like and don’t like about their TV service and TV content. Next spring the broadcasters will weigh in and the distributors will also have a chance to comment. One of the big questions is how to meet cultural objectives that are part of the CRTC’s mandate, Audet said. “There is a cultural policy in this country that forces distributors to carry and package channels in a certain manner. It remains to be seen further to the dialogue the CRTC has undertaken with the population on Oct. 24 ... how the cultural policy of this country evolves and as a result of that, through negotiation with program suppliers we’ll see what we are able to do,” he said. Glover said Ottawa has asked the CRTC to determine any costs consumers might face because of unbundling of TV service. It also wants to figure out whether ethnic and specialty channels could survive. Audet said he expects the industry to find ways to integrate video-streaming services such as Netflix into their offerings. Cogeco’s U.S. unit is experimenting with Tivo, a set-top device that allows streaming from the internet, live and on-demand video, as well as broadcast options. “A number of people have seen Netflix as an enemy of cable distributors. We rather see it as a complement to the complete offering of cable distributors,” he said, adding that Cogeco is testing a platform similar to Tivo for the Canadian market. Summary:","completion":"Okay kiddo, so you know how when you want to watch your favorite cartoons on TV, we have to subscribe to a lot of channels, many of which we don't watch?

This lady named Shelly Glover, who works for the government, is helping make this happen. She's asked some important people to figure out how this might work. But it's not that simple. They have to think about how this may affect other things, like channels that show shows from different cultures, and the cost it may mean for us, the viewers. There's also talk of adding services like Netflix to our TV. So instead of using a different device to watch Netflix, we could watch it right on our TV along with regular channels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Possible A: mountains, arctic tundra, great outdoors, open meadow, city Why is \\"great outdoors\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The term \\"great outdoors\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it broadly encapsulates various natural environments where one can hike and potentially encounter foxes. As a more generalized term, it highlights the natural beauty, freedom, and adventure usually associated with open-air spaces, making it a reasonable answer to the question. Let's examine each of the suggested answers more closely: 1. Mountains: A specific location, mountains are indeed a place one can enjoy a hike and may encounter a fox. However, it might not cover every possibility, as foxes inhabit various terrains beyond mountains. 2. Arctic Tundra: Another specific location, the Arctic Tundra refers to the colder regions of Earth where certain species of foxes, like the Arctic fox, can be found. However, not every fox species occupies this type of terrain, and it narrows the range of possibilities, as opposed to a more generalized answer like the great outdoors. 3. Great Outdoors: As mentioned earlier, this term is more aligned with human common sense because it covers multiple types of terrain, including forests, meadows, fields, mountains, and many other natural settings where you can hike and encounter foxes. The great outdoors can be encountered in various locations around the world, making opportunities for hiking and fox encounters more widespread and accessible. 4. Open Meadow: An open meadow is a particular type of landscape where one may hike and possibly spot a fox, but it limits the range of possibilities for the setting, as foxes can inhabit other types of landscapes as well. 5. City: While it is possible to spot a fox in a city, this answer is less likely to be aligned with human common sense, as fox encounters are rarer in urban areas, and cities typically do not provide ideal hiking opportunities when compared to the great outdoors. In conclusion, \\"great outdoors\\" is an answer that resonates with human common sense because it acknowledges the broad range of natural environments where people can enjoy a hike and encounter various species of foxes. It evokes the essence of outdoor exploration, and as a human-compatible AI, it is a suitable answer because it relies on the essence of what humans appreciate about outdoor experiences and wildlife sightings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We do this by subtracting 73 from both sides: -12 * f = 169 - 73 Now we subtract: 169 - 73 = 96 So the equation is: -12 * f = 96 Now, we need to find the value of 'f'.

One day, a secret government organization called FairyT.I.A. (Fairy Tale Investigation Agency) discovers the swamp, which is rumored to be an untapped source of magical energy. Act 2: FairyT.I.A. sends agents to explore and seize control of the swamp, disrupting the tranquility of Shrek's daily life. Shocked by their intrusion, Shrek sets out on a journey to save his home, enlisting the help of his old friend, Donkey, a likable and talkative animal companion.

No. It is not valid to assume that Kendall is \\"trying to cause Lee pain\\" just based on the information provided. Although it is mentioned that Kendall stretched Lee's legs as part of the yoga lesson, there is no clear indication of any intent to cause harm or pain. Yoga is an ancient practice involving physical, mental, and spiritual aspects that help maintain balance and promote overall well-being. One of its key components is stretching, which is essential in increasing flexibility, promoting relaxation, and enhancing muscle strength. It is common for yoga teachers or practitioners to assist others in performing various stretches to help them achieve the right posture and level of flexibility. This assistance can be seen as a supportive act rather than a harmful one, as the main goal is to help the individual progress in their practice, reduce the risk of injuries, and provide a safe and fulfilling yoga experience.

It is a neutral description of a category of movies. To determine the sentiment, we need to understand the context in which the phrase \\"cult film\\" is used. A cult film is a movie that has acquired a dedicated and passionate fan base, often characterized by its unconventional or controversial content, style, or theme. These films may not have performed well at the box office or received outstanding critical acclaim, but they have gained a devoted following over time. Cult films often resonate with people on a personal level, addressing niche interests and connecting with subcultures that mainstream cinema might overlook. There are various reasons why a movie may be considered a cult film, such as: 1. Unique or provocative subject matter that appeals to a specific audience. 2. The presence of unpopular, controversial, or subversive themes. 3. A distinctive visual or narrative style that sets it apart from mainstream cinema. 4. A heavily quotable or memorable script. 5. A connection with a particular subculture or countercultural movement. Examples of cult films include \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show,\\" \\"Eraserhead,\\" \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" and \\"Donnie Darko,\\" among many others. The sentiment of the phrase \\"cult film\\" may lean towards positive or negative depending on one's perspective and the specific film being referred to. Some might view cult films positively, emphasizing their creativity, originality, and the dedicated fan base they inspire. Others could see them as negative, focusing on the controversial or subversive aspects that might not resonate with mainstream audiences.

Write a title for this article: The Thrift Savings Plan is preparing to extend its services to participants by reaching out to them about important decisions for their retirement savings, maybe to the point of providing financial advice. A plan outlined at a meeting Monday of the TSP’s governing board would represent a significant shift from the program’s traditional approach of having direct personal contact only with those investors who initiate it, such as to transfer money among investment funds or to withdraw it. “Right now we are built to facilitate transactions. What we are not built to do is engage in conversations around goals,” TSP Executive Director Gregory T. Long told the board. [Treasury again tapping TSP federal retirement fund for debt ceiling relief] Currently, personal contact is “only reactive,” he said. “We have an opportunity to provide a different type of service, something that is more consultative . . . Our participants are asking for and need a greater level of engagement from us.” The TSP is the largest 401(k)-type plan in the country, as of April holding 454 billion in assets for 4.7 million current and former federal employees and military personnel. Long said the transformation likely would take five years or more, and some elements would need approval from the governing board or changes in law. For example, it includes an assumption that the TSP will open an investment “window” through which account holders could direct money to investment funds other than those the TSP itself offers. The TSP has had that authority for years but only recently moved toward carrying it out. A formal recommendation to the board is planned for the upcoming months, although even if approved such an option likely could not be made available until 2017. Another issue ahead, Long said, is the “very meaningful and important line between consultation and advice. Where you cross the line is when you say what someone should do. Are we thinking about it? Absolutely.” Individual attention “is something that really drives participants to action,” said Renee C. Wilder, director of enterprise planning. “It gives them some comfort for making retirement decisions. They are looking for someone to help them plan for their retirement.” Such services could include contact initiated by the TSP, including by phone, at key career points including at hiring, one year later, on moving to another agency or on entering or leaving Reserve service, on reaching certain ages, and at retirement. Other opportunities would arise when an investor contacts the TSP about taking a financial hardship-based withdrawal or transferring an account to an IRA after retirement. While the TSP provides information in printed form and at www.tsp.gov, “the reality is that not everyone is going to absorb information in that way,” Long said. “We want to take advantage of life moments when you’re receptive to information.” “Our phone reps are doing exactly what we are asking them to do, transaction support,” he added. “What I’m advocating here is a different posture for our one on one conversations.” As a step in that direction, the TSP recently began soliciting phone numbers and e-mail addresses from those who check their accounts online. Other planned steps include simplifying and driving online current paper-based transactions such as designations of beneficiaries, as well as improving the online calculator features. Expanding withdrawal options is also on the list, for example to allow more than one partial withdrawal. “What we’re focused on is building a long-term strategic plan for the organization,” said board chairman Michael Kennedy, a managing director in the Atlanta office of Korn/Ferry International. “We still have a way to go from the customer service aspect. We have come a long way over the last year but we certainly have a way to go.” One telling statistic, officials said, is that 55 percent of investors who leave government for retirement or other reasons transfer their money out of the TSP within a year. In many cases they may not even know they can leave their money in the TSP, and they may not realize the TSP has exceptionally low administrative fees for the investment industry, officials said. A note of caution was sounded by Jacqueline Simon, public policy director of the American Federation of Government Employees, a member of an advisory board of employee organizations also at the meeting. She said that participants might reject phone contacts out of fear of fraud. “Federal employees are constant targets and I think a lot of our members will be very wary of someone calling saying they’re from the TSP—‘I’m not falling for this.’ A lot of these ideas will have you seem like a marketer,” she told Long. Long said that phone contact would be just one aspect; another would be pop-ups when investors are making certain transactions online asking them if they are aware of the consequences and if they would like to engage in an online chat. Also, some of those concerns would be eased if the TSP established a more personal relationship with investors, he said. Referring to those who transfer their TSP accounts rather than keeping them open, he said, “The way I see it is that 55 percent of people are firing us. You fire people you don’t know.”","completion":"\\"Thrift Savings Plan: Advancing Towards Personalized Retirement Savings Support and Consultation\\" In a significant shift from its traditional reactive approach, the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP), America's largest 401(k)-type plan, is planning to proactively engage with investors about crucial retirement savings decisions. Rather than waiting for investors to initiate contact for transactions such as fund transfers or withdrawals, the TSP team seeks to help guide the investors' journey to achieving their financial goals. Bearing in mind the delicate line between consultation and advice, the TSP is keenly working towards evolving into a more consultative service, seeking to foster a greater level of engagement with participants. In conceptualizing a future where the TSP initiates contact with investors at key career points and during critical life moments, the program aims to create a more personalized approach towards financial planning and retirement savings. While this transformation is expected to take five years or more, it is hoped that such changes will garner a heightened sense of investor trust and confidence. Speculations around potential changes in law and an opening of investment windows are being reviewed, with formal recommendations to the governing board planned for the months ahead. Despite comprising the authority to extend its services, TSP has demonstrated a cautious approach, taking into consideration the importance of maintaining confidentiality and preventing potential fraud. As an added layer of security, consideration is being given to incorporating pop-ups during online transactions, consulting investors about potential impacts, and offering opportunities for online chats. Simultaneously, to extend the user's digital experiencex, the TSP has also begun to request personal contact details from investors, including phone numbers and email addresses. In addition to these steps, there are ongoing projections to upgrade and simplify current paper-based transactions by encouraging online operations, broadening withdrawal options, and enhancing online calculator features. Despite the massive steps taken towards better customer service, the TSP acknowledges that there still is a long way to go. One of the challenges being evaluated is the fact that a considerable percentage of investors transfer their money out of the TSP within a year after leaving the government service. By providing more consultative support and establishing a more personal relationship with investors, the TSP intends to counter this trend, emphasizing its exceptionally low administrative fees in the investment industry. With its focus on building a long-term strategic plan for the organization, the TSP is committed to redefining its role in the retirement savings landscape, addressing the need for investors seeking personalized financial guidance, and offering improved transactional and consultative services. Through this evolution, the TSP aims to become more than just a financial institution, but rather, a trusted investment partner for the present and future federal employees and military personnel in America."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

TEXT:For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage. Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like \\"Ratso Rizzo\\" in this film and then going to be the \\"Rain Man\\" later on. Yes, \\"Ratso\\" is a character you'll never forget, and \\"Joe Buck\\" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting. This movie isn't \\"art,\\" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people. I did like the catchy song, \\"Everybody's Talking'\\" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And - as mentioned - the name \\"Ratso Rizzo\\" kind of stays with you! The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: this marked it as \\"official\\" that Hollywood had gone down the toilet, and it has remained in the sewer ever since.","completion":"The correct sentiment for this text is (A). negative. The text criticizes the film's content, characters, and impact on Hollywood, describing it as depressing, bleak, sordid, stunning, and appalling. It also refers to the movie as \\"gilded garbage\\" and implies that, due to its shady content, the film was undeserving of its many awards. The negative sentiment is further emphasized by the author's personal experience of being left with a bad taste after watching the movie and their belief that it marked a turning point in which Hollywood officially \\"went down the toilet.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Last week we talked about healthy eating on a budget. Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. Question: What field does the author most probably work in? Options: A. sales B. medicine C.

She was going through family problems and I _ her to be with the cooler people. None of my new friends liked her as much as I did because they knew she had problems. However, every summer we would always sit at each other's house, watch soap operas and talk about all the boys we like. It was last year when I noticed the problem.

OPT: (1). description; (2). entity; (3). abbreviation; (4). human; (5). numeric; (6). location; Answer:","completion":"The question \\"How many logarithmic scales are there on a slide rule?\\" is asking about the numeric aspect (Option 5) of slide rules. To provide a more detailed answer, let's first discuss what slide rules are and their usage. Slide rules are analog calculation devices that were widely used before the advent of digital calculators and computers. They consist of several logarithmic scales (graduated straightedges with scales) that slide against each other. By aligning the scales and reading the results at appropriate points, users can perform various mathematical operations such as multiplication, division, roots, powers, and logarithmic calculations with relative ease and speed. The number of logarithmic scales on a slide rule can vary depending on the complexity of the device and its intended use. Early slide rules typically had only two or three logarithmic scales, while more advanced models, such as the popular Pickett N600-ES slide rule, had additional scales to perform specialized calculations for engineering, science, and mathematics. A common slide rule design features three main logarithmic scales: 1. C and D scales: These are the primary scales for multiplication and division. They are identical with evenly spaced logarithmic markings and cover a range of 1 to 10. To multiply or divide two numbers, the user aligns the C and D scales appropriately and reads the result on the other scale. 2. A and B scales: These scales are used for finding squares and square roots of numbers. They cover a logarithmic range of 1 to 100 and are typically marked in 1/10 increments. Some slide rules also include additional scales for specific operations or applications, such as: - K scale for cube roots and powers - L scale for logarithm base 10 calculations - S scale for trigonometric functions like sine and cosine - T scale for tangents - P scale for square roots of small numbers - DF scale for π-related calculations Overall, the number of logarithmic scales on a slide rule can be anywhere from two or three on a basic device to a dozen or more on advanced models designed for specialized purposes. In summary, the question is asking about the numeric aspect of slide rules, focusing on the presence and variation in the number of logarithmic scales found on these devices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Squeeze the conditioner into your hands and rub them together. Then, use your fingers to smooth the conditioner down the shafts of your hair, starting at the roots. Make sure that you apply an even coating. If you run out of conditioner by the time you get to your ends, simply use a little more. If you prefer, you can use your favourite hair oil instead of conditioner. Coconut oil and olive oil are popular moisturising options. If you have long hair, tie it up in a low bun first. Then, place the shower cap over your head and tuck any stray hairs underneath. Purchase a shower cap from a pharmacy or the hair care aisle of a supermarket. Continue to squeeze the face cloth until there are no drips coming off it. This is important, as hot drips of water have the potential to burn your neck. Shake the face cloth to ensure that there are no drips of water left in it. If you have a hair turban, you can use this instead of a face cloth. Face cloths work well because of their small size. If you don’t have one, use a similar sized cloth instead. Set the microwave to the highest setting and press start. This heats up the water in the cloth which will help to steam your hair. Don’t worry if you see steam coming off the cloth while it is in the microwave – this is normal. If your microwave plate is dirty, place the face cloth into a microwave-safe bowl to keep it clean. Position the face cloth on the middle of your head over the shower cap. If you feel the face cloth slipping down your head, simply adjust it back onto the middle of your head in a more balanced position. Wear gloves when transferring the face cloth to your head to avoid getting burnt. Alternatively, use a potholder to remove the face cloth. This helps to stop the heat from escaping and encourages steam to form. Don’t worry if the shower cap doesn’t fit over your whole head, simply stretch it over the face cloth. If you don’t have another shower cap, place a plastic rubbish or garbage bag over the face cloth instead. This gives time for the steam to soak into the strands of your hair. Try to sit relatively still so that the face cloth doesn’t slip off your head. Read a book, watch TV, or simply relax! If you want really moisturised hair, leave it to steam for up to 2 hours. However, be sure to reheat your face cloth 2-3 times during your steam. If the face cloth falls off, simply put it back into its original position and place the shower cap back over it. You might want to reheat it before you replace it if it's cooled off. Take the shower caps and face cloth off your head and untie your hair, if necessary. Then, adjust the shower to the highest pressure and allow the water to push the conditioner out of your hair. The cold water helps to seal the hair cuticles and locks in moisture. The beautiful moisturised feeling will last about 1 week. Avoid steaming your hair more often than this, as steaming too often weakens your hair. Leave your hair to air-dry. This maximises the moisture in your hair and minimises heat damage.","completion":"Apply conditioner or hair oil on your hair evenly, then tie it up and cover with a shower cap.

Write an article based on this summary: A mere two months ago George Osborne was the second most powerful member of the government.","completion":"Title: The Meteoric Fall of George Osborne - From Second in Command to Relative Obscurity Introduction: It was only two months ago that George Osborne reigned as the second most powerful member of the government. Commanding respect and wielding influence, Osborne seemed untouchable. Yet, his meteoric rise was matched only by his sudden fall from grace. This article explores the circumstances surrounding this political enigma and seeks to understand how such a rapid descent came to be. Step 1: Establish Osborne's prior accomplishments and status: Just a few months back, George Osborne held an influential position within the government as Chancellor of the Exchequer. In this role, he played a crucial part in shaping the nation's economic policies and was often seen as the right-hand man to the Prime Minister. With a successful track record, it seemed unlikely that his fall from prominence would happen so quickly. Step 2: Examine the key factors that led to his downfall: Osborne's downfall can be attributed to several significant events that transpired within a short period. These events ultimately exposed his vulnerability as a political figure and hastened his exit from the forefront of government. 1. Political rivalry: Infighting within the ruling party, as well as the rise of new political factions, ultimately weakened Osborne's grip on power. 2. Policy reversals: Some of Osborne's economic strategies met with objections, leading to policy reversals that diminished his credibility in the eyes of his colleagues and the public. 3. Media scrutiny: Osborne's actions and policies were increasingly criticized by the media, which played a role in tarnishing his image and reputation. Step 3: Discuss the implications of his rapid political downfall: The fall of George Osborne from a position of power has left a considerable impact both on him personally and on the government as a whole. His sudden departure has raised questions about the stability and future direction of the administration. Additionally, his absence from the political landscape has left a vacuum that other politicians may be keen to fill, potentially changing the overall dynamic of the government. Step 4: Analyze the lessons to be learned from Osborne's experience: Osborne's dramatic descent from power serves as a cautionary tale for politicians and a reminder of the volatile nature of political success. In the blink of an eye, fortunes can turn, and even the most influential individuals can find themselves left out in the cold. To remain successful in public service, politicians must always be aware of their precarious position and be prepared to adapt to the ever-changing political landscape. Conclusion: In the short span of just two months, George Osborne has gone from being the second most powerful member of the government to a figure of relative obscurity. His rapid fall from grace serves as a sobering reminder of the fickle nature of political power. Through this examination of Osborne's sudden downfall, we come to understand the fragility of political success and the importance for those in positions of power to remain both vigilant and adaptable, lest they suffer a similar fate."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which American tennis player won his only Wimbledon singles title in 1992 ?","completion":"Andre Agassi, an American tennis player, won his only Wimbledon singles title in 1992. Born on April 29, 1970, in Las Vegas, Nevada, Agassi is widely regarded as one of the most dominant and talented tennis players in the history of the sport. Known for his aggressive playing style, unique fashion choices, and charismatic personality, Agassi had a long and storied career in professional tennis. To provide a detailed and long answer, we can discuss a bit more about his background and achievements. Agassi turned professional in 1986 and was coached by Nick Bollettieri. Bollettieri is a renowned tennis coach who has worked with numerous top players, including Jim Courier, Monica Seles, and Maria Sharapova. Agassi's collaboration with Bollettieri proved to be a pivotal partnership in his career. Agassi had a less-than-stellar start to his career at Wimbledon. Before 1992, his best performances were in 1991 when he reached the quarterfinals and in 1989 when he reached the fourth round. Ranked no. 8 in the world at the time, Agassi was not considered a favorite to win Wimbledon in 1992. However, in 1992, the 22-year-old Agassi showed a new level of dominance at the championships. Throughout the tournament, he defeated several top-ranked players, including Boris Becker (4th round) and John McEnroe (quarterfinals). These victories set up a memorable final match against Goran Ivanišević, a Croatian player ranked no. 15 in the world. In a thrilling five-set battle, Agassi managed to overcome Ivanišević with a score of 6-7, 6-4, 6-4, 1-6, 6-4. This victory marked his first-ever Grand Slam title and a significant milestone in his career. The Wimbledon victory propelled Agassi's rankings to new heights and established him as a formidable force within the tennis world. Beyond his 1992 Wimbledon victory, Agassi won a total of eight Grand Slam singles titles throughout his career. Here's a breakdown: 1. Wimbledon (1992) 2. U.S. Open (1994 and 1999) 3. Australian Open (1995, 2000, 2001, 2003) 4. French Open (1999) The 1999 French Open victory made Andre Agassi one of the few men's singles players to complete a career Grand Slam, winning all four Grand Slam tournaments. Agassi retired from professional tennis in 2006, but his impact on the sport is still felt today. He used his success as a tennis player to give back to his community, establishing the Andre Agassi Foundation for Education, which is dedicated to improving education for children in the United States. He is also involved in charitable activities and mentoring young tennis players, showcasing the same passion and dedication that made him a champion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: -456 * c + 2290 = 2 * c First, I want to get all the c's (or apples) on one side of the equation. To do that, I'll add 456*c to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -456*c on the left side and also add 456*c to the right side. So, now our equation will look like this: 2290 = 2*c + 456*c Now, let's add the c's together to simplify the equation: 2290 = 458*c We're almost done! Now we just need to find out what number c (or each apple) is.

What are the full names of the two individuals who achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land? Answer the above question based on the context below: Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893–96 was an attempt by the Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen to reach the geographical North Pole by harnessing the natural east–west current of the Arctic Ocean. In the face of much discouragement from other polar explorers, Nansen took his ship Fram to the New Siberian Islands in the eastern Arctic Ocean, froze her into the pack ice, and waited for the drift to carry her towards the pole. Impatient with the slow speed and erratic character of the drift, after 18 months Nansen and a chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen, left the ship with a team of dogs and sledges and made for the pole. They did not reach it, but they achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N before a long retreat over ice and water to reach safety in Franz Josef Land. Meanwhile, Fram continued to drift westward, finally emerging in the North Atlantic Ocean. The idea for the expedition had arisen after items from the American vessel Jeannette, which had sunk off the north coast of Siberia in 1881, were discovered three years later off the south-west coast of Greenland. The wreckage had obviously been carried across the polar ocean, perhaps across the pole itself. Based on this and other debris recovered from the Greenland coast, the meteorologist Henrik Mohn developed a theory of transpolar drift, which led Nansen to believe that a specially designed ship could be frozen in the pack ice and follow the same track as Jeannette wreckage, thus reaching the vicinity of the pole. Nansen supervised the construction of a vessel with a rounded hull and other features designed to withstand prolonged pressure from ice. The ship was rarely threatened during her long imprisonment, and emerged unscathed after three years. The scientific observations carried out during this period contributed significantly to the new discipline of oceanography, which subsequently became the main focus of Nansen's scientific work. Fram's drift and Nansen's sledge journey proved conclusively that there were no significant land...","completion":"The two individuals who achieved a record Farthest North latitude of 86°13.6′N during Nansen's Fram expedition of 1893-96 were Norwegian explorer Fridtjof Nansen and his chosen companion, Hjalmar Johansen.

Nearly 900,000 Britons have been issued with a fine for motoring offences while driving on holiday abroad. One in 12 holidaymakers have been collared for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car, according to a survey. The findings sparked a warning for British travellers to get up to speed with little-known local laws including a Spanish ban on driving in flip-flops and a French restriction on satnav speed camera alerts. Laws in European countries include carrying a spare pair of spectacles in Italy, having a clean car in Russia and not wearing flip-flops to drive in Spain. The research comes amid a row over an EU Directive that will make it easier for police in Europe to trace errant British motorists whilst foreign drivers in the UK often escape scot-free. The research found the popularity of self-drive holidays across the English Channel has soared in the past two years. Nearly a quarter of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car - a total of 11.5 million British holidaymakers. But 80 per cent have been stopped for motoring misdemeanours or picked up a parking ticket - equivalent to 878,000 penalised abroad. The figure does not include Britons fined on fly-drive holidays in hire cars. The survey of 2,054 adults indicated that 4.4 million will set off from home on road trips abroad this year alone - 2.6 million more than in 2012 when just 1.8 million drove to their destination. 24% of the UK's 47.4 million adults have gone abroad by car, it's essential that British travellers get up to speed with little-known local laws in Europe before travelling. It found that men are much more likely to contravene local laws than women - 9 per cent did so compared to 6 per cent of women - and those aged under 25 are the worst offenders. 'There are lots of different laws when you drive in continental Europe and they vary from country to country,' Victoria Walton, Insurance company NFU Mutual's motor insurance specialist, said. SPAIN Fines for driving in flip-flops and ban on using DIY hands-free phone kits at the wheel. FRANCE Fines of up to Euro £1,200 for using a satnav with the speed camera location warning enabled and compulsory to carry a DIY breathalyser. GERMANY Illegal to stop on an autobahn, even when running out of fuel. ITALY Compulsory to park in the direction of traffic on that side of the road and carry spare pair of spectacles if needed for driving. RUSSIA AND BELARUS On-the-spot fine for driving a dirty car. CYPRUS Honking a horn near a hospital prohibited. DENMARK Mandatory to check under car for children hiding before driving off. LUXEMBOURG All cars must have windscreen wipers...even if they don't have a windscreen. SCANDINAVIA First region to make daytime use of headlights compulsory. 'You may not know that it is the law to carry a breathalyser in France, illegal to use a hands-free kit in Spain and compulsory that drivers who wear glasses carry a spare pair in their vehicle in Italy and Spain. 'British tourists are also at risk of serious fines if they drive wearing flip-flops or do not indicate on the motorway in Spain.' The Foreign and Commonwealth Office said holidaymakers face fines for driving a dirty car in Russia or honking their horn near a hospital in Cyprus and warned that travellers could even be arrested if caught unawares. 'It's easy to throw caution to the wind when on holiday but it's important to be aware of the local laws and customs before you set off,' FCO Minister Mark Simmonds said. 'Laws and customs vary widely from country to country. We want people to enjoy their holidays so we encourage them to be prepared.' Motorists also risk fines for driving without the minimum third party insurance required throughout Europe and advised travellers to check policies to ensure they are covered on the Continent. 'Anyone planning a self-drive trip to Europe this summer must check both their insurance and breakdown cover extends to European travel,' said Walton. 'Some policies do not provide this cover as standard. You risk being seriously out of pocket and, more importantly, breaking the law without the adequate cover.' One in twelve holidaymakers have been stopped for breaking road rules on foreign trips in their own car. The 2011 EU Directive is due to come into force next year after a ruling by the European Court of Justice overturned a UK opt-out. The clampdown gives overseas authorities the go-ahead to electronically access driver records at the DVLA to pursue fines which are currently only enforceable if drivers are stopped by a police officer. Britain fought it on the economic grounds that the cost of upgrading DVLA computers to enable instant exchange of registered keeper details and the expense of processing penalties outweigh the income generated from fines.

Update: Both Starr and McCaw have since departed from Baylor, Starr doing so on June 1 by resigning from his reassigned chancellor position and McCaw resigning on May 30 after the hiring of Jim Grobe as acting head coach. Baylor University fired head football coach Art Briles on Thursday, stemming from a nearly year-long scandal over how his program handled allegations of player violence against women. But Briles isn't the only powerful person in Waco in trouble. The university announced, in addition, that president Ken Starr (the former independent counsel who investigated Bill Clinton in the 1990s) will give up his role as the school's president at the end of May. He'll continue to serve as a law school chair and as Baylor's chancellor -- a separate position -- under \\"terms that are still being discussed.\\" Baylor athletic director Ian McCaw has been \\"sanctioned and placed on probation.\\" Briles, officially, is under indefinite suspension with the intent to terminate his contract. The school's report included findings by a third-party law firm that Briles' coaching staff failed to report allegations of player misconduct. Other members of Baylor's administration have also been dismissed, but the school said it won't identify all of them publicly. Baylor appears prepared to undergo a significant administrative realignment. This is Baylor's second major athletic scandal since the turn of the century. McCaw took over as the athletic director in 2003, after a Bears basketball player murdered teammate Patrick Dennehy that summer, along with an attempted cover up by head coach Dave Bliss. Last July, McCaw told SB Nation in an interview for a separate story that he'd been focused on building bridges while the school tried to move on from that story. \\"We started closest to home,\\" McCaw said. \\"We needed to reestablish trust with everybody because of what had happened but I think our staff probably was the biggest challenge quite honestly. Because of what happened with the basketball scandal, they felt very violated. We had people we thought we could trust and we were mislead and 'look what's happened to us.' We started closest to home and built it out.\\" Fostering trust was an important part of McCaw's job. \\"Trust isn't like a light switch. You don't just flick it on. You have to demonstrate trust by being consistent over a period of time. Once people learn who you are, how you do things, you slowly gain their trust and their confidence,\\" he said. \\"That's what you have to do.\\" Now, Baylor will have to do it again, and it isn't clear whether McCaw will be a part of it. \\"We want to be the nation's premier Christian intercollegiate program,\\" McCaw said. \\"That was the vision we cast, that was put into our strategic plan.\\" ||||| Baylor University has demoted president Ken Starr, fired head football coach Art Briles, sanctioned athletic director Ian McCaw, and fired unnamed administrative and athletics department staffers, according to a release from the school. The school also said that an independent investigation found a “fundamental failure by Baylor to implement Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972\\" and a “lack of strong institutional management and control on a number of levels.” The changes came as a result of an investigation commissioned by law firm Pepper Hamilton, which has spent the past nine months responding to Baylor’s handling of sexual assault claims. According to the university’s statement, Pepper Hamilton did not prepare an actual report; instead the school has synthesized the law firm’s findings into a 13-page Findings of Fact, which you can read here.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was said to free your mind the way Elvis freed your body? In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: N.E.R.D (stylized as N*E*R*D, a backronym of No-one Ever Really Dies) is an American hip hop and rock band, formed in Virginia Beach, Virginia in 1999. Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo were signed by Teddy Riley to Virgin Records as a duo, The Neptunes. After producing songs for several artists throughout the late 1990s and early 2000s, the production duo formed the band with Shay Haley as a side project of The Neptunes in 1999. In 2010, N.E.R.D announced the release of their fourth studio album entitled Nothing, which had a scheduled release date for September 7, 2010, but was pushed back to November 2, 2010. The first single from the album, \\"Hot-n-Fun\\" featuring Canadian recording artist Nelly Furtado, was released on May 18, 2010 on iTunes. It was released in the United Kingdom on August 30, 2010. On August 20, 2010, a track titled \\"Party People\\" leaked onto the internet. It was rumored to be the second single from the album. On September 28, 2010, they premiered another track from the album titled \\"Hypnotize U\\" on Late Show with David Letterman, produced by electronic music duo Daft Punk. On September 30, 2010, in an interview with Mark Hoppus on A Different Spin with Mark Hoppus, Pharrell explained the album cover as \\"a mix of so many things. The feathers represent the peace, and the helmet represents the war. It's like where we are right now. There's a lot of war, that people can't necessarily explain. The economy sucks, girls are still beautiful. We wanted to make music that reflected that. So people can look back twenty years from now, and say 'this is what was going on'\\". They then announced in the interview that the next two singles would be \\"I've Seen the Light\\" and \\"Hypnotize U\\". Pharrell described \\"Hypnotize U\\" as being \\"so different from the rest of the album\\", stating he was \\"very pleased because it serves a different purpose\\" in the album. On October 17, 2010, the standard edition and the deluxe edition of the album became available for pre-order on iTunes. It was later announced that they would support Gorillaz on the North American leg of their 2010 'Escape to Plastic Beach' world tour. In 2013, Pharrell confirmed a N.E.R.D album was in progress, but also mentioned that the album would not be released that year due to the projects he was working on with other artists. He has also said the album will be \\"nature-based\\". The group reunited on December 26, 2014, to release the songs \\"Squeeze Me,\\" \\"Patrick Star,\\" and \\"Sandy Squirrel\\" for the film The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water.

Background Paragraph: In many ways, bacterial metabolism provides traits that are useful for ecological stability and for human society. One example is that some bacteria have the ability to fix nitrogen gas using the enzyme nitrogenase. This environmentally important trait can be found in bacteria of most metabolic types listed above. This leads to the ecologically important processes of denitrification, sulfate reduction, and acetogenesis, respectively. Bacterial metabolic processes are also important in biological responses to pollution; for example, sulfate-reducing bacteria are largely responsible for the production of the highly toxic forms of mercury (methyl- and dimethylmercury) in the environment. Non-respiratory anaerobes use fermentation to generate energy and reducing power, secreting metabolic by-products (such as ethanol in brewing) as waste. Facultative anaerobes can switch between fermentation and different terminal electron acceptors depending on the environmental conditions in which they find themselves. Story: Brett and Scott were both studying bacteria for their exam. Scott read more about nitrogen-fixating and sulfate-reducing bacteria, while his colleague Brett read more about non-respiratory anaerobe bacteria and facultative anaerobes.

FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan, reviewed the volume for the journal Man, describing \\"this very readable little book\\" as being \\"adulatory\\" in tone, \\"but hardly more so than its subject deserves.\\" In 1982, the archaeologist Jacquetta Hawkes published a second biography, Mortimer Wheeler: Adventurer in Archaeology. Hawkes admitted she had developed \\"a very great liking\\" for Wheeler, having first met him when she was an archaeology student at the University of Cambridge. She believed that he had \\"a daemonic energy\\", with his accomplishments in India being \\"almost superhuman\\". Ultimately, she thought of him as being \\"an epic hero in an anti-heroic age\\" in which growing social egalitarianism had stifled and condemned aspects of his greatness.In the 2000 film Hey Ram, the lead character, Saket Ram (played by Kamal Haasan) and his friend, Amjad Khan (played by Shah Rukh Khan) are shown as employees of Wheeler, who was portrayed by Lewis K. Elbinger, before the 1947 Hindu–Muslim riots. In a 2003 volume of the South Asian Studies journal, Sudeshna Gusha published a research article examining Wheeler's use of photography in his excavations and publications in the Indian subcontinent. In 2011, the academic journal Public Archaeology published a research paper by Moshenska and Schadla-Hall that analysed Wheeler's role in presenting archaeology to the British public.

Premise: \\"Noyers is a fortified medieval village with 16 towers in its ramparts.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"Noyers is a fortified medieval village with 16 towers in its ramparts\\" is true, then it provides strong support for the hypothesis \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers.\\" Both the premise and the hypothesis focus on the same core facts – the presence of 16 towers and their location in the ramparts. To better understand the relationship between these statements, let's analyze the components of each. 1. The premise indicates that Noyers is a fortified medieval village. This tells us that the village dates back to the medieval period and features fortifications, which usually include walls or ramparts for protection against attacks or invasions during that era. 2. The premise identifies that there are 16 towers in Noyers' ramparts. This provides specific information about the total number of towers within the village's fortifications. The towers would have had defensive purposes during the medieval period, such as providing vantage points for observation, supporting the walls, and acting as a base for soldiers to defend the village. When looking at the hypothesis, \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers,\\" the core information is consistent with the facts presented in the premise: 1. The hypothesis acknowledges that Noyers has surrounding ramparts. Given that the premise confirms its status as a fortified medieval village, it is logical to assume the presence of ramparts or walls surrounding it. 2. The hypothesis focuses specifically on the number of towers present in the ramparts, stating there are 16. This information matches the details provided in the premise, reinforcing the validity of the claim. Therefore, if the premise is true, it entails that the hypothesis \\"There are 16 towers in the ramparts surrounding Noyers\\" is also true or highly probable. Both statements share foundational information about the presence and number of towers, providing evidence that supports the hypothesis's accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The city is home to the Thirty-Sixth District Court, as well as the First District of the Michigan Court of Appeals and the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The city provides law enforcement through the Detroit Police Department and emergency services through the Detroit Fire Department.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the city of Detroit, multiple entities are involved in administering the courts, as the courts belong to different judicial levels and jurisdictions. The primary organizations responsible for the administration of Detroit's courts are the state government of Michigan and the federal government of the United States. 1. The State Government of Michigan: Detroit's courts are majorly administered by the state government. This includes the Probate Court, the Circuit Court, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals. The administration of these courts is managed by the judicial branch of the Michigan state government. The nonpartisan elections for these courts indicate that they are managed at the state level. a) Probate Court: Located in the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center, the Probate Court for Wayne County handles cases related to wills, estates, and guardianship. The court is overseen by the State of Michigan through judicial appointments and budgetary supervision. b) Circuit Court: The Circuit Court is situated in the Frank Murphy Hall of Justice, and it manages civil and criminal cases.

Today, we are going to learn about a very important event that happened in our country. Do you know what the Defense of Marriage Act is? Let's find out! Long ago (in 1996), some people in our country made a law called the Defense of Marriage Act, or DOMA for short. This law said that marriage could only be between a man and a woman. That meant that two people who love each other like a boy and a girl could get married, but not two boys or two girls who love each other. Many people thought that was not fair, because everyone should have the chance to marry the person they love, even if it is two boys or two girls. So, they asked the Justices for help. The Justices are kind and smart people who help make sure the laws in our country are fair to everyone. They work in a big, fancy building called the Supreme Court. So, the Justices agreed that they would listen to the people and think about whether the Defense of Marriage Act is a good law or not. They all got together and talked about it. And guess what? They decided that DOMA was not fair, because it did not treat everyone the same way. Now, because of the help of the Justices and the hard work of many people, everyone in our country can marry the person they love, whether it is a boy and a girl, two boys, or two girls! Isn't that great news? Love is a very special thing that brings people together, and now everyone has the same chance to show their love through marriage. That is the story of how the Justices heard the case on the Defense of Marriage Act and helped make our country a fairer and happier place for everyone. I hope you enjoyed learning about this important event. And always remember, boys and girls, love is for everyone!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jackson) and John Sanders (Mark Houghton) on a Boeing 747-400 to testify at the trial in Los Angeles.Despite increased security for the flight, Kim arranges for a time-release crate full of venomous and constrictor snakes to be placed in the cargo hold, in an attempt to bring down the plane before it reaches Los Angeles.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Marion Post is a New York philosophy professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book. Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet. Her work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis. She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty. Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way. She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness. She also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry. She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called \\"Hope\\". Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore. She leaves Ken after catching him having an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura.

With every flower, shrub and hanging basket coated in hand-knitted garments, the gesture didn't only add an element of cheer to the town, but also served as a tribute to soldiers from the First World War through the beauty of art. The Knitted Wonderland On a seemingly ordinary day, the residents slowly stepped out of their homes, rubbing their eyes in disbelief as they witnessed the wondrous sight before them. It appeared that a group of dedicated and exceptionally skilled knitters had pulled an all-nighter to create the astonishing display. Rows upon rows of meticulously-crafted crochets covered everything from the tiniest flowers to the largest bushes. It seemed that no plant had been left untouched. The stunning array of colors and intricate designs brought a touch of whimsy and warmth to the seafront area, evoking a sense of childlike enjoyment and amazement among residents and visitors alike. As the day progressed, people of all ages found themselves gathering at the seafront, marveling at the unique and vibrant display. Families, couples, and solo visitors alike basked in the delight of the unexpected art installation and bonded over the joy it created. A Tribute to Fallen Soldiers Further adding to the depth and meaning behind this extraordinary gesture, a section of the gardens had been devoted exclusively to remembering fallen soldiers of the First World War. Here, the anonymous knitters had meticulously crafted an array of knitted poppies, a well-known symbol of remembrance and respect for those who sacrificed their lives for their countries. The beautiful red poppies stood as a poignant tribute to the many heroes who braved the challenges of war to ensure our safety and freedom. The contrast of bright red flowers against the various pastel-colored knits also served as a constant reminder of the importance and weight of their sacrifices. Impact on the Community The anonymous knitters have not only brought a fresh burst of color and joy to the town but have also fostered a strong sense of community among residents. The excitement and buzz in the area have led to lively conversations, new friendships, and even knitting enthusiasts coming together to share their passion for the craft. Locals now are speculating who might be behind this wonderful initiative and how they can keep this sense of camaraderie alive after the knit-work is eventually taken down. The temporary nature of the installation only serves to remind us that beauty, like life itself, can be fleeting. For now, the town can embrace its new-found vibrancy, while paying their respects to the brave soldiers of the past. Conclusion The sudden appearance of the knit-covered seafront gardens brought a sense of wonder and community spirit to the unsuspecting residents of the quaint seaside town. Combining the delicate beauty of nature and the intricacy of hand-crafted art has created a powerful message of unity and remembrance. For now, the town remains abuzz with appreciation for the anonymous knitters who delivered a heartfelt tribute that has touched the hearts of many and rekindled the spirit of gratitude for the sacrifices made by heroes of the First World War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: What are some examples of statutory law? Question 2: What are statutory laws? What are some example? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1 and Question 2 are similar, but not exactly the same. While both questions ask for examples of statutory law, the latter also seeks to understand what statutory laws are. Before diving into the examples, let's briefly clarify what statutory laws are. Statutory laws are written laws enacted by a legislative body, such as the Parliament, Congress, or any other institution with the authority to create legislation. These laws are typically documented in official law codes and serve as a primary source of law in many jurisdictions, governing various areas of life including, but not limited to, criminal, civil, commercial, administrative, and social issues. They are passed in order to uphold community standards, maintain public safety, and protect individual rights. Now, let's go over some examples of statutory law, which will address both questions: 1. Civil Rights Act of 1964 (USA): This groundbreaking law in the United States outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It also ended unequal application of voter registration requirements and prohibited racial segregation in schools, the workplace, and public accommodations. 2. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (USA): Also known as the \\"Public Company Accounting Reform and Investor Protection Act,\\" this law established new or enhanced standards for all U.S. public company boards, management, and public accounting firms. It was enacted in response to high-profile financial scandals at companies like Enron and WorldCom and aims to improve corporate transparency and financial accountability. 3. The Companies Act 2006 (UK): This act is the primary source of company law in the United Kingdom and provides rules and regulations governing company formation, management, and administration. It includes provisions like the codification of directors’ duties, rights of shareholders, and requirements for annual reports and financial disclosures. 4. Criminal Code Act 1995 (Australia): This act serves as the primary source of criminal law in Australia and covers a broad range of offenses like fraud, bribery, theft, drug offenses, and terrorism, among others. It also establishes general principles of criminal responsibility, such as intention, recklessness, and attempts to commit a crime. 5. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 (India): Enacted during British rule in India, this code provides a comprehensive list of criminal offenses and corresponding punishments in Indian law. It covers offenses such as theft, assault, rape, and murder, as well as offenses against the state, such as sedition, waging war, and promoting enmity between different groups. These examples demonstrate the variety of subject matter that statutory laws can address and their impact on multiple areas of society. Although the questions were not exactly the same, this comprehensive answer should provide clarification and relevant examples for both Question 1 and Question 2."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Titanium is a chemical element with symbol Ti and atomic number 22. It is a lustrous transition metal with a silver color, low density, and high strength. Titanium is resistant to corrosion in sea water, aqua regia, and chlorine. - Nitrogen is a chemical element with symbol N and atomic number 7. It was first discovered and isolated by Scottish physician Daniel Rutherford in 1772. Although Carl Wilhelm Scheele and Henry Cavendish had independently done so at about the same time, Rutherford is generally accorded the credit because his work was published first. The name \\"nitrogen\\" was suggested by Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal in 1790, when it was found that nitrogen was present in nitric acid and nitrates; this name derives from the Greek roots \\"nitre\\" and - \\"to form\\". Antoine Lavoisier suggested instead the name \\"azote\\", from the Greek \\"no life\\", as it is an asphyxiant gas; his name is instead used in many languages, such as French, Russian, and Turkish, and appears in the English names of some nitrogen compounds such as hydrazine, azides and azo compounds. - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - Helium is a chemical element with symbol He and atomic number 2. It is a colorless, odorless, tasteless, non-toxic, inert, monatomic gas, the first in the noble gas group in the periodic table. Its boiling point is the lowest among all the elements. - Hydrazine is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula (also written ). A simple pnictogen hydride, it is a colorless flammable liquid with an ammonia-like odor. Hydrazine is highly toxic and dangerously unstable unless handled in solution. , approximately 120,000 tons of hydrazine hydrate (corresponding to a 64% solution of hydrazine in water by weight) were manufactured worldwide per year. Hydrazine is mainly used as a foaming agent in preparing polymer foams, but significant applications also include its uses as a precursor to polymerization catalysts and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, hydrazine is used in various rocket fuels and to prepare the gas precursors used in air bags. Hydrazine is used within both nuclear and conventional electrical power plant steam cycles as an oxygen scavenger to control concentrations of dissolved oxygen in an effort to reduce corrosion. Anhydrous hydrazine is corrosive towards glass, in a manner similar to hydrofluoric acid. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Potassium is a chemical element with symbol K (derived from Neo-Latin, \\"kalium\\") and atomic number 19. It was first isolated from potash, the ashes of plants, from which its name derives. In the periodic table, potassium is one of the alkali metals. All of the alkali metals have a single valence electron in the outer electron shell, which is easily removed to create an ion with a positive charge a cation, which combines with anions to form salts. Potassium in nature occurs only in ionic salts. Elemental potassium is a soft silvery-white alkali metal that oxidizes rapidly in air and reacts vigorously with water, generating sufficient heat to ignite hydrogen emitted in the reaction and burning with a lilac-colored flame. It is found dissolved in sea water (which is 0.04% potassium by weight), and is part of many minerals. - The chalcogens are the chemical elements in group 16 of the periodic table. This group is also known as the oxygen family. It consists of the elements oxygen (O), sulfur (S), selenium (Se), tellurium (Te), and the radioactive element polonium (Po). The chemically uncharacterized synthetic element livermorium (Lv) is predicted to be a chalcogen as well. Often, oxygen is treated separately from the other chalcogens, sometimes even excluded from the scope of the term \\"chalcogen\\" altogether, due to its very different chemical behavior from sulfur, selenium, tellurium, and polonium. The word \\"chalcogen\\" is derived from a combination of the Greek word \\"khalks\\" () principally meaning copper (the term was also used for bronze/brass, any metal in the poetic sense, ore or coin), and the Latinised Greek word \\"gens\\", meaning \\"born\\" or \\"produced\\". - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Boron is a chemical element with symbol B and atomic number 5. Produced entirely by cosmic ray spallation and supernovae and not by stellar nucleosynthesis, it is a low-abundance element in the Solar system and in the Earth's crust. Boron is concentrated on Earth by the water-solubility of its more common naturally occurring compounds, the borate minerals. These are mined industrially as evaporites, such as borax and kernite. The largest known boron deposits are in Turkey, the largest producer of boron minerals. - Silicon is a chemical element with symbol Si and atomic number 14. A hard and brittle crystalline solid with a blue-gray metallic luster, it is a tetravalent metalloid. It is a member of group 14 in the periodic table, along with carbon above it and germanium, tin, lead, and flerovium below. It is rather unreactive, though less so than germanium, and has great chemical affinity for oxygen; as such, it was first prepared and characterized in pure form only in 1823 by Jöns Jakob Berzelius. - Chromium trioxide is an inorganic compound with the formula CrO. It is the acidic anhydride of chromic acid, and is sometimes marketed under the same name. This compound is a dark-purple solid under anhydrous conditions, bright orange when wet and which dissolves in water concomitant with hydrolysis. Millions of kilograms are produced annually, mainly for electroplating. Chromium trioxide is a powerful oxidiser and a suspected carcinogen. - Pollucite is a zeolite mineral with the formula (Cs,Na)AlSiO·2HO with iron, calcium, rubidium and potassium as common substituting elements. It is important as a significant ore of caesium and sometimes rubidium. It forms a solid solution series with analcime. It crystallizes in the isometric - hexoctahedral crystal system as colorless, white, gray, or rarely pink and blue masses. Well formed crystals are rare. It has a Mohs hardness of 6.5 and a specific gravity of 2.9. It has a brittle fracture and no cleavage. - The term chromic acid is usually used for a mixture made by adding concentrated sulfuric acid to a dichromate, which may contain a variety of compounds, including solid chromium trioxide. This kind of chromic acid may be used as a cleaning mixture for glass. Chromic acid may also refer to the molecular species, HCrO of which the trioxide is the anhydride. Chromic acid features chromium in an oxidation state of +6 (or VI). It is a strong and corrosive oxidising agent. - Sulfuric acid (alternative spelling sulphuric acid) is a highly corrosive strong mineral acid with the molecular formula HSO and molecular weight 98.079 g/mol. It is a pungent-ethereal, colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid that is soluble in water at all concentrations. Sometimes, it is dyed dark brown during production to alert people to its hazards. The historical name of this acid is oil of vitriol. - Caesium or cesium is a chemical element with symbol Cs and atomic number 55. It is a soft, silvery-gold (or, according to some, silver/colorless) alkali metal with a melting point of 28.5 °C (83.3 °F), which makes it one of only five elemental metals that are liquid at or near room temperature. Caesium is an alkali metal and has physical and chemical properties similar to those of rubidium and potassium. The metal is extremely reactive and pyrophoric, reacting with water even at 116 °C (177 °F). It is the least electronegative element. It has only one stable isotope, caesium-133. Caesium is mined mostly from pollucite, while the radioisotopes, especially caesium-137, a fission product, are extracted from waste produced by nuclear reactors. - Rust is an iron oxide, usually red oxide formed by the redox reaction of iron and oxygen in the presence of water or air moisture. Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Rust consists of hydrated iron(III) oxides FeO·\\"n\\"HO and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)). - Tin is a chemical element with the symbol Sn (for ) and atomic number 50, is a post-transition metal in group 14 of the periodic table. It is obtained chiefly from the mineral cassiterite, which contains tin dioxide, SnO. Tin shows a chemical similarity to both of its neighbors in group 14, germanium and lead, and has two main oxidation states, +2 and the slightly more stable +4. Tin is the 49th most abundant element and has, with 10 stable isotopes, the largest number of stable isotopes in the periodic table, thanks to its magic number of protons. It has two main allotropes: at room temperature, the stable allotrope is -tin, a silvery-white, malleable metal, but at low temperatures it transforms into the less dense grey -tin, which has the diamond cubic structure. Metallic tin is not easily oxidized in air. - Caesium chromate , the caesium salt of chromic acid , is used to produce caesium vapour by reaction with silicon , boron , or titanium , which is used to in the final stages of creating vacuum tubes ; the caesium vapour reacts with the remaining gases , including nitrogen and oxygen . - Gold is a chemical element with the symbol Au (from ) and the atomic number 79. In its purest form, it is a bright, slightly reddish yellow, dense, soft, malleable, and ductile metal. Chemically, gold is a transition metal and a group 11 element. It is one of the least reactive chemical elements and is solid under standard conditions. Gold often occurs in free elemental (native) form, as nuggets or grains, in rocks, in veins, and in alluvial deposits. It occurs in a solid solution series with the native element silver (as electrum) and also naturally alloyed with copper and palladium. Less commonly, it occurs in minerals as gold compounds, often with tellurium (gold tellurides). - Silver is the metallic element with the atomic number 47. Its symbol is Ag, from the Latin \\"\\", derived from the Greek \\"\\" (literally \\"shiny\\" or \\"white\\"), and ultimately from a Proto-Indo-European language root reconstructed as *\\"her-\\", \\"grey\\" or \\"shining\\". A soft, white, lustrous transition metal, it exhibits the highest electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, and reflectivity of any metal. The metal is found in the Earth's crust in the pure, free elemental form (\\"native silver\\"), as an alloy with gold and other metals, and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite. Most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper, gold, lead, and zinc refining. Silver is more abundant than gold, but it is much less abundant as a native metal. Its purity is typically measured on a per mille basis; a 94%-pure alloy is described as \\"0.940 fine\\". - Chlorine is a chemical element with symbol Cl and atomic number 17. The second-lightest of the halogens, it appears between fluorine and bromine in the periodic table and its properties are mostly intermediate between them. Chlorine is a yellow-green gas at room temperature. It is an extremely reactive element and a strong oxidising agent: among the elements, it has the highest electron affinity and the third-highest electronegativity, behind only oxygen and fluorine. - Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter (the others being solid, liquid, and plasma). A pure gas may be made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon), elemental molecules made from one type of atom (e.g. oxygen), or compound molecules made from a variety of atoms (e.g. carbon dioxide). A gas mixture would contain a variety of pure gases much like the air. What distinguishes a gas from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer. The interaction of gas particles in the presence of electric and gravitational fields are considered negligible as indicated by the constant velocity vectors in the image. One type of commonly known gas is steam. - Aqua regia (\\"royal water\\" or \\"king's water\\") is a mixture of nitric acid and hydrochloric acid, optimally in a molar ratio of 1:3. Aqua regia is a yellow-orange fuming liquid. Aqua regia was so named by alchemists because it can dissolve the noble metals gold and platinum. However, aqua regia does not dissolve or corrode silver, titanium, iridium, ruthenium, rhenium, tantalum, niobium, hafnium, osmium, or rhodium. - Oxygen is a chemical element with symbol O and atomic number 8. It is a member of the chalcogen group on the periodic table and is a highly reactive nonmetal and oxidizing agent that readily forms oxides with most elements as well as other compounds. By mass, oxygen is the third-most abundant element in the universe, after hydrogen and helium. At standard temperature and pressure, two atoms of the element bind to form dioxygen, a colorless and odorless diatomic gas with the formula . This is an important part of the atmosphere and diatomic oxygen gas constitutes 20.8% of the Earth's atmosphere. Additionally, as oxides the element makes up almost half of the Earth's crust. - Rubidium is a chemical element with symbol Rb and atomic number 37. Rubidium is a soft, silvery-white metallic element of the alkali metal group, with an atomic mass of 85.4678. Elemental rubidium is highly reactive, with properties similar to those of other alkali metals, including rapid oxidation in air. On Earth, natural rubidium comprises two isotopes: 72% is the stable isotope, Rb; 28% is the slightly radioactive Rb, with a half-life of 49 billion yearsmore than three times longer than the estimated age of the universe. - Germanium is a chemical element with symbol Ge and atomic number 32. It is a lustrous, hard, grayish-white metalloid in the carbon group, chemically similar to its group neighbors tin and silicon. Pure germanium is a semiconductor with an appearance similar to elemental silicon. Like silicon, germanium naturally reacts and forms complexes with oxygen in nature. Unlike silicon, it is too reactive to be found naturally on Earth in the free (elemental) state. - Borax, also known as sodium borate, sodium tetraborate, or disodium tetraborate, is an important boron compound, a mineral, and a salt of boric acid. Powdered borax is white, consisting of soft colorless crystals that dissolve easily in water. - Kernite, also known as rasorite is a hydrated sodium borate hydroxide mineral with formula . It is a colorless to white mineral crystallizing in the monoclinic crystal system typically occurring as prismatic to acicular crystals or granular masses. It is relatively soft with Mohs hardness of 2.5 to 3 and light with a specific gravity of 1.91. It exhibits perfect cleavage and a brittle fracture.

Article:","completion":"Title: Unveiling the History Behind Bangkok's Small Brass Plaque: A Riveting Story of Commemoration Introduction For over eight decades, a small brass plaque, no larger than a dinner plate, remained embedded in the tarmac in front of Bangkok's iconic Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall. Having endured relentless vehicular traffic and constantly facing the ravages of time and weather, this unassuming monument which now holds a story of its own. A Glimpse into the History of Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall The Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall has long been a symbol of Thai history and culture. Built between 1907 and 1915, the hall was commissioned by King Chulalongkorn, also known as Rama V, as a magnificent gift for his successor, King Rama VI. A blend of Italian Renaissance and Neo-Classicist architectural styles, the elaborate and highly detailed structure features mesmerizing frescoes, paintings, and sculptures. Throughout its storied history, the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall has played host to numerous important events and meetings and has also served as the seat of parliament in the 20th century. Recognized as a historical building and a museum, the hall stands as a testament to the richness of Thai heritage and the grandeur of its monarchy. The Legend of the Small Brass Plaque With such historical significance attached to the Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall, it is no wonder that the small brass plaque in front of its entrance holds a fascinating tale of commemoration. Although the origins of the plaque remain shrouded in mystery, it is believed to have been placed there sometime in the late 1930s or early 1940s to mark a significant event or achievement in Thai history. Despite the plaque's diminutive size and relatively hidden location, it has managed to capture the curiosity and imagination of locals and tourists alike. For decades, people have speculated about its purpose and the events or individuals it sought to immortalize. Theories have ranged from the plausible to the fantastical, with suggestions that it commemorates everything from the birth of a Thai prince to a secret military campaign. Preservation and Rediscovery of the Plaque As the years passed, the small brass plaque began to succumb to the elements, losing much of its original luster and engraved detail. In recent times, concerned individuals and organizations in Bangkok have taken it upon themselves to protect and restore this captivating piece of local history. Efforts to preserve the plaque have included carefully removing the surrounding tarmac, delicately cleaning the surface, and conducting research to learn more about its provenance and possible significance. The renewed attention and care afforded to this brass artifact has not only led to a deeper appreciation of its historical value among the public but has also inspired numerous articles, studies, and even a documentary about its enigmatic past. Conclusion The small brass plaque that once lay partially-hidden in front of the regal Ananta Samakhom Throne Hall in Bangkok serves as a poignant reminder of history's enduring power over time. As the legacies of kings and queens reverberate through centuries past, seemingly mundane yet alluring artifacts such as this humble plaque become portals to a time that requires our undivided attention, appreciation, and preservation. A testament to the abundant cultural wealth and history of Thailand, the story of the plaque highlights the importance of safeguarding historical artifacts, no matter how small or seemingly inconsequential they may appear. By unraveling the mysteries of our collective past, we gain invaluable insights into the world around us and, in turn, enrich our understanding and appreciation of the human experience."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Bullshit.\\" into Czech, I will perform the following steps: 1. Understand the meaning of the given phrase: The phrase seems to imply that someone is very hungry or has not eaten in a while, and is likely annoyed or frustrated. The word \\"bullshit\\" is likely used as an exclamation or to disbelieve what someone is saying. 2. Break down the sentence into parts: The sentence contains two parts: - \\"Your stomach's going round to meet itself behind your back\\": This is a figurative expression which refers to extreme hunger. - \\"Bullshit\\": This is a slang term that is used to express disbelief or disapproval. 3. Translate the parts individually: - \\"Your stomach's going round to meet itself behind your back\\": In Czech, this figurative expression doesn't have a direct equivalent, so we need to find an expression conveying the meaning of extreme hunger. A Czech expression for extreme hunger is \\"mít hlad jako vlk\\", which means \\"to be hungry as a wolf\\". - \\"Bullshit\\": In Czech, the appropriate slang term for expressing disbelief or disapproval is \\"nesmysl\\", which means \\"nonsense\\" or \\"rubbish\\". 4.

This question is specific to the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) elections that took place in 2017 in Mumbai, India. The BMC is responsible for civic infrastructure and administration in the city of Mumbai. The question is regarding the prospects of five major political parties - the Shiv Sena (SS), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), Indian National Congress (Congress), Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) - in those elections. 2. Will the demonetization move help BJP to win the UP elections of 2017? This question is about the Uttar Pradesh (UP) Legislative Assembly elections that occurred in 2017. Unlike the previous question, this one is specifically focused on the role of demonetization in influencing the outcome of the UP elections. Demonetization refers to the Indian government's decision to withdraw high-denomination currency notes in November 2016, effectively rendering them non-legal tender. The question seeks to explore whether this move had any positive bearing on BJP's chances of winning the UP elections. To summarize, the two questions cannot be considered the same.

They marry and he takes his bride to the family mansion near Flintham in rural Nottinghamshire to meet his mother, Veronica Whittaker and father, Major Jim Whittaker and his two sisters, Hilda and Marion. Veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law, is further disappointed to find that she, like Jim, speaks fluent French. Larita also meets John's former girlfriend and neighbour Sarah Hurst, who is gracious about the marriage. Larita makes some inadvertent gaffes, accidentally killing the family chihuahua and giving some joking advice to Hilda that unfortunately results in embarrassment to, and enmity from, the sisters. Sarah comes to the Whittakers' parties, and to play tennis, accompanied by her brother Philip, on whom Hilda has a crush. Philip, however, is infatuated with Larita, which further angers Hilda. Larita reveals she has been previously married and remains calm in the face of her mother-in-law's disdain. To Larita's disappointment, John is not eager to leave the estate so that they can find a home of their own. Larita is bored and miserable in the countryside and hates blood sports like hunting, and any of the entertainment that country English people seem to enjoy. She reads Lady Chatterley's Lover, shocking the female relatives, and she will not play tennis.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing. I think perhaps the drink helped me to... The answer is:","completion":"The spatial device that Francis Bacon continued to incorporate and used many times throughout his career is the three lines radiating from the central figure. This spatial device was first seen in his painting Crucifixion, 1933, and it became a characteristic element in many of his works. The use of the three radiating lines helped to create a sense of depth and space around the central figure, focusing the viewer's attention on the subject while maintaining the abstract and expressive nature of his artworks. This technique showcases Bacon's innovative approach to art, combining both formal and expressive elements to communicate powerful emotions and concepts through his paintings. Throughout his career, Bacon continued to develop and refine this spatial device, further establishing his unique artistic style and contributing to his reputation as a significant figure in 20th-century art."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a premise: \\"A boy wearing an arm cast lying in a hospital bed\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The boy was recently injured.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"While the premise does not explicitly confirm the hypothesis as true, it does provide a strong basis for making an educated inference about the situation. Let's examine the premise and hypothesis more closely to understand their relationship. Premise: \\"A boy wearing an arm cast lying in a hospital bed\\" From this statement, we can gather some key pieces of information: 1. The subject is a boy. 2. The boy has an arm cast. 3. The boy is lying in a hospital bed. Hypothesis: \\"The boy was recently injured.\\" This hypothesis postulates that the reason behind the boy's current state is due to a recent injury. When we look at the premise, we see that the boy has an arm cast which could indicate that he has suffered an injury that required medical treatment, resulting in his current situation. Furthermore, the fact that he is lying in a hospital bed strengthens this idea, as patients are generally admitted into hospitals when they need medical care, treatment, or observation for their health issues or injuries. However, it is important to note that while there is a strong possibility that the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we cannot definitively say so. There could be alternative reasons for the boy's arm cast or hospital stay. For instance, he might have a medical condition that requires the immobilization of his arm, or he could be at the hospital to visit someone else and coincidentally have an arm cast. In conclusion, while the premise significantly supports the hypothesis that the boy was recently injured, it does not provide concrete evidence to declare the hypothesis as true. We cannot confirm the hypothesis entirely without additional context or information. However, based on the available information in the premise, it is reasonable to infer that the boy's arm cast and hospital stay are most likely the result of a recent injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fish that contain high levels of omega-3 fatty acids are some of the healthiest seafood choices. Salmon, halibut, and sardines are all rich in omegas and delicious additions to your regular diet. Choose your answer from: (A). High-quality fish, on the other hand, don't have much of these fatty acids. One exception is mackerel, since it has a high cholesterol content. (B). Opt for quality fish if you want easy fishing. Best quality seafood means fish that is not excessively high in omega-3 fatty acids. (C). However, they contain high amounts of monounsaturated fats which cause excess oil to build up on the fish. Omega 3 fatty acids will not make the oil inside your fish rubbery nor lift up the scales.

Try grilling salmon or halibut and serving it with a side of vegetables. Eat clams and sardines to boost your b-12 levels. Explanation: (A) is incorrect because it contradicts the statement that fish high in omega-3 fatty acids are the healthiest choices, and mackerel is actually a good source of omega-3 fatty acids despite its cholesterol content. (B) is incorrect because it also contradicts the premise of the paragraph, which promotes choosing fish high in omega-3 fatty acids for their health benefits, rather than avoiding them. (C) is incorrect because it introduces incorrect information about monounsaturated fats and their effects on fish, which is unrelated to the paragraph's main idea of choosing and preparing fish high in omega-3 fatty acids for health benefits.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk. Two neighboring cities had very different health related problems. Twin city had increased air pollution, their people experiencing all kinds of respiratory diseases, while Pine city had problems with age related diseases. Which city had more people exposed to outdoor pollution? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Twin City had increased air pollution, and its people experienced all kinds of respiratory diseases. This suggests that more people in Twin City were exposed to outdoor pollution compared to those in Pine City, where the health problems were mainly related to age-related diseases. The air pollution in Twin City likely resulted from human actions such as industrial production, vehicle emissions, construction, and other activities releasing harmful chemical substances and particles into the air. As a consequence, the outdoor air quality in Twin City was poor, affecting the respiratory health of the people living there. The prevalence of respiratory diseases among the population indicates that many people were exposed to outdoor pollution in that area. On the other hand, Pine City had problems with age-related diseases, but there was no mention of pollution or air quality issues in the provided information. It is possible that the outdoor pollution levels in Pine City were lower than those in Twin City since the primary health issues reported in Pine City were not pollution-related.

Read this and answer the question Thermally, a temperate glacier is at melting point throughout the year, from its surface to its base. The ice of a polar glacier is always below freezing point from the surface to its base, although the surface snowpack may experience seasonal melting. A sub-polar glacier includes both temperate and polar ice, depending on depth beneath the surface and position along the length of the glacier. In a similar way, the thermal regime of a glacier is often described by the temperature at its base alone. A cold-based glacier is below freezing at the ice-ground interface, and is thus frozen to the underlying substrate. A warm-based glacier is above or at freezing at the interface, and is able to slide at this contact. This contrast is thought to a large extent to govern the ability of a glacier to effectively erode its bed, as sliding ice promotes plucking at rock from the surface below. Glaciers which are partly cold-based and partly warm-based are known as polythermal. From where is the temperature of a glacier measured?","completion":"The temperature of a glacier is typically measured at various points along its length, depth, and at its base. A more specific way to describe the thermal regime of a glacier is by the temperature at its base alone, which is the ice-ground interface. This is because the temperature at the base greatly influences the glacier's overall behavior, like its sliding mechanism and its ability to erode the bedrock. In general, a glacier's temperature can be categorized into temperate, polar, sub-polar, cold-based, or warm-based depending on the specific measurement points and the characteristic temperature distribution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Armenians have had a continuous documented presence in Cyprus since 578 AD: according to historian Theophylact Simocatta, during his campaign against the Persian King Chosroes I, Byzantine General Maurice the Cappadocian captured 10,090 Armenians as prisoners in Arzanene, of whom about 3,350 were deported to Cyprus. More Armenians arrived during the reign of Armenian-descended Emperor Heraclius for political reasons and also during the pontificate of Catholicos Hovhannes III Odznetsi for commercial reasons. Flowing on, after the end of Arab raids in Cyprus, more arrived by the patrician Niketas Chalkoutzes for military reasons, when Armenian mercenaries were transferred to Cyprus to protect it. In the middle Byzantine period, Armenian generals and governors served in Cyprus, like Alexios Mousele or Mousere who undertook the construction of Saint Lazarus' basilica in Larnaca. It appears that Saint Lazarus' church had been an Armenian Apostolic church in the 10th century and was used by Armenian-Catholics during the Latin Era as well. The numerous Armenians required an analogous spiritual pastorate, and so in 973 Catholicos Khatchig I established the Armenian Bishopric in Nicosia. Relations between Cyprus and the Armenians became closer when the Kingdom of Cilicia was established. Between 1136-1138, Byzantine Emperor John II Comnenus moved the entire population of the Armenian city of Tell Hamdun to Cyprus. After Isaac Comnenus' wedding to the daughter of the Armenian prince Thoros II in 1185, Armenian nobles and warriors came with him to Cyprus, many of whom defended the island against Richard the Lionheart, when he landed in Limassol.

We sometimes take our loved ones for granted ,and we expect that they will be with us all the time. However, as we all know, life does not work that way and sometimes we get a wake-up call that shocks us and makes us stand back and realize how short life is. To cheer her up, I tried to imagine if I were in her shoes how I would feel. It was impossible to imagine what she was going through. What words could I say to help her?Sometimes words just can't express our feelings. Sometimes our actions are much more meaningful than words. So I gave her a hug ... Life is too short, and we should treasure every day staying with our loved ones. Question: In the writer's opinion, life for us is _ . Options: A: short B: serious C: unexpected D: meaningless A:","completion":"The correct answer, based on the context provided in the article, is likely to be A: Short. The author often reiterates the fleeting nature of life throughout the article, particularly through the use of phrases such as \\"you just don't know when a loved one is no longer going to be with you\\", \\"realize how short life is\\", and \\"Life is too short\\". Option B: Serious, could be a potential answer as the article does deal with a serious topic, losing a loved one. However, the author doesn't explicitly state or particularly emphasize on how serious life is, making it a less fitting option. Option C: Unexpected, is another plausible choice as the article speaks about the unexpected loss of a dear friend's husband. However, it seems the unexpected aspect is mainly utilized to illuminate the unpredictability of life rather than as a general characterization of life itself. Option D: Meaningless, is the least fitting choice as the author displays sentiments of cherishing life and the moments with our loved ones, directly contradicting the notion of life being meaningless. Instead of presenting life as devoid of value, the author urges the readers to value and treasure every day with their loved ones, implying that life, according to the author, is filled with meaning and worth.

Question: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Look no further than the Chocolate Mint Martini. This delightful cocktail combines the elegance of a classic martini with the sweet and refreshing taste of chocolate and mint, making it the perfect drink for a special occasion or a luxurious nightcap. In this article, we will guide you step by step in crafting the perfect Chocolate Mint Martini, from chilling your glass to adding the finishing touches of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and a mint leaf. Let's get started! Step 1: Chill the Martini Glass The first step in creating a flawless Chocolate Mint Martini is to ensure that your glass is adequately chilled. Place your martini glass in the freezer or refrigerator for at least 15 minutes before making your cocktail. This simple step will add an extra touch of class and ensure that your drink stays cold for longer. Step 2: Fill a Cocktail Shaker with Ice Next, take a cocktail shaker and fill it with ice to about halfway. Using a sufficient quantity of ice in the shaker ensures that your cocktail is cold and properly mixed. Step 3: Add Ingredients to the Cocktail Shaker Now, it's time to bring the flavors together. Add the following ingredients to your shaker: - Vodka: The vodka provides a strong base for the drink and complements the sweet and refreshing flavors of the other ingredients. - Crème de Cocoa: This chocolate-flavored liqueur adds a rich and indulgent chocolate taste to the martini. - Crème de Menthe: This mint-flavored liqueur infuses the drink with a refreshing and cooling mint flavor, perfectly balancing the sweetness of the chocolate. - Half-and-Half: This blend of equal parts milk and cream gives the cocktail a delightful creaminess, smoothing out the flavors and adding a touch of luxury. Step 4: Shake the Cocktail Shaker After adding all ingredients to the shaker, securely close the lid and shake vigorously for 15 to 20 seconds. Shaking the mixture ensures proper aeration, blending, and chilling, resulting in a consistency and flavor that are sure to impress. Step 5: Strain and Pour the Mixture Take your chilled martini glass, remove the lid from the shaker, attach a strainer, and pour the mixture into the glass. This step separates the ice from the actual drink, ensuring a perfect pour. Step 6: Garnish the Martini Finally, it's time to add the finishing touches that elevate the Chocolate Mint Martini to a true work of art. Garnish your drink with a dollop of whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and a fresh mint leaf. This not only enhances the visual appeal of the cocktail but also adds contrasting textures and flavors that make each sip even more enjoyable. Conclusion: The Chocolate Mint Martini is a drink that exudes elegance and indulgence. The combination of vodka, crème de cocoa, and crème de menthe, with its creamy texture and delightful garnishes, creates a cocktail that is as beautiful as it is delicious. So, treat yourself to an unforgettable experience by crafting the perfect Chocolate Mint Martini and enjoying each exquisite sip. Cheers!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown.

Here are some detailed steps you can take depending on your current circumstances: a) If your resume is lacking in any of these areas, then focus on enhancing that particular area. For instance, if your skills section is sparse, consider enrolling in short courses to add to your skill sets. You could also volunteer in organizations where you can exercise and refine those particular skills. It is crucial to to get perspective on areas of improvement; you can ask mentors, professors, friends, or career advisors for their input. Taking their advice into consideration could provide valuable insight into how potential employers might perceive your resume. b) If you have plenty of experience but have an outdated section such as contact information for a high school, revise it to reflect your recent educational or professional experiences instead. Remember, a successful career path often involves continuous learning and development. Show this commitment by listing any pertinent extra courses you've taken or any seminars you've attended. Keep your resume up-to-date with the latest industry demands or trends in your field. c) Including writing samples can be a great way to showcase your communication skills, especially if your job would involve significant amounts of writing. Whether it's a published blog post, an article you've written, or a report from a previous job, make sure it's relevant to your career and displays your competence. Convert your writing samples into PDFs if possible, as this format preserves the document’s formatting across various platforms. Black ink is easiest on the eyes and the most professional color choice. d) If your experience includes working in niche areas or industries, you can highlight this as a unique selling point. For instance, if you've had graphic design experiences, create a portfolio section in your resume where you can enumerate the projects you've worked with. This gives employers proof of your expertise. If you're looking to start a new resume, consider opening a professional email account that you use specifically for job applications. This allows potential employers to easily and professionally contact you. Aside from these points, remember to make your resume visually appealing. Use a structured layout, consistent headings, bullets points and maintain a uniform font and text size. Keep the language simple, concise, and jargon-free to the best extent possible. Use active verbs and quantify your achievements whenever possible. After making these improvements, it is essential to review and revise. Have someone else proofread it for you to get an outside perspective. You can also read it out loud to yourself or use grammar checking tools to catch any awkward phrasing or typos.

Context: I’ve shared my feelings about Temple Spa before in my review of Repose Aromatherapy Resting Cream. Basically, my first experience was a very pushy salesperson at a wedding fair several years ago which really put me off the brand, and it took me a while to try their products again. But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold! To apply you just paint the golden mask onto your face with the cute little brush (it makes applying the mask so easy) then leave for 15-20 minutes.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was almost shot after being identified? , can you please find it? Fowzi Nejad was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault. After being identified, he was dragged away by an SAS trooper, who allegedly intended to take him back into the building and shoot him. The soldier reportedly changed his mind when it was pointed out to him that the raid was being broadcast on live television. It later emerged that the footage from the back of the embassy was coming from a wireless camera placed in the window of a flat overlooking the embassy. The camera had been installed by ITN technicians, who had posed as guests of a local resident in order to get past the police cordon, which had been in place since the beginning of the siege. Nejad was arrested, and was eventually tried, convicted, and sentenced to life imprisonment for his role in the siege. He became eligible for parole in 2005. As a foreign national, he would normally have been immediately deported to his home country but Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated into British law by the Human Rights Act 1998, has been held by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit deportation in cases where the person concerned would be likely to be tortured or executed in his home country. Nejad was eventually paroled in 2008 and granted leave to remain in the UK, but was not given political asylum. The Home Office released a statement, saying \\"We do not give refugee status to convicted terrorists. Our aim is to deport people as quickly as possible but the law requires us to first obtain assurances that the person being returned will not face certain death\\". After 27 years in prison, Nejad was deemed no longer to be a threat to society, but Trevor Lock wrote to the Home Office to oppose his release. Because it is accepted by the British government that he would be executed or tortured, he cannot be deported to Iran under the Human Rights Act 1998. He now lives in Peckham, south London, having assumed another identity. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who was almost shot after being identified is Nejad. His full name is Fowzi Nejad, and he was the only gunman to survive the SAS assault during the embassy siege."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the following passage \\"Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources. Incubation periods range from 10 days (in woodpeckers, cuckoos and passerine birds) to over 80 days (in albatrosses and kiwis).\\", answer the following question.

Almost from the word go this film is poor and lacking conviction but then again most people would struggle to show commitment to a script as uninspiring as this. The dialogue really does not flow and sometimes as in this case more is less (or should have been). This is also backed-up by odd scenes (e.g. the Cemetry slow-motion walk) that you think might lead somewhere but only seem to waste a few more seconds of your life.

Mit einer Audio Doppel CD und vorliegendem 3 – DVD Set blicken die eisernen Jungfrauen auf ihre „Dance of Death“ World Tour 2003 zurück. Mitgefilmt wurde die Show in der Dortmunder Westfalenhalle und aufgrund der Datenmenge entschieden sich die Macher Steve Harris und Kevin Shirley dafür das Konzert zweimal in das Package zu stopfen. So bekommt man quasi auf Disc 1 das Konzert in Stereo Sound und auf Disc 2 in 5.1. Dolby Digital und DTS Sound. Gute Sache! Die Show mit der Burg Dekoration war schon der Hammer. Da kommen neue Stracks wie „Dance of Death“ oder „Paschendale“ (beide von Bruce Dickinson mit Kostümen und Masken auch optisch unterstützt) richtig fett und geil rüber. Wenn Klassiker Alarm angesagt ist wechseln die Backdrops zum jeweiligen Artwork von „The Trooper“, „Run to the Hills“, etc.! Auch wird mit „Lord of the Flies“ ein Stück aus der Blaze Bayley Ära gebracht und beim genialen „Journeyman“ die Accoustic Klampfen ausgepackt. Nur noch Bestens – 17 Tracks die in perfekter Qualität (auch was Kamera, Bildschnitt und Ton betrifft) dargeboten werden und jeden Maiden Maniac in Entzückung bringen, da der gute alte Eddie ja auch zweimal zum Einsatz (auf der Bühne jagt er Janick Gers und hinter Nicko Mc. Brain´s Drumset taucht er als Gevatter Tod mit Sense auf) kommt. Die dritte Disc bietet massig Bonus, es wird ausführlich über Album und Tour schwadroniert (75 Min.) und es gibt auch ein Special in dem die witzige, aber auch sehr fleißige Crew zu Wort kommt (45 Min.). Ein weiteres Special widmet sich den Fans, die vor einem England Gig befragt wurden. Da gibt es ganze Maiden Familienausflüge wo Daddy seine Kids (standesgemäß im Eddie Shirt) mitbringt!

Ein weiteres EPK (15 Min.) und die „Wildest Dreams“ und „Rainmaker“ Clips mit Making Of Reportagen so wie endlose Foto und Tourdate Gallerien lassen das Package nie enden.

Donald didn't have a very attractive face like Hunter.","completion":"Donald sighed as he looked into the bathroom mirror, his hands slowly tracing the harsh lines of his face. Hunter, his younger brother, was the golden boy of the family - the athletic, straight-A student with perfect, angular features. He was also blessed with a warm and inviting smile that could make anyone feel like they just found their best friend. In contrast, Donald’s features seemed to be a patchwork of the leftover bits that nature didn’t deem good enough for his brother. Donald couldn't help but envy his brother on more than one occasion. Every day, he witnessed how the world treated Hunter, how doors opened to him solely based on his looks. People weren’t generally unkind to Donald per se, but they didn’t light up in the same way when they saw him. \\"If only I looked like him,\\" Donald thought, \\"maybe I could also experience that attention, that carefree ease that Hunter walks through life with.\\" Unbeknownst to Donald, it wasn't just his looks that made him different. He had a keen intellect, an uncanny ability to work through the most complex problems with ease. Even more remarkably, Donald had an empathetic heart, able to sense and empathize with the emotions of those around him. Throughout his short life, he had made genuine friendships and created strong connections with everyone he encountered. Unfortunately, it was difficult for him to see the worth of his strengths through the fog of envy that clouded his vision. One day, as Donald arrived at school, he noticed a group of his classmates huddled by the entrance. Curious and slightly apprehensive, he approached them to find out what they were discussing so animatedly. To his surprise, he saw a poster advertising an upcoming talent show. With prizes for the best performers, the top prize being a full scholarship to a prestigious arts school, excitement was in the air. All at once, Donald had an idea. While he may not possess his brother’s looks, he knew he had a natural talent for playing the piano. He realized that he could seize this opportunity, a chance to prove himself to the world and, in turn, boost his self-esteem. So, without a moment’s hesitation, he put his name down to participate in the talent show. Word spread fast that Donald would be competing in the talent show, and even Hunter heard the news. Surprisingly, instead of reacting with condescension or mockery, Hunter offered his unwavering support. \\"You got this, Donald,\\" he said, clapping his brother on the back. \\"I've heard you play, and you're a natural. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\\" In the following weeks, Donald threw himself into preparation, spending countless hours practicing and honing his piano skills. Hunter continued to support Donald, even helping him select the perfect piece to perform. The brothers grew closer, and an unspoken bond was forged, built on understanding and respect. Finally, the night of the talent show arrived. Nervous energy buzzed through the auditorium as family, friends, and fellow students gathered to watch the various acts. Donald took the stage, and as the first notes rang out, he felt a calm wash over him. His fingers danced across the keys, pouring his soul into the music. The audience was entranced, and when his performance came to an end, a thunderous applause erupted. Hunter beamed with pride as he watched from the wings, his earlier envy long forgotten in lieu of his brother's success. Donald didn't need looks to share his gift with the world; his heart and talent were more than enough. Ultimately, Donald won the talent show and received the prestigious scholarship. However, the most valuable thing he gained from the experience wasn't the trophy or the applause; it was the understanding that everyone possesses unique gifts and that true beauty lies within the passions and talents one holds close to their heart. From that day onward, Donald embraced his strengths, no longer fixating on the surface-level differences between himself and Hunter. The two brothers, now closer than ever, went on to achieve greatness in their respective fields, forever grateful for the life-changing night that brought them closer together and enlightened Donald to the hidden power within himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although he has played for multiple teams throughout his career in different leagues, there is no specific mention of an award or honor he has received. To draw such a conclusion, further research or additional information about his accomplishments and honors would be necessary. Kasey Peters, born on May 20, 1987, has had an extensive career as an American football quarterback. He played college football at a variety of institutions, including Saddleback, Santa Ana, Grand Valley State, and Rocky Mountain. This range of experience suggests that he has a considerable amount of talent and knowledge in the sport. Following his college career, Peters played professionally for multiple teams. These teams included the Tri-Cities Fever, New Mexico Stars, West Texas Wildcatters, Duke City Gladiators, Las Vegas Outlaws, New Orleans VooDoo, Portland Steel, and Monterrey Steel. This series of engagements across several leagues highlights his adaptability and proficiency in the sport. However, as stated earlier, there is no specific mention of Kasey Peters winning any awards for playing football. While it is possible that he could have earned accolades for his performances, we cannot infer this from the available information alone. To determine if Kasey Peters has indeed won any awards for his football career, a more in-depth examination of his accomplishments and career milestones would be needed. This could involve researching historical records, examining media coverage, or reaching out to his former teams to inquire about his achievements. Without this additional context, we cannot conclusively state that he has won an award for his participation in football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Soon after Leon's arrival, a series of strange occurrences take place in the town, starting with mysterious broadcasts of Adolf Hitler's speeches over the airwaves. Thomas feels that the messages may have a connection with Leon, so he decides to ask the youth about it. Leon denies any knowledge of the broadcasts, but as time goes on, the connection between them becomes too hard to ignore. Thomas can't shake the feeling that the secrets behind the strange events are buried deep in history. Determined to uncover the truth, the two begin a perilous journey investigating the past and visiting World War II sites across Germany to follow the clues leading to the origin of the broadcasts. As they journey, Thomas learns of Leon's ancestors and their connection to a Nazi group that wanted to create a world controlled by Adolf Hitler's ideas. Their search leads them to an abandoned bunker, the site where the group experimented with time travel as a means to change history in their favor. Thomas and Leon discover that the group has been operating covertly until now, trying to expose both Nazi atrocities and the whispers of Hitler's prophecy. The ultimate goal: creating a new Nazi regime in modern-day Germany. As Thomas and Leon uncover the group's plan, they are hunted by its members and must stay ahead of their pursuers. With time running out and the group getting closer to achieving their objective, Thomas and Leon must put their differences aside and work together to stop the rise of a terrifying new era that could threaten the world as we know it.

Unbeknownst to him, Leon is the last living descendant of a powerful line that was responsible for stopping the Nazis in WWII. His existence threatens the group's plans, making the pair's journey even more perilous. Resolution: In the end, Thomas and Leon expose the group's activities, dismantling their operations and thwarting their deadly agenda. With the threat neutralized, Leon decides to embrace his heritage, using the Nazi group's research on time travel for good by studying and preserving the lessons of history.

Barrie play who was the resourceful butler to the Earl of Loam?\\" is Crichton. This character, Crichton, is from the play \\"The Admirable Crichton,\\" which was written by J. M. Barrie, a famous Scottish playwright and novelist who is best known for his creation of Peter Pan. The play was first produced in 1902 and is a biting satire on British class system as well as a commentary on social issues of the time. \\"The Admirable Crichton\\" tells the story of a wealthy, British aristocratic family that becomes stranded on a deserted island after a yachting accident. The protagonist, Crichton, is the Earl of Loam's capable and intelligent butler whose skills and ability to adapt enable the party to survive. As the group is removed from the strictures of the class system and the rules of their society, Crichton replaces the Earl of Loam as the island's natural leader. In the play, Crichton demonstrates various skills, from hunting and fishing to constructing shelters and forging tools. Despite his impressive attributes and abilities, he remains committed to the societal norms that mandate servant and master relationships and insists on addressing the others as \\"my lord\\" or \\"my lady.\\" When the group is eventually rescued, the social order is restored, and Crichton returns to his role as the Earl's butler, without any acknowledgment of his leadership during their time on the island. Over the years, \\"The Admirable Crichton\\" has been adapted into films and television shows, with various actors taking on the role of the resourceful and skilled butler.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of person whose ancestral home was denied to her through agnatic primogeniture? Answer the above question based on the context below: Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"False. The suggested answer does not provide a direct explanation of how sedimentary rock forms. Here is a more appropriate and detailed answer: Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of mineral and organic particles, which are typically derived from the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks. These particles, known as sediment, are transported by wind, water, and ice, and eventually deposited in locations such as riverbanks, lakes, and oceans. Over time, the layers of sediment become buried beneath more sediment, which leads to the compaction of the material under the weight of the overlying layers. The process of cementation then takes place when minerals, such as silica or calcite, precipitate and fill the spaces between the sediment particles, effectively binding them together to form solid rock.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? They rowed.","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"They rowed.\\" can be considered correct by the strictest standards of a linguist. Let's break down the elements of this sentence to understand its correctness from a linguistic point of view: 1. Subject: \\"They\\" is a pronoun functioning as the subject of the sentence. \\"They\\" is the plural third person pronoun in English and can refer to a group of people or things. The usage of a subject is crucial in most sentences to indicate who or what the sentence is about, and \\"They\\" fulfills that criterion here. 2. Verb: \\"rowed\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to row.\\" The verb is essential in conveying the action or state within a sentence. In this case, the action of rowing a boat, which is understood to have taken place in the past, is expressed using the past tense form \\"rowed.\\" The verb agrees with the subject (a plural pronoun) in both tense and number, making it grammatically correct. 3. Sentence structure: The sentence has a simple structure: one subject and one verb. It conveys a complete thought, even if it does not explicitly mention when, where, or how the rowing occurred. As a complete sentence, it can stand alone and still convey meaning. 4. Punctuation: The sentence is punctuated correctly with a period at the end. A period signifies the end of a complete thought and indicates that there is no more information to be gleaned from the sentence. Since this sentence consists of a subject and verb and conveys a complete idea, the period is appropriate. 5. Clarity: Although the sentence is brief, it conveys a clear action performed by the subject. The subject and verb are appropriate for each other, and there is no ambiguity in the meaning of the sentence. 6. No errors: The sentence does not contain any apparent grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors. Considering all these points, a linguist would likely consider \\"They rowed.\\" to be correct, even by the strictest of standards. Despite its brevity, the sentence adheres to the guidelines of proper English grammar and usage, with no mistakes or ambiguity present."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace. - Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819 22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India. - Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning. - Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex. - John Grant Malcolmson VC MVO ( 9 February 1835 -- 14 August 1902 ) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces .

Article: Bringing a giraffe into the world is _ . A baby giraffe is born 10 feet high and usually lands on its back. Within seconds it rolls over its legs under its body. Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality of life. In his book,A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety.

Cardinal Sean Brady must go India is crisscrossed by schools and other institutions run by Jesuits. Yet thanks to India’s dodgy editorial class very few in India know that the Vatican has paid out close to a hundred million dollars to compensate for victims of child sexual abuse by albeit “a small minority” of priests. The Indian media has barely reported that story. Was the media’s heinous silence an act of concern for Indian children or a hideously wrongheaded act of leaving well enough alone ? Abuse of power often happens in plain sight, since to the “busy,busy, busy” lay person, the powerful appear glamorous and formidable and their prey appear to be in many ways, asking for it. Since the past two decades, the Government of India, the Government of my own state, Andhra Pradesh, the Andhra Pradesh High Court , the Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioner have combined to impress on me that what works in India is what I have called the “patronage paradigm” ? the paradigm of shoddiness, irresponsibility, cronyism and corruption” – and that ideas of the rule of law and democratic processes are merely spectacles to lull the gullible. I have been denied the recognition that were commended to me by one former Chief Minister of my state, one former minister of home affairs, one speaker of the Lok Sabha, several prominent ministers of the central cabinet, eminent intellectuals and freedom fighters. I have been unable to earn a decent living. The office of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh incited my neighbours to cut off my water supply. The Indian editorial class published government spin and ostentatiously made me a “non person”. The information commissions in the state and at the centre denied me my right to information on spurious, brazenly illegal grounds and punished me for daring to object. The high court denied me my right to competent counsel and punished me for complaining. Even as we speak, Dr Manmohan Singh”s office, “Daredevil” Pratibha Patil’s Rashtrapati Bhavan, Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, State Information Commissioner CD Arha are all locked in a most perverse and ignominious conspiracy of silence to deny me justice. Even as the Prime Minister’s Office maintains a guilty silence in my case, it appears to have jumped through hoops to heap honour on a businessman alleged to be a serial swindler. What about “civil society” in India ? Since close to a year now, I have written to the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, Campaign for Judicial Accountability And Reform, Forum For Judicial Accountability, MKSS (Aruna Roy) and Anna Hazare regarding this cascading delinquency of constitutional bodies in India. There has not been one constructive response. They all appear to be in helpless denial of the awful truth that an innocent citizen has been hounded and humiliated since two decades, not for any bad behaviour or wrongdoing, but for resisting the dilution of the values of the Indian constitution and standing up for the correct administration of the Right To Information Act 2005.

Write highlights for this article: Stanislas Wawrinka opened his ATP World Tour Finals campaign in stunning fashion with a straight-sets demolition of Tomas Berdych. The Swiss took just 58 minutes to beat his out-of-sorts Czech opponent 6-1, 6-1 and go top of Group A, with world No 1 Novak Djokovic and US Open champion Marin Cilic due to face off later on Monday night. Wawrinka had arrived here having won just one of his last five matches but there was no sign of that recent poor form as he earned an early break in the second game with a nervy Berdych firing a forehand wide. Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland capitalised on a nervy Tomas Berdych to start his campaign in style. Berdych, of the Czech Republic, has not won any of his opening matches at the O2 Arena in London. Berdych has never won his opening match at the O2 Arena and it quickly looked to be heading that way again as a deep return by Wawrinka secured the double break for 4-0. Wawrinka had a set point for a first-serve bagel but Berdych saved with an ace and finally got on the board, before Wawrinka held to wrap up the first set in just 25 minutes. Things got no better for Berdych in the second set as a lengthy third game ended with Wawrinka claiming the break courtesy of his trademark one-handed backhand which was too powerful for Berdych to get back. Wawrinka's victory earned him 200 ranking points as he fightsto keep his place in the world top four. Wawrinka then reeled off the next four games in quick succession to clinch victory, as well as 200 ranking points which will prove handy as he bids to retain his place in the world's top four. Wawrinka said: 'I didn't expect to win that easy in the score, for sure. But I was ready to play well. 'I had a great week of preparation. I worked really, really hard [in the last] few weeks with Magnus [Norman, his coach]. 'Even if the result wasn't there in Basel and Paris, I was feeling the ball really well on the practice court.' The good news for Czech fans is that Berdych has always gone on to win his second match at the ATP World Tour Finals, but the world No 7 will have to drastically improve in his next match on Wednesday if he is to continue that particular streak. Berdych said: 'Unfortunately it was my worst match of the season and I kept it for the start here in the World Tour Finals.' Highlights:","completion":"- Stanislas Wawrinka opens ATP World Tour Finals campaign with a commanding win over Tomas Berdych. - The Swiss player won in straight sets, 6-1, 6-1, taking just 58 minutes to defeat the out-of-sorts Czech. - Wawrinka tops Group A ahead of Novak Djokovic and Marin Cilic's match. - Despite arriving with only one win in his last five matches, Wawrinka's excellent performance secures an early break in the second game. - Berdych's struggle at the O2 Arena in London continues, having never won an opening match at the venue. - Wawrinka clinches victory, earning 200 ranking points to help maintain his position in the world top four. - Berdych admits it was his worst match of the season, needing to improve to continue his streak of winning second matches at the ATP World Tour Finals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Article: NEW YORK--Microsoft on Monday made another effort to challenge Apple's iPhone and Google's Android in the exploding smartphone market--launching a wireless operating system,Windows Phone 7. Consumers will consider it\\"always delightful and thoroughly mine,\\"Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said at a launch event. Ballmer said last year that Microsoft had\\" _ \\"with its Windows Mobile operating system.For example,it failed to keep up with touch-screen innovations that make iPhones and Android phones easy to use. Microsoft fell from third to fourth place in market share this year,behind BlackBerry,iPhone and Android. Only 10.8% of smartphone owners used Microsoft's system in August,down from 18% last December. But Windows Phone 7 is\\"a total departure from anything they've done\\".Microsoft says it sought to simplify common activities. For example,you can instantly take a picture with a phone's camera by pushing a button on the device. You don't have to first awaken it from its sleep mode and launch the camera application. You also can program the phones to automatically upload photos to Facebook or other social network sites in a couple of seconds. Users can easily work with Microsoft Office contact and calendar information as well as documents created in Microsoft's Word,Excel and PowerPoint. The phones will not show videos built on Adobe's Flash platform,widely used by services including YouTube and Hulu. AT&T will offer the first Windows Phone 7 smartphone,the Samsung Focus,on Nov.8.Soon after,it will have the LG Quantum and HTC Surround. Each will cost S| 199.99 with a two-year service contract. T-Mobile will have two Windows Phone 7 models out for the holiday shopping season:the HTC HD7 and Dell Venue Pro. It did not say how much they'll cost.

Use hyphens to combine \\"Euro\\" and \\"Latin American\\": Since these two words together describe a single organization, it is better to use a hyphen to connect them (i.e., \\"Euro-Latin American\\"). 3. Use parentheses for the abbreviation: Enclosing the abbreviation \\"EUROLAT\\" in parentheses helps to signal that it is an alternative way to refer to the organization. 4. Add commas to separate the relative clause: Use commas to separate the relative clause (\\"which brings together MEPs and parliamentarians from Latin America\\") from the main clause, as it is non-restrictive or non-essential information. 5.

Blake was born on January 18, 1970 in Compton, California. He was chiefly inspired by funk and soul artists, such as Roger Troutman (who even taught him the use of the talkbox, which became a trademark for Quik's sound throughout his career) and George Clinton. Out of respect for his beloved friend, Roger Troutman, he retired the talkbox. David's love for music began at 2, as his mother had an extensive record collection. Before recording Safe + Sound, DJ Quik had previously scrapped an album, which he said was so horrible that he had to smash the masters. As DJ Quik began to work on his third album, he started working with Suge Knight again. Their relationship dates back to 1988, before he sought refuge with a major label. He was signed to Suge's independent label Funky Enough Records in 1988. The arrangement proved to be short lived. They linked up again in 1993 for another short lived arrangement. His third album Safe + Sound, released in 1995, made number 14 on the Billboard 200. It featured friends 2nd II None, Kam, Playa Hamm and Hi-C. The album features the singles \\"Dollaz & Sense\\" and \\"Safe + Sound\\". During the process of the album, Quik was feuding with rapper MC Eiht from Compton's Most Wanted and long time friend AMG. Today, he is on good terms with MC Eiht. Safe + Sound saw Suge being the executive producer. His relationship with Suge led him to produce some of the tracks on Above The Rim, Murder Was The Case, All Eyez On Me, Until the End of Time, Better Dayz and It's About Time and was on Death Row Records for a short period but never released an album while on the label. He also produced a 2nd II None album for Death Row Records, which was never released. Quik played a part on the 2Pac album All Eyez On Me, though he is only credited for producing \\"Heartz of Men\\" on that album (in the credits he used his real name, David Blake, because he was under contract to Profile). He also did additional production and mixed half the album in over two days. Quik made another uncredited appearance on a song with 2Pac named \\"Thug Passion\\". He also produced on the albums Dogg Food and Tha Doggfather, although he received no credit. DJ Quik later went to say that he had some of the best times of his life when he worked with the label.","completion":"This text is about David Blake, better known by his stage name DJ Quik, a rapper, songwriter, and record producer from Compton, California."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician who was the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, and served as the junior U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009 and 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. In 2008, she sought and lost the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States to then-Senator Barack Obama. She became the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Context: Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent, and managed a small but successful textile business. Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent. Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony. As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge. She participated swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She has often told a story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program. She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society. She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \\"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\\". For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted, \\"most likely to succeed\\". She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class. Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Rodham was raised in a politically conservative household, and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon, and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.

INSTANT COLOUR TV In 1962 there was only one TV channel in Sweden, and it broadcast in black and white.The station's technical expert, Kjell Stensson, appeared on the news to announce that thanks to a newly developed technology, all viewers could now quickly and easily transform their existing sets to display colour reception.All they had to do was pull a nylon stocking over their TV screen, and they would begin to see their favorite shows in color.Reportedly, hundreds of thousands of people were taken in.Actual color TV transmission only started to appear in Sweden on April 1, 1970. SAN ERRIFFE In 1977 the British newspaper The Guardian published a special seven-page supplement in honor of the tenth anniversary of San Serriffe, a small republic located in the Indian Ocean.A series of articles affectionately described the geography and culture of this unknown nation.The Guardian's phones rang all day as readers asked for more information about the beautiful holiday spot.Few noticed that everything about the island was made up.

Question 1: A can finish a work in 18 days and B can do the same work in 15 days. B worked for 10 days and left the job. In how many days A alone can finish the remaining work? To solve this question, let's calculate: 1. Work done by A in a day. 2. Work done by B in a day. 3. Work done by B in 10 days. 4. Remaining work. 5. Number of days required for A to complete the remaining work. Question 2: 20 workers can finish a work in 30 days. After how many days should 5 workers leave the job so the work is completed in 35 days? To solve this question, let's follow these steps: 1. Calculate work done by 20 workers in a day. 2.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Suggested answer: This process happens when light is available independent of the kind of photosynthesis ( C3 carbon fixation , C4 carbon fixation , and Crassulacean Acid Metabolism ); CAM plants store malic acid in their vacuoles every night and release it by day in order to make this process work. Should I validate this answer?","completion":"It seems like there is some confusion in the provided answer regarding the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis and the different types of photosynthesis strategies. I'll help clarify and provide a more accurate answer: Light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle or dark reactions, occur within the chloroplasts of a plant cell after the light-dependent reactions have produced ATP and NADPH. The main purpose of the light-independent reactions is to use the energy from ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into an organic molecule, ultimately producing glucose or other sugars that the plant can use for growth and other metabolic processes. The different types of photosynthesis strategies (C3, C4, and CAM) primarily refer to different mechanisms of carbon fixation and how plants handle CO2 uptake and its incorporation into organic molecules. 1. C3 plants: These plants use the enzyme RuBisCO to attach CO2 to a five-carbon sugar (RuBP) in the stroma of the chloroplast. The resulting compound is then split into two three-carbon molecules, phosphoglycerate (PGA), which is then subjected to the Calvin cycle in order to produce glucose. 2. C4 plants: This type of photosynthesis is an adaptation to deal with higher temperatures and low CO2 concentrations. In the C4 pathway, plants initially fix CO2 into a 4-carbon compound with the help of the enzyme PEP carboxylase. This compound is shuttled to specialized cells called bundle sheath cells, where it is decarboxylated, releasing CO2, which is then fixed again by RuBisCO in a C3-like Calvin cycle. 3. CAM plants: These plants primarily grow in arid environments where water conservation is crucial. They use a similar mechanism to C4 plants for carbon fixation by initially fixating CO2 using PEP carboxylase into a 4-carbon compound, which is then converted to malic acid. However, unlike C4 plants, CAM plants perform this process at night when stomata are open, and store the malic acid in their vacuoles. During the day, when the stomata are closed to conserve water, the malic acid is released, decarboxylated to release CO2, and then the Calvin cycle proceeds as in C3 plants. In conclusion, the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis, or the Calvin cycle, generally occur the same way across these types of photosynthesis strategies. The main difference between C3, C4, and CAM plants lies in their specific methods of handling carbon dioxide, which are adaptations to different environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. O'Neill was married to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909 to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910-1950). In 1917, O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a successful writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, after their marriage. The years of their marriage--during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona--are described vividly in her 1958 memoir Part of a Long Story. They divorced in 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and the children for the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O'Neill and Carlotta married less than a month after he officially divorced his previous wife. In 1929, O'Neill and Monterey moved to the Loire Valley in central France, where they lived in the Chateau du Plessis in Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher, Indre-et-Loire. During the early 1930s they returned to the United States and lived in Sea Island, Georgia, at a house called Casa Genotta. He moved to Danville, California in 1937 and lived there until 1944. His house there, Tao House, is today the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site. In their first years together, Monterey organized O'Neill's life, enabling him to devote himself to writing. She later became addicted to potassium bromide, and the marriage deteriorated, resulting in a number of separations, although they never divorced. In 1943, O'Neill disowned his daughter Oona for marrying the English actor, director, and producer Charlie Chaplin when she was 18 and Chaplin was 54. He never saw Oona again. He also had distant relationships with his sons. Eugene O'Neill, Jr., a Yale classicist, suffered from alcoholism and committed suicide in 1950 at the age of 40. Shane O'Neill became a heroin addict and moved into the family home in Bermuda, Spithead, with his new wife, where he supported himself by selling off the furnishings. He was disowned by his father before also committing suicide (by jumping out of a window) a number of years later. Oona ultimately inherited Spithead and the connected estate (subsequently known as the Chaplin Estate). In 1950 O'Neill joined The Lambs, the famed theater club.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What became of Shane after his addiction?","completion":"Shane O'Neill became a heroin addict and after moving into the family home in Bermuda with his new wife, he supported himself by selling off the furnishings.

Background: The Academy Juvenile Award, also known as the Juvenile Oscar, was a Special Honorary Academy Award bestowed at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to specifically recognize juvenile performers under the age of eighteen for their \\"outstanding contributions to screen entertainment\\". The trophy itself was a miniature Oscar statuette which stood approximately 7 inches tall. The honor was first awarded by the Academy in 1935 to 6-year-old Shirley Temple for her work in 1934. The Award continued to be presented intermittently over the next 25 years until 1961, when 14-year-old Hayley Mills became the last recipient to be awarded the child-size statuette for her role in Pollyanna. Context: Judy Garland had reportedly lost her award over the years, and in June 1958 contacted the Academy to obtain a replacement at her own expense. The Academy obliged, but asked Garland to sign its well-known right of first refusal agreement covering the duplicate Oscar as well as her original, should it ever turn up. The agreement, put into implementation by the Academy in 1950, states that Oscar recipients or their heirs who want to sell their statuettes must first offer the Academy the opportunity to buy the Oscar back for the sum of 10. (An amount which was subsequently dropped to 1 in the 1980s.) After her death in 1969, many of Garland's personal effects came into the possession of her former husband, Sidney Luft who attempted to sell a miniature Oscar statuette at a Christie's auction in 1993. Upon learning of the impending auction, the Academy quickly filed a legal injunction to halt the sale of the Award and, after some research, determined that the statuette in question was Garland's 1958 replacement Oscar, using photographs that showed the original 1940 statuette's unique base differed from the one being put up for auction. The courts ruled in the Academy's favor in 1995 and ordered Luft to return the 1958 statuette to the Academy; prompting Luft to instead turn the award over to daughter Lorna Luft who had expressed a desire to keep it in the family. In 2000, a second statuette was put up for auction, which the Academy determined this time to be Garland's long-lost \\"original\\" 1940 Oscar. After once again tracing the auction back to Sidney Luft, the Academy again took legal action to halt the sale claiming the 1940 statuette fell under the terms of the agreement Garland had signed in 1958. The Academy again won its lawsuit in 2002 and Luft was ordered to turn the 1940 statuette over to the Academy. In February 2010, Garland's original 1940 Juvenile Oscar was put on display to the public at an exhibit held by the Academy in New York City called \\"Meet The Oscars\\". As of 2011, its 1958 replacement is believed to still be in the possession of Garland's youngest daughter, Lorna Luft. Question: What was the Lost Garland Award? Answer:","completion":"The Lost Garland Award was a special Oscar trophy given to Judy Garland when she was young for her great acting in movies. It was called \\"lost\\" because, over time, Judy Garland could not find her original award and asked for a new one, which she got in 1958. Later, after she passed away, her original award from 1940 showed up in an auction by her former husband, Sidney Luft. The people who give the Oscars said it couldn't be sold and they won the case in court to stop the sale. Both original and replacement awards ended up with the Oscars' people and with Judy Garland's family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Protect your computer from viruses and malware The next step in maintaining your computer is ensuring that it is protected against viruses, malware, and other threats. Installing a reliable antivirus and anti-malware program is essential to prevent cyber attacks and unauthorized access to your data. Some popular antivirus software options include Norton, McAfee, Avast, AVG, and Bitdefender. Most of these programs offer a combination of free and paid packages, with the paid versions providing advanced features and enhanced protection. In addition to installing security software, regularly updating your operating system, applications, and antivirus programs is crucial to keeping your computer protected. Updates can address security vulnerabilities, fix bugs, and add new features that enhance your computer's performance and stability. To ensure that you are running the latest version of your operating system and applications, enable automatic updates in your system settings. This will ensure that updates are installed as soon as they are available, minimizing the risk of being exposed to security threats. In this paragraph, we will discuss the process of defragmenting, optimizing your hard drive and running system diagnostics. Optimizing your hard drive and running system diagnostics One of the key components of a well-performing computer is an optimized hard drive. Over time, files on your hard drive can become fragmented, leading to slower performance and reduced efficiency. To combat this issue, it is important to routinely defragment and optimize your hard drive. Windows users can utilise the built-in Disk Defragmenter or Optimize Drives utility to automatically defragment and optimize their hard drive, while macOS users can enable automatic optimization through the Disk Utility application. Running system diagnostics is another important aspect of computer maintenance. This process involves checking your computer's hardware and software components to ensure that they are functioning optimally. There are several diagnostic tools available, some built into the operating system and others available for download. For Windows users, the Performance Monitor and Resource Monitor can be used to assess system performance and troubleshoot issues, while macOS users can utilise the built-in Activity Monitor and Console applications. Third-party diagnostics tools such as AIDA64, HWMonitor, and Speccy offer additional features and information, often providing a more comprehensive analysis of your computer's performance and health. In conclusion, maintaining your computer involves performing regular tasks such as cleaning up browser junk, protecting against viruses and malware, updating software, optimizing your hard drive, and running system diagnostics. By taking the necessary steps to ensure your computer's health, you can enjoy better performance, prolonged life, and increased security for your device. Regular maintenance will also help you identify and address any potential issues before they have a chance to escalate into more serious problems, ultimately saving you time, frustration, and potential data loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Bill and Paul were farmers. Bill used insecticides to get read of aphids, while his buddy farmer Paul didn't. Which farmer didn't use a strong water jet to kill aphids? A:","completion":"In this situation, Bill and Paul were both farmers dealing with aphids, which are small insects that can cause damage to crops. While Bill used insecticides to control the aphids on his farm, Paul did not use any insecticides for the same purpose. It is stated in the question that one of the farmers didn't use a strong water jet to kill aphids. Based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine which of the farmers, Bill or Paul, didn't use the strong water jet method for controlling aphids. There is no information provided about their specific methods beyond the fact that Bill used insecticides and Paul did not. It is important to note that using a strong water jet to kill aphids is one of the non-chemical methods for aphid control. This technique involves using water pressure to dislodge the aphids from the plants, making it difficult for them to return and causing many of them to die in the process. This approach can be useful for small-scale aphid control, such as in home gardens, but may not be as effective for large-scale farming operations. However, based on the given information, it would be reasonable to assume that Paul might be more likely to use non-chemical methods like the strong water jet, since he avoided using insecticides. Nonetheless, the specific choice of method for each farmer could involve various factors such as their personal preference, prior experience, or even the type of plants they grow. In conclusion, while we cannot definitively answer which farmer didn't use a strong water jet to kill aphids based on the information provided, it is more likely that Bill, who used insecticides for aphid control, didn't use the strong water jet method, while Paul, who didn't use insecticides, might have chosen this method, given that he might be more open to non-chemical methods of control. However, further information would be required to confirm this assumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. Approaching the bear startled it so we gave it honey instead of water as the","completion":"situation demanded a different course of action. The bear seemed delighted at the honey, and its eyes sparkled with curiosity and excitement. As the bear carefully sniffed the container of honey and put its paw inside, the thick, golden liquid stuck to its fur, creating a messy sight. We realized we had a unique opportunity to form a bond with this magnificent creature by offering something irresistible and responding to its immediate needs. Seeing the bear enjoy the honey reminded us of the simple pleasures that nature provides and the importance of respecting the wild animals that roamed the forests. However, it got us thinking about the broader ecosystem and the role humans played in it. The bear, which had previously been roaming the woods searching for sources of nutrition, might have been weakened by a diminishing food supply caused by human activities, such as deforestation and pollution. The water supply, which we originally planned to offer the bear, could have been compromised as well by similar factors. Watching the bear meticulously savor every drop of honey, we marveled at the adaptability of these creatures in an ever-changing environment. They had learned to seek alternative food sources and navigate the challenges they faced, with their keen senses and powerful bodies. It was a process of constant learning and adaptation, driven by the desire to survive and thrive in a complex world. As we observed the bear, we couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility towards the conservation of their habitat. The importance of protecting these animals and the environment they depend on became clearer than ever. We realized that our actions, both individually and collectively, had tremendous consequences for the natural world and all the living beings that inhabit it. In that moment, standing beside the honey-covered bear, we became more aware of our role in the global ecosystem. We stood in awe of the strength and grace of this wild animal, but also of the vulnerability that surrounded it. Our newfound insight into the delicate balance of life was a call to action that could no longer be ignored. We resolved to become advocates for the environment and its inhabitants, dedicating ourselves to the conservation and preservation of wildlife and their habitats. The lessons we learned from the bear, coupled with the knowledge of our own power to make a difference, fueled us with passion and determination. We began by raising awareness about the importance of protecting these animals and their environments, through social media campaigns, community events, educational initiatives, and collaboration with local wildlife shelters. In time, our efforts grew into a movement that inspired others to join us in our quest to ensure a brighter, more sustainable future for all living creatures. And so, the encounter with the bear changed us fundamentally, opening our eyes to the profound interconnectedness of all life. It was a reminder that even a simple act of kindness, such as offering honey instead of water, could inspire a cascade of positive change that extended far beyond that one interaction. As we continue our mission to protect and conserve the natural world, we carry with us the memory of the bear as a symbol of the delicate balance between human beings and the environment. It serves as a constant reminder of our responsibility to one another and to the vibrant, diverse, and awe-inspiring tapestry of life that we share this planet with."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided question and answer, it is clear that the suggested answer does not address the main question about the composition of a slug's slime. Instead, it provides information on semislugs and their shell characteristics. Therefore, you should not validate this answer. To provide clarity on the original question, a slug's slime is primarily made of water, glycoproteins, and salts. The glycoproteins give the slime its characteristic mucus-like texture, while the salts and other ions aid in hydration, movement, and protection. The slime serves various purposes for the slug, including facilitating movement across surfaces, retaining moisture, deterring predators, and aiding in mating. So, the correct answer should be something like the following: Slug slime is primarily composed of water, glycoproteins, and salts, and serves multiple purposes for the slug, such as locomotion, moisture retention, predator deterrence, and mating."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of Davey's mother? from the following article ?

He proposes to her and tells her to get ready for the wedding in an hour. He rushes to search for the English church. On the way he meets his superior, who tells him that he has to report immediately, they have to leave Paris. He doesn't even have the time to see his fiancé again. After returning to fight on the front, he suffers from shellshock and forgets everything that happened in the last four years. After recovering he goes back to his wealthy life of rich industrialist, marries a British Socialite, with whom he runs entirely separate lives. She is the one to invite Deloryse to London to dance on one of her charity events. While dancing and singing on the stage she sees him in a loge. During her second number, where she sings the same song of when he met her in Paris, he finally has a flash back of the song and the singer.

Tämä raportti kattaa erilaisia näkökulmia ja asioita, jotka on otettava huomioon, kun siirrymme yhteisvaluutta euroon. Monet näistä menettelyistä vaativat yhteistyötä ja koordinointia Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioiden sekä komission ja Euroopan keskuspankin välillä. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että meidän on tehtävä tiivistä yhteistyötä ja viestintää, jotta voimme saavuttaa yhtenäisen valuutta-alueen Euroopassa. Yksi keskeinen osa euron käyttöönottoon liittyvistä menettelyistä on jäsenvaltioiden rahapoliittinen yhdentyminen. Tämä merkitsee sitä, että jäsenvaltioiden on tarkistettava, että täyttävät kaikki euron käyttöönoton kriteerit, kuten julkisen talouden alijäämän ja velkatason. Jäsenvaltioiden on myös varmistettava, että kansallinen lainsäädäntö on yhdenmukaistettu Euroopan unionin sekundäärilainsäädännön kanssa, ja että kansalliset keskuspankit integroituvat Euroopan keskuspankkijärjestelmään. Toinen monimutkainen menettely on kansallisten valuuttojen vaihtokurssien kiinnittäminen euroon. Tämä tarkoittaa, että jäsenvaltioiden on sovittava keskenään ja Euroopan keskuspankin kanssa niiden valuuttojen suhteellisista arvoista, jotka tullaan korvaamaan eurolla. Tämä prosessi sisältää keskeisesti myös vaihtokurssimekanismi (ERM II) -järjestelmän käyttöönoton, jonka tarkoituksena on varmistaa valuuttojen vakaus ennen euron käyttöönottoa. Kolmas monimutkainen menettely on euron fyysisten setelien ja kolikoiden tuotanto ja jakelu. Tämä vaatii merkittävää koordinointia ja yhteistyötä eri tahojen välillä, kuten Euroopan keskuspankin, kansallisten keskuspankkien ja rahapajojen. Lisäksi jäsenvaltioiden on varmistettava, että kansalaiset tietävät ja ymmärtävät euron käyttöönottoon liittyviä muutoksia, kuten valuutanvaihtoa ja uusien seteleiden ja kolikoiden tunnistamista. Näiden monimutkaisten menettelyjen lisäksi herra Langen raportti korostaa, että euron käyttöönotto edellyttää myös poliittista sitoutumista ja yhteisvastuullisuutta jäsenvaltioiden välillä. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että meidän on yhdessä sitouduttava euron onnistuneeseen käyttöönottoon ja sen tuomiin etuihin, kuten taloudellisen integraation syventämiseen, hintavakauden takaamiseen ja kilpailukyvyn vahvistamiseen Euroopan unionin alueella. Kokonaisuudessaan tämä raportti kuvastaa sitä, kuinka monimutkaisia ja yhteistyötä vaativia menettelyjä meidän on vielä suoritettava ennen yhteisvaluutta euron käyttöönottoa.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: To crush garlic cloves, you can Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal? Available choices: a). Use a cheesegrater to crush them; b). Use a metal cooking mallet;","completion":"To accomplish the goal of crushing garlic cloves, both methods mentioned could potentially work. However, it is essential to consider the advantages, disadvantages, and intended use of crushed garlic to decide which method makes the most sense. Below, I have provided a detailed analysis of both options: a). Using a cheesegrater Advantages: 1. Finely grated garlic: A cheesegrater, especially one with small holes, will produce finely grated garlic, which can easily be spread and incorporated into a variety of dishes. 2. Uniform distribution: The small particles created by the graters help in achieving an even distribution of garlic flavor in recipes. 3. Quick process: Cheese graters typically grate foods quickly, which will speed up the cooking process. Disadvantages: 1. Increased waste: Since the grated garlic is very small, more garlic will be stuck on the grater's surface, which can be difficult to extract and use. This leads to wastage. 2. More tedious cleaning: Graters have many nooks and crannies that can trap the garlic, making them more challenging to clean. 3. Risk of injury: By holding the garlic cloves close to a grater, you run the risk of accidentally grating your fingers as well. b). Using a metal cooking mallet Advantages: 1. Effectively crushed garlic: A metal cooking mallet can easily crush the garlic cloves, which emparts a robust flavor to the dish you are preparing. 2. Less waste: Compared to grating, using a mallet is more accurate and doesn't waste as much garlic. 3. Easier cleaning: A metal mallet is easier to clean since it has a smooth surface and no hidden compartments. 4. Additional uses: A versatile tool in the kitchen, a mallet can be used to tenderize meat, pound dough, or crack nuts, in addition to crushing garlic. Disadvantages: 1. Less uniform distribution: The crushed garlic can be uneven and chunkier, which may lead to an inconsistent flavor profile in your dish. 2. Potential mess: Since you're crushing garlic using force, there is a possibility that it could spread all over your countertop, creating a messy work area. After considering both methods, using a metal cooking mallet (option b) makes more sense to accomplish the goal of crushing garlic cloves. It is more efficient, produces less waste, and is easier to clean. While the garlic might not be as finely crushed as when using a cheesegrater, it will still effectively add flavor to your dishes. The metal cooking mallet is also a more versatile tool in your kitchen."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Near the village, there is an old famous temple.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In April 1999 Combs was charged with assault as a result of an incident with Steve Stoute of Interscope Records. Stoute was the manager for Nas, with whom Combs had filmed a video earlier that year for the song \\"Hate Me Now\\". Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous. He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after it aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute's offices and injured Stoute. Combs was charged with second-degree assault and criminal mischief, and was sentenced to attend a one-day anger management class. Forever, Combs' debut solo studio album, was released by Bad Boy Records on August 24, 1999, in North America, and in the UK on the following day. It reached number two on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it remained for one week before being knocked off by Mary J. Blige's fourth album, Mary. The album received positive to mixed reviews from music critics and spawned three singles that have charted on the Billboard charts. It peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart, Combs' highest-charting album in that country. On December 27, 1999, Combs and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were at Club New York in Manhattan when gunfire broke out. After a police investigation, Combs and fellow rapper Shyne were arrested for weapons violations and other charges. Combs was charged with four weapons-related charges and bribing his driver, Wardel Fenderson, to claim ownership of his gun. With a gag order in place, the highly publicized trial began. Combs' attorneys were Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Benjamin Brafman. Combs was found not guilty on all charges; Shyne was convicted on five of his eight charges and sentenced to ten years in prison. Combs and Lopez broke up shortly after. A lawsuit filed by Fenderson, who said he suffered emotional damage after the shooting, was settled in February 2004. Lawyers for both sides, having agreed to keep the settlement terms secret, said that the matter was \\"resolved to the satisfaction of all parties\\".

Visibly in pain, he begins dictating a confession into a Dictaphone for his friend and colleague, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a brilliant claims adjuster. The story, told primarily in flashback, ensues. Neff first meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (Tom Powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. They flirt, until Phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. However, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \\"double indemnity\\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value. After Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis drives him to the train station for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion. Neff is hiding in the backseat and kills Dietrichson when Phyllis turns onto a deserted side street. Then, Neff boards the train posing as Dietrichson and using his crutches. He makes his way to the last car, the observation car, and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks by his crutches.

Such a thing has just happened in a school in the UK. Nottingham East Academy, a school in the UK, has established a non-homework policy recently. The school plans to give an extra lesson and provide more activities for students to do at school. So the students no longer need to do homework after class. When the school announced this policy , students , parents and teachers were all shocked. The school , Nottingham East Academy , is the country's largest school. It has a total of 3,570 students. Barry Day, the president of the school, thinks that homework is unnecessary and can easily cause argument both at home and at school. He once told the local newspaper ,\\" People give homework for children to do simply because they think it should be given. Actually, homework doesn't help with education at all.\\" Letting kids leave their homework at school is becoming popular in the UK. Several other schools are welcoming the policy and are taking similar measures .Tiffin Boy's school has started giving students less homework. Students now spend less time on homework.

(Instyle.com) -- It has been nearly 30 years since Princess Diana walked down the aisle at St. Paul's Cathedral and the world is anxious for another royal wedding of the same fairy tale proportions. And if Kate Middleton and Prince William's appearance at their friends' wedding over the weekend in England is any indication, the wait may be almost over. The usually publicity-shy couple arrived together for the festivities in Gloucestershire and even smiled for photographers when exiting the church.

So if your American or English friend asks you to dinner, he usually invites you a week ahead. But if you really have no time and can't go to the dinner, you can ring him to say sorry. The dinner is usually served at home, sometimes at a restaurant. You should get there on time, and don't forget to put on your fine clothes. It is also a good idea to take some little presents to your friend, such as flowers, chocolates and so on. When you are at dinner, you should also observe some other customs. Here I'll give you some dos and don'ts about them in the following: 1) Don't leave bones on the table or the floor. (You should put them on your plate with fingers.) 2) Don't use your bowl to drink soup, but use your spoon to help you instead. 3) Don't talk with much food in your mouth. 4) Don't ask others to have more wine. (This is quite different from that in China.) 5) After dinner, use your napkin to clean your mouth and hands. 6) Make sure small pieces of food are not left on your face. Then after dinner, you can stay there a little time. And your friend will be pleased if you leave in half an hour or so. Next day, you had better ring him up to thank him for the good dinner.

Here's a step-by-step justification: 1. Contact is made with a virus: A virus outside the body comes into contact with a host, either through physical touch, ingestion, or inhalation. 2. The virus enters the human or animal body: The virus penetrates the host's body and infects cells, usually by attaching itself to a receptor on the host cell's surface. 3. The virus goes to the part of the body that contains its food: Viruses use the host's cellular machinery to reproduce, so they target cells that have the necessary resources for replication. 4. The virus consumes part of the body or materials that the body uses: The virus hijacks the host cell, using its resources and machinery to make multiple copies of itself. 5. The virus replicates and spreads: The newly produced virus particles are released from the host cell and spread throughout the body, infecting other cells and potentially being transmitted to other individuals.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day? Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave. Hint: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Answer:","completion":"Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day. Justifying this, first, we need to look at the living conditions and lifestyle of both Jason and Brad. Jason lives in an environment where his circadian rhythm, meaning his biological clock that runs on a 24-hour cycle, is likely regulated by the natural pattern of day and night. This schedule would therefore encourage eating at regular times. Conversely, Brad lives in a dark cave with almost no natural light. The lack of light can disrupt his circadian rhythm, possibly making his eating habits irregular as his biological clock may not align with the typical 24-hour cycle due to absence of light cues. The paragraph also hints at the fact that circadian rhythms and the biological clock are influenced by light. Jason with his exposure to natural light is likely maintaining regular patterns including eating habits. Therefore, Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish. People from two villages ate lots of salt.

Information: - Sicyon (\\"gen\\".: ) was an ancient Greek city state situated in the northern Peloponnesus between Corinth and Achaea on the territory of the present-day regional unit of Corinthia. An ancient monarchy at the times of the Trojan War, the city was ruled by a number of tyrants during the Archaic and Classical period and became a democracy in the 3rd century BC. Sicyon was celebrated for its contributions to ancient Greek art, producing many famous painters and sculptors. In Hellenistic times it was also the home of Aratus of Sicyon, the leader of the Achaean League. - James Loeb (August 6, 1867 May 27, 1933) was a German-born American banker, Hellenist and philanthropist. - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself. - Argos (Modern Greek: ; Ancient Greek: ) is a city in Argolis, Peloponnese, Greece and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is also a former bishopric and present Latin Catholic titular see. It is the biggest town in Argolis and a major center for the area. Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km. It is from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years. The city is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network. - Antipater of Thessalonica was the author of over a hundred epigrams in the \\"Greek Anthology\\". He is the most copious and perhaps the most interesting of the Augustan epigrammatists. He lived under the patronage of Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul in BC 15 and then proconsul of Macedonia for several years), who appointed him governor of Thessalonica. - Achaea or Achaia, sometimes transliterated from Greek as Akhaïa (\\"Achaïa\\"), is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of West Greece and is situated in the northwestern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. The capital is Patras. Since 2001, the population has exceeded 300,000. - Zenobius was a Greek sophist, who taught rhetoric at Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138). - Aratus (271213 BC) was a statesman of the ancient Greek city-state of Sicyon and a leader of the Achaean League. He deposed the Sicyonian tyrant Nicocles in 251 BC. Aratus was an advocate of Greek unity and brought Sicyon into the Achaean League, which he led to its maximum extent. He was elected \\"strategos\\" many times and led the Achaeans against Macedonia, the Aetolians and the Spartans. After the Spartans defeated and nearly destroyed the cities of the Achaean League, he requested Antigonus Doson of Macedonia to help fight against the Aetolians and Spartans. After Antigonus died in 222 BC, Aratus did not get along with Philip V of Macedon, who wanted to make the Achaean League subject to Macedonia. Polybius and Plutarch record that Philip had Aratus poisoned. - Sappho (Attic Greek , Aeolic Greek , \\"Psappho\\" ) (c. 630 c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and survives only in fragmentary form. As well as lyric poetry, three epigrams attributed to Sappho are preserved, but these are in fact Hellenistic imitations. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Praxilla of Sicyon ( Greek : ) , was a Greek lyric poet of the 5th century BC. She was a contemporary of Telesilla . Antipater of Thessalonica lists her first among his canon of nine \`\` immortal - tongued '' women poets She was highly esteemed in her time . Evidence of this is shown in that Lysippus , a famous sculptor , made a bronze statue of her . In addition to this statue a vase was found with the first four words of a poem , she had written , on it . \`\` Further evidence for the reception of her work in the fifth century BC comes from the comic playwright Aristophanes , who parodied lines from her poetry both in the Wasps ( 1238 ) and the Thesmophoriazusae ( 528 ) . Not only did he know her work , but his parody implies that he expected his Athenian audience to recognize it too . '' Not much of her works survive , only eight fragments of her work .

The General Editor is Jeffrey Henderson, holder of the William Goodwin Aurelio Professorship of Greek Language and Literature at Boston University. - Thesmophoriazusae (\\"Thesmophoriazousai\\"; meaning \\"Women Celebrating the Festival of the Thesmophoria\\", sometimes also called The Poet and the Women) is one of eleven surviving plays by Aristophanes. It was first produced in , probably at the City Dionysia. The play's focuses include the subversive role of women in a male-dominated society; the vanity of contemporary poets, such as the tragic playwrights Euripides and Agathon; and the shameless, enterprising vulgarity of an ordinary Athenian, as represented in this play by the protagonist, Mnesilochus. The work is also notable for Aristophanes' free adaptation of key structural elements of Old Comedy and for the absence of the anti-populist and anti-war comments that pepper his earlier work. It was produced in the same year as \\"Lysistrata\\", another play with sexual themes. - In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably through Homer's \\"Iliad\\". The \\"Iliad\\" relates four days in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the \\"Odyssey\\" describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid. - Adonis, in Greek mythology, is a central figure in various mystery religions. In 1966, Wahib Atallah wrote that the \\"cult of Adonis belonged to women\\", and further asserted \\"the cult of dying Adonis was fully developed in the circle of young girls around Sappho on Lesbos, about 600 BC, as a fragment of Sappho reveals.\\" - The Greek Anthology is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that span the classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature. Most of the material of the \\"Greek Anthology\\" comes from two manuscripts, the \\"Palatine Anthology\\" of the 10th century and the \\"Anthology of Planudes\\" (or \\"Planudean Anthology\\") of the 14th century. - Lysistrata (or ; Attic Greek: , \\"Army Disbander\\") is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career. It was produced in the same year as the \\"Thesmophoriazusae\\", another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition. - The Achaean League (Greek: ), also known as the Aegean League, was a Hellenistic-era confederation of Greek city states on the northern and central Peloponnese. The first league was formed in the 5th century BC. The second Achaean League existed between 280 BC and 146 BC. The league was named after the region of Achaea. - Telesilla (fl. 510 BC) was an ancient Greek poet, native of Argos. She was a distinguished woman who was especially renowned for her poetry and for her leadership of Argos through a political and military crisis and subsequent re-building. - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis. - Thesmophoria was a festival held in Greek cities, in honor of the goddesses Demeter and her daughter Persephone. The name derives from \\"thesmoi\\", or laws by which men must work the land. The Thesmophoria were the most widespread festivals and the main expression of the cult of Demeter, aside from the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Thesmophoria commemorated the third of the year when Demeter abstained from her role of goddess of the harvest and growth; spending the harsh summer months of Greece, when vegetation dies and lacks rain, in mourning for her daughter who was in the realm of the Underworld. Their distinctive feature was the sacrifice of pigs. - Latin literature includes the essays, histories, poems, plays, and other writings written in the Latin language. Beginning around the 3rd century BC, it took two centuries to become a dominant literature of ancient Rome, with many educated Romans still reading and writing in Ancient Greek, as late as Marcus Aurelius (121180 AD). Latin literature was in many ways a continuation of Greek literature, using many of the same forms.

Highly concentrated sources of oxygen promote rapid combustion. Fire and explosion hazards exist when concentrated oxidants and fuels are brought into close proximity; an ignition event, such as heat or a spark, is needed to trigger combustion. Oxygen is the oxidant, not the fuel, but nevertheless the source of most of the chemical energy released in combustion. Combustion hazards also apply to compounds of oxygen with a high oxidative potential, such as peroxides, chlorates, nitrates, perchlorates, and dichromates because they can donate oxygen to a fire.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Lawsuit forces famed pickle dealer Guss' Pickles to change its name BY Jeff Wilkins and Carrie Melago DAILY NEWS WRITERS Friday, July 31st 2009, 8:34 AM Owner Pat Fairhurst seen at Guss' Pickles on Orchard St. Manhattan, which will move to Brooklyn. There's never a dill moment for pickle purveyors. A landmark lower East Side pickle store will have to change its name when it moves to Brooklyn, the end result of a briny legal battle. Guss' Pickles, immortalized in the 1988 film \\"Crossing Delancey,\\" will have to leave behind its famous moniker when owner Pat Fairhurst sets up shop in Borough Park. \\"It doesn't matter what our name is. People are going to know where I'm going,\\" said Fairhurst, who has owned the store since 2004. \\"I'll put whatever I want on the sign, and they'll still come because it's our pickles they want.\\" Fairhurst revealed this week that she will move the landmark shop thanks to high rent, lower sales and a parking meter planted in front of her trademark barrels. But keeping the store's name the same? That just wouldn't be kosher under a 2007 settlement between Fairhurst and Steve and Andrew Leibowitz, a father and son duo who also laid claim to the Guss' Pickles name. Both pickle peddlers insisted they had the true connection to Isidor Guss, the Polish immigrant who sold pickles from a pushcart in the lower East Side and later opened up the shop. Fairhurst took over the institution from Harold Baker, who had purchased it from Guss' family after the patriarch's death. But the Leibowitzes, who run United Pickle in the Bronx, also had a long relationship with the store and bought the rights to the name. Son Andrew Leibowitz's company, Crossing Delancey Pickle Enterprises, opened a Guss' Pickle shop in Cedarhurst in 2001. Fairhurst sued him in 2006, then Andrew Leibowitz countersued. A 2007 settlement allowed Fairhurst to use the name only at her Orchard St. location. That decision left a bad taste in Fairhurst's mouth, and she has nothing but sour words about it to this day. \\"We have a following, they don't,\\" she says simply. The Leibowitz's hope the move will bring an end to the sticky pickle predicament at long last. \\"I wish her all the luck in the world in her new location - as long as she doesn't use our name,\\" said Steve Leibowitz.

Answer the following question: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today. The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Where can we most probably read this passage? A) In a biography of scientists.

Rumor has it that the megaplex is haunted by a \\"phantom\\", someone who was trapped inside the old movie theater that was demolished to build the current megaplex. Pete, senior manager Shawn MacGibbon, the other employees, and an elderly member of the family who once owned the original theater known as \\"Movie Mason\\" (played by Mickey Rooney) who loves movies and thinks he works at the megaplex, are working to prepare the theater for the star-studded premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster \\"Midnight Mayhem\\". Wolfgang Nedermeyer, the owner of the megaplex, is to be among the guests. To Pete's disappointment, he is forced to bring along his younger siblings, 13-year-old Karen and 12-year-old Bryan, to the theater while their widowed mother goes out on a date with her boyfriend George. Pete dumps his siblings in a movie (which Karen ditches to see a horror movie with her friends) so he can focus on setting up for the premiere, but problems begin to pop up all through the megaplex. The other movies begin to suffer mishaps, which Karen and Bryan realize are all related to the titles of the films being shown (for example, a theater showing a movie called \\"Cyclone Summer\\" has a giant fan moved in front of the screen, which blows everyone out of their seats). Pete, Karen, and Bryan work together and discover that the rumored phantom is behind these acts of sabotage. Through online spoilers, Bryan and Karen are able to learn the movie's plot, and Pete is able to stop the phantom from sabotaging the premiere. The phantom is revealed to be Shawn, who Nedermeyer immediately fires; however, Shawn explodes with anger as he did all this so Nedermeyer would finally notice him (and get his name right, since he never did).

Climate change: Durban must finish what Kyoto began There is, of course, already a legally binding deal in place: the Kyoto Protocol. In 1997, 37 major economies formally committed to cutting emissions. The EU has already surpassed its Kyoto target. But the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period ends next year and several countries have already said they will not enter a second. If the EU alone signs up, accounting for just 12pc of global emissions, then we won’t have achieved much. What we need is for all major emitters – from industrialised countries such as the EU, US and Japan, to emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil – to commit at Durban to a comprehensive global legal framework, and to complete negotiations as soon as possible and by 2015 at the latest. Together with the rest of the EU, I have made it clear that the UK is keen to secure a second commitment period of Kyoto. But this must be accompanied by the legal framework the world needs. Ultimately, Durban is about the movement others make. If we have learnt anything from the financial crisis, it is that clear rules implemented properly can prevent the toxic build-up of risk. A recent survey of large global firms found that 83pc of business leaders think a multilateral agreement is needed to tackle climate change. Businesses want certainty; only the politics lags behind. A commitment to a new agreement will provide that certainty – and Kyoto provides the basis of the rules we need to manage a destabilising climate. Durban must not be the end of Kyoto, but a chance to build on what it began. We recognise that it will take time to negotiate this. So we also want immediate action. Current voluntary pledges to reduce emissions are not yet enough; in Durban, we should agree that we must close the gap, building momentum towards a major review of ambition. We must build the system we use to measure and verify emissions cuts. We must do more on long-term financial support for developing countries, and agree how the new Green Fund will operate. And we must continue to reduce emissions from deforestation. Above all, we must show leadership. Next year I will continue to press for a more ambitious EU emissions target: a 30pc reduction by 2020. That will help us raise our sights globally.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic organisms. For example, if a bird eats a caterpillar, then the bird gets the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats. So the bird indirectly gets energy that began with the glucose formed through photosynthesis. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is central to sustaining life on Earth. In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts . Only cells with chloroplasts—plant cells and algal (protist) cells—can perform photosynthesis. Animal cells and fungal cells do not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize. That is why these organisms, as well as the non-photosynthetic protists, rely on other organisms to obtain their energy. These organisms are heterotrophs.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor. Guess a valid title for it!

Process: - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person has just completed a spring happens, how will it affect less carbon dioxide is removed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process you described is the respiration process, which is essential for life. It consists of inhaling oxygen (O2) and exhaling carbon dioxide (CO2). Let's break down the process step by step, and then discuss the perturbation hypothesis considering a person who has just completed a sprint. 1. Air inhalation: When we breathe in, air enters through our mouth or nose and goes down the trachea into the bronchi and eventually reaches the lungs. 2. Oxygen in the lungs: Inside the lungs, there are tiny air sacs called alveoli. These alveoli are covered with a network of small blood vessels (capillaries), where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from the air we breathe diffuses into the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Carbon dioxide removal: At the same time, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 4. Exhaling CO2: We then breathe out, exhaling carbon dioxide from our lungs. 5. The circulatory system transports the oxygen-rich blood throughout the body to supply cells with oxygen for proper cell functioning and energy production. Now regarding the perturbation hypothesis, let's assume a person has just completed a sprint, which is an intense physical activity. During such activity, the body's demand for oxygen increases, and more carbon dioxide is produced due to increased cellular respiration to produce energy. This sets a few potential responses: 1. Breathing rate increases: To meet the increased demand for oxygen and to remove more carbon dioxide from the body, the person would breathe faster and deeper. This allows more air to flow in and out of the lungs, and more carbon dioxide can be removed effectively. 2. Heart rate increases: The heart pumps faster to distribute the oxygen-rich blood more quickly to the active muscles and to help remove carbon dioxide, which needs to be brought back to the lungs for exhalation. The perturbation leads to a direct effect on the respiration process. The person's body compensates for the increased carbon dioxide levels by increasing the breathing and heart rates, ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen to the cells and efficient removal of excess carbon dioxide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: What happens after I place the lemon juice in the syrup when making mooncakes?","completion":"When making mooncakes, incorporating lemon juice into the syrup plays a significant role in producing a soft and tender texture with a succulent, rich filling. Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens after you add lemon juice to the syrup and how it contributes to the final texture and taste of your mooncakes. 1. Preparing the syrup: Before the lemon juice comes into play, let's discuss the importance of the syrup itself. The sugar syrup, a crucial component in mooncake-making, is typically prepared by boiling sugar, water, and sometimes a slice of lemon until it reaches a desired, thick consistency. The syrup is then allowed to cool and further thicken, sometimes for as long as a month, which allows deeper flavors to develop and ultimately enhances the taste and texture of your mooncakes. 2. The addition of lemon juice: Once the syrup has reached its optimal consistency and depth of flavor, you'll need to mix in your lemon juice. The citrus fruit adds a brightness to the syrup's flavors. Additionally, it has more crucial roles: a. Neutralizing the alkaline dough - In most mooncake recipes, an alkaline substance like lye water, potassium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate is added to the dough to improve its texture. The acidity provided by the lemon juice in the syrup counterbalances the alkaline nature of the dough, maintaining a neutral pH balance and producing a tender crust once the mooncake is baked. b. Inverting the sugar - The acidity of lemon juice aids in inverting some of the sucrose in the syrup into glucose and fructose, which have humectant properties that help maintain the mooncake's moistness. Inverted sugars also have a lower tendency to crystallize, which helps keep the filling intact while incorporating it into the dough during shaping. c. Enhancing the golden-brown crust - The Maillard reaction, responsible for producing the appealing golden-brown color of the mooncake crust, is encouraged by the presence of amino acids and reducing sugars. As mentioned earlier, the lemon juice helps invert some sugar molecules, creating a favorable environment for the Maillard reaction to occur and producing an attractive crust with a complex flavor profile. 3. Incorporating the syrup into the dough: After the lemon juice is mixed with the syrup, it's time to combine the syrup with your other dough ingredients, such as flour and fat. This process should be done carefully and gradually, paying attention to the consistency of your dough to ensure it remains pliable and easy to handle. It's essential to avoid overmixing the dough, as that could lead to a tough, undesirably textured mooncake. 4. Assembly and shaping: Now that your dough and filling are prepared, it's time to assemble and shape the mooncakes. The syrup infused with the lemon juice aids in keeping its shape while also holding in the filling during the baking process. Achieving a consistent thickness around the filling ensures even cooking and the ideal balance of crust and filling in each bite. 5. Baking: When you bake the mooncakes, the heat prompts the Maillard reaction and caramelization processes, resulting in a gorgeously golden-brown crust. The lemon juice in the syrup also contributes to minimizing the risk of an overly tough crust. Perfectly baked mooncakes should be tender on the outside with a rich and moist filling on the inside. 6. Storing and resting: Once your mooncakes have cooled, it's essential to allow them to \\"rest\\" for one or two days before consuming them. During this resting period, the syrup flavored with lemon juice continues to be absorbed into the dough, keeping the mooncake moist and tender. The flavors meld together, and the crust becomes soft and smooth, achieving the ideal mooncake experience. In conclusion, adding lemon juice to the syrup when making mooncakes is essential for multiple reasons – it affects the pH level, promotes a moist texture, helps create that delightful golden-brown crust, and enhances overall flavor. By carefully following each step of the mooncake-making process, you can ensure delicious, perfectly textured mooncakes every time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But before we get into the details of the new version, let us explain the big picture problem we are addressing. We recently conducted a survey of 300 professionals who are involved in the hiring process at their company to understand the use of social networks for screening job applicants. The results of this survey are shown in this infographic: So what do these results really tell us? From our perspective, there are three key takeaways: Whether you like it or not, hirers are using social networks to screen job applicants. This means it is important to carefully manage your image on these types of sites. Facebook and Twitter are being used a lot to screen job applicants. On Facebook and Twitter, we believe hirers are trying to get a more personal view of a candidate, rather than the resume-like view they will see on LinkedIn. Hirers are looking at the social networking profiles of candidates very early in the process. This means that job seekers need to have their online act in order before they begin looking for a job. The bottom line is that it is important for users, whether they are looking for a job or building up their professional reputation, to manage their online image across the different social networks they use. And this is the big picture problem we are addressing with the new version of Reppler. The features in the new version of Reppler include: Support for Twitter and LinkedIn – Reppler now supports Twitter and LinkedIn, in addition to the support for Facebook it currently has. Cross-Network Analysis – In addition to monitoring each of these services to provide you feedback on the tone of language used, inappropriate content found, and other potential issues and risks identified, Reppler provides cross-network analysis in a couple areas. It looks at all of your connections across the social networks you use to inform you on the makeup of your connections. For example, Reppler will show you how many of your professional connections on LinkedIn are also friends of yours on Facebook. Reppler also provides a comparison matrix of your profile information on each social network so you can see if there are any inconsistencies in how you are presenting yourself. The Reppler Image Score – Reppler calculates what we call the Reppler Image Score, a measure that takes into account a variety of elements that can affect your online image – the completeness of information in your profiles, the consistency of your information across different social networks, the tone of your content, the appropriateness of your content, the number of people you are connected to, etc. Weekly Updates – Reppler automatically sends you a weekly email that summarizes activity across your social networks that could affect your online image. This keeps you abreast of any issues and gives you the opportunity to take action before it is too late. That’s a quick overview of the new version of Reppler. Now you can effectively manage your online image across the different social networks you use. Reppler is a free service and you can sign up by going to www.reppler.com.

Based on the premise \\"Harvesting and Long Term Exposure Effects in the Relation between Air Pollution and Mortality,\\" we cannot conclusively determine whether the hypothesis \\"Connection between Air Pollution and food over time\\" is true. This is because the initial premise only establishes a link between air pollution and mortality, and does not specifically explore the impact of air pollution on food over time. In order to draw a reliable conclusion about the connection between air pollution and food over time, a separate study would be needed. This independent research should incorporate various factors like: 1. Examining how air pollution affects different types of crops and their growth patterns. 2. Assessing the nutritional quality of the crops in polluted environments and comparing it to crops grown in cleaner surroundings. 3. Determining if higher levels of air pollution cause food-borne diseases and alter the taste or texture of the food. 4. Evaluating how air pollution may impact food transport, storage, and availability to consumers, especially in dense urban settings with poor air quality. It is essential to gather scientific data on these factors to establish a meaningful connection between air pollution and food over time.

Movie title: Blood and Lace Movie plot: The film opens as an unseen assailant enters a dark house, removes a hammer from a kitchen drawer, and walks though the house to the bedroom of a sleeping man and woman. The killer uses the claw of the hammer to beat the woman to death, and the man is bludgeoned as well, his face mutilated. Then the murderer sets the room on fire. The man in the bed tries to crawl to safety, flames burning his face.Ellie Masters (Melody Patterson) wakes up screaming in bed, the opening incident being the subject of her nightmare. The murdered woman was her mother, Edna, who was a small town prostitute. The man in bed with her was her latest john, and his body has apparently not been recovered. A social worker named Mullins (Milton Selzer) has Ellie temporarily housed in a hospital, but Ellie wants to leave and go in search of her estranged father, whom she has never met. Mullins refuses, since Ellie is still a minor and technically a ward of the state, and Mullins says if she leaves, he will have to report it to the sheriff. Ellie does pack a suitcase and makes a run for it, but a mysterious man follows her in a car. He reveals himself to be Calvin Carruthers (Vic Tayback), a former theater performer and now a detective working for the county Sheriff's department. He tells Ellie he knows who she is, and that he will look out for her, and he takes her back to the hospital. Later, Calvin meets Mullins for a drink in a bar and asks about his intentions regarding Ellie. Mullins says he's placing Ellie in the Deere Youth Home, an isolated orphanage run by a recently widowed woman named Mrs. Deere (Gloria Grahame). Mullins accuses Calvin of having a prurient interest in Ellie, and Calvin admits that he'd like to make Ellie his wife because he considers her good \\"breeding stock\\". Mullins tells Calvin that Ellie could never be interested in him because he's too old for her, but Calvin cuts him off by revealing that he knows Mullins has an unorthodox \\"business arrangement\\" with Mrs. Deere where he sends certain orphans to her home.... The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the movie Blood and Lace, it is not explicitly mentioned who Ellie is attracted to. However, there are a few characters in the movie that potentially play a role in her relationships. These characters include her social worker Mullins and Calvin Carruthers, the detective working for the county Sheriff's department. Both Mullins and Calvin express an interest in Ellie, but their intentions may not be genuine or in Ellie's best interest. It is important to note that Ellie's primary focus throughout the plot seems to be finding her estranged father and escaping her difficult circumstances rather than building a romantic relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When is it time to give up pursuing a guy you like? When is it time to give up pursuing a girl you really like?","completion":"The two questions essentially have the same meaning, as they both address the theme of knowing when to stop pursuing someone you are romantically interested in. However, the first question is specifically about giving up on pursuing a guy, whereas the second question pertains to giving up on pursuing a girl. Despite the slight difference in the subjects' gender, both questions are seeking guidance on the same issue: recognizing the right time to discontinue pursuing someone you have strong feelings for. Various factors can contribute to this decision, such as a lack of reciprocation, differences in values, and practical circumstances. The core idea in both instances is to evaluate the situation and determine whether continuing to pursue the person is worth the time, effort, and emotional investment. Here is a more detailed breakdown of factors that could be relevant to both questions: 1. Lack of reciprocation: If the person you like consistently shows no interest in you or repeatedly declines your invitations, it may be time to consider giving up. It's essential to respect their feelings and boundaries. It's also important to protect your self-esteem and emotional well-being, which can be negatively impacted in the face of constant rejection. 2. Emotional unavailability: If the person you're interested in is not emotionally available (e.g., still dealing with past trauma or a recent breakup), it may be better to give them space and time to heal. Pursuing someone who isn't ready for a relationship often leads to heartbreak and disappointment for both parties. 3. Incompatibility: It's crucial to evaluate whether your values, interests, and life goals align with the other person's. Continuously trying to cultivate a relationship with someone fundamentally incompatible with you may be both unfulfilling and exhausting in the long run. 4. External factors: Sometimes, external factors such as distance, career obligations, or family commitments can affect the pursuit of a romantic interest. It may be worth reassessing the situation and prioritizing what's most important in your life at that moment. 5. Impact on personal well-being: If pursuing the person you like is causing you emotional distress, anxiety, or unhealthy behaviors, it's crucial to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. It's essential to recognize the toll the pursuit may be taking on your life and consider whether it's time to step back and focus on self-care. In conclusion, although the two questions specifically deal with pursuing a guy and a girl, the meaning behind both is nearly identical. The primary focus is on identifying the appropriate time to let go of a romantic pursuit and contemplating various factors contributing to that decision. Prioritizing one's well-being, respecting the other person's feelings, and recognizing when to move on are crucial steps in the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of the Eagles' players had indicated they would not attend in response to Trump's harsh criticism of athletes who have refused to stand during pregame performances of the national anthem — even though all the Eagles stood for the anthem last season. Trump relabeled Tuesday's gathering as a \\"celebration of the American flag.\\" Speaking for 3½ minutes, he told flag-waving invited fans of the team that he wanted to explain why \\"young Americans stand for a national anthem. Maybe it's about time we understood.\\" One attendee shouted at the president to \\"stop hiding behind the armed services and the national anthem.\\" That prompted booing and the man was escorted from the event. Trump concluded by saying that the celebration turned out to be \\"even bigger than we anticipated\\" had the football players attended. Media reports said as few as five to 10 players had planned to attend Tuesday's event. \\"The vast majority of the Eagles team decided to abandon their fans,\\" the White House said in a statement Tuesday. \\"The Eagles are the ones who tried to change their commitment at the 11th hour,\\" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters just prior to the event. \\"If this wasn't a political stunt by the Eagles franchise, then they wouldn't have planned to attend the event and then backed out at the last minute.\\" A White House statement said Trump withdrew the invitation \\"after...

Let's learn about air conditioners today. Air conditioners are those cool machines that help make our rooms nice and cold when it's hot outside. To make sure our room feels just right, we need to find the perfect air conditioner for it. To do that, we need to know how big our room is and how much sunlight it gets every day. First, let's talk about measuring the area of the room that needs to be cooled. The area is just a fancy word for how big our room is. It's like a big hug around the whole room, from wall to wall. We can measure the area by using a really cool tool called a measuring tape. Measure how long and how wide your room is, and then multiply those two numbers together to find the area. This will help us know how powerful our air conditioner should be. Next, we need to talk about something called BTU. BTU stands for British Thermal Units, but don't worry about the big words. Just remember that BTU tells us how strong and cool the air conditioner is. The bigger the BTU number, the stronger and cooler the air conditioner will be in our room. But how do we know which BTU number is right for our room? To find the perfect air conditioner, look at a special chart called the Recommended BTU Chart. This chart helps us match the area of our room to the right BTU number. For example, if our room is 150 square feet, then we might need an air conditioner with 5,000 BTU to cool our room and make it feel just right. But wait! There's one more thing to think about. Do you remember how we talked about sunlight? If our room gets lots of sunlight, then it can become really hot and bright inside. In this case, we might need an air conditioner with a higher BTU rating than what the chart tells us. This means that our air conditioner needs to be even stronger and cooler to keep our room nice and chilly. To sum it up, we need to measure the area of our room, use the Recommended BTU Chart to find the right air conditioner, and consider getting a stronger air conditioner if our room gets a lot of sunlight. That way, we can make sure our room stays nice and cool, even on the hottest days. Now, we're all set to find the perfect air conditioner for our space!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - The Kriegsmarine (\\"War Navy\\") was the navy of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1945. It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\". The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - Friedrich Christiansen ( 12 December 1879 -- 3 December 1972 ) was a World War I German seaplane ace who claimed shooting down twenty planes and an airship ; thirteen of those victories were confirmed . During World War II , he was the commander of the German Wehrmacht in the Netherlands ; he was convicted for war crimes after the war . - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted. - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The Reichswehr (English: Imperial Defence) formed the military organisation of Germany from 1919 until 1935, when it was united with the new \\"Wehrmacht\\" (Defence Force). - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - An airship or dirigible balloon is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power. Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen, due to its high lifting capacity and ready availability. Helium gas has almost the same lifting capacity and is not flammable, unlike hydrogen, but is rare and relatively expensive. Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and for a while helium was only used for airships by the United States. Most airships built since the 1960s have used helium, though some have used hot air.

Options： A. kitchen drawer B. fishing boat C. pocket D. garbage bag E. table","completion":"C. Pocket Carrying a small folding knife in your pocket is the most suitable option among the given choices. A folding knife is designed to be compact and easily accessible, and keeping it in your pocket ensures that it is readily available when needed for various tasks, such as cutting rope, opening packages, or peeling fruit, among other uses. Let's consider the other options and why they may not be as suitable: A. Kitchen drawer: Although keeping a small folding knife in a kitchen drawer might work if you exclusively use it for kitchen purposes, this option is not as practical if you need the knife for multiple scenarios or while you're on the go. In addition, a kitchen drawer may already have other dedicated knives that serve specific purposes in the kitchen (like a chef's knife or paring knife) – making the folding knife less essential in this context. B. Fishing boat: Using a small folding knife while fishing is certainly a viable option; however, storing the knife on a fishing boat means that it is not as easily accessible in various other situations where it may prove useful. The pocket is advantageous, as you would have the knife at your disposal whether you are on a fishing boat or not. D. Garbage bag: This option is unsafe and impractical. Storing a small folding knife in a garbage bag would not only make it difficult to find when needed, but it would also pose a safety hazard if someone reaches into the bag without realizing that there's a sharp object inside. Furthermore, assuming the bag will be thrown away; the knife would end up getting discarded as well. E. Table: While placing the folding knife on a table would make it visible and easily accessible, it would not be as practical when you need to have the knife with you while moving around. In addition, storing a knife on a table could pose a safety hazard, especially in a household with children or pets that could accidentally knock it off or come into contact with it. In conclusion, option C – carrying a small folding knife in your pocket – is the most suitable choice. The pocket provides easy access to the knife in various situations, remains within reach when moving around, and ensures that the knife is safely stored when not in use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You may wonder if there are other examples of static discharge. The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.

Short movie review: easy to like Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review, \\"easy to like,\\" it appears that the critic is thinking positively about the movie. Although the response is quite brief and doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of the film, the phrase \\"easy to like\\" suggests that the movie has some qualities that make it enjoyable and appealing to audiences. This can be interpreted as a positive remark, as it indicates that the viewer found the film engaging and appreciable. The critic's positive vibes can be attributed to various factors, such as compelling storytelling, strong performances by the actors, impeccable visuals and cinematography, enjoyable soundtracks, or a thought-provoking theme that resonates with the audience. Some other aspects, like relatable characters, well-executed humor, or impactful emotional elements, could also be responsible for making the movie likable and leaving the viewer with a favorable impression. However, since the review is quite brief, it's essential not to jump to conclusions and assume that the critic loved the movie entirely. A more in-depth review would provide a better understanding of the aspects that the critic particularly enjoyed or appreciated. For instance, they might have found the movie easy to like due to notable performances by the cast but considered the storyline or plot predictable or generic. Alternatively, the cinematography might have been stunning, but the theme or message of the film was lackluster. In conclusion, the critic's statement, \\"easy to like,\\" signifies an overall positive outlook on the movie. This could mean that the critic found some valuable and enjoyable qualities in the film.

Question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which student learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds? Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus. Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the subject of interest The question asks about which student learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds. Step 2: Locate relevant information The paragraph describes that Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere and Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus. Step 3: Analyze the information The paragraph mentions that clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Therefore, Zack's study on Earth's atmosphere didn't necessarily involve sulfur dioxide clouds. The paragraph also describes Venus's clouds as being composed of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Step 4: Determine which student learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds Since Ken studied the atmospheric conditions on Venus and Venus has sulfur dioxide clouds, it is clear that Ken learned more about sulfur dioxide clouds.

Q:Given the below context: The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre. Guess a valid title for it!

The formation of a united ministry of defence was rejected by David Lloyd George's coalition government in 1921; but the Chiefs of Staff Committee was formed in 1923, for the purposes of inter-Service co-ordination. As rearmament became a concern during the 1930s, Stanley Baldwin created the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence.

They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013 – the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association. Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase. “People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “This is a long-term trend.” Expanding bus and train networks help push the growth. Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area’s huge transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally. Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs. “People want to work and live along transit lines,” Melaniphy said. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.” Title:","completion":"\\"More People Riding Buses, Trains, and Subways in America Than in 50 Years!\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. I have been the brunt of cruelty from a doctor a number of times but I will relate one that has always stayed with me since I was a child. I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

I've tried everything to potty train Emily, but nothing seems to be working. She's starting nursery soon, and I'm getting really worried. Olivia: I understand how you feel, Jen. I went through the same thing with Charlotte. It took me some time and a lot of experimentation before I found the right approach for her. What have you tried so far? Jen: That's the thing, Olivia. I've tried EVERYTHING! Reward charts,waiting for her to be ready, songs, you name it, we've given it a shot. Except, of course, for trying to use the toilet instead of the potty, like your daughter did. Olivia: Well, it might be worth trying that. Charlotte didn't like sitting on the potty and wasn't making any progress with potty training. One day, she just showed interest in using the toilet like a 'big girl'. Maybe Emily would respond to that as well? Jen: Really? Hmm, I haven't considered it yet. Did you use any training seat or ladder? Olivia: Yes! We bought a child-sized seat that could be placed on top of the regular toilet seat, along with a stepstool to help her reach it. Surprisingly, she adjusted quickly and felt much more comfortable using the toilet. I think it's worth a shot for Emily. Jen: Thanks, Olivia. That's a great tip. Would you recommend any specific brand or model for the training seat? Olivia: I used the “Babyloo Soft Cushion Toilet Seat” model. It provided enough cushioning to make her feel comfortable but was still easy to clean and store. As for the stepstool, we bought “Gimars Non-Slip Folding Step Stool” – it's lightweight and has a non-slip surface, so I felt confident letting Charlotte use it. Jen: That's really helpful. I think I'll give it a try. Maybe I could also invite her to watch me use the toilet more often, so that she understands what it's for and emulates it? Olivia: Absolutely! That's what we did with Charlotte. We also tried to make the process fun and engaging. For example, I gave her a book about going to the toilet or let her play with a toy while sitting on the toilet to make her feel at ease. Jen: What a great idea! I'll have to grab a few children's books about using the toilet from the library. Did you ever face any setbacks or accidents when Charlotte was transitioning from the potty to the toilet? Olivia: Of course! Setbacks and accidents are part of the potty-training process. Whenever that happened, we just stayed calm, and I kept reminding her that it's okay to make mistakes and that she'll get better with time. It's important not to get frustrated; consistency and patience are key. Jen: Thank you so much, Olivia. I feel a lot more optimistic now about potty training Emily. Sometimes, all you need is a different perspective and a fresh approach. I can't wait to give this a try and help Emily become a confident toilet user. Olivia: I'm confident she'll get there with your guidance, Jen. Remember, it's the journey that matters, not how fast we get there. If you need any more help or advice, just let me know.

Their findings included 331 live chinchillas and two cats, which were eventually removed from the house. “They actually had cages that were fairly substantial, not temporary. It appeared they were built-in cages constructed in the house and had areas for the waste to drop, and it wasn't being addressed quickly and there was a lot of it,” Waukesha Fire Marshal Brian Charlesworth said. Approximately two dozen dead chinchillas were also found in the residence. \\"Our biggest concern is the parents seemed more concerned about these animals these chinchillas than they did about their children. That was the read the officers had of the parent's reaction to the situation,\\" Waukesha police Capt. Ron Oremus said. Three children live in the home, ages 7, 9 and 17 years old.

The fire marshal declared the home “unlivable” and the city health and building inspectors will likely be contacted. Humane Animal Welfare Society of Waukesha County took custody of the chinchillas.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Write a title for this article: A city police officer shot and killed Rice on November 22. A citizen had called the 911 center to report a \\"guy with a pistol\\" outside a city recreation center, but the responding officers weren't told the caller said the gun might be \\"fake\\" and the guy might be a juvenile. Rice actually had a pellet gun. Will the officer and his partner be charged? On Thursday a judge said he thought there was probable cause, but his opinion is not binding. A grand jury will study this investigation report and decide whether to indict. Here are some of the report's major takeaways: The police department has said Officer Timothy Loehmann \\"shouted verbal commands\\" from inside his patrol car before firing at Rice, but the report says witness interviews don't back up that statement. Loehmann and his partner, Frank Garmback, didn't talk to the sheriff's office investigators. The patrol car didn't have a dashboard camera and security video cameras at the recreation center don't have audio. One woman who lives nearby said she heard two popping sounds, then shouting, then a third popping sound. Loehmann only fired two shots, however. An FBI agent happened to be in the area following up a bank robbery, heard about the incident and arrived about three minutes after the shooting. He found Rice lying on the ground. The two officers appeared upset and shell-shocked, he said, wanting to help Rice but not knowing what to do. The agent, a national registered paramedic who'd served in the military, tried to stop the bleeding and got assistance from an officer when he asked for it. Janell Rutherford, supervisor for patrols in that area, said patrol cars were not equipped with first-aid kits and officers had no first-aid training beyond basic CPR. The initial call to 911 described a male with a gun at the recreation center, who might have been a juvenile. Officers at the scene said they thought Rice was 16-20 and the FBI agent said he first thought Rice was \\"eighteen-ish,\\" based on his size. Rice was 5 feet 7 and weighed 195 pounds, according to the autopsy. The agent said he heard Rice's sister screaming that he was only 12 years old. The agent said, \\"I remember thinking to myself, I'm like, 'There's no way.' And I looked at his face, I'm like, 'Yeah.' He's got a young-looking face. ...\\" Rice traded a cell phone to a friend for the pistol. The friend told investigators he'd taken the air pistol apart and couldn't refasten the orange tip that distinguishes air pistols from real ones. The gun is listed as a \\"replica firearm,\\" a Colt 1911 target pistol that's 11.25 inches long. One officer said it looked \\"a thousand percent real.\\" \\"I asked him his name which he replied to me -- told me, and then he said that he was shot and he made a reference to his, uh, regarding like a gun or a question like, 'Where's my gun?' ... I can't remember exactly what it was. I just remembered that he made reference to a firearm.\\" Though he didn't talk to Cuyahoga County investigators, Loehmann talked briefly to the FBI agent while he sat in a patrol car nursing an ankle injured during the shooting at the rec center. Loehmann said, \\"He [Rice] had a gun and he reached for it,\\" according to the agent. Loehmann fired from a distance of 4.5 to 7 feet from Rice. The patrol car rolled onto the grass at the Cudell Recreation Center and Loehmann exited the vehicle and fired twice within two seconds. Cleveland police were investigating the shooting, but amid calls for an independent investigation, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department was brought in. Many of the interviews with witnesses were conducted in March, more than three months after Rice was killed.

The Konbaung-Hanthawaddy war was the last of the many wars fought between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that began with King Anawrahta's conquest of the south in 1057. Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\". Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end.

Food Crisis Is Depicted As 'Silent Tsunami' LONDON, April 22 -- More than 100 million people are being driven deeper into poverty by a \\"silent tsunami\\" of sharply rising food prices, which have sparked riots around the world and threaten U.N.-backed feeding programs for 20 million children, the top U.N. food official said Tuesday. \\"This is the new face of hunger -- the millions of people who were not in the urgent hunger category six months ago but now are,\\" Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program (WFP), said at a London news conference. \\"The world's misery index is rising.\\" Prime Minister Gordon Brown, hosting Sheeran and other private and government experts at his 10 Downing Street offices, said the growing food crisis has pushed prices to their highest levels since 1945 and rivals the current global financial turmoil as a threat to world stability. \\"Hunger is a moral challenge to each one of us as global citizens, but it is also a threat to the political and economic stability of poor nations around the world,\\" Brown said, adding that 25,000 people a day are dying of conditions linked to hunger. \\"With one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes, the time to act is now,\\" Brown said, pledging 60 million in emergency aid to help the WFP feed the poor in Africa and Asia, where in some nations the prices of many food staples have doubled in the past six months. Brown said the \\"vast\\" food crisis was threatening to reverse years of progress to create stronger middle classes around the world and lift millions of people out of poverty. Prices for basic food supplies such as rice, wheat and corn have skyrocketed in recent months, driven by a complex set of factors including sharply rising fuel prices, droughts in key food-producing countries, ballooning demand in emerging nations such as China and India, and the diversion of some crops to produce biofuels. Sheeran noted that the United States, which she said provides half of the world's food assistance, has pledged 200 million in emergency food aid and that Congress was considering an additional appropriation. Holding up the kind of plastic cup that the WFP uses to feed millions of children, Sheeran told reporters that the price of a metric ton of rice in parts of Asia had risen from 460 to 1,000 in less than two months. \\"People are simply being priced out of food markets,\\" she said. The WFP has budgeted 2.9 billion this year -- all from donor nations -- to conduct its feeding programs around the world, including large efforts in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia and other nations that could not otherwise feed themselves. Sheeran said soaring prices mean that the WFP needs an additional 755 million to meet its needs. That \\"food gap\\" jumped from 500 million just two months ago as prices keep rising, she said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article highlights a \\"silent tsunami\\" of rapidly increasing food prices, which is pushing over 100 million people into deeper poverty.

The Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker wrote a lengthy Facebook post today clarifying his statements, saying they were not intended as a criticism of the movie American Sniper, based on Kyle's bestselling memoir. Anger: Michael Moore took to Twitter with his views on snipers the day after","completion":"American Sniper was released, and later posted a lengthy explanation on Facebook. Controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore sparked a heated debate on social media this weekend after posting comments on Twitter that labeled snipers as 'cowards'. His statements were met with immediate backlash, with many assuming he was attacking the memory of the late Chris Kyle, a highly decorated U.S. Navy SEAL sniper and the subject of the recently released movie, American Sniper. American Sniper, directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, is based on the bestselling memoir of the same name. The film focuses on the life, accomplishments, and struggles of Chris Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq and is credited with 160 confirmed kills – the most in U.S. military history. On January 18th, the day following the release of American Sniper, Moore tweeted: “My uncle was killed by a sniper in WW2. We were taught that snipers were cowards because they would kill you without giving you the chance to defend yourself.” Many saw this statement as a direct jab at both Chris Kyle and the film, which led to widespread condemnation of Moore's views and a spirited defense of Kyle's memory and the role of snipers in military history. Facing mounting criticism, Moore attempted to clarify his statements in a lengthy Facebook post the following day. In it, he emphasized that his comments were not meant to target Chris Kyle specifically, nor were they intended as a critique of American Sniper as a film. Instead, he claimed his remarks were meant to reflect a broader opposition to war and a belief that snipers, in general, were not honorable due to their method of killing from a distance. Moore wrote in his Facebook post: \\"When you view a film about a true American hero (like Chris Kyle), you can never fully understand what they went through unless you have experienced it yourself. That sniper's bullet could just as easily be coming at a soldier or a civilian, depending on the circumstances.\\" Further, Moore attempted to distance himself from associating Kyle's actions with cowardice by stating that \\"the issue is not with the soldiers themselves, but with the politicians and leaders who send them into battle knowing full well the horrors they will face.\\" Despite his efforts to clarify his position and separate his views on snipers from the specific subject matter of American Sniper and Chris Kyle, Michael Moore's comments continue to fuel an ongoing debate about the role of snipers in the context of war and the military. Supporters of Moore argue that his comments reflect a broader anti-war sentiment and a desire to open up a conversation about the ethics and morality of using snipers in warfare. Critics, on the other hand, view his remarks as disrespectful and inflammatory, particularly given the timing of his comments so close to the release of a film honoring a decorated war hero. This situation highlights the power of social media in amplifying and distorting public discourse. Moore's initial tweets provoked intense reactions, leading to a broader debate that has partially overshadowed the movie's release and reigniting discussions on military tactics, heroism, and the ethics of war. As with many such controversies, only time will tell whether Michael Moore's comments will have a lasting impact on the public's perception of snipers and the military, or whether his remarks will eventually be overshadowed by the continued success of American Sniper and the ongoing debate around the issues it raises."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is noticed and taken to an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets?, using the article: A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin. Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks, who has a strong interest in Oliver.

Write a text based on this summary: bush calls mccain about anti-kerry political ads Text:","completion":"In a remarkable turn of events, former President George W. Bush called Senator John McCain to discuss the recent onslaught of anti-John Kerry political advertisements. These ads have been making headlines and causing a stir among the public, as they target Kerry's character and record. The conversation between Bush and McCain showcases the increasing concern among prominent political figures about the nature and potential impact of negative campaign ads. While Bush did not give specific details regarding his conversation with McCain, it is believed that they discussed potential ways to address the issue and mitigate its harmful effects on political discourse. These anti-Kerry ads, criticized for their inflammatory and misleading content, have been widely circulated on social media platforms, causing a great deal of concern among both politicians and citizens alike. The fact that former President Bush, a Republican, has taken the initiative to reach out to Senator McCain, also a Republican, to address this issue is a testament to the widespread unease that negative campaign ads create. McCain has been an outspoken critic of negative political ads, specifically in his 2000 presidential campaign, when he experienced the damaging effects of such ads firsthand. He has since advocated for greater transparency and honesty in political campaigns, pushing for stricter regulations around political advertising. While it remains to be seen what concrete steps will be taken as a result of this conversation between Bush and McCain, their discussion highlights the growing consensus among politicians that negative campaign ads pose a threat to the integrity of the political process. By calling attention to this critical issue, Bush and McCain hope to spark a broader dialogue about the role of truth and civility in modern politics, ultimately leading to a more honest and constructive political environment. Despite the alarming nature of these anti-Kerry political ads, the conversation between two prominent Republicans signals a positive shift in the landscape of modern politics. As more political figures join the call for honest and transparent campaigning, perhaps the days of inflammatory and misleading political ads will soon be a thing of the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the best ways to keep your liver healthy is to eat a balanced diet that is low in trans fats and fructose (as in \\"high fructose corn syrup\\"). These substances are found in many processed foods, including chips, soda, fried foods, etc., and have both been shown to contribute negatively to liver function. Processed foods also include a host of other chemicals to maintain freshness and appearance, which your liver has to work to filter out. Your best bet for maintaining liver (and overall!) health is to minimize your consumption of prepackaged and processed foods, and prepare food from scratch using fresh ingredients whenever possible. Organic food is produced using minimal pesticides in the case of produce, and minimal or no added hormones or antibiotics, in the case of animal products. This translates to less chemicals and additives that your liver has to filter out. It is important to note that organic foods still may contain some residual pesticides, and the jury is still out on how much of a health benefit they provide. However, if you can afford to go organic, it certainly won't harm your liver, and you will be helping the environment, as well. A recent study published in Hepatology found that coffee drinkers, including those who drank decaf, were up to 25 percent less likely to have abnormal liver enzyme levels. Researchers do not yet know why this is the case, but drinking coffee may be helping your liver out. Regular exercise not only helps you maintain a healthy body weight, it does good things for your liver, as well. Studies have shown that just 150 minutes of activity per week (that’s just 1/2 an hour, five days per week) is enough to improve liver enzyme levels, and overall liver function. It can also reduce your chances of developing fatty liver disease. As if you didn't have enough reasons to quit already: numerous studies have shown that smoking drastically increases the risks of contracting both cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, and liver cancer. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is usually caused by a virus. There are three main types of hepatitis: A, B, and C, and all are contagious, however hepatitis C is usually only spread by sharing intravenous needles. Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B. Practice good hygiene: remember to wash your hands after using the restroom or changing a baby's diaper. Hepatitis B is commonly spread through unprotected sex, so always wear a condom. Do not share drug needles with another person, or come in contact with another person's blood. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: In many businesses, computers have largely replaced paperwork, because they are fast, and do not make mistakes. And they are honest. Many banks say that their business is \\"untouched by human hands\\" and therefore safe. But they have no thought that the growing number of computer crimes show they can be used to steal. Computer criminals don't use guns. And even if they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there is often no proof. A computer cannot remember who used it. It simply does what it is told. The head teller at a New York City bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this because he moved the money from one account to another. Each time a customer whose money he had stolen questioned the balance in his account, the teller said it was a computer mistake, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught at last. Some workers use the computer's power to punish their bosses they consider unfair. Recently, a large company fired its computer record assistant for reasons that were connected with her personal life rather than her job. She was given thirty days notice. In those thirty days, she stole all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been common workers. Now police wonder if this is \\"the tip of iceberg\\". As one official says, \\"I have the feeling that there is more crime out there than we are catching. What we are seeing now is all so poorly done.

Here is a detailed analysis of the options: 1. They sweat so much that the sunscreen came off. Considering the intensity of the biking and excitement level of the individual, it is likely that they may have sweated profusely, causing the sunscreen to come off or become less effective in protecting their skin from the sun's rays. The passage mentions that they were \\"fried just six miles in\\" and \\"could n't hold back,\\" indicating rigorous exertion and potentially excessive sweating. 2. They didn't use a high enough SPF. This option is less likely because the individual applied SPF 50 sunscreen before going out. SPF 50 is generally considered to be a high SPF, offering adequate sun protection for most people. While this option cannot be entirely ruled out, as different skin types require different levels of sun protection, it is not as plausible given the information provided in the passage. 3. They didn't apply enough. The passage does not provide any information regarding the amount of sunscreen applied or whether it was insufficient, so we cannot infer this as the reason why they might have gotten sunburned. Hence, this cannot be considered as the most likely reason. 4. None of the above choices. Since there is no direct evidence in the passage that supports or contradicts the other options, this choice does not provide useful insight. Therefore, if the individual did get sunburned, option 1, \\"They sweat so much that the sunscreen came off,\\" is the most plausible reason, given the context and information provided in the passage."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A girl playing in a puddle while wearing a pink coat Hypothesis: The girls pink coat is a raincoat. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"Based on the premise alone, which states that a girl is playing in a puddle while wearing a pink coat, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, which suggests that the girl's pink coat is a raincoat, additional information or evidence is needed. It is plausible to assume, given the context of the girl playing in a puddle, that she might be wearing a raincoat since raincoats are designed to keep people dry during wet conditions. However, this assumption neglects other possibilities, such as the coat being made of a different material or being worn for reasons unrelated to its water-resistant properties. Additionally, the color of the coat, pink in this case, does not provide any information about the type or function of the coat. To draw a valid conclusion, we can consider the following factors and pieces of information: 1. Material and Characteristics of the Coat: Establish whether the coat's material is water-resistant or designed specifically for rain, such as GORE-TEX or coated nylon. If such information is available, it could help determine if the coat is indeed a raincoat. 2. Context and Situation: Analyze the situation in which the girl is playing in the puddle. Is it raining or has it recently rained? If it is clear that wet conditions have prompted the girl to wear her pink coat, it would support the hypothesis that it is a raincoat. 3. Style and Design: Examine the coat's design features, such as a hood, sealed seams, or storm flaps, that suggest it is built for rainy weather protection. These features might indicate that the coat is specifically designed to provide protection from rain. 4. Testimony or Statements: If there are statements from the girl or her caregivers concerning the purpose of the coat that directly suggest it is intended for rainy or wet conditions, it would serve as direct evidence to support the hypothesis. 5. Observations and Comparisons: Observe other people in the vicinity or compare the girl’s coat to other raincoats to identify similarities or differences in design and purpose. If the pink coat displays characteristics common among raincoats, it may strengthen the argument that it is, in fact, a raincoat. In conclusion, although the hypothesis that the girl's pink coat is a raincoat appears plausible in the context of the premise, we cannot definitively conclude its validity without additional information or evidence. Further investigation into the coat's material, characteristics, context, design, and any accompanying statements or testimonies would be necessary to support or refute the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Rio de Janeiro (; ; \\"River of January\\"), or simply Rio, is the second-most populous municipality in Brazil and the sixth-most populous in the Americas. The metropolis is anchor to the Rio de Janeiro metropolitan area, the second-most populous metropolitan area in Brazil and sixth-most populous in the Americas. Rio de Janeiro the capital of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil's third-most populous state. Part of the city has been designated as a World Heritage Site, named \\"\\"Rio de Janeiro: Carioca Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea\\"\\", by UNESCO on 1 July 2012 as a Cultural Landscape. Founded in 1565 by the Portuguese, the city was initially the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a domain of the Portuguese Empire. Later, in 1763, it became the capital of the State of Brazil, a state of the Portuguese Empire. In 1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in 1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil, and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies. Rio de Janeiro subsequently served as the capital of the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889, and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960 when the capital was transferred to Brasília. 1.

Examine the context: The reviewer states that the dealership expects customers to buy a car without test driving it. - This is a negative comment as it goes against the standard practice of allowing customers to test drive vehicles before making a decision. 3. Review the comparison to other experiences: The reviewer mentions test driving various luxury brands and not facing any issues. - A comparison is being made to emphasize the uniqueness of the negative experience at this dealership. 4. Assess the overall recommendation: \\"Save your time and money, and go to another Dodge/Jeep dealership...\\" - The reviewer is explicitly advising potential customers to avoid this dealership and go to another one, which is a clear negative statement.

What motivates people like David Irving to become Holocaust deniers? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options: *no. *yes.","completion":"To complete the task, I will first research the number of Holocaust deniers and their reasons, followed by investigating the motivations of people like David Irving, and lastly, I will compare the questions to determine whether they have the same meaning or not. Step 1: Research the number of Holocaust deniers and their reasons. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact number of people who deny the Holocaust as the figures and percentages can vary among different countries and populations. However, according to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in 2014, surveyed respondents around the world showed that 35% of those who had heard about the Holocaust thought it was either a myth, an exaggeration, or that they were unsure of its existence. As for the reasons behind their denial, some common motivations include anti-Semitism, a desire to rehabilitate the image of Axis Powers (primarily Germany and its allies), or conspiracy theories. Step 2: Investigate the motivations of people like David Irving. David Irving is a notable figure in the Holocaust denial movement. His motivations for becoming a Holocaust denier can be attributed to political beliefs and personal ideologies. Irving has been criticized for distorting historical records and manipulating facts in order to promote his revisionist agenda. Some believe his denial serves to lessen the impact and subsequent guilt of the perpetrators and their supporters during the Holocaust. Step 3: Compare the questions to determine whether they have the same meaning. The first question asks about the number of Holocaust deniers and their motivations, whereas the second question specifically inquires about the motivations of people like David Irving, who are notable Holocaust deniers. Based on the analysis of the questions at hand, I will chose the available option: *no. The questions do not have the same meaning, as one focuses on the general scope of Holocaust deniers and their motivations, while the other is centered around a specific individual in the Holocaust denial movement and his motivations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"The \\"Pencil Test\\" was predominantly administered by minor officials who were responsible for enforcing racial classifications during the apartheid era in South Africa. However, to fully comprehend and appreciate the context and implications of this practice, it's essential to dive deeper into the history and development of the apartheid system in the country. Apartheid, which is an Afrikaans word meaning \\"separateness,\\" was a policy of systematic racial segregation and discrimination implemented by the National Party government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Under this policy, the country's population was divided into four main racial categories: White, Black, Coloured (mixed-race), and Indian/Asian. The classification of individuals into these categories had far-reaching consequences on their social, economic, and political lives. The \\"Pencil Test\\" (or \\"Crayon Test\\") was one of the ways used to separate and classify individuals who were not easily distinguishable as either black or white. This test was mainly practiced during the initial stages of apartheid to determine the racial categorization of individuals, particularly those who belonged to the coloured and black communities. The test involved sliding a pencil or crayon through the person's hair. The underlying assumption was that those with \\"kinkier\\" or more tightly coiled hair were considered black, while those with looser, less coiled hair were categorized as coloured. If the pencil did not fall out after being inserted into the hair, the individual would likely be deemed black; conversely, if the pencil fell out or could not be inserted at all, the person would likely be classified as coloured. The officials conducting the test were often low-ranking bureaucrats or civil servants, such as police officers or personnel from the now-defunct Department of Home Affairs. These minor officials were charged with implementing and enforcing the apartheid government's stringent and unfair racial divisions. The \\"Pencil Test\\" and other similar methods used to determine race were highly controversial and have since been widely condemned. They were dehumanizing, subjective, and rooted in racist assumptions about the difference between \\"white\\" and \\"non-white\\" features. Furthermore, the test caused anguish to many people who were separated from their families or communities based on this arbitrary measure. In 1994, with the end of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa, the process of dismantling racial classifications and policies began, and the importance of racial categorization as a means of governance and control started to diminish. Today, the \\"Pencil Test\\" serves as a stark reminder of the historical injustice perpetrated by the apartheid regime and highlights the importance of actively working to eradicate racial discrimination and prejudice in society."},{"prompt":"The office smelled like money.

It's likely that the man and woman were discussing their daily routine or activities, which has lead them to the topic of internet usage. It's possible that they were talking about their jobs, productivity, and different tools and methods they use for their work. The man might have been explaining how busy his work schedule is, possibly due to increased workloads, multiple projects or tasks that he is managing, or tight deadlines. This intensity of work could lead to a discussion on how he utilizes technology-enabled tools, like the internet, to better manage his time and increase his efficiency. Similarly, the woman might have shared her own experiences or asked the man about how often he uses technological tools at work or for personal leisure. They might have been discussing differences in their use of technology or the internet and this prompted her to ask him about his internet surfing habits. This then prompted the man to explain how he manages to incorporate internet usage into his busy schedule.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) Homicide Sergeant Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), shortly after his 50th birthday, is partnered with Sergeant Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson), a transfer from the Narcotics division. Riggs is a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier who lost his wife in a car accident two years prior and has turned suicidal, and has been taking his anger out on suspects, leading to his superiors requesting his transfer. Murtaugh and Riggs quickly find themselves at odds with each other. Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War buddy turned banker, but before they can meet, Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker's daughter, Amanda, apparently committed suicide by jumping to her death from her apartment balcony. Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle. Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Amanda's pimp, but find a drug lab on the premises, leading to a shootout. Riggs kills the pimp and saves Murtaugh's life, who starts to gain respect for his new partner. Though the case seems closed, Riggs is worried that the only witness to Amanda's apparent suicide was Dixie, another prostitute who was working well outside her normal streets. They go to see her at her home but it explodes as they approach it. Riggs finds parts of a mercury switch from bomb debris, indicating a professional had set the bomb; children that had been nearby witnessed a man approach the house with a Special Forces tattoo similar to Riggs', and Murtaugh suspects Hunsaker knows more than he has let on.

Andre Roussimoff was born in Moliens, the son of Boris and Mariann Roussimoff. His parents were of Bulgarian and Polish descent. His nickname growing up was \\"Dede\\". As a child, he displayed symptoms of his gigantism very early, reaching a height of 191 cm (6 ft 3 in) and a weight of 94 kg (208 lb) by the age of 12. Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11th in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30th at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury. His on-air return finally came at WrestleMania VII, when he came to the aid of The Big Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10th he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Andre one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Andre and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Andre to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Andre denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Andre from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Andre's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Andre was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Most, if not all, online clothing websites have a chart that explains their sizing measurements. Sometimes dresses will run bigger or smaller than your typical size, so you will want your measurements handy to check against the website's sizing guide. It's a good idea to shop at the same websites, because you're more likely to already know what size works best for you. Once you know your measurements you'll need to check out the different sizing at different stores. Many stores and many brands operate on their own sizing when it comes to dresses. A lot of times you can check the label to find where your measurements fall. At Target, for example, a small at Target (in numeric size: 0 or 2) has the bust of 85.09 cm to 86.39, waist measurements of 66.04cm to 67.31cm, and hip measurements of 91.44 cm to93.98 cm. At Top shop, an American size 6 has a bust of 87 cm, a waist of 69.2 cm, and a hip measurement of 91.5, which is smaller than the generic size chart.

Write an article using the following points: Steve Israel says his grandparents fled persecution in Russia to seek promise of U.S. He says post-election hopes that the parties could unite over immigration reform have dimmed. He says Rep. King has insulted Latinos; Boehner-led GOP using procedural tactics to deny vote. Israel: Boehner's use of Hastert Rule is barrier to bipartisanship, thwarts will of the people.","completion":"Title: The Fading Hopes for Bipartisan Immigration Reform: The Role of John Boehner and the Hastert Rule Introduction In the United States, the story of immigration is deeply woven into the nation's fabric. For many Americans, like Steve Israel, their ancestors' history is filled with tales of escaping persecution and seeking the promises and opportunities offered by the United States. Today, immigration reform remains a pressing issue where bipartisan cooperation is desperately needed. However, post-election optimism for unity on this matter has begun to slip away. This article explores the reasons behind this decline, focusing on the role played by the Republican Party, particularly Rep. John Boehner. Dimmed Hopes for Immigration Reform Following the elections, there was hope that both major political parties would set aside their differences and focus on much-needed immigration reform. Sadly, these hopes have been tarnished by events unfolding in the political sphere. One key figure in this disintegration is Rep. Peter King, who has made a name for himself by openly insulting Latinos. His comments and attitudes have alienated many potential supporters of bipartisan immigration reform. Additionally, the GOP, led by John Boehner, has been accused of using procedural tactics to deny a vote on crucial legislation. This approach has only served to further poison the already strained relationship between the parties on this matter. Boehner's Use of the Hastert Rule Central to this issue is Boehner's employment of the Hastert Rule. This unwritten governing principle essentially states that the Speaker of the House will not bring a bill to the floor for a vote unless it is supported by a majority of the Speaker's party members. In essence, this rule allows a small group of politicians to have near-veto power over legislation that could benefit the majority of Americans. The Hastert Rule as a Barrier to Bipartisanship The use of the Hastert Rule by Boehner has created a significant roadblock to bipartisan cooperation on immigration reform. By adhering to this rule, he is effectively stifering the will of the people and ignoring the calls for change from both his constituents and citizens across the country. As the United States continues to grapple with the complex issue of immigration, it is essential that our elected leaders be willing and able to come together and develop policy that will benefit all Americans. Unfortunately, the current situation, notably Boehner's reliance on the Hastert Rule, is acting as a barrier to the kind of bipartisanship required in this critical moment in our nation's history. Conclusion The fading hopes for bipartisan immigration reform are a troubling indicator of the state of our political climate. While Steve Israel's grandparents found promise in the United States, many others still long for the opportunities they were once afforded. This journey to a better life has hit an all-too-familiar political roadblock, and it remains to be seen if our leaders will be able to navigate around it. For now, the question remains: Can the United States rediscover the unity needed to address this vital issue, or will it continue to be blocked by those who refuse to compromise? Only time will tell if our elected officials can rise to the occasion, embrace bipartisanship, and make the changes necessary to ensure that the American Dream remains alive and well for generations to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Unemployed mum-of-five demands bigger home from the council… so her children don’t have to SHARE a bedroom Unemployed Rachael Dower, 28, claims her family has outgrown their current property A BENEFITS mum-of-five is demanding a bigger home – so her children don’t have to SHARE a bedroom. Unemployed Rachael Dower, 28, says her housing provider must upgrade her – as she keeps having kids and has outgrown her current property. She has continued to grow her family despite having not worked in over ten years and always claiming benefits. And now she wants a larger house so her children all have their own space. The handout-reliant mum lives with her partner Keith Birchmore, 29, and kids in a two bedroom home in Camborne, Cornwall, and says she has spent six months trying to move. She says she feels justified in making the demands as it is “unfair” that her daughter, Antonia, 11, has to share what she describes as a tiny “box room” with four brothers -Blake, two, Keedan, nine, Rhys, eight, and Oakley, six. She said: “I know people say it’s my fault for having so many kids but it’s what I wanted. We are just asking for an extra bedroom. “We just want to move into a nice family home. It’s not family-like here. At the moment they are all in one box room and it’s not a good way for the children to live. “I don’t mind the boys sharing but my daughter is approaching the age when she will be experiencing lady problems so it’s so important for her to get her own space. “It’s not fair on my daughter and it’s driving me nuts. She has not got her own privacy. It’s not fair at all.” Miss Dower has been asking Coastline Housing for a bigger home for half a year. She says that she gets around £240 a week in total benefits and they currently have all of their rent paid for through housing benefit. Miss Dower had previously been in £,1500 rent arrears but claims that she was promised by the provider that they would find her a more suitable property once her payments were up-to-date. I know people say it’s my fault for having so many kids but it’s what I wanted. We are just asking for an extra bedroom But having cleared her debts at a rate of £85 a week she says she is still waiting for news of a bigger property becoming available. She also registered with Cornwall Council’s Homechoice scheme in an effort to get a new home, but despite being accepted onto it after eight weeks of waiting, has yet to hear of a suitable property. She added: “We moved here nine years ago and although we got into arrears two years ago, we paid it off and I presumed that this would allow for us to move into a new house. “I’ve been told that Coastline doesn’t have a suitable property available. “Even a three bed property would be an improvement as it’s not fair on my daughter having to share with her four brothers.” “I don’t want to be here for another year, we wanted to be out by Christmas but that didn’t happen.” Miss Dower added that she will look for work in the future. “I did work – I worked in a riding school before my daughter was born 11 years ago. I do want to work,” she said. The housing provider said that there were currently no homes available. In a statement, Coastline Housing said: “We understand as this family has grown their home is now too small for their needs. “Our lettings team is working with the family and Cornwall HomeChoice. We hope to be able to offer them a move to a suitable larger home in the not too distant future, when one becomes available.” Keith works as a mechanic but doesn’t earn enough to mean they have to pay rent themselves.

Marojejy National Park is located in the northeast of Madagascar between the towns of Andapa and Sambava and extends approximately 32 km (20 mi) from east to west and 22 km (14 mi) from north to south. It is centered on the chain of mountains known as Marojejy Massif. Despite a scientific survey of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine, Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when L.-J. Arragon of the Service Géographique de Madagascar ascended Marojejy Est. Arragon did not conduct any field research during his visit. The massif was not geologically described until after the French botanist Jean-Henri Humbert from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris explored the mountains in 1948. Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy. Between November 1948 and November 1950, he spent five months collecting 4,039 dried plant (herbarium) specimens for study. After several expeditions, he published the book \\"A Marvel of Nature\\" in 1955, in which he claimed the massif was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size, floral diversity, and pristine natural state.Marojejy was set aside as one of Madagascar's strict nature reserves in 1952 largely due to Humbert's enthusiasm and support. Under this protection, only research scientists were permitted to visit the site. In 1998, Marojejy was converted into a national park and thus became open to visitors.Originally seen as a transition zone between the eastern rainforests and the central highlands, Marojejy is now recognized as having its own unique features, with some of the richest biodiversity on the island. Several studies from the early 1970s through the 1990s surveyed the mountain ecosystems and inventoried the flora and fauna. In 2007, Marojejy was listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana. Due to illegal logging and trafficking of valuable hardwoods, and especially after the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar, the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2010.

He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and James Stirling. Even though he faced religious persecution he remained a \\"steadfast Christian\\" throughout his life. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Huguenots (or ) is a designation for an ethnoreligious group of French Protestants that follow the Reformed tradition. - A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions. - Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability, the analysis of random phenomena. The central objects of probability theory are random variables, stochastic processes, and events: mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion. - In mathematics , Stirling 's approximation ( or Stirling 's formula ) is an approximation for factorials . It is a very powerful approximation , leading to accurate results even for small values of n. It is named after James Stirling , though it was first stated by Abraham de Moivre . The formula as typically used in applications is ln ( n ! ) = n ln ( n ) - n + O ( ln ( n ) ) ( in big O notation ) . The next term in the O ( ln ( n ) ) is 1/2ln ( 2n ) ; a more precise variant of the formula is therefore n ! sim sqrt ( 2 pi n ) left ( frac ( n ) ( e ) right ) ^ n. It is also possible to give a version of Stirling 's formula with bounds valid for all positive integers n , rather than asymptotics : one has sqrt ( 2 pi ) n ^ ( n + frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) le n ! le e n ^ ( n + frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) for all positive integers n. Thus the ratio frac ( n ! ) ( n ^ ( n + frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) ) is always between 2 = 2.5066 ... and e = 2.71828 ... . As an asymptotic formula , Stirling 's approximation has the property that the ratio frac ( n ! ) ( sqrt ( 2 pi n ) left ( frac ( n ) ( e ) right ) ^ n ) approaches 1 as n grows to infinity . - Trigonometry (from Greek \\"trignon\\", \\"triangle\\" and \\"metron\\", \\"measure\\") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies. - Pierre des Maizeaux, also spelled Desmaizeaux (c. 1666 or 1673June 1745), was a French Huguenot writer exiled in London, best known as the translator and biographer of Pierre Bayle. - In mathematics, de Moivre's formula (also known as de Moivre's theorem and de Moivre's identity), named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) and integer it holds that - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework. - Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642 20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist (described in his own day as a \\"natural philosopher\\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book \\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" (\\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus. - A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form , where and are real numbers and is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation . In this expression, is the ' and is the ' of the complex number. If formula_1, then formula_2 - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change.

The longest east-west extent is about . - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Sivas (Latin: \\"Sebastia\\", \\"Sebastea\\", \\"Sebasteia\\", \\"Sebaste\\") is a city in central Turkey and the seat of Sivas Province.

It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas. - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data. - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching . - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - A wireless router is a device that performs the functions of a router and also includes the functions of a wireless access point. It is used to provide access to the Internet or a private computer network. It can function in a wired LAN (local area network), in a wireless-only LAN (WLAN), or in a mixed wired/wireless network, depending on the manufacturer and model. - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia.

Article: Embed this Video x Email Digg Reddit Delicious Link A Peabody woman says a cupcake she tried to take on a flight with her sparked a potential security threat this week. Rebecca Hains says she was going through security at the airport in Las Vegas when a TSA agent pulled her aside and said the cupcake frosting was “gel-like” enough to constitute a security risk. She said she was able to pass through Logan International Airport security with two cupcakes, but she was stopped on the way back when she tried to return with one of them. \\"In general, cakes and pies are allowed in carry-on luggage,\\" said TSA spokesperson James Fotenos, adding they were looking into why this cupcake was confiscated. Hains said she had received the cupcakes as a gift and after eating one on the trip out west, decided to save the other for the flight back. Hains contacted the cupcake company, Wicked Good Cupcakes of Cohasset, which said it will ship her a new batch free of charge. “Apparently we're a tasty, terrorist threat. I guess we were also amazed at what can pass through security in one airport, but not in another,” said Brian Vilagie of Wicked Good Cupcakes. ||||| A woman who just flew back home from Las Vegas says an airport security officer confiscated her frosted cupcake because he thought the icing on it could be a security risk. Rebecca Hains said the Transportation Security Administration agent at McCarran International Airport took her cupcake Wednesday, telling her its frosting was enough like a gel to violate TSA restrictions on allowing liquids and gels onto flights to prevent them from being used as explosives. \\"I just thought this was terrible logic,\\" Hains said Friday. Hains, who lives in Peabody, just north of Boston, said the agent didn't seem concerned that the cupcake could actually be explosive, just that it fit some bureaucratic definition about what was prohibited. She said he even offered to let her eat it away from the airport security area. Hains, a 35-year-old communications professor at Salem State University, said she told the agent she had passed through security at Boston's Logan International Airport earlier in the week with two cupcakes packaged in jars, gifts from a student. But she said the agent told her that just meant TSA in Boston didn't do its job. The TSA, which is entrusted with protecting the nation's transportation system, was reviewing the incident, agency spokesman Nico Melendez said. Passengers are allowed to take cakes and cupcakes through checkpoints, he said. Hains ultimately surrendered the cupcake. But she said the encounter highlighted a lack of common sense by the agent and the ludicrousness of TSA policies. \\"It's not really about the cupcake; I can get another cupcake,\\" she said. \\"It's about an encroachment on civil liberties. We're just building up a resistance and tolerance to all these things they're doing in the name of security, when it's really theater. It is not keeping us safe.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"A woman named Rebecca Hains experienced a potential security issue at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas when a TSA agent confiscated her cupcake, stating that the frosting was \\"gel-like\\" enough to constitute a security risk.

Article: For parkour, you need to wear thin-soled shoes that have a one-piece sole. Thin soles let you feel the wall better, improving your technique, while one-piece soles won't rip off in pieces as easily. The shoe should have a well-defined arch to help you dig in your heels. It should also have a soft rubber for the best grip. If you want to learn parkour in a more controlled, safe environment, look for a parkour gym in your area. They'll have coaches on hand to help you learn the techniques. Basically, you are using your momentum to get up the wall. Therefore, you have to take the wall while jogging. Parkour is not for the faint of heart. You can fall or injure your ankles while trying to do parkour. As you reach the wall, push off the ground with your non-dominant leg. You should be close enough to the wall that you can easily hit it with the other leg. In other words, you need to be within a foot or two. Basically, you are trying to push yourself as far up the wall as you can. Immediately as you get to the wall, push your arms up. You need to be ready when you approach the top of the wall to grasp it. Using the ball of your foot, plant your foot on the wall. Use that foot to change your horizontal motion to vertical motion, pushing yourself up the wall. As you do, be sure to lean in towards the wall, as it will keep you moving upwards rather than away from the wall. Using your non-dominant leg, run another step up the wall. Basically, you're still trying to get as far up the wall as you can. All of these steps must be done in quick succession. You can take a third step, but more than three steps is probably pushing it. Grab the top of the wall with both hands. Pull yourself upwards. As you reach the top, push yourself like you're climbing out of the pool. You can then simply push until you can put your foot on the wall and stand up. Alternatively, you can swing a leg up to the side, pushing it over and drop down the other side of the wall.

Pub: It was the pub that first introduced the concept of the bar counter being used to serve the beer. Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar[citation needed]. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the \\"vault\\", other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere.

Paragraph: The accumulation of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) and its oxidation products was studied in primary cultures of cerebral astrocytes. Astroglial accumulation of radiolabeled catecholamine ([3H] NA and oxidation products) was enhanced by manganese or iron, but it was inhibited by unlabeled NA, dopamine or ascorbate. Tissue:medium ratios of radioactivity increased as extracellular [3H]NA was oxidized. When extracellular oxidation was prevented by ascorbate, as confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, either ouabain pretreatment or nominally Na*-free incubation medium inhibited approximately one-half of specific [3H]NA accumulation by rat (but not mouse) astrocytes. These observations suggest that neurological responses to trace metals and ascorbate may arise from the effects of these agents on the clearance of extracellular catecholamines. Astrocytes can accumulate oxidation products of NA more rapidly than they take up NA itself, but ascorbate at physiological concentrations prevents the oxidation process in extracellular fluid. Furthermore, in the presence of ascorbate, Na+-dependent transport mediates a significant component of NA accumulation in rat astrocytes.

Answer the following question: This article: At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ... We could at least propose to evict the female element\\".

Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished. Since 1996 it has formed part of the unitary East Renfrewshire council area; East Renfrewshire Council is the local authority.

They may not be the freshest available. - Market: This option refers to a place where fresh produce, including tomatoes, is commonly sold. At a market, tomatoes can be sourced from local farms, ensuring that they are freshly picked. Additionally, markets typically stock produce that is currently in season, further increasing the likelihood of finding the freshest tomatoes.

Here is a detailed, negative review of a hypothetical restaurant called \\"The Gourmet Bistro.\\" Title: Disappointing Experience at The Gourmet Bistro I had high expectations for The Gourmet Bistro, considering the rave reviews I had heard from friends and the promising reputation that preceded it. Unfortunately, my recent visit to the restaurant was a major disappointment and left me regretting my choice to dine there. From the moment we walked in, it was apparent that the staff was overwhelmed and poorly organized. Despite having made a reservation in advance, we had to wait for approximately 30 minutes to be seated at our table. Once seated, it took another 20 minutes for our waiter to bring the menus and take our drink orders. In retrospect, the long wait times were an early red flag, signaling the beginning of our frustrating experience. When it came to food selection, I was unimpressed by the limited range of options on the menu. The restaurant prides itself on serving \\"gourmet\\" cuisine, yet a majority of the dishes seemed generic, lacking any creativity or innovation to truly make them stand out. I ordered the grilled salmon with seasonal vegetables, anticipating a flavorful and well-crafted dish. Regrettably, the salmon was overcooked and dry, while the vegetables were swimming in an unnecessarily copious amount of butter. The accompanying sauce did little to salvage the dish, as it tasted store-bought rather than house-made. Furthermore, the wait times between courses were excessive and resulted in a prolonged and tedious dining experience. Considering the restaurant was not fully packed that evening, it was difficult to understand why the kitchen struggled to deliver dishes in a timely manner. When our dessert finally arrived, my chocolate soufflé was not baked thoroughly and visibly collapsed upon contact with my spoon. Needless to say, it was a disappointing conclusion to an already underwhelming meal. To make matters worse, the overall atmosphere in The Gourmet Bistro was far from enjoyable. The excessive noise from the nearby bar area and crowded seating made it challenging to hold a conversation with my dining partner. Additionally, the dim lighting was not conducive to comfortably reading the menu or observing the presentation of the food. Considering the high prices of the dishes and the restaurant's reputable status, I expected a more pleasant and upscale environment. In conclusion, my experience at The Gourmet Bistro was far from the exceptional dining adventure I had anticipated. The combination of poor customer service, subpar food quality, lengthy wait times, and an uncomfortable atmosphere left me feeling profoundly dissatisfied. Based on this visit, I cannot in good conscience recommend The Gourmet Bistro to anyone seeking an enjoyable and refined dining experience. It is my hope that the restaurant's management will address these issues to bring its performance up to par with the expectations set by its self-proclaimed \\"gourmet\\" image."},{"prompt":"You are presented with the question \\"How does heat make an object hot?\\" and the following answer choices: - temperature - high - transfer - It expands - frozen - Evaporation - electricity - sunlight Now knowing that if heat is conducted to an object then that object will become hot and conductive heat transfer is excellent, choose the best answer.

The equation is given as: 228*d + 2814 = -214*d - 27*d. First, let's combine the terms with 'd' on the right side of the equation: -214*d - 27*d = (-214 - 27) * d = -241*d Now, the equation looks like this: 228*d + 2814 = -241*d. We can now move all 'd' terms to the left side of the equation by adding 241*d on both sides: 228*d + 241*d + 2814 = 0 (228 + 241) * d + 2814 = 0 469 * d + 2814 = 0 Now, we have only one term with 'd' on the left side of the equation. To isolate 'd' and find its value, let's move 2814 to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 469*d = -2814 Now, we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 469: d = -2814 / 469 Now, evaluating the fraction, we get: d ≈ -6 Hence, the solution to the given math problem is d ≈ -6."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: Bar Marco has been rocking the boat since it launched—with a restaurant that has been recognized nationally not only for its inventive food but also for its focus on community programming. And as it turns three this year, it shows no signs of stopping. On January 2, the restaurant tweeted some pretty groundbreaking news. With this move, Bar Marco leads with a handful of restaurants in the country—including Thomas Keller’s and Daniel Patterson’s restaurant groups—opting to eschew tipping in favor of offering their staff not only a living wage but the stability that is hard to come by when your take home pay depends on tips. The minimum wage for tipped workers in Pennsylvania is 2.83. According to a recent Mother Jones article, up to 40 percent of restaurant workers live in near-poverty and less than 15 percent of restaurant workers have employer-sponsored health insurance compared to 42 percent for other industries. “We’ve been watching the data all year. I put together what we have to do to pay the front and back equally and pay them well and give them a share of the upsides,” says Bar Marco co-owner, Bobby Fry. Bar Marco will not be adding a service charge to diners’ checks nor will the prices suddenly increase significantly. “Every restaurant does it a little bit differently. Some restaurants charge a 20 percent service fee—I don’t think that will work well for us,” says Fry. “Our plan hinges on hitting revenues—mainly the expansion of the wine room where gratuity and tax have been included since it launched.” Instead of the current two ticketed seatings, the restaurant will now take reservations. “Six courses for 65, plus wine pairings for an additional 40,” says Fry. “We have also put together a great team in the kitchen. Our menu will change subtly—with dishes that offer more depth.” All employees at Bar Marco will work 40-44 hours a week maximum—with two days off, plus one night, since the restaurant is closed on Sundays. On top of that, employees get 10 vacation days. Each employee will be paid 35,000 a year base salary, plus health care from date of hire and 500 shares in the business that will vest after three months of employment. Every share is worth 1 after three months and it increases in value as it matures. “All of our current employees have seen and approved the contract,” says Fry. “They will have a lot of responsibilities, too—like being present at bi-monthly finance meetings. We want complete transparency. We want people who want to be part of what we are doing and who want to grow with us.” What is the public’s reaction to this news? The tweet in the image featured here had over 300 retweets and favorites. Still want to leave a gesture of appreciation for the good service you receive? Please do. When the new structure launches, tips at Bar Marco will go toward the Food Revolution Pittsburgh Cooking Club. ||||| Is the the future of the restaurant industry tip-free? One Pittsburgh restaurant certainly thinks so. The owners of three-year-old Bar Marco are not only abolishing tips, but are giving their employees a salary with benefits. According to Next Pittsburgh, full-time employees will be paid a base salary of 35,000 a year and will be given health care and 500 shares in the company. Employees will be asked to work a maximum of 40 to 44 hours per week, will have two days and one night off a week, and will receive 10 paid vacation days per year. Co-owner Robert Fry tells Eater, \\"America needs to realize that working in the restaurant industry is an occupation.\\" Fry worked with long-term employees to create the plan. Fry notes that by April of this year, 20 of the restaurant's employees — both front and back of house — will be switched over to salary and that the restaurant will no longer accept tips. There will still be a handful of part-time employees, \\"mainly college students,\\" says Fry, that will work as servers' assistants and will be paid 10 to 12 dollars per hour. Unlike other restaurants that have eliminated tipping, Bar Marco will not be adding in a service fee or raising their prices. Instead, the co-owners are hoping to grow revenue by expanding their menu, increasing the number of covers they do in their wine room, and upping the number of events they host. Fry tells Eater that all employees are on board and have signed contracts. He told Next Pittsburgh that with the salary comes other expectations: They will have a lot of responsibilities, too like being present at bi-monthly finance meetings. We want complete transparency. We want people who want to be part of what we are doing and who want to grow with us.\\" Back in June, another Pennsylvania restaurant announced that it would ban tipping. The co-owners of Bistro Girard decided that they would pay their waitstaff a \\"living wage\\" of 11 per hour and offer them full benefits as well as profit sharing. To offset the costs, the restaurant would raise prices by 10 to 20 percent. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Bar Marco, a restaurant in Pittsburgh, is making some big changes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: Marble is very soft and prone to damage so it is important to apply a coat of high quality marble sealing agent before proceeding with the grout. This seal is also important because marble is very porous and grout can cause stains in the tiles. Apply the sealing agent over the tops of the marble. Even if you prefer the color and look of unsealed marble you can use a “grout release”-type sealer to prevent grout from sticking to the marble tiles. Grout, or mortar, will be used ot fill in the spaces between the tiles. Be sure to wear a dust mask, safety goggles, and heavy-duty work gloves. Wear a long-sleeve shirt to avoid any possible damage to your skin from contact with the grout. Mix only enough as will be used in 15-20 minutes of work or else the extra can dry out and harden. This prepares the spaces for the grout or mortar. Spread the concrete evenly over the spaces between the tiles using a squeegee. Be careful to avoid getting cement on the tops of the tiles. Some will inevitably get on top of the tiles but you want to minimize the amount. Try to push it into the spaces as much as possible to create a tight fight. Wipe up any grout on top of the tiles as you go. Use a squeegee to spread out the grout and leave a smooth surface in the cracks. You can also use a gloved finger to run down the grooves and smooth the top of the grout. Use a damp sponge to wipe down the tops of the tiles to remove any excess grout. Try not to get extra moisture into the grout or else it can make it too wet. Allow the grout to dry for the length of time required by the manufacturer. Some will require long curing times to ensure maximum strength. Use a disposable sponge applicator to paint the grout with a grout sealer. This will help prevent stains and dirt from permanently discoloring the grout. It will also make cleaning easier later on. Clean your tools with water or acetone to remove the excess grout or mortar and prepare them for use once again.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.

The novel begins in England during the Age of Enlightenment but long before the days of Darwin and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The novel is broken into two books, beginning in 1752 and 1753 and ending in 1765, with a decade or so separating the two. Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception.

Q:Information: - The Luna programme (from the Russian word \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures. - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys . - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\"). - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

Answer:","completion":"In text terms, \\"Bevo\\" refers to a non-alcoholic malt beverage that was produced by the Anheuser-Busch company during the early 20th century. It was a popular drink during the Prohibition era in the United States when the sale of alcoholic beverages was illegal. Regarding the statement \\"The Bevo building, with the Renard character prominently displayed at the corners, still operates as a bottling facility at their main brewery in St. Louis, Missouri\\", it provides information about a Bevo-related building and its location, but it does not directly answer the question about the meaning of \\"Bevo\\" in text terms. However, it does provide some context about its historical connection to the Anheuser-Busch company and its use as a bottling facility. A more reasonable answer to the question would be: \\"Bevo, in text terms, refers to a non-alcoholic malt beverage produced by the Anheuser-Busch company during the Prohibition era. The Bevo building in St. Louis, Missouri, with the Renard character prominently displayed at the corners, served as a bottling facility for this beverage and still operates as a bottling facility for the company today.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A new 200mph British supercar has broken cover with a scintillating £800,000 price-tag to match. The new flagship two-seater McLaren P1 will accelerate from rest to 62mph in under three seconds and is set to be one of the stars of next week’s Paris Motor Show. The super-lightweight but powerful supercar is being built at McLaren’s state of the art factory in Woking, Surrey and has the ambition of being the best road and track car in the world for drivers. It is about the same size as a Porsche 911 but is being seen as the spiritual successor of the legendary three-seater Mclaren F1 supercar of the 1990s – one of which ‘Mr Bean’ star Rowan Atkinson famously pranged. State-of-the-art: The super-lightweight but powerful supercar (pictured) is being built at McLaren's factory in Woking, Surrey. 'One simple goal': Manufacturers have described the vehicle as the best driver's car on the road. A McLaren spokesman said: ‘McLaren Automotive will use its first ever international motor show appearance to preview its next generation ultimate supercar – the McLaren P1 – which takes much of its technological and spiritual inspiration from the company’s Racing division. ‘The McLaren P1 has one simple goal: to be the best driver’s car in the world on road and track.’ A prototype of the P1 car is to go on show in Paris next Thursday with a production version to follow and go on sale in September next year. Weight is kept down thanks to its super-strong but very light carbon-fibre structure. McLaren Automotive executive chairman Ron Dennis said:‘The McLaren P1 will be the result of 50 years of racing and road car heritage. ‘Twenty years ago we raised the supercar performance bar with the McLaren F1 and our goal with the McLaren P1 is to redefine it once again.’ Hot wheels: The P1 is seen as the spiritual successor of the legendary three-seater Mclaren F1 supercar of the 1990s (pictured) Counting the cost: This was what was left of Rowan Atkinson's £640,000 McLaren F1 sports car after a prang in 2011. McLaren automotive managing director Antony Sheriff said; ‘Our aim is not necessarily to be the fastest in absolute top speed but to be the quickest and most rewarding series production road car on a circuit.’ He added:’It is the true test of a supercar’s all round ability and a much more important technical statement. Our goal is to make the McLaren P1 the most exciting, most capable, most technologically advanced and most dynamically accomplished supercar ever made.’ When the flagship McLaren P1 goes into production later next year, it will sit above the existing 12C and 12C Spider, in terms of both price and performance with a price of around £800,000. Rowan Atkinson during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit. The comedian crashed his supercar last year. Johnny English star Rowan Atkinson spoke in September last year about the £1million crash that wrecked his own original McLaren F1 supercar noting: ’I can’t blame the car’, he confessed ruefully. ‘It was wet.‘. And so high was the expected repair bill he added: ’I haven’t had the estimate. But I have had the estimate for the estimate.’ His Woking-built supercar is capable of 230mph, and accelerates from 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds. He was hurt when he crashed the three-seater McLaren F1 supercar into a tree in Cambridgeshire in early August 2011. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star suffered a shoulder injury and wounded pride in the accident, near Peterborough. He walked from the car, which caught fire, after the crash on the A605 at Haddon and waited for an ambulance. Atkinson, 56, was admitted to Peterborough City Hospital but later discharged with ‘a minor shoulder injury’ following the crash. Only a few weeks earlier, he had staunchly defended the McLaren to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson: ’You've got to live with it. I have lived with it for 14 years, I've done a lot of miles in it, I've done 37,000 miles – which for a McLaren is a lot.’. He even loaned the car to the programme on a previous occasion, when it was driven by another Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond without incident. In 1999, Atkinson damaged the bonnet of the car in a low speed shut. In 1995 former BMW boss Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder, himself wrote-off a McLaren F1 in 1995 when he was head of the German car giant. That he and his passengers survived was put down to the strength of the car’s carbon-fibre space-frame.

Kanye West used this platform as an opportunity to express his disappointment and frustration with then-President George W. Bush, whom he accused of not caring about the black community affected by Hurricane Katrina. The accusation made national headlines and stirred much debate and discussion in the following days and weeks. In conclusion, the sentence effectively answers the question by identifying President George W. Bush as the U.S. President whom Kanye West accused of not caring for black people.

He believes that a loophole in Santander's security system was exploited by fraudsters. But Santander said that victims failed to keep a passcode private. One of these victims was Alex Luke, from London, who had £180,000 stolen from her account. \\"I had a call from someone I thought was BT,\\" she told the BBC. \\"They had all my personal details and they said that they needed to put security on to my computer to prevent me losing everything. \\"So they got me to log on to my Santander account and get a security code.\\" She later discovered that nearly all of her money had gone from her account. Her bank managed to recover £40,000 but Santander refuses to compensate her for the rest of the missing money. Mr Emery, who runs 4keys International, argued that there was a loophole that allowed fraudsters, posing as BT, to gain access to the money - and others had suffered the same fate. \\"If Santander customers create a new account payee, they have to authorise it with a One-Time Passcode system or OTP. But there was a huge loophole - you could amend an existing payee, changing their account and sort code numbers,\\" he said. \\"All other banks prevent a change to existing payees' account details. They should now compensate all customers affected. Whilst the customer holds the first key to the door, Santander holds the second key and in these cases they left the door open and the crooks exploited it.\\" But Santander does not agree. \\"We refute Mr Emery's position that there is a loophole,\\" a spokesman said. \\"The security for amending a payee and a new payee was the same. If the customers had not given access to their account and shared their individual one-time passcode with a third party, then they would not have lost their money.\\" However, within three weeks of Mr Emery's objections, which were broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Money Box, Santander had upgraded its security. Mr Emery said he was planning to take a group case to the Financial Ombudsman or, if that failed, file a collective civil action against Santander. Fraudsters are continually changing the way they target bank customers, according to Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime. Thieves have been stealing large sums of money from victims' bank accounts by intercepting calls, or tricking people into revealing details of texts sent by banks, as in the case of Alex Luke. Meanwhile, many companies are having their coffers emptied by scam emails, such as community football club Laurel Park FC, in Lower Earley, near Reading in Berkshire, which supports 400 young players in 27 youth teams. It was conned out of nearly £30,000 when the club's treasurer received what seemed to be a genuine email from the chairman along with invoices from a supplier, which he paid. But the account details were those of a fraudster and despite pleading with their bank, Barclays, the club has taken a big financial hit and faced closure Ian Jobson, the club's development officer, said: \\"Because we requested the payments to be made, Barclays believed we were liable for the loss. The fraudsters got away with it.\\" Barclays said they had already warned businesses and community projects of rising \\"CEO fraud\\". \\"This scam is a tragic case of criminal theft by a fraudster impersonating the chairman in an email to an employee within his business. We acted swiftly to recover any funds that remained in Barclays accounts at the time this was reported. We hope that the police urgently investigate this matter and bring the criminal to justice,\\" the bank said.

Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Options: A. Make it more pigmented and less shiny B. Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have C. Create a strictly plum color and a strictly pearl color D. not enough information Answer:","completion":"B.

True story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show. A contest rather. The main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure. For real. The country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd, saying it was appalling, immoral, what-is-this-world-coming-to, and the like. In a way, I had to agree. As the months passed, the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not, instead of running the country. The show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead. And up to the last moment the country was up in arms, the Prime Minister making speeches, every newspaper writing about it, everyone in the country holding their breaths. And the network pushed on. Towards a new frontier in television. And they definitely succeeded in doing just that. They pushed the envelope. The show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live, whilst she would die shortly after. And then, in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. The woman was not ill, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, that, with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions, built up for months to a fantastic climax, was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors. The man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease. Now THIS is television. Leaving everybody far behind in amazement. Don't give me a poorly acted, poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a Russian Roulette show on American TV. As if. *Spoiler* As if I'm going to believe they would get this through the FCC. As if I'm going to believe this would get through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air. It's all been done before. Watch Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it had a semi good ending. *Spoiler* This is an appallingly bad piece of film, together with a ridiculous ending. So she gets shot in the end, is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice?

Paddy saw Lightfoot almost as soon as he stepped out on the bank. He kept right on swimming with the branch of a poplar-tree until he reached his food pile, which, you know, is in the water. There he forced the branch down until it was held by other branches already sunken in the pond. This done, he swam over to where Lightfoot was watching. \\"Hello, Lightfoot!\\" he exclaimed. \\"You are looking handsomer than ever. How are you feeling these fine autumn days?\\" \\"Anxious,\\" replied Lightfoot. \\"I am feeling terribly anxious.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Context: Most patients are admitted to the hospital through the emergency department (ED), and ED waiting times partly reflect the availability of inpatient beds. We test whether the balance between daily hospital admissions and discharges affects next-day ED length of stay.', 'We conducted a cross-sectional study of hospitals in metropolitan Toronto, served by a single emergency medical services provider in a publicly funded system. During a 3-year period, we evaluated the daily ratio of admissions to discharges at each hospital and the next-day median ED length of stay in the same hospital by using linear regression.', 'Across hospitals, the daily mean (SD) 50th percentile ED length of stay averaged 218 (51) minutes. As the inpatient admission-discharge ratio increased or decreased, next-day ED length of stay changed accordingly. Compared with ratios of 1.0, those less than 0.6 were associated with an 11-minute (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 to 16 minutes) shorter next-day median ED length of stay; at admission-discharge ratios of 1.3 to 1.4, ED length of stay was significantly prolonged by 5 minutes (95% CI 3 to 6 minutes). Admission-discharge ratios on weekends and among medical inpatients had a stronger influence on next-day ED length of stay; effects were also greater among higher-acuity and admitted ED patients. Answer: Disequilibrium between the number of admitted and discharged inpatients significantly affects next-day ED length of stay. Better matching of daily hospital discharges and admissions could reduce ED waiting times and may be more amenable to intervention than reducing admissions alone. The admission-discharge ratio may also provide a simple way of tracking and enhancing hospital system performance.

Wow, did I really go to the same place as all the other Yelpers?! I feel it my civic duty to add my 2 cents. As a disclaimer, my husband and I enjoy a good prime rib. We used to live in the Bay Area and frequented HOPR in SF. Our options are limited in SD and thus we arrived at Lawry's Vegas looking forward to a nice piece of meat! The service was just eh for the price you're paying. Our waitress at one point came over and excused herself to \\"need to attend to something\\" before taking our order. She then immediately went to the table across from us and chatted up the couple and their child, who sat down 10 minutes after us, for a good 15-20 minutes!! She obviously knew them and was in no hurry to tend to us. The one star she gets was the fact they noted it was my husbands birthday and thus brought out a comp dessert. The food was rather mediocre as well. The salad was rather bland and non-descript. As per usual Lawry's style, the prime rib is served straight from the carving cart at your table.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Eating food, aside from Monster Meats, is always a good way to recover hunger, health, and sanity. Earlier on in the game, your main source of food will be from rabbits caught in traps, berries picked from berry bushes, and carrots lying around, all of which you can cook over a campfire and eat to restore your Hunger. However, for food that restores sanity, you'll need more thorough methods. Carrots can be found poking out of the ground and Berry bushes are scattered around the world. You can pick them up by left-clicking or pressing X. To catch rabbits, make a trap with 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You’ll need to “murder” the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a rabbit is selected will do the trick. With a Science Machine, you can also craft a Bird Trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab. This functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds. To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine. You can make it through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure, and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and are found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.). Once you’ve placed the farm plot, you can put a seed on it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, simply interact with the crop to gather it, and congratulations! You now have some food! Jerky and Small Jerky are long-lasting food items that restore quite a bit of all three gauges. To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal. Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the Trees. Each burned Tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption! The Crock Pot is another way of cooking your food, and you can make one with a Science Machine and costs 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about a minute for the dish to cook. Most meals can restore a great amount of sanity, as long as you figure out the recipe. You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important “edible” ingredients. Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you’ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity.

From your choices, let's consider every one of them and their overall fit in the context. Choice 1: 'adds seasonings from a can and a tortilla to the pasta;' While adding seasonings from a can would certainly further enrich the flavor of the dish, the addition of a 'tortilla' seems out of place considering that the person is preparing a spaghetti dish, not a tex-mex or Mexican dish where tortillas are prevalent food items. Choice 2: 'slices lettuce while cooking them in a separate pot;' This choice again seems somewhat disjointed from the rest of the dish. While it's possible to incorporate lettuce into the sauce or salad, cooking it in a separate pot might not seem to blend well with the rest of the dish. Raw lettuce is often used in salads or as toppings, not typically cooked alongside pasta. Choice 3: 'then starts making a salad with the pomodorate stuff and dressing along with laying out a jar of dressing;' This choice fits in the context seemingly well. The pomodoro sauce (which the 'pomodorate stuff' likely refers to) is a traditional Italian tomato-based sauce, often used in pasta recipes, which matches perfectly with the prepared spaghetti. Moreover, the presence of a salad with dressing would balance out the meal, providing it with some fresh raw elements. Choice 4: 'then adds a cup of grape tomatoes;' Enriching the sauce or dish with grape tomatoes seems like a good idea, considering their tangy flavor that could complement the rest of the meal. However, the placement or use of these tomatoes is not specified. Are they added to the sauce, used in a salad, or just served as is? Considering all the options, the most logical next event in the cooking process mentioned above would be, \\"then starts making a salad with the pomodorate stuff and dressing along with laid out a jar of dressing.\\" This choice maintains the Italian theme of the meal – spaghetti with pomodoro sauce, and introduces another element to the meal - a salad. It is logical to assume that while the spaghetti is being cooked, the person preparing the meal can simultaneously whip up a salad using the dressing. The \\"jar of dressing\\" could either refer to the same Italian dressing used earlier or another type of dressing, offering variety to the person eating the meal."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

POST : During a long road trip I stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type café/restaurant we’ve been to many times before. My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets. She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally. She’d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her. I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking. A bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she’d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she’d been pretty funny. When he brought the food over though he didn’t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her “do you know you are really beautiful?” She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn’t look up or respond and so he said it again. I got her attention and said “the man is talking to you” he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you. I was uncomfortable for a few reasons: I didn’t like his tone or the look on his face, I’ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman It’s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice “beautiful” inappropriate I made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable &amp;#x200B; Later on he came back and brought her a slice of cake I hadn’t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it’s their secret and not to tell mum.

News article: Frank, in Fight, Can't Help Fellow Democrats as Much Taunton, Mass., Mayor Charles Crowley, left, joins Bill Clinton and Barney Frank at a September campaign rally. It's the kind of political year in which even Rep. Barney Frank is being forced to break a sweat. The Massachusetts Democrat, one of Congress's most well-known members, usually wins re-election by steamrolling his opponents. This year, he's campaigning aggressively to beat back Sean Bielat, an upstart Republican challenger who was five years old when Mr. Frank first won a House seat in 1980. It remains highly unlikely Mr. Frank will lose. He remains popular in his Boston-area district. From his perch as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, he has surpassed his own fund-raising record. Internal polls show him with a 24-point lead with less than a month left; his opponent says the gap is closer to 10. Last time, Mr. Frank won by 43 points. See which House, Senate and governors' races are considered closest. But the national mood is hostile, and conservative groups would consider his defeat a trophy for their wall. Mr. Frank is now spending more time on his re-election instead of pumping money into the campaigns of vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, the traditional role of a party grandee. As a result, Mr. Frank's focus on his own district will have reverberations in races across the country. So far this election, Mr. Frank has dipped into his personal re-election account to donate just 35,000 to 12 Democratic candidates, according to campaign-finance figures compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a fraction of his largesse two years ago, when he gave 248,000 to 86 candidates. This year, he has given 250,000 to the campaign arm of House Democrats, compared with 650,000 in 2008. Jerry Seib and Aaron Zitner look at the Senate races in Washington, California and Connecticut in which Democrats are starting to gain momentum. Mr. Frank's opponent is a 35-year-old U.S. Marine Reserve officer and a business consultant from the Boston suburb of Brookline. His campaign has been focused on jump-starting the economy, taking on the political establishment in Washington and removing regulations he says hurt growth. \\"People here are tired of Barney Frank,\\" said Mr. Bielat. \\"He's been here for 30 years. He's gained a reputation for being arrogant to constituents, to the press, to whomever.\\" Mr. Bielat shocked many by raising 400,000 in September, a large number for a neophyte, and he said money has poured in this month as well. Last month, Mr. Frank, 70, drafted former President Bill Clinton to appear at a campaign event in Taunton, a sign of how seriously Mr. Frank takes the race. As one of the chief authors of the new Wall Street regulatory law, Mr. Frank has became a target of business and conservative groups who dislike the legislation. Mr. Frank said many of the attacks on his record, particularly related to housing policy and the growth of mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were inaccurate. \\"It's not my opponent that is the issue, it's the right-wing attacks,\\" Mr. Frank said. \\"No matter how implausible things are, if people are saying them over and over again, you've got to respond to them or people will believe them.\\" New England is hostile territory for House Republicans, and the 2008 election wiped the party off the map. Massachusetts seemed particularly impenetrable until January, when Republican Scott Brown won the Senate seat previously held by Sen. Edward Kennedy. Mr. Brown won Mr. Frank's district easily, suggesting to some that Mr. Frank's seat could be in play. Some Republicans believe they have a shot to win three House seats in Massachusetts alone, including Mr. Frank's. Mr. Frank's district includes a large section of blue-collar neighborhoods that make up southeastern Massachusetts. It winds north through the state and includes parts of Boston suburbs Newton and Brookline. Mr. Frank has more than 1 million on hand to finish the race, and the support of many local business groups. With just four weeks until election day, it's now looking like the Republicans have a chance of regaining control of the U.S. Senate. Senator John Cornyn, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman joins Jerry Seib to discuss GOP prospects. \\"It's much more of a race than it has been in prior years, but from our perspective, it would be a real loss to Massachusetts if Barney's not re-elected,\\" said Daniel Forte, president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, a trade group. Messrs. Frank and Bielat are scheduled to debate each other twice. \\"When turnout is low, a 10% differential in a poll can evaporate quickly,\\" said Roger Porter, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \\"While Frank clearly has the lead now, and he's very well funded and financed, he will undoubtedly put on a huge get-out-the vote effort, but so will his challenger.\\" Write to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com and Brody Mullins at brody.mullins@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Rep. Barney Frank, a prominent Massachusetts Democrat, is facing an unexpectedly competitive re-election campaign against Republican challenger Sean Bielat. 2. Frank's focus on his own re-election is limiting his ability to support other vulnerable Democratic candidates in close races across the country. 3. Bielat, a U.S. Marine Reserve officer and business consultant, has gained traction with his focus on jump-starting the economy and challenging the political establishment in Washington. 4. Frank has had to bring in political heavyweights, like former President Bill Clinton, to bolster his campaign. 5. Republican Scott Brown's Senate victory in Massachusetts earlier in the year has given hope to Republicans that Frank's seat could be up for grabs. 6.

The investigation must use many variables. Using many variables might actually make the experiment more complicated and harder to control.

While it is important to use good quality equipment, it doesn't necessarily need to be new. As long as the equipment is in proper working condition and calibrated accurately, it should suffice. 3. Results of the investigation must be recorded accurately. This seems crucial. Accurate recording of results ensures transparency and reproducibility of the experiment. Other scientists can rely on the findings if they know the results are reported with precision. 4. The investigation needs to be performed by well-known scientists. The identity of the scientists is not important, as long as proper scientific methods and protocols are followed.

What are the differences between a pompadour, fade and undercut haircuts? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choose from: 1). no 2). yes","completion":"1) To answer the first part of the question, I will have to gather information about PixelBlock, its functionality, and alternative options. Step 1: Search for information about PixelBlock PixelBlock is a Gmail extension that blocks people from tracking when users open their emails. It prevents read receipts or tracking pixels from working, ensuring the sender doesn't know when the email has been opened. Step 2: Determine if PixelBlock works According to user reviews and ratings on the Chrome Web Store, it seems that PixelBlock works effectively for most users. However, individual experiences may vary. Step 3: Identify alternative options to PixelBlock Alternatives to PixelBlock include: a. Ugly Email: Another Gmail extension that detects and blocks email tracking. b. Trackbuster: A service that works with any email provider to block tracking pixels. 2) To answer the second part of the question, I will briefly describe the differences between the pompadour, fade, and undercut haircuts. - Pompadour: The pompadour is a classic hairstyle characterized by long hair on top and shorter hair on the sides and back. The hair on top is styled upward and backward for height and volume. - Fade: A fade haircut features hair that gradually transitions from short to shorter or bald on the sides and back. There are different types of fades, such as low, mid, or high fades, depending on the starting point of the shorter hair. - Undercut: An undercut consists of long hair on top while the sides and back are shaved or cut very short. The contrast between the top and sides is more apparent than in a fade, as there is a more noticeable disconnection between the lengths. Based on the information above, I can now answer if those questions are the same: 1). no"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

In China, Qingming Day, or Tomb-Sweeping Day, falls every April. People visit their ancestors' graves to clean away the dirt. Schools sometimes organize a trip to a local martyr's park where students show their respect for those who lost their lives in revolutionary wars. In most Western countries there is no equivalent of tomb-sweeping day, but people still value the opportunity to remember loved ones. On the anniversary of a death, s visit the cemetery. Often they will leave flowers. In the US, the last Monday of May is Memorial Day. It is a holiday to show respect for those who died defending the country. The most common way to recognize the day is to wear a small piece of yellow ribbon on the chest. People also fly their own American flags. Sometimes they put a small flag on their car, tied to the antenna .Flags are also flown in yards. In the morning, all flags should be flown at half-mast in honor of fallen soldiers. In Britain, people wear red paper replica poppies in November in remembrance of those who died or were injured in all fighting, but most particularly in World War I. Why the poppy? It goes back to a poem written by John McCrae in 1915. He saw the fragile flowers growing on the graves of soldiers.

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells.

Patient A had high blood glucose level, but patient B had low blood glucose level. Rob was amazed to find how body keeps its balance. Hint: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. A:","completion":"Patient B is more likely to produce the hormone glucagon.

Article: Why can some people sleep through noises like a honking car or flushing toilet, while others are awakened by the lightest sound? To find the answer, sleep researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted an unusual study of 12 self-described deep sleepers. After tests confirmed that the healthy volunteers were solid sleepers, they took part in a three-night study in the university's sleep laboratory. The participants spent the night in a big and comfortable room. But the room also included four speakers positioned near the top of the bed. During the night, the deep sleepers were subjected to 14 different recorded sounds, like street traffic, toilets flushing, an ice machine dispensing and an airplane flying overhead. Next door, the researchers monitored their sleep patterns and brain waves. As expected, all of the participants slept ly well, but there were differences in how they responded to the noisy interruptions. Some of the sleepers didn't wake up even when a sound was blasted at 70 decibels ; others were awakened by sounds at 40 or 50 decibels. The researchers discovered that the difference in a sleeper's reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called \\"sleep spindles''. A sleep spindle is a burst of high-frequency brain activity coming from deep inside the brain during sleep. The source of the spindles is the thalamus, a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex . Before the study, the Massachusetts researchers theorized that the spindles are the brain's way of preventing sensory information from passing through the thalamus and waking the rest of the brain during sleep. They found that the sleepers who experienced the most sleep spindles during the night were also the soundest sleepers and were least likely to be awakened by noise. Scientists already know that most people become lighter sleepers with age, most likely because older people experience less \\"slow wave sleep'', which is the deepest stage of sleep. People also produce...

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. Sumatra, Indonesia (CNN) -- Few people in the world have the chance to see a former pet orangutan released back into the wild and it was about to happen right in front of me. We were with the Frankfurt Zoological Society orangutan team deep in the Sumatran jungle at the site where Bobo the endangered Sumatran orangutan was to be released. I was standing with the CNN team about 10 feet from the orangutan's crate, watching in anticipation as an Indonesian man was standing on top about to open it. He lifted one wall of the crate and Bobo slowly walked out. The orangutan was very calm as he exited the crate. The first thing he did was look over to where we were standing. That also happened to be the direction where our tech expert John had placed our gopro camera just a few feet away. It was an incredible sight and a great shot.

What is the solution?","completion":"This math problem is like a treasure hunt, but instead of seeking treasure, we're looking for the mystery number, which is d in this case. First, let's add 1447 and 158 together. This is like having 1447 candies and then someone giving you 158 more. You end up with 1605 candies. So our puzzle now looks like this: 0 = 107*d - 1605. To make it easier, we'll swap it around. This is like saying that \\"a cat is a pet\\" and \\"a pet is a cat\\" are the same. Now it looks like this: 107*d - 1605 = 0. Now, let's bring 1605 to the other side of the \\"=\\". We do that by adding 1605 to both sides (like eating the same amount of candies from both your hands, so it's fair). That gives: 107*d = 1605. Now, we know why we have 107 d's. We have to distribute the same number of candies to these 107 people (or d's). How do we find out the number of candies each person will get when we only know the total candies we have? Yes, we divide it! So if we have 1605 candies and 107 people, each person gets 1605 / 107 candies. That means d = 1605 / 107, which equals 15.

Review: I purchased the DVD set on a recommendation from Amazon.com based on my other interests. They hit the nail on the head with this one. I remember watching the show when it was on TV but always wondered what happened to it. Ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. Almost representing good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that I don't believe were granted by anything Holy. He can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person's emotions to change. None the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. All in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others I can think of, (I.E. Point Pleasant, Threshold, Nowhere Man, and SeaQuest DSV just to name a few) were cancelled way before their time. The Steven King's The Dead Zone ( Sunday's USA Network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it. There is just nothing fit to watch on TV anymore. This is because anything that deals with Christianity and Satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from TV. So, in the meantime, I'll just keep buying DVD sets and watching shows that should still be on TV but were booted off TV by religious zealots so we could watch \\"quality\\" shows like Family Guy and American Dad and The Simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).

It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap.

Some feel proud when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them, others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly. Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re-socialization process. Although many good books have been written about American mothers, only recently have some books discussed the role of a father. It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life, on the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. However, even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household.

Mauricio Pochettino praises Federico Fazio and Benji Stambouli who made their first starts for the club.","completion":"Title: Tottenham Held to Stalemate in Partizan Clash; Injuries and New Starters Mark the Game The eminent Premier League club, Tottenham Hotspur, faced a major blow when their key player, Andros Townsend, was forced to exit the field due to an upper leg injury during their hard-won encounter against Partizan Belgrade. For the Spurs, their night in Belgrade ended in a goalless deadlock, as they were unable to land even a single shot on target in the eventful 0-0 draw. Andros Townsend, the influential winger and sometimes striker for Tottenham, saw a premature end to his evening on the pitch as an upper leg injury compelled his substitution. This was undoubtedly a setback for the Spurs who already had an uphill battle ahead of them. Townsend's injury risked not only the team's offensive force but also presented a significant dilemma for the management considering the crucial fixtures that lie ahead. Tottenham's prowess was drastically curtailed as they failed to register a shot on target in the crucial fixture. Despite being known for their attacking style and ability to reroute their opponent's defense, the Spurs seemed perplexed and mildly disorganized. Their attempts at asserting dominance through their trademark aggressive play didn't materialize, leading to the goalless draw. Despite the injuries and the inability to penetrate Partizan's solid defense, there was still something that Tottenham's Head Coach, Mauricio Pochettino, found to be commendable. He reserved a word of praise for Federico Fazio and Benji Stambouli, who donned the club's colours for the first time in a starting role. Both Fazio and Stambouli displayed commendable poise and determination in their debut. Fazio, an imposing force in the centre-back role, and Stambouli, operating from deep midfield, provided a sense of solidity and showcased their potential to be consistent contributors in the upcoming games. This might have been a tough expedition for Tottenham, but it's clear that Pochettino sees glimmers of hope. With new players finding their way and the spark that comes from a fresh start, the club has much to look forward to this season. Despite this stumbling block, the club remains resolute and is ready to strive harder for the next encounter. In the wake of the draw and the forced substitution due to an injury, the club must now refocus its resources and strategy. Pochettino's post-match remarks seem promising, indicating that Tottenham will capitalize on this learning experience in future games."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For a while, as the AP reported, her whereabouts were unknown; she ended up checking into a different California facility late yesterday, TMZ reports. Apparently Lohan spent just a few minutes at Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, which was already a last-minute switcheroo from the New York facility she originally chose. Morningside had not been approved by prosecutors and it's not licensed for residential in-patient rehab—a problem since Lohan was supposed to be at a lockdown facility.

As reported by the Associated Press, for some time, her whereabouts remained unknown. However, TMZ confirms that Lohan finally checked into a different California facility late yesterday. This latest development comes after Lohan spent merely a few minutes at Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, which was already an eleventh-hour change from her original choice of a New York facility. Unfortunately for Lohan, Morningside had not been approved by prosecutors and was not licensed for residential in-patient rehab. This posed a significant issue, as Lohan was required to be at a lockdown facility. Lindsay's father, Michael Lohan, told CNN that she \\"was not happy with the place\\" and had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved. As a result, Lindsay decided to check into the Betty Ford Center, just hours before prosecutors planned to seek an arrest warrant. It is worth noting that the Rancho Mirage facility was the same one where Lohan was accused of getting into a brawl with a staff member back in 2010. Adding another twist to the story, Lindsay re-hired her previous attorney, Shawn Holley, who promptly negotiated the Betty Ford deal on her behalf with the Santa Monica city attorney. Now, all that remains is for the judge to sign off on the arrangement, which is expected to happen shortly. In a bizarre turn of events, the New York Daily News spotted the troubled actress wandering through an electronics store yesterday, and reported that she wished to fly back to her home state of New York. According to statements given by Michael Lohan to the newspaper, Lindsay seemed to have little understanding of the legal system, quoting her as saying, \\"Daddy, how can they arrest me?\\" Michael ultimately persuaded her to remain in Los Angeles to deal with the matter at hand. This ordeal has certainly brought a lot of attention to Lohan's ongoing struggles, but the hope is that the decision to enter the Betty Ford Center will provide her with the necessary support and guidance during this tumultuous time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The goal is to choose the middle statement that makes the story coherent/plausible by writing \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" in the output. If both sentences are plausible, pick the one that makes the most sense. Steps to solve the task: 1. Read the beginning, middle 1, middle 2, and ending sentences of the story. 2. Determine which middle sentence makes the story coherent/plausible when considering the beginning and ending sentences. 3. If both middle sentences are plausible, choose the one that makes the most sense. 4. Write \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" as the final answer, representing the chosen middle statement. Now, let's solve the task: Beginning: I decided to go to Maui for a vacation. Middle 1: I loved the hotel my friend told me about. Middle 2: I had a terrible time at the resort my friend suggested. Ending: That was the last time I took advice from my friend. In this case, Middle 2 makes the story more coherent, as it shows dissatisfaction with the recommended resort, which would cause the narrator not to take advice from their friend in the future. So, the answer is 2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Officials from the university are reluctant to give interviews. \\"We had a hard time calming down students who were shocked at the suicides,\\" said Zhang Jingyuan, head of HUST's center for research and guidance for students' development. \\"Media coverage may arouse some students' negative emotions again. Suicide can be contagious ,\\" Zhang said. The university reacted promptly to the first suicide on October 23. Advisors and class leaders conducted dorm-to-dorm checks to find students suffering depression. Then psychologists offered one-on-one counseling to them. Notice boards publicizing tips for identifying peers' mental problems and offering help were set up in front of dorm buildings. Leaflets carrying similar information were handed out to each dorm. However, the second suicide came seven days later. Both students were described as men of few words. Their schoolmates didn't see anything to indicate suicide. Zhang revealed that the two students had been bothered by mental disorders. But the school didn't know this until the students' close friends outside school and their parents unveiled the truth after the suicides. According to Zhang, there are only three full-time counselors working in the university's counseling center for its 60,000 students. He complained: \\"It's unrealistic to rely only on counselors to detect students' mental problems.\\" Some universities in the US may be able to offer solutions to Zhang's worries.

The Cromwellian conquest completed the British colonisation of Ireland, which was merged into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1653-59. It destroyed the native Irish Catholic land-owning classes and replaced them with colonists with a British identity. The bitterness caused by the Cromwellian settlement was a powerful source of Irish nationalism from the 17th century onwards. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, Charles II of England restored about a third of the confiscated land to the former landlords in the Act of Settlement 1662, but not all, as he needed political support from former parliamentarians in England. A generation later, during the Glorious Revolution, many of the Irish Catholic landed class tried to reverse the remaining Cromwellian settlement in the Williamite War in Ireland , where they fought en masse for the Jacobites. They were defeated once again, and many lost land that had been regranted after 1662. As a result, Irish and English Catholics did not become full political citizens of the British state again until 1829 and were legally barred from buying valuable interests in land until the Papists Act 1778.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Scientists Alan M.Goldberg and Thomas Hartung describe recent advances in replacing the use of animals in toxicology testing.Improvements in cell and tissue culture technologies,for example,allow a growing number of tests to be performed on human cells alone.Computer models are becoming increasingly complex and many could one day become more accurate than trials in living animals. Since the late 1990s,Huntingdon Life Sciences--a company that conducts testing of substances on animals conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration--has become a proving ground for aggressive strategies by animal-rights militants .At a hearing,a Senate.committee listened to testimony against Huntingdon employees and financial institutions providing services to the company.One experimentation witness at the hearing insisted that any means necessary were justified to spare animals' lives;he has previously accepted the idea of murder to that end. Use of animals in testing and in biomedical research continues to be necessary in many instances and is ethically preferable to experimenting on humans or giving up cures that could save human lives.But for the sake of people and animals alike,the development and acceptance of animal substitutes deserve enthusiastic support. In some instances, substitutes are already thought as good or better than animals,but supervising agencies have yet to catch up.In both the European Union and the U.S.,scientists and companies wanting to use the new alternative tests complain that regulatory standards for proving a drug or chemical to be safe for humans force the continued use of animals.Thus,animal-loving Americans might turn to persuading the EPA and the FDA to speed validation of new methods so that they can be more widely employed.And animal advocates who want to influence business could consider investing in the small biotech's and large pharmaceutical companies that are working to develop alternatives to animals in research. The answer is:","completion":"A. Which of the following is NOT one of the recent advances in replacing the use of animals in toxicology testing as described by scientists Alan M.Goldberg and Thomas Hartung? a) Improvements in cell and tissue culture technologies allowing tests to be performed on human cells alone. b) The use of computer models that are becoming increasingly complex and potentially more accurate than trials in living animals. c) The use of live human subjects to directly test the effects of various substances. d) Regulatory standard adjustments that allow substitutes for animal testing to be employed more widely. The correct choice in this context is (c). The article does not mention the use of live human subjects as a recent advance in replacing animals for toxicology testing. The article advocates for using human cells and sophisticated computer models as alternatives to animal testing, and also mentions the need for regulatory standards to be revised so that these alternatives can be employed more widely. This question effectively tests comprehension and understanding of the key points in the article, ensuring that the reader understands the proposed alternatives to animal testing as well as the challenges posed by existing regulatory standards. The distractor (c) is plausible and relevant to the topic, but it is not mentioned in the text, making it the correct answer choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Little did she know that this decision would lead to an unforgettable journey that would transform her life in ways she had never anticipated. Patricia had heard about the island from a mutual friend who had visited Natalie on her travels. Envisioning lush landscapes, exotic flora and fauna, and the idyllic pace of island life, Patricia's mind was set on this new adventure. As soon as she arrived on the island, Patricia could see that it was indeed a remarkable place. The picturesque shorelines, pristine beaches, and the simple yet contented residents filled her heart with a sense of belonging and an eagerness to settle in as soon as possible. Natalie, having lived on the island for many years, had nurtured deep relationships within the community and welcomed Patricia with open arms. She was well established, knowledgeable, and generous with her time and resources. Natalie knew the ins and outs of the island's customs and practices and was more than happy to help Patricia acclimate to her new surroundings. She took Patricia under her wing and introduced her to the locals and various points of interest on the island. In no time, Patricia began embracing her new way of life. She found solace in the tranquility of the island and was captivated by its stunning natural beauty. From learning about the indigenous species that inhabited the land and water, to partaking in age-old cultural traditions, Patricia was an eager and enthusiastic learner. She even began to pick up the local language, and this further endeared her to the people of the island. Aside from the scenic beauty and cultural richness, she also forged deep connections with the residents and felt a strong sense of community. Patricia found herself involved in local events, attended gatherings, and volunteered her time to support the community. At every turn, she was met with kindness, acceptance, and a genuine warmth that she'd never experienced before. These connections nurtured her growth and gave her a fresh perspective on life. As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, Patricia truly felt at home on the island. Her gratitude toward Natalie grew stronger with each passing day. It was the support and mentorship of Natalie that helped Patricia carve out a life on the island, and their friendship became an unbreakable bond.

It was very bad planning considering it was the same time that dogs, puppies, and KITTENS/CATS are going to be waiting around for a long time to get shots.

Although the reviewer acknowledged that the staff and people giving the shots were friendly and it is evident that they had their pet's shots done at this place, several negative aspects of the experience were pointed out. First, the review highlights the poor environment by describing the store as filthy and noisy. The noise level, according to the reviewer, was caused by a dog get-together event happening at the front of the store, leading to continuous barking. This exacerbated the negative experience since dogs, puppies, and cats, including the reviewer's own cat, were present in the area waiting to receive their shots. The cat's terrified state due to the barking was mentioned as a specific negative aspect of the experience. Furthermore, the dirty state of the floors led to dissatisfaction as the reviewer felt their dog was sitting in dirt throughout their time at the store. This could imply a lack of proper cleanliness and sanitation in the establishment, which can be a crucial factor in deciding whether or not to visit a store or clinic for pet-related services. The concluding statement indicates that the reviewer is unlikely to return to this place unless it's absolutely necessary to get shots for their pets again. This suggests that the negative aspects of the experience outweighed the friendly service provided by the staff and the people administering the shots. Overall, this review leans more towards the negative side and paints an unfavorable picture of the establishment in question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released \\"Imagine\\" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote Shaved Fish, a compilation LP and it reached number six on the chart that year. The photograph on the cover was taken by May Pang in 1974. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following Lennon's murder in December 1980. In 1985, the Central Park Conservancy memorialised a portion of the park in honour of Lennon, called Strawberry Fields, with a mosaic that reads \\"Imagine\\".BMI named \\"Imagine\\" one of the 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century.

Article: Some years ago on a hot summer day in south Florida, a little boy decided to go for a swim in the lake behind his house. He ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator was getting close. The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them. Luckily, after weeks and weeks in the hospital, the little boy survived. His legs were seriously scarred by the terrible attack of the animal. And on his arms, were deep scars where his mother's fingernails dug into his arms in her effort to pull the son she loved. The newspaper reporter, who interviewed the boy, asked if he would show him his scars. The boy lifted the legs. And then, he said to the reporter, \\"Look at my arms. I have great scars on my arms, too. I have them because my mum wouldn't let go.\\" Question: From the passage we can infer _ . - the son was proud of his scars on his legs - the son was proud of his scars on his arms - the mother was unwilling to let the alligator go - the mother was stronger than the alligator in fact","completion":"From the passage we can infer that the son was proud of his scars on his arms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Natalie was shy at work while Kayla was very assertive, so","completion":"Natalie often looked up to Kayla as a source of inspiration, hoping to learn from her confidence and strong communication skills. Although some people saw Kayla's assertiveness as overpowering, Natalie believed that it stemmed from a great sense of self-assurance and ability to say what needed to be said, even in challenging situations. She admired Kayla's fearlessness when it came to speaking her mind and standing up for her ideas. Natalie, on the other hand, struggled with expressing herself and often found it difficult to contribute to discussions during meetings. She worried about what others might think of her opinions, and the fear of being judged or dismissed by her peers kept her from participating as actively as she wanted to. Despite their contrasting personalities, Natalie and Kayla maintained a healthy professional relationship, finding ways to work together effectively and even complementing each other's strengths. Kayla admired Natalie's attention to detail, creative problem-solving skills, and ability to work marvelously well under pressure. Natalie's quiet dedication and diligence to her work helped counterbalance Kayla's sometimes overwhelming energy, resulting in a dynamic and efficient partnership. Observing Kayla closely, Natalie began to pick up on some of her assertive habits and strategies. She noticed that Kayla was always well-prepared; anything she thought, said, or did had a clear intention and purpose. This not only gave her an air of authority and confidence but also ensured that her ideas were backed up by strong, evidence-based arguments. Natalie realized that, for her to emulate Kayla's assertiveness, she needed to build her own confidence first. She started putting more effort into her work, double-checking her facts, and seeking constructive feedback from her colleagues to improve her performance. This practice helped Natalie grow both as an individual and as a professional, laying the groundwork for her to develop a stronger voice in the workplace. Slowly, Natalie began adopting some of the assertive communication techniques that Kayla exemplified. She practiced speaking up in meetings, ensuring she had done thorough research beforehand so she could articulate her ideas clearly and convincingly. Natalie made a conscious effort to maintain eye contact while speaking, a small but powerful tool that helped her appear more self-assured and attentive. With time and perseverance, Natalie's newfound assertiveness did not go unnoticed by her colleagues. Co-workers began to value her input and actively sought out her opinion on various matters. Natalie's diligent and thoughtful approach to her work helped her establish a newfound respect among her peers, which in turn bolstered her self-confidence. As Natalie grew more comfortable expressing herself assertively, her relationship with Kayla evolved as well. What began as a mentor-mentee dynamic transformed into a more collaborative, balanced partnership. Together, they tackled projects with renewed enthusiasm, leveraging their strengths to innovate and drive their team towards success. In the end, Natalie's journey to becoming more assertive proved not only transformative for her career but for her personal life as well. By learning to speak up and express herself confidently, she became a more well-rounded person, embracing her worth and shedding the fear that had previously held her back."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Professor Hinkle","completion":"Title: The Enchanted Classroom Genre: Adventure, Fantasy, Family Plot Summary: A talented, but down on his luck magician named Professor Hinkle gets hired by a teacher named Miss Evans to entertain her students and bring some magic to their ordinary school lives. The professor ends up finding a peculiar ancient artifact in the school's old storage, which upon recitation of a mysterious incantation, turns the classroom into an enchanted wonderland. The children, teacher, and Professor Hinkle then embark on a quest to navigate this otherworldly realm, uncover the story behind the artifact, and find their way back home. Act 1: Introducing the Characters The movie opens with an aerial shot of Northbrook Middle School, located in a quiet suburban town. We are introduced to Miss Evans, a passionate and dedicated teacher, who struggles to make her lessons exciting enough to engage her students. She has the idea of inviting a magician, Professor Hinkle, to entertain her disinterested students. Professor Hinkle, a middle-aged man with a wiry beard and twinkling eyes, is a seasoned magician who has always dreamed of performing in grand theaters and enchanting his audience with extraordinary acts of illusion. However, he now finds himself performing at children's parties and other small events, due to dwindling demand for his art. Act 2: The Discovery of the Artifact On the day of Professor Hinkle's performance in Miss Evans’ classroom, he accidentally stumbles upon an old box in the school's dusty storage room. Inside the box, he finds a peculiar artifact with a set of cryptic instructions, which he decides to use in his act. Back in the classroom, Professor Hinkle starts performing simple acts of magic that amaze and delight the students. As they become more interested, he decides to incorporate the artifact into his act by reciting the mysterious incantation inscribed upon it. To the surprise of everyone in the classroom, reciting the incantation transforms their ordinary schoolroom into an enchanted wonderland. The now bewildered students, Miss Evans, and Professor Hinkle suddenly find themselves transported to a magical realm filled with vivid landscapes and mythical creatures. Act 3: The Quest The group, now realizing they are trapped in this magical world, sets off on a journey to find a way back to their reality. Along the way, they encounter and befriend various inhabitants, such as talking animals, friendly giants, and cheerful fairies. The group learns that the artifact holds a deeper meaning and has a long history in the magical realm, having been lost for centuries. With the help of their newfound friends, the group undertakes challenges and puzzles, each one revealing more information about the artifact and its origin. They eventually discover the artifact's true purpose: to bring magic, wonder, and curiosity back into people's lives. Unbeknownst to Professor Hinkle, the artifact had chosen him, recognizing his pure heart and desire to create magical moments for his audience. Act 4: The Return and Resolution Once they've unraveled the mystery and embraced the essence of true magic within themselves, the group is guided by the talking animals to an ancient portal that allows them to return to their classroom. Upon their return, the now enchanted children bring newfound excitement and curiosity to their studies, inspired by the magic and wonder they experienced in the other realm. Having experienced the grandest adventure of his life, Professor Hinkle realizes that true magic exists not only in the extraordinary but also in the everyday moments that touch people's hearts. With a renewed sense of purpose, he continues to perform for children, enriching their lives with the essence of wonder and creativity. The movie ends with a heartwarming scene of Miss Evans, her enthusiastic students, and Professor Hinkle sharing a magical lesson together in the classroom, proving that the power of magic, imagination, and curiosity can truly transform the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose High caloric meats and happens, how will it affect LESS food being digested. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis supposes that if a person consumes high caloric meats, it would result in less food being digested. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that the high caloric intake from the meats would provide sufficient energy, and thus decrease the need to consume more food. Let's analyze its potential direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. Direct effects: 1. If less food is consumed due to high caloric meats, there will be a smaller volume of food going through the digestive process. 2. This smaller volume of food means that the stomach will have to secrete less acid and enzymes to break down the food. 3. The smaller volume of food may pass more quickly through the small intestine and colon due to the reduced need for breaking down and absorbing nutrients. Indirect effects: 1. Consuming high caloric meats might affect the body's metabolism and energy requirements, which could influence the digestive process. 2. A diet that is rich in high caloric meats might be lacking in essential nutrients, like fiber, which is crucial for healthy digestion. The absence of sufficient fiber can lead to constipation or other digestive issues. 3. High caloric meats are also typically high in fat content. Some individuals may have difficulty digesting and absorbing high amounts of fat, potentially leading to malabsorption, diarrhea, or other digestive symptoms. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis may lead to changes in the digestive process, including a smaller volume of food being digested, less secretion of acids and enzymes, and altered passage of food through the digestive system. However, it is essential to consider that the body's overall nutritional needs and individual differences in metabolism and digestive function can also play a role."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Compact and no more wobble! Review: After years of struggling with the best portable sawhorses I could find at the big orange stores I picked up a pair of these. Each leg securely locks to the frame by means of a spring loaded pin. On arrival two pins did not engage thanks to rough handling in shipment but this was quickly fixed with a round file. The legs unfolded easily and the secure click once open is a great thing. No wobble, very stable. They stand 34 inches tall before whatever top lumber you choose to add so this means less bending over all day. Once folded, rivets do protrude on the bottom of the unit but they did not seem to have excessively sharp edges. The last two legs to fold in for storage also securely lock into place keeping the unit well compacted. They could probably use a collapsible handle on the side. All in all a sturdy, portable tool for the jobsite. Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of this product review is positive.

Do Americans associate old age with telltale physical signs like wrinkles and crow’s feet? Or do they believe that passing a certain age defines a person as ‘over the hill’? According to a new study, neither – a person is defined by how old they act, and how independent they are. For instance, consumers who can no longer shop for themselves, complete housework, or drive their cars are considered ‘old,’ the study claims. Independence is an important marker of age and strongly related to a person's 'ability to drive, shop, and cook for themselves' According to the new study by Oregon State University researcher Michelle Barnhart, activities that define one’s independence are the most important markers of age. In much of America, a person’s independence is closely tied to their ability to drive, shop, and cook for themselves. Because of these unwritten adages, those who are too feeble to carry shopping bags or operate their vehicle are looked at as someone in their twilight years. To conduct her research, Ms Barnhart conducted in-depth interviews with consumers in their late 80s, as well as their caregivers and family members – often the subject’s adult children in their 50s and 60s. Michell Barnhart of Oregon State University. Her new study looks into how perceptions of aging are changing. She found that the Baby Boomers, who are aging themselves, did not wish to be seen as old, but often treated their own parents as ‘old people’ – not allowing them to exercise independence where they could and assuming they’re scatterbrained as well as slow. Because of this, she writes that conflicts are ripe to occur between the parents, who don’t see themselves as old, and their adult children, who do. Ms Barnhart notes that those in their 80s and 90s are often dealing with negative connotations of old age. ‘Almost every stereotype we associate with being elderly is something negative,’ she said, ‘from being “crotchety” and unwilling to change to being forgetful.’ One woman she interviewed, ‘Abbie,’ is 89. When her adult daughters drove her to a routine doctor’s appointment and accompanied her into the exam room, the doctor addressed her daughters and wouldn’t talk to Abbie. Ms Barnhart claims that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years, rather than valuing them for their wisdom. At later appointments, Abbie told her daughters to remain in the waiting room while she was meeting with her physician. Ms Barnhart writes that part of the problem with ‘old age’ is that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years, rather than valuing them for their wisdom. ‘Unless we change the way we view old age, the generation younger than the boomers will treat them the same way as soon as they show a few more wrinkles, or seem a bit shaky on their feet,’ she said. Her full study will be published in the April 2013 edition of the Journal of Consumer Research.","completion":"This article talks about a study by Oregon State University researcher Michelle Barnhart. She found out that being \\"old\\" is not just about having wrinkles or being a certain age, but it's about how independent someone is. Being able to drive, shop, and cook for themselves is very important for a person's independence. Sometimes, younger people make older people feel like they can't do these things anymore and treat them like they are old and forgetful. This can cause conflicts between parents and children. The study suggests that society should value older people for their wisdom, and not just see them as old because they have a few wrinkles or can't move as quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Each final count will be announced aloud, then an official report will be filed that can be viewed by nonprofit groups, the media, and candidates, said Sultan. As the counting progressed and the election results became apparent, it was clear that this was a closely contested race between two leading candidates. The results were widely accepted as credible and transparent, with both domestic and international observers expressing satisfaction with the electoral process. In his post-election speech, Sultan praised the millions of Egyptians who braved long lines and hot temperatures to cast their ballots, saying their participation marked a milestone in the nation's journey towards democracy. The winning candidate echoed this sentiment, pledging to address the pressing issues facing the country, such as unemployment, poverty, and inequality. However, the losing candidate's supporters took to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction with the results, demanding a recount. The government called for calm and assured the public that the electoral process had been fair and transparent, with all legal avenues open for the losing candidate to contest the results. In the following days, the situation remained tense but largely peaceful, as various political factions and civil society groups debated the election outcome. Ultimately, the losing candidate accepted the results and congratulated the winner, promising to work together for the betterment of the country. The international community welcomed the peaceful conclusion of the elections and called on the new government to address the country's myriad challenges, including strengthening democratic institutions and promoting social cohesion.

John Kenneth Galbraith (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947. During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan. While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan. In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%.

The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère, Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. The Olympia Paris has presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly visitors to the city.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Folies Bergère and Olympia Paris were both famous Paris institutions with some distinct differences. The main difference between the two was the style of the shows and the atmospheres they offered. While the Olympia Paris was known for its grand staircase, providing a unique setting for its shows, the Folies Bergère had a more sensual and risqué touch to its performances. The Folies Bergère, established in 1869, gained fame by presenting light and entertaining shows that often featured semi-nude female performers along with music and dance numbers. Its atmosphere was one of glamour, allure, and daring, appealing to a diverse audience looking for excitement and fun. The Folies Bergère became a symbol of the Belle Époque era in Paris, with its lavish and opulent productions. It attracted many great performers including Mistinguett and Édith Piaf, and also had close associations with famous artists like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec who made posters for the venue. On the other hand, the Olympia Paris, which opened in 1911, primarily focused on musical performances. It introduced the grand staircase as a focal point of its shows, creating a more sophisticated and elegant atmosphere. The Olympia Paris featured renowned artists such as Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, and Tino Rossi, and hosted concerts by legendary musicians like Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. In summary, the main difference between the Folies Bergère and the Olympia Paris is the type of performances each venue was known for.

This was especially \\"odd\\" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those \\"dark\\" films, too. This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an \\"odd\\" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that! Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released. The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill.

They had been discussing a topic that could potentially imply negative or controversial behavior on the part of the narrator (possibly regarding Emily's friend list) when the connection was lost, so there is concern that the sudden disconnection could be seen as an attempt to avoid answering his question or continuing the discussion. The narrator is also sensitive to how they are perceived due to past experiences with people from Hastings High School making fun of them or being obnoxious, which has made them more anxious about their interactions with others. This worry about how they come across to others, specifically in this situation, has led the narrator to hope that the other person does not think they were being rude or malicious by 'hanging up' on them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fortunately, although two-thirds of the buildings were destroyed during the excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, they were mainly the residences for the 4,000 monks and the monastery itself was not as extensively damaged as most other religious structures in Tibet, for it was the seat of the Panchen Lama who remained in Chinese-controlled territory. However, during 1966 Red Guards led a crowd to break statues, burn scriptures and open the stupas containing the relics of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas, and throw them in the river. Some remains, though, were saved by locals, and in 1985, Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, began the construction of a new stupa to house them and honour his predecessors.

The most special thing happened when I was out for this walk. I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least 70 years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me. Then, a little girl came toward him.

The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. A:","completion":"Era B would see a lower rate of weathering than Era A.

It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums.

Turn the breakers and gas back on.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Installing Your Gas Dryer: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Among the many household appliances that have evolved over the years, dryers have come a long way in terms of their efficiency and overall capabilities. Buying a new gas dryer can be an exciting investment, but it often comes with the big question of how to set it up properly. In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing your new gas dryer in a few easy steps, ensuring that it is securely connected and ready to use. Step 1: Attach the Power Cord The first step in installing your new gas dryer is to connect the power cord. Most gas dryers come with a three-prong or four-prong power cord, depending on your home's electrical sockets. It is crucial to properly attach the power cord to the dryer and ensure that it is firmly secured. We recommend following these steps: 1. Locate the terminal block at the back of the dryer. 2. Remove the terminal block cover, usually held in place by a couple of screws. 3. Connect the power cord wires to the terminal block according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The wires are typically color-coded: black (hot), red (hot), and white (neutral). If the power cord has a green wire, it should be connected to the dryer's grounding point or green screw. 4. Secure the cord by tightening the screws that hold the wires to the terminal block. 5. Replace the terminal block cover. Step 2: Move the Dryer into Its Final Position Once the power cord is securely attached, it is time to move the dryer into its final position. Consider the following tips to help you move and position your dryer: 1. Measure the space where the dryer will be placed to ensure that there is enough room for ventilation and access. There should be at least a few inches of space between the wall and the dryer. 2. Carefully slide the dryer into its final position, using a dolly or assistance from a friend if needed. Make sure not to damage any flooring or nearby objects in the process. 3. Ensure that the dryer is positioned close enough to the gas supply line and electrical outlet. Step 3: Level the Dryer Once the dryer is in place, it is essential to level the unit. An uneven dryer can cause vibrations, noise, and even potential damage to the appliance. To level the dryer, follow these steps: 1. Place a level on top of the dryer to check its alignment. 2. If the dryer is not level, adjust the dryer feet by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise until the desired level is achieved. 3. Recheck the level and make any necessary adjustments until the dryer is perfectly balanced. Step 4: Turn the Breakers and Gas Back On With the dryer correctly positioned and leveled, it's now time to restore power and gas to the appliance. 1. Turn on the circuit breaker responsible for supplying power to the dryer. 2. Open the gas supply valve to reconnect the gas line to the dryer. You may need to double-check your dryer's user manual to ensure that the gas valve is connected properly. 3. Plug the power cord into the electrical outlet. 4. Once everything is connected, test your dryer by turning it on and ensuring that it heats up properly. If you detect any issues or smell gas, turn off the appliance immediately and contact a professional for assistance. Conclusion Installing a gas dryer is a straightforward process if you follow these essential steps. With your power cord properly attached, your dryer positioned and leveled, and your breakers and gas supply restored, you can now enjoy the efficiency and convenience of your new appliance. Remember, if you encounter any difficulty during the installation process, do not hesitate to consult your dryer's user manual or contact a professional for assistance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One night, Marie goes insane and attempts to kill her children, but Alan locks her away.
