In fact, the information within the context directly contradicts this hypothesis. The context clearly states that Warren O. \\"Wedge\\" Grimm was an officer in the United States Army and served with the American Expeditionary Force Siberia stationed in Russia from 1918 to 1919. To reiterate, not only did Grimm serve as an officer in the United States Army, but he also played a significant role during his time with the American Expeditionary Force Siberia. This deployment was a part of the broader Allied intervention in Russia during the Russian Civil War, which aimed to support various anti-Bolshevik factions and protect the interests of the participating Allied countries. Furthermore, the context provides information on a tragic event that occurred after Grimm's military service – he was killed during the Centralia Massacre in Washington State on November 11, 1919. The Centralia Massacre was an incident during which members of the American Legion clashed with the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a radical labor union. Several people were killed during the violence, including Grimm. In summary, the context provided clearly indicates that Warren O. \\"Wedge\\" Grimm served as an officer in the United States Army and was stationed in Russia as part of the American Expeditionary Force Siberia from 1918 to 1919.

Both directors have made significant contributions to the world of cinema, but they hail from different countries in Europe, with distinct cultural backgrounds and filmmaking traditions. Fritz Lang was born on December 5, 1890, in Vienna, Austria-Hungary (now Austria). He is widely regarded as one of the most influential filmmakers in the history of cinema, particularly for his pioneering work in German Expressionist cinema. Lang began his career in the 1910s and gained international recognition for films such as \\"Metropolis\\" (1927), \\"M\\" (1931), and \\"The Testament of Dr. Mabuse\\" (1933). As his career progressed, Lang moved to the United States in the 1930s, where he continued to direct films until the early 1960s. Despite spending a significant portion of his career in the United States, he is primarily identified with his homeland of Austria and Germany due to his early work in the German film industry. Christophe Gans, on the other hand, was born on March 11, 1960, in Antibes, France. He is a French film director, screenwriter, and producer known for his work in various genres, including action, horror, and fantasy. Gans is an avid fan of Japanese culture, manga, and anime, which have influenced a number of his films. Some of Gans' most notable works include adapting the video game \\"Silent Hill\\" into a successful horror film in 2006 and directing the French fantasy action film \\"Brotherhood of the Wolf\\" (2001), which received both critical acclaim and box office success. Gans is primarily associated with the French film industry, drawing from the country's rich cinematic tradition. In conclusion, Fritz Lang and Christophe Gans are not from the same country. Lang was born in Austria and is primarily associated with the Austrian and German film industries, while Gans was born in France and has been an active figure in French cinema. Although both directors share a passion for filmmaking, their geographical origins and cultural influences set them apart."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies.

The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was given to Napoleon's force?\\" is in \\"Before the formation of the Third Coalition, Napoleon had assembled an invasion force, the Armée d'Angleterre, around six camps at Boulogne in Northern France. He intended to use this invasion force to strike at England. They never invaded, but Napoleon's troops received careful and invaluable training for future military operations. The men at Boulogne formed the core for what Napoleon later called La Grande Armée. At the start, this French army had about 200,000 men organized into seven corps, which were large field units that contained 36 to 40 cannons each and were capable of independent action until other corps could come to the rescue. A single corps properly situated in a strong defensive position could survive at least a day without support, giving the Grande Armée countless strategic and tactical options on every campaign. On top of these forces, Napoleon created a cavalry reserve of 22,000 organized into two cuirassier divisions, four mounted dragoon divisions, one division of dismounted dragoons, and one of light cavalry, all supported by 24 artillery pieces. By 1805, the Grande Armée had grown to a force of 350,000 men, who were well equipped, well trained, and led by competent officers.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

News article: It was so horrific it became national news: Two years ago my three little girls were killed when my sister-in-law drove the wrong way down a New York highway. People wonder how you can go on after a tragedy like that. The answer is, you have to. How It Happened My life changed so dramatically on July 26, 2009, that I sometimes wonder if I'm still the same person. I used to hear stories of awful tragedies and think of all the reasons it could never happen to me. I found out that the unthinkable can happen to any of us. On that Sunday afternoon Diane Schuler drove a minivan the wrong way on the Taconic Parkway in New York and slammed headfirst into an oncoming SUV. Eight people died in the collision, including three little girls who were sitting in the minivan's backseat. I am the mother of those beautiful girls: Emma, Alyson, and Katie, ages 8, 7, and 5. The girls had gone off for a weekend camping trip with their aunt Diane, uncle Danny, and cousins Bryan and Erin, ages 5 and 2. They had been excited about this annual event, and they checked in with us many times over the weekend to tell us how much fun they were having. I missed them but I felt confident that they were safe, since my husband, Warren, and I had sent them away with my sister-in-law, the most responsible person I knew. Then came the conversation that I replay in my head a dozen times a day. On the drive back home, Emma, our oldest, called us from the car and said, \\"Something is wrong with Aunt Diane.\\" I heard other children crying in the background and then the phone cut out. Warren called back immediately and when he spoke to his sister, she didn't sound right. He told her not to drive -- to pull over right away. We thought she was having a stroke. He got Emma on the phone to describe exactly where they were. I stayed home and called 911; Warren raced off to try to find them. But by then it was too late. Instead of stopping, Diane drove the wrong way down an exit ramp, continued along the highway and hit the SUV. My three kids, Diane and her daughter, Erin, 2, were all killed. The three men in the SUV also died. Only my nephew Bryan, now 7, survived the crash. When something this terrible happens, your brain simply can't process it -- or at least mine couldn't. For weeks after the accident I'd wake up thinking it was that Sunday again and that the girls were heading home. And every day my husband or one of my friends would have to tell me the awful news all over again. For the first month friends stayed at my house 24 hours a day -- sleeping on the couch or sitting outside our bedroom door. It wasn't just to keep me company. I was so dazed with grief that I'd wander out of my room or out of the house at all hours. I don't know what I was doing -- searching for the girls? My friends and family would gently steer me back where I belonged. They were amazing, helping with everything, including dealing with all the phone calls from Oprah and Dr. Phil and other talk shows. News helicopters were circling over my house and police had to rope off our street since so many reporters had gathered. But I didn't talk to anyone. I couldn't. Since the accident I've spoken to other moms who've lost a child, and they usually say that they needed to stay strong for the children they still have. I didn't even have that. All I could think about was Emma, Alyson, and Katie, my three beautiful girls, and all the wonderful things they'd never do, never see. The girls were very different, but they had an incredible bond. Emma was a good student and was into sports, everything from gymnastics to basketball. She enjoyed performing onstage, but the role she took most seriously was being a big sister. Alyson loved a good time and wanted to be sure everyone was included in it -- which they always were, since her smile and laugh were contagious. And Katie, the baby, was all about the hugs and kisses, which she gave freely and asked for often. And she idolized her older sisters. My girls were more than just siblings. They were best friends. We're family, so we buried the girls next to Diane and Erin. But I had no idea at the funeral what we would find out later. Toxicology reports showed that Diane had a blood alcohol level double the legal limit, along with evidence she'd been smoking marijuana. Warren and I were stunned. People always ask how I feel about Diane. You can't imagine how complex that question is. How does a person go from being like a sister to me -- adored by my girls and cherished by my husband -- to being the one who ruined our lives? How could this person I trusted completely have done something so unthinkable that I couldn't -- and still can't -- wrap my head around it? I pray every day that there is another explanation. To not have any answers is torture. I don't know how to describe that pain. When something like this happens, you want to be able to hate someone. When I see the misery in Warren's eyes, I know what he's thinking. It was his sister who did this, his sister who destroyed our lives. I can't blame him for her actions. And since Diane's not here, I can't take out my anger, my confusion, or my heartache on her. There's no one left to hate. And anyway, we both loved her very much. Warren and I have struggled with our grief, and the differences in how we grieve, from the first day. He copes by staying busy and trying not to think about it. I'm the opposite: I need to talk. We are different people, but we're both broken. I need someone to help me to take the pain away. But how can Warren do that for me when he is in the same place, struggling with his own pain? When I look to him for strength, all I see is heartache. People are always quoting the statistics on how few marriages survive the death of a child. When you factor in our extraordinary circumstances, you really begin to wonder how Warren and I can hold on. But I love him very much -- that part hasn't changed. For that reason, and for the love of my daughters and the family that I cherished, I am holding on to my husband and to the idea that we can survive this. But I have to admit that it's not easy to do. The split in our extended family makes it even harder. Warren and I have remained private until now, but Diane's husband, Danny, went public to defend her reputation and to search for another explanation for what happened to her. As I write this, I know that a television special made with his permission is about to air on HBO. I can't imagine what it will say. I hope there are answers to all our questions, but I don't know if I'll even be able to watch it. The film is called There's Something Wrong with Aunt Diane. The fact that they used my daughter Emma's last words as a title only makes it that much more painful. I miss my niece, Erin. And my godson, Bryan, the only survivor -- I love him and think of him every day. I am hoping I get strong enough to have a relationship with him again. He was in the car, the last person to see and hear my girls. I have so many questions, too many for a little boy to answer. I have to be able to trust myself around him and right now I don't. I want to reach out and hug him and at the same time try to shake answers out of him, answers he doesn't have. So for now, I stay away. After the accident, desperate for answers, I visited many priests and asked why all my girls were taken. \\"They needed to be together,\\" I was told over and over again. That just made me angrier. Didn't the girls need to be together here on earth with Warren and me? For my whole life I always went to church. But after this tragedy I stopped going. How could I believe that God had been listening to my prayers? ||||| Two years ago, Jackie Hance lost everything when all three of her daughters died in a gruesome wrong-way car crash on New York's Taconic Parkway. But today, she is pregnant again after undergoing in vitro fertilization in a twist of fate that she says came from a dream about her beloved daughters. Hance, 40, of Floral Park, N.Y., announced her pregnancy just as HBO is ready to air its own documentary, \\"Something's Wrong With Aunt Diane,\\" on the drunk-driving accident. The girls were killed on their way home from a camping trip in upstate New York when their aunt, Diane Schuler, 36, drove 70 mph down the wrong side of the parkway for two miles before slamming her SUV head-on into another vehicle. Toxicology reports showed that Schuler's blood alcohol level was twice the limit -- the equivalent of 10 shots of vodka -- and she was high on marijuana. Just minutes before the deadly crash, Hance's daughter, Emma, had called her mother to say, \\"Something's wrong with Aunt Diane.\\" Hance's girls, Emma, 8; Alyson, 7; and Katie, 5, as well as Schuler and her 2-year-old daughter Erin died instantly. Three men in the other vehicle also died, a total of eight people. The only survivor was Schuler's son Bryan, 5. \\"Parenting is not something you can ever let go of, even if your children are gone,\\" Hance wrote in the Ladies Home Journal this week. Hance is expecting her baby in September. But psychologists say having a baby too soon after the death of a child is no panacea for grief. Hance writes that her friends persuaded her to have another child as a way of coping with the \\"torture\\" that she has felt since her girls died, unable even to cook because it reminds her of her daughters' excitement at mealtime. \\"After the accident so many people suggested that Warren and I consider having another child. They said having a baby was what the girls would want and it would give us a future,\\" she writes. Experts say the term \\"replacement child\\" is a cruel one, suggesting that a parent wipes out the agonizing grief of the death of one child with the birth of another. Just last year, actors John Travolta, 57, and his wife Kelly Preston, 48, had a baby boy, Benjamin, after the loss of their 16-year-old son Jett in 2009 after he had a seizure at their vacation villa in the Bahamas. So, too, did former presidential candidate John Edwards and his then-wife Elizabeth after the death of their son Wade in a North Carolina car crash. The had two children, Emma, now 13, and Jack, 11. When a child dies, many parents have a \\"natural urge\\" to have another, according to Katherine Shear, professor of psychiatry and social work at Columbia University who specializes in complicated grief. \\"A lot of parents do wish to have another child to come to terms with the loss,\\" she said. \\"After they've accepted the loss, it's a very natural part of life and can be a very healing thing to do.\\" \\"When they do this, it's usually with a little bit of sadness and trepidation even when they know it's the right thing for them, and I don't think we should judge them,\\" she said. \\"When they make that decision, it's a hard one to make and we should primarily support them.\\" Replacement Child Can Compound Grief Other psychologists say that having another child so quickly after such a tragic loss can compound the devastation, leaving the grief process unresolved. The pain felt by bereaving parents is one of the most intense of all sorrows and the most complicated. \\"In Western culture, all feelings of hope and meaning and expectations are projected on to the child,\\" said Therese Rando, a Rhode Island psychologist who wrote, \\"How to Go on Living When Someone You Love Dies\\" Overcoming that grief can be difficult, especially if parents remember times they were angry with the child. \\"When we lose a child, we feel our expectations are violated,\\" said Rando. \\"It's like losing a lung, it's so central,\\" she said. \\"There is more guilt, more anger and more shattered pain, and other people in society are terrified of you because if it can happen to your child, it can happen to mine.\\" As the child's protector, we have \\"basically failed at the task\\" if a child dies, according to Rando. \\"We are assaulted. There is a sense of powerlessness and inability to carry out our role as parents.\\" Having another child after the \\"work of grieving\\" is over, can be a good idea, but not to replace the loss. \\"The new pregnancy should not be an attempt to deal with the sadness,\\" she said. \\"They will see this new little person as a distinct member of their family.\\" Hance said that she had her tubes tied after having her third child, but decided to do IVF after a doctor offered the procedure after hearing her story. She said her daughters came to her in a dream: \\"I was standing in heaven and I could see Emma, Alyson, and Katie through these big gates. God would not let me inside the gates. He said that I had been given a gift from that doctor and I had to use his gift before I could be with my babies.\\" Dr. Richard Paulson, director USC Fertility in Los Angeles, said that having another child can sometimes fulfill the dreams of a complete family. \\"It's not a replacement child, it's a reconstituted family,\\" said \\"Because that person is gone, you don't replace that person,\\" he said. Paulson said he had worked with many patients seeking another pregnancy after the death of a child. \\"People variously go through the grieving process and try to figure things out,\\" he said. \\"It's fair to wait a reasonable amount of time, at least a year, and as the grief passes and you learn to live with the fact the person is gone, you can start looking forward.\\" Complicating Hance's grief is the fact that the woman who is responsible for her daughters' deaths is her sister-in-law, a woman she considered \\"the most responsible person I knew.\\" She said the accident has torn their family apart. Hance has been unable to even speak to her nephew Bryan, who was the last person to see the girls alive. \\"I want to reach out and hug him and at the same time try to shake answers out of him, answers he doesn't have,\\" she writes. \\"So for now, I stay away.\\" The Hances refused to participate in the making of the documentary by Oscar-nominated filmmaker Liz Garbus, which portrays Schuler as a \\"super mom\\" who rarely drank. Schuler's husband, Daniel, cooperated with documentary producers and has contended all along -- despite lawsuits from the families of the adult crash victims -- that his wife may have had a stroke or other medical complicating factor to cause the accident. Hance still struggles with allowing her children to go on the camping trip with their relatives. \\"People always ask how I feel about Diane,\\" writes Hance. \\"You can't imagine how complex that question is. How does a person go from being like a sister to me -- adored by my girls and cherished by my husband -- to being the one who ruined our lives?\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Jackie Hance lost her three daughters Emma, Alyson, and Katie in a tragic car accident in 2009 when her sister-in-law, Diane Schuler, drove the wrong way down New York's Taconic Parkway while under the influence of alcohol and marijuana.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: It’s never helpful to tell someone to stop crying or that whatever they are crying about isn’t worth their tears. Crying lets a person feel better. Emotions when vented are better than if they are stored inside because bottled up emotions lead to mental illnesses like depression. If someone is crying, let them cry. Never say things like, \\"Don't cry\\" or \\"This is such a small thing, why are you crying?\\" They are sharing a vulnerable moment with you, so allow them to express what needs to be expressed without telling them how to feel. You might feel awkward or uncomfortable around someone who’s crying. Remember that your role is to offer support in a way that’s helpful to them, and the focus is ultimately not on you. They might want you to stay and listen or they may want some space and alone time. Don’t assume you know what they want because you don’t. Asking what they want and need puts the other person in control and gives you the opportunity to listen and respond. Whatever they ask for or need, respect what they say. Ask, “What can I do to help?” or “How can I support you?” If they ask that you leave, leave. Refrain from saying things like \\"But you need me to help you!\\", rather just say \\"Okay, fine but if you need something, call or text me.\\" People need space sometimes. You shouldn’t feel like you’re in a rush or need to go do something. Part of being supportive is being there and giving your time for the person. If you’re there to comfort them, give them the time that they need. Your presence alone can be comforting, so sticking around and making sure they are capable of getting on with their day or getting further help can be what they need most. Don’t stop for a few moments then get on with your day. Stay with them and let them know you will stay if they need you. Even if you have work to do, giving a few mins extra won't hurt. If you know your friend likes hugs, give them a hug. However, if they tend to be more physically reserved, you may wish to pat them on the back or perhaps not touch them at all. If you’re helping a stranger, it’s best to ask if they want physical touch. If you’re in doubt, ask if they’d like a hug or for you to hold them. If they don't want physical touch, don't do it. Ask, \\"Mind if I hug you\\"? Your friends or family may want physical touch more than strangers, so make sure you don't make the person more uncomfortable.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure. It means that the President could commit capital treason, or any other federal crime, and then immediately pardon himself. \\"It means that he could commit murder in the White House,\\" Koppelman said. \\"It makes no sense within the Constitution as a whole.\\" Asked by reporters Monday about Trump’s comment on his ability to pardon himself, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders repeatedly replied: \\"The...

He was the first to write ballades and scherzi as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op. 28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert étude, already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op. 10 published in 1833, Op. 25 in 1837).\\"?

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which friend studied less about ethane gas? Vic and Joe studied chemistry in school. Joe studied alkanes, while his friend Vic studied other acyclic hydrocarbons. Hint: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in - ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane, with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and several other alkanes are listed in Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally have higher boiling and melting points. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Vic. Given the information in the paragraph, Joe studied alkanes, a type of hydrocarbon. Ethane is described as an alkane, meaning it would fall under Joe's area of study. On the other hand, Vic studied other acyclic hydrocarbons, which does not explicitly include alkanes. Therefore, Vic is the friend who studied less about ethane gas."},{"prompt":"Combine facts and answer this: Located in market town of Frodsham, the M56 motorway is also known as what?

He was a key figure in the political landscape of Quebec and Canada, with his active participation in two major political parties: the Quebec Liberal Party and the Liberal Party of Canada. Côté first took office as a member of the Legislative Assembly of Quebec for the Bonaventure constituency. His term commenced in 1924 and concluded in 1936. He succeeded Joseph-Fabien Bugeaud and Charles Marcil and was succeeded by J.-Alphée Poirier. His political career had a reprise when he embarked a second term, starting in 1937 and ending in 1939. During this time, he again represented the Bonaventure constituency, with his successor being Henri Jolicoeur. Further testament to his political significance, Côté held the position once again from 1939 to 1944 with Henri Jolicoeur being his predecessor and successor. This distinguished him as a three-term parliamentarian under the auspices of the Canadian Parliament. His contributions to politics were significant and demonstrated his commitment to the service of his constituents and the wider Canadian populace.

During the day, elements of a Bavarian and two Prussian corps became engaged and were aided by Prussian artillery, which blasted holes in the defenses of the town. Douay held a very strong position initially, thanks to the accurate long-range fire of the Chassepots but his force was too thinly stretched to hold it.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)A ship arrives in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Four of the alighting passengers are: Major H. O. Jones (Alec Guinness), a British businessman with a letter of invitation to do business with the government; Mr. and Mrs. Smith (Paul Ford and Lillian Gish), an elderly American couple who wish to set up a vegetarian complex for education and nutrition for the locals; and the central character, a cynical, washed-up hotel owner named Brown, portrayed by Richard Burton.Upon arrival, Major Jones presents his credentials to Captain Concasseur (Raymond St. Jacques), a law enforcement officer, who notices that the official who invited Jones has been deposed and imprisoned. Concasseur and his men rough up and imprison Jones.Brown has been bequeathed a hotel in the capital from his late British mother, but has been unable to sell it in his trip to New York City. Brown also has an ongoing affair with Martha (Elizabeth Taylor), the German-born wife of the Uruguayan ambassador to Haiti, Pineda (Peter Ustinov). When Martha and Brown have an argument, Brown goes to Mere Catherine's brothel where he discovers that not only has Jones been released, but he's a guest of Captain Concasseur and is enjoying the hospitality of Brown's favourite prostitute, Marie Therese (Cicely Tyson).Jones has gained the favour of the new regime, who are keen to receive a supply of arms. They have paid a down payment, and Jones claims the weapons are impounded in a warehouse in Miami, but the weapons may be imaginary and a confidence trick by Jones. The government will not allow Jones to leave the island until they are sure the weapons exist.Mr. Smith, a former \\"Vegetarian Party\\" candidate for the Presidency of the United States against Harry S. Truman, is given a tour of the new capital, an empty shambles called Duvalierville. He and Mrs. Smith follow a local procession that they believe is a religious ceremony but turns out to be an audience for executions by firing squad. Captain Concasseur and his men enter Brown's hotel and beat him up until Mrs. Smith bluffs the thugs by threatening to inform her husband, the American \\"presidential candidate.\\" The Smiths depart the next day.Brown watches as the Duvalier regime seeks to put down any dissent with an iron fist. He becomes friends with Dr. Magiot (James Earl Jones), the rebel leader.As Brown becomes a reluctant participant in the planned insurrection, the rebels recruit Major Jones to provide military leadership. Jones has been regaling the other expatriates with his tales of heroism as a commando officer in the Burma Campaign that Brown does not quite believe. Brown hosts a meeting of the group, including Magiot, Jones, and Ambassador Pineda. But trouble ensues soon thereafterÂ â Duvalierâs spies from the Tonton Macoute are watching Brownâs Hotel Trianon and his every step.The day after the meeting, three assassins confront Magiot while heâs performing surgery and cut his throat with a scalpel knife. Brown reluctantly agrees to drive Jones, who escapes by dressing as Brown's female cook, wearing drag and blackface. Taking him to a rebel base, Brown suspects that Jones has become involved with Martha Pineda. The inebriated Jones makes matters worse by bragging about his conquest.Driving carelessly up the treacherous, winding road, Brown hits an embankment and breaks the carâs front axle. On foot, they arrive at a remote cemetery, the designated meeting point. They settle in for the night with Jones admitting that his jungle war stories were total fabrication, as was his claimed conquest of Martha. His wartime career involved running a cinema in India, and he'd never been with a woman he hadn't paid \\"or promised to pay.\\"In the morning, Captain Concasseur and one Tonton Macoute accost Brown at the cemetery. Brown denies that the Major is there, talking loudly to warn Jones. But a sleepy Jones approaches anyway. Commanded to stop, Jones turns and runs, but is killed. Brown is ordered into a jeep, but shots from rebels ring out. Concasseur and his henchman drop dead.Asked about Jones, Brown tells the two rebels in dismay: \\"You arrived two minutes too late.\\" The rebels plead with Brown to assume the role of Jones, seeing this as the only hope they have left. Brown hesitates, but relents after being asked whether he wants to continue living like this.The three meet up with a ragtag group of poorly equipped rebels who believe that Brown is Jones. He gives a cynical, taunting speech, apparently without being understood, since the rebels speak French and he English.The Pinedas are leaving the island. Petit Pierre (Roscoe Lee Browne), a journalist friend of Brown, tells them about a battle between government troops and rebels. He says two rebels have been killed, one \\"unidentified.\\" As the plane takes off, Martha notices smoke on a hillside of the island. The question whether Brown has survived remains unanswered., Question: Where does the ship arrive?

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin, including Beethoven's Ode to Joy, with the word \\"Joy\\" changed to \\"Freedom\\" in the lyrics sung.The orchestra were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .\\"The pigs are intelligent,\\" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. \\"They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic.\\" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin. Pigs within city limits are only shot if they make an immediate threat.No humans have yet been seriously wounded by them, but local dogs have been the victims of their tusks. \\"The forestry department is not aiming to get rid of the pigs,\\" explains Franusch, \\"but we do have to reduce dangerous situations.\\" Options: A in Berlin people can never kill any wild pig B it is against law to offer food to wild pigs C wild pigs each weigh more than three hundred pounds D traffic accidents are mainly caused by wild pigs in Berlin Answer: B it is against law to offer food to wild pigs Question: The answer to this question is:","completion":"In the context of the article about wild pigs in Berlin, which of the following statements is true?

Victoria and Albert attended the opening of a new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on 5 August 1858, in an attempt by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy in comparison to the French one. Derby's ministry did not last long, and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that the band that released an album in 1983 did not choose to use for the cover design? In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album.

Question: What did Dutton do for Saint Helena? Context: In 1657, Oliver Cromwell granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena and the following year the company decided to fortify the island and colonise it with planters. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort and houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a royal charter giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island. The fort was renamed James Fort and the town Jamestown, in honour of the Duke of York, later James II of England.

Unlock your phone and open the Gallery application. 2. On the main gallery screen, you will see all your photo albums. To access hidden albums, you need to perform a special gesture on the screen. 3. Touch the screen and, using two fingers, make a \\"pinch-in\\" gesture. This means moving your fingers towards each other on the screen. Make sure the gesture is recognized by the phone. 4. After performing the pinch-in gesture, you will be prompted to enter your Privacy Protection password or use your fingerprint to authenticate. This is to ensure that only authorized users gain access to hidden albums. 5. Once authenticated, you should see all the hidden photo albums in the Gallery application. If you want, you can unhide these albums by selecting them individually and choosing the \\"Unhide\\" option from the menu. 6. If you're not able to view the hidden photos, even after following these steps and enabling the \\"Show hidden albums\\" option in the Settings, it's possible that the files may have either been moved or deleted. In this case, you may need to use a file manager application like Xiaomi's in-built File Manager app or a third-party app like ES File Explorer to navigate to the internal storage and locate the HiddenAlbum folder manually. 7. Within the HiddenAlbum folder, you should find separate folders for each hidden album. Check inside these folders to find the photos you're looking for. If you still cannot find them, you may need to recover the lost files using a data recovery tool or seek assistance from the Xiaomi customer support team.

Q: Offset regression is a standard method for spatial localization in many vision tasks, including human pose estimation, object detection, and instance segmentation. However, if high localization accuracy is crucial for a task, convolutional neural networks will offset regression usually struggle to deliver. This can be attributed to the locality of the convolution operation, exacerbated by variance in scale, clutter, and viewpoint. An even more fundamental issue is the multi-modality of real-world images. As a consequence, they cannot be approximated adequately using a single mode model. Instead, we propose to use mixture density networks (MDN) for offset regression, allowing the model to manage various modes efficiently and learning to predict full conditional density of the outputs given the input. On 2D human pose estimation in the wild, which requires accurate localisation of body keypoints, we show that this yields significant improvement in localization accuracy. In particular, our experiments reveal viewpoint variation as the dominant multi-modal factor. Further, by carefully initializing MDN parameters, we do not face any instabilities in training, which is known to be a big obstacle for widespread deployment of MDN. The method can be readily applied to any task with a spatial regression component. Our findings highlight the multi-modal nature of real-world vision, and the significance of explicitly accounting for viewpoint variation, at least when spatial localization is concerned. A:","completion":"Offset regression struggles in high localization accuracy tasks due to convolution operation limitations and multi-modality. The proposed solution utilizes mixture density networks (MDN) for better performance, specifically addressing viewpoint variation and improving 2D human pose estimation accuracy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (Choices: A). negative. B). positive.).","completion":"A). Negative Movie Review: Title: \\"Disappointment on the Big Screen\\" As a movie aficionado, I always look forward to the opportunity to witness cinematic masterpieces. Unfortunately, my experience watching \\"Disappointment on the Big Screen\\" was far from satisfying. There are multiple factors that contributed to my discontentment with this film, and I will discuss them in this review. Step 1: Analyze the storyline The storyline was one of the major issues in this film. It lacked originality and felt like a rehash of various plotlines from previous films in the genre. As a result, it became increasingly difficult to stay engaged in the movie, as it was all too predictable. Furthermore, the story was riddled with plot holes and inconsistencies that left the audience seeking answers, ultimately causing confusion and frustration. Step 2: Evaluate the character development The characters in the film were underdeveloped, making it challenging to connect or empathize with their experiences. Stereotypical tropes and lazy writing left the characters feeling one-dimensional and unrelatable. Additionally, the dialogues were weak and did not add any substance to the characters or the storyline. Step 3: Assess the direction The direction of the film was lackluster, with poor pacing and a disjointed narrative. The film seemed to meander aimlessly between scenes without any clear direction, leaving its audience feeling disoriented and disconnected from the action on-screen. Step 4: Examine the cinematography The cinematography in the film did not add any artistic value nor enhance the storytelling experience. The camera work was uninspired and poorly executed, leading to bland visuals and lackluster scene compositions. Step 5: Consider the performances The actors' performances were unconvincing and lacked depth, making it more challenging for the audience to connect with them. It is unclear if the blame for this lies with the talent themselves or the script and direction; however, the lackluster portrayals ultimately detracted from the overall experience. Step 6: Reflect on the overall experience In conclusion, \\"Disappointment on the Big Screen\\" was a let-down in multiple areas – from storytelling to character development and direction. The film could have been a much richer experience had these factors been thoroughly addressed and refined. Instead, it remains a prime example of wasted opportunity, leaving viewers longing for a more immersive and enjoyable experience."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To combine eggs in a bowl, you can","completion":"follow a step-by-step process that is both easy and efficient. The process of combining eggs in a bowl involves breaking the eggs, beating them, and incorporating any additional ingredients if desired. Depending on the number of eggs and the specific recipe, you may need to use a whisk, a fork, or an electric mixer for this process. The following step-by-step guide outlines how to combine eggs in a bowl successfully: Equipment and supplies: 1. Fresh eggs (as many as required by your recipe) 2. A clean, medium-sized mixing bowl 3. A whisk, fork, or electric mixer 4. A separate small container or cup (for breaking eggs into) 5. A trash receptacle or plastic bag (for disposal of empty eggshells) 6. Measuring cups (for any additional ingredients, such as milk or cream, if required by your recipe) 7. A rubber spatula (optional) Step-by-step process: 1. Prepare your work area: Clean your work surface and gather your equipment and supplies. Ensure that your hands are clean and dry before starting the process. 2. Break the eggs: Hold one egg in your dominant hand. Gently tap the egg against the edge of the small container or cup, applying just enough pressure to create a crack in the shell. Be careful not to use too much force, as this can cause the egg to shatter and create a mess. Carefully pry the eggshell apart over the container, allowing the egg's contents to drop into the container. It's important to break each egg into a separate container before adding it to the mixing bowl. This way, you can ensure that each egg is fresh and free of any shell fragments. 3. Inspect the egg: Examine the small container containing the egg's contents. Check for any bits of eggshell that may have fallen in; if you spot any, carefully remove them using a fork. Additionally, ensure that the egg is fresh; if it appears discolored or has a strong, unpleasant odor, discard it and use another egg. 4. Transfer the egg to the mixing bowl: Once you have determined that the egg is fresh and free of shell fragments, carefully pour it into the mixing bowl. 5. Repeat steps 2 through 4: Continue breaking, inspecting, and transferring the eggs to the mixing bowl until you have added the required number of eggs for your recipe. 6. Add any additional ingredients to the mixing bowl: If your recipe calls for any additional ingredients, such as milk or cream, measure out the appropriate amount and add it to the bowl with the eggs. Some recipes may also require salt or other seasonings; add these according to the recipe's instructions. 7. Beat the eggs: Using a whisk, fork, or electric mixer, begin to beat the mixture in the bowl. Start at a low speed and gradually increase the speed if necessary. Make sure to mix the egg yolks and whites thoroughly, as well as any additional ingredients. If you are using a fork, employ a vigorous, side-to-side stirring motion to ensure proper blending. The finished mixture should be smooth, with a consistent texture and color. 8. Optional step: Scrape down the sides of the bowl using a rubber spatula to ensure that any residual egg or other ingredients are fully incorporated into the mixture. 9. Use the egg mixture in your recipe: Once you have achieved the desired consistency, your combined eggs are ready for use in your chosen recipe, whether you're making scrambled eggs, an omelette, or using the eggs as an ingredient in a baked dish. Enjoy! Remember to thoroughly clean the mixing bowl, whisk or electric mixer, spatula, and other utensils with warm, soapy water when you have finished preparing your meal. Store any remaining eggs safely in your refrigerator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

A: Answer:","completion":"The fusion inside a star ends after it reaches the red giant stage. In general, a star's life progresses from a protostar to a main sequence star, which is a yellow dwarf for stars similar to our Sun. During this stage, the star fuses Hydrogen into Helium in its core through a process known as nuclear fusion, resulting in a substantial amount of energy in the form of light and heat. At a certain point, the hydrogen in the core is almost entirely converted into helium. This leads the core to compress under gravity, which increases the core temperature. The outer layers expand due to the increased heat, transforming the star into a red giant. During the red giant phase, helium atoms in the core fuse to become carbon and oxygen, but this fusion process won't last long. In the case of smaller stars like our Sun, the core fusion ceases after the helium is depleted, and the star becomes a white dwarf. Larger stars may undergo further fusion processes to form heavier elements. Finally, in case of very massive stars, they might end up as neutron stars or black holes after a supernova explosion. So, the nuclear fusion ends for standard stars like the Sun after their transition from the red giant stage to becoming a white dwarf. This is when they have exhausted the fuel necessary for fusion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. A leopard jumped across a building in Meerut on Feb. 23. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images A leopard made its way into the wards of a hospital in Meerut, Uttar Pradesh on Sunday, terrifying patients and staff for around 12 hours before wounding a police officer after it smashed its way through a window and fled. The animal, which was still on the loose on Monday, was first spotted early Sunday in a timber warehouse in a densely-packed market place in the northern city, which has a population of nearly three-and-a-half million. Within minutes, a large crowd had gathered and “a couple of mischievous elements” attempted to tease the creature, according to Sushant Sharma, a regional forest officer. Advertisement It was then that the leopard ran to the Meerut Cantonment Hospital, about a mile away from the market square, and entered a ward where three patients were staying at around 1.30 p.m., said a spokesperson for the Cantonment Board, a committee of supervisors at the military quarters in the city. There are about 8,000 leopards in India, and nearly 200 are poached each year, said Shekhar Kumar Niraj, who heads the India chapter of TRAFFIC, a wildlife trade monitoring network run by the World Wildlife Fund. As urban areas encroach on nearby forests the animals are venturing more frequently into populated neighborhoods. Biologically, said Mr. Kumar Niraj, the wild cat is a multi-habitat species leading to clashes with humans. Mohammed Ali Zafar, the Cantonment Board spokesman, said “there were about three patients in the ward who were evacuated in a matter of a few seconds and the door was shut behind them.” Efforts to cage the animal inside the hospital carried on for nearly 12 hours, Mr. Zafar added. The leopard escaping the Meerut Cantonment Hospital. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images At 8 p.m., he said, a team of three officials from the Wildlife Trust of India, a non-profit conservation organization headquartered in Noida, arrived from Bijnor, a neighboring district about 45 miles north of Meerut. Their attempts to tranquilize the leopard failed, said Mr. Sharma, because a cluster of reporters trying to take photographs of the animal made it irritable and it broke out of a door of the room where it was cornered and smashed through glass window and a concrete wall at the corner of a passageway at the hospital. As it fled, the leopard bit Gajendra Pal Singh, a police official who was positioned outside cordoning off the hospital complex. Mr. Singh told The Wall Street Journal that he had suffered a wound on the left shoulder, which required seven stitches. “But I am absolutely fine now and set to hunt the leopard down,” Mr. Singh said. While the search for the animal continues, the district magistrate of Meerut declared Monday a holiday for schools in the city. He could not be immediately reached for comment. Killada Satyanarayan, a senior police officer in the city, said that about seven search teams of at least four officers each, were trying to trace the animal. He said that it was “very strange and bizarre for the animal to appear out of nowhere” on the streets of the city. While it might be unusual in this city, which was the site of the first war of independence in 1857, it is more common in other parts of the country, especially in Mumbai where the forest meets the megacity. In two incidents in January last year, a 9-year-old boy was killed by a leopard in Mumbai, and an elderly man died in a similar attack in Guwahati, in the east of the country.

The city is on high alert after the animal, who was trapped inside a room of the cantonment hospital, escaped during a rescue operation by wildlife experts around midnight. The leopard was first spotted at a timber shop in Sadar area on Sunday afternoon, from where it entered the nearby cantonment hospital and was locked inside a room. A team of wildlife experts was summoned from Afzalgarh to capture the animal, who escaped after breaking a window in the room. The leopard was then spotted at a commercial complex in the posh Abulane market on Monday morning. The CCTV footage showed that the animal entered the complex around 3am. A team of the Wildlife Trust of India reached the market along with forest officials, but failed to locate the animal. Forest officials and additional staff from five districts have been called for assistance, said divisional forest officer Sudhanshu Sharma. Senior superintendent of police Onkar Singh said, \\"We have been urging the public not to go near the animal, but some of them went close out of curiosity and the animal attacked them\\" Seven people sustained minor injuries, including Sadar police station house officer Gajendra Pal, who had to get seven stitches on the shoulder. Schools and colleges in the city were closed while the examinations scheduled for Monday were postponed. Most shops in and around Sadar area were also shut. \\"It is a robust animal who broke the window to escape from the hospital room,\\" said chief conservator of forests (west zone) SK Rastogi. \\"We are expecting the leopard to venture out at night and are prepared to trap him.\\" Leopard breaks the cemented window of the ward and escapes.

I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived.

Context: Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend blog will know that I suffer from an extremely sensitive scalp which can be really itchy, and I have to be very careful what shampoo I use. I know that I’m sensitive to shampoos containing sodium laureth sulfate (also known as SLS, it’s the ingredient that makes shampoos, shower gels and soaps lather) but I’m also sensitive to some other ingredients in shampoos too – mainly fragrances. I had previously been using Rainforest Balance Shampoo and Conditioner from The Body Shop®, but I found the conditioner a bit too rich and my hair didn’t always feel totally clean after using it. So I started doing a bit of research into recommended natural shampoos – and this Sensitive Shampoo from Lavera kept coming up again and again! Several of the reviews I read said that this was the best shampoo for sensitive scalps and that it left hair feeling really clean and soft, so I decided to try it. The shampoo is a translucent peach-coloured gel that contains organic witch hazel and organic almond milk. It has quite a strong scent, but it’s a nice one so it doesn’t put me off. The shampoo feels creamy when you rub it together in your hands, but I did need quite a lot of it to get a good lather on my first application – the second application lathers a lot more easily. I definitely agree that this makes hair feel a lot cleaner than a lot of the other SLS-free shampoos that I’ve tried, my hair feels clean and full and soft when I’ve used it – the same way it would do if I were using a regular shampoo. I think it also helps my hair to dry more quickly and makes it easier to straighten too. But where this shampoo is outstanding is the way it makes my scalp feel – my scalp feels soothed and calm and there’s no hint of itching. I’ve been using Lavera Sensitive Shampoo for over a year now and I wouldn’t change it for the world, it’s definitely one of the best shampoos for a sensitive itchy scalp.

Additionally, this day is dedicated to celebrating the positive achievements and contributions of men across the globe, especially in the fields of community, family, marriage, and childcare. The concept of International Men's Day was first introduced in 1992 by Professor Thomas Oaster, although the event gained wider recognition and acceptance in the early 2000s. Since then, every year, more and more countries have started to observe this day, organizing various events, discussions, and campaigns promoting gender equality and men's rights. Some key goals of International Men's Day include addressing stigmas surrounding masculinity, fostering gender equality, encouraging men to take care of their physical and mental health, and promoting open dialogue about the challenges that men face. International Men's Day complements International Women's Day, which takes place on March 8th every year. Both days promote mutual understanding, respect, and cooperation between the genders.

Eight months later he meets a Norwegian fisherman, Captain Alstad, in a sailors' bar, where a scuffle breaks out between British and Norwegian sailors (singing \\"Rule Britannia\\", egged on by Metcalfe) and German ones (singing the Nazi Party anthem the \\"Horst-Wessel-Lied\\"). Alstad takes him aboard his boat during a sea voyage in Norway's territorial waters, during which they sight the Altmark and are fired upon by a German U-boat, despite Norway's neutrality. They then come back to his home port of Langedal, and Metcalfe goes to Oslo to report this to the British embassy there, despite the best efforts of the German Kommandant and the German-sympathising local police chief Ottoman Gunter. There Metcalfe meets Frank Lockwood en route back to England from the Winter War in Finland. It was Lockwood who had got him the foreign correspondent job at the outbreak of war, but he now passes on the news to Metcalfe that he has been fired from it for sailing out with the fisherman rather than staying on dry land where the paper can contact him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this fact: \\"a plant requires soil for to grow\\" Now answer this question: \\"What requires soil to grow?\\"","completion":"A plant requires soil to grow. This is because soil serves as a crucial medium that provides necessary nutrients, minerals, water, and anchorage for the proper growth and development of a plant. Various components within the soil work together to create a conducive environment for the plant's well-being. 1. Nutrients and Minerals: Soil contains essential nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are vital for plant growth. These nutrients are absorbed by the plant's roots and used to build new cells and synthesize important molecules. Soil also contains minerals like calcium, magnesium, and sulfur that contribute to the plant's overall health. 2. Organic Matter: The presence of organic matter, such as decaying plant and animal materials, contributes to the fertility of the soil. This organic matter decomposes over time, releasing vital nutrients that are absorbed by the plant, further promoting growth. 3. Water: Soil acts as a reservoir for water, which is essential for plants. The plant's roots absorb water from the soil that is then transported to the rest of the plant for various processes such as photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and transpiration. The soil's ability to hold water is critical for plants, especially during periods of drought. 4. Soil Structure: The soil's structure, including the size and arrangement of its particles, plays a significant role in plant growth. A well-structured soil provides enough space for roots to grow and access nutrients and water, while also allowing for proper drainage and aeration, which helps prevent waterlogging and root rot. 5. Soil Microorganisms: A diverse community of microorganisms inhabit the soil, including bacteria, fungi, and other microscopic creatures. These microorganisms help break down organic matter, releasing nutrients for the plant to absorb. They also contribute to the formation of soil structure and play a role in controlling plant diseases and pests. 6. Anchorage: Soil provides a stable structure for a plant's root system, anchoring the plant firmly in the ground. This enables the plant to withstand various environmental conditions, such as strong winds and rainfall, without toppling over or being uprooted. In summary, plants require soil to grow because it provides essential nutrients, water supply, stable structure, organic matter, and a rich microbiome that all contribute to the plant's optimal growth and development. Different plants have adapted to growing in specific types of soil, depending on their native habitat and required conditions for survival. Therefore, understanding the soil's composition and characteristics is crucial for successful plant cultivation and gardening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

One group is called hunter-gatherers, and the other is called agriculturalists. Hunter-gatherers are people who find food by hunting animals and picking fruits, nuts, and berries. Agriculturalists, on the other hand, grow their own food by planting seeds and taking care of them. But, you know what? It's not always easy to tell the difference between these two groups. This is because, over time, people have been sharing ideas and ways of life. So, the answer is that it is not easy to draw a clear line between hunter-gatherer and agricultural societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which entity is this text about? Richard was born on 2 October 1452 at Fotheringhay Castle, the twelfth of thirteen children of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York and Cecily Neville at the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the \\"Wars of the Roses\\", a period of \\"three or four decades of political instability and periodic open civil war in the second half of the fifteenth century\\", between supporters of Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of King Henry VI from birth)--\\"Yorkists\\"--in opposition to the regime of Henry VI and his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and those loyal to the crown (\\"Lancastrians\\"). When his father and the Nevilles were forced to flee to Ludlow in 1459, Richard and his older brother, George (later Duke of Clarence), were placed in the custody of the Duchess of Buckingham, and the Archbishop of Canterbury. When his father and elder brother Edmund, Earl of Rutland, were killed at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December 1460, Richard, who was eight years old, and George were sent by his mother, the Duchess of York, to the Low Countries. They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the Battle of Towton and participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as King Edward IV in June 1461. Apart from Shakespeare, Richard appears in many other works of literature. Two other plays of the Elizabethan era predated Shakespeare's work. The Latin-language drama Richardus Tertius (first known performance in 1580) by Thomas Legge is believed to be the first history play written in England. The anonymous play The True Tragedy of Richard III (c. 1590), performed in the same decade as Shakespeare's work, was probably an influence on Shakespeare. Neither of the two plays places any emphasis on Richard's physical appearance, though the True Tragedy briefly mentions that he is \\"A man ill shaped, crooked backed, lame armed\\" adding that he is \\"valiantly minded, but tyrannous in authority\\". Both portray him as a man motivated by personal ambition, who uses everyone around him to get his way. Ben Jonson is also known to have written a play Richard Crookback in 1602, but it was never published and nothing is known about its portrayal of the king. Marjorie Bowen's 1929 novel Dickon set the trend for pro-Ricardian literature. Particularly influential was The Daughter of Time (1951) by Josephine Tey, in which a modern detective concludes that Richard III is innocent in the death of the Princes. Other novelists such as Valerie Anand in the novel Crown of Roses (1989) have also offered alternative versions to the theory that he murdered them. Sharon Kay Penman, in her historical novel The Sunne in Splendour, attributes the death of the Princes to the Duke of Buckingham. In the mystery novel The Murders of Richard III by Elizabeth Peters (1974) the central plot revolves around the debate as to whether Richard III was guilty of these and other crimes. A sympathetic portrayal of Richard III is given in The Founding, the first volume in The Morland Dynasty series by Cynthia Harrod-Eagles. One film adaptation of Shakespeare's play Richard III is the 1955 version directed and produced by Laurence Olivier, who also played the lead role. Also notable are the 1995 film version starring Ian McKellen, set in a fictional 1930s fascist England, and Looking for Richard, a 1996 documentary film directed by Al Pacino, who plays the title character as well as himself. The play has been adapted for television on several occasions. Entity:","completion":"Richard III"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1964, the first commoner featured on a British postage stamp was?","completion":"In 1964, the first commoner to be featured on a British postage stamp was William Shakespeare, the famous playwright and poet. This was a significant event in British philately history, as prior to this, only members of the British Royal Family or depictions of the monarchy were featured on national postage stamps. The decision to feature Shakespeare on a stamp recognized and celebrated his monumental contributions to English literature, drama, and the arts. Born in 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon, England, William Shakespeare is often referred to as the \\"Bard of Avon.\\" He wrote around 39 plays and 154 sonnets, and his works have had a longstanding impact on the world of literature, ranging from tragedies, comedies, and historical plays to poetry. 1964 was an appropriate year to celebrate the Bard, as it marked the 400th anniversary of his birth. As part of the celebration, the Royal Mail issued a set of six stamps on April 23rd, 1964, featuring images related to Shakespeare's plays. This set included scenes from his most famous works, such as Hamlet, Macbeth, Romeo and Juliet, Twelfth Night, Henry V, and A Midsummer Night's Dream. The scenes were created using photographs by Laurence Olivier, an iconic Shakespearean actor and director, and other well-known theater designers. These stamps not only represented a turning point in British postage stamp design, shifting from the traditional focus on the Royal Family to include important cultural icons, but they also signaled the start of a trend that continues to this day. Since 1964, many distinguished British figures from various fields, including literature, science, sports, and entertainment, have appeared on postage stamps. The inclusion of William Shakespeare in the 1964 stamp series demonstrated a growing emphasis on commemorating British history and achievements in various domains. It acknowledged the lasting impact and global influence of Shakespeare's works, which continue to captivate audience members and readers around the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Head Start programs are cutting back; the White House furloughed 480 people; but Congressional salaries will remain intact, because they’re not appropriated by Congress or included in presidential budgets. Lawmakers could pass a bill cutting their salaries—yes, commenters, I know about the 27th amendment, the cut wouldn’t go into effect until the next session—but they haven’t. Alternatively, individual members of Congress could sign over some portion of their wages to the Treasury. Guess who’s doing just that. President Obama announced today that he would give 5 percent of his salary to the Treasury. The president wants “to share in the sacrifice being made by public servants across the federal government that are affected by the sequester,” an administration official said. He probably got the idea from Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and his deputy, Ashton B. Carton, who said on Tuesday that they would return a share of their salaries in solidarity with the department’s civilian employees.","completion":"So, there was this thing called the sequester which means some people had to cut back on money they spend.

The prehistoric creature had a wingspan of between 6.1 and 7.4 metres and could glide for long distances over the oceans as it searched for fish 25m years ago, according to scientists writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Its wingspan was double that of the royal albatross, the largest flying bird alive, and challenges the wingspan of Argentavis magnificens, a prehistoric bird that lived six million years ago and had a wingspan between 5.5 and 7 metres. The bird, named Pelagornis sandersi, had short, stumpy legs and likely took to the air by hopping off cliff edges or making short runs into the wind to take off from the ground or sea. In flight it reached speeds of up to 60 km/h. Skeletal reconstruction of P sandersi with a California condor (lower left) and royal albatross (lower right) for scale. Illustration: Liz Bradford/PNAS \\"This was a remarkable fossil, almost like something out of Game of Thrones,\\" said Daniel Ksepka at North Carolina State University. Its mouth was filled with bony spikes that gave it the menacing look of a dragon, he added. The remains of the bird, including its skull, shoulder blade, and hollow leg and wing bones, were dug from rock near Charleston airport in 1983, but the full significance of the fossils had not been realised before. Though no feathers survived, Ksepka extrapolated the mass, wingspan and wing shape from the fossilised bones and fed them into a computer to estimate how the bird might fly. A conservative estimate put the wingspan of P. sandersi at around 6.4 metres. The computer model showed that like the modern albatross, the prehistoric bird was an extremely efficient glider and barely needed to flap to cover ground. \\"It could probably travel for extreme distances using a very, very small amount of energy,\\" said Ksepka. If the bird was caught on low ground in bad wind conditions, it may have become fatally stuck. The Charleston specimen likely died at sea, as the excavation site was a prehistoric seabed. Remains of archaic rays, skates, and even a toothed whale have been unearthed at the site in the past. There are no obvious breaks in the bird's bones that point to a particularly violent death, Ksepka said. Robert Nudds at Manchester University said the bird's dimensions were \\"guesstimates instead of estimates\\", but said the bird would have had a similar flying style to the albatross. \\"It would flap its wings rarely and use wind profiles above the waves to carry it,\\" he said. Ksepka said the remains of larger flying birds may yet be found. \\"I wouldn't be surprised if something a little bit larger was found some time down the line. I don't think we'll be pushing 10-metre wingspans, but a little bit bigger,\\" he said. ||||| Reconstruction by Liz Bradford If we had lived 3 million years ago, our holiday beach visits would not have been so pleasant. North American ocean fronts were home to Pelagornis sandersi, the largest known marine bird. It had a wingspan of up to 24 feet. For comparison, imagine the length of four humans head-to-toe, or the height of a two-story building. If its size isn’t terrifying enough, the bird also had pseudoteeth—all the better to impale its prey with. The first P. sandersi fossil was found in 1983, when crews in South Carolina began construction to expand the Charleston International Airport. Charleston Museum volunteer James Malcom and museum curator Albert Sander removed a stone block containing the fossil and brought it to the museum for further inspection. (The sandersi in the species name is a homage to Sanders.) Nearly 30 years later, paleontologist Daniel Ksepka rediscovered it when he was invited to study the Charleston Museum’s fossils. “I was pretty confident it was a new species right away,” says Ksepka. “The size jumps out at you. I found a single wing bone longer than my arm, so I thought, this must be important.” Ksepka’s results are published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Advertisement The newly described monster bird is part of a family of giant seabirds called Pelagornithids, named for teeth found on the edges of their bills. Unlike human teeth, which have roots and are covered with enamel, pelagornithids’ teeth were made of bone and were likely covered with beak tissue. Scientists believe these birds’ beaks resembled those of modern birds, only with bony, saw-like edges. “They were very sharp, but not made for slicing,” Ksepka says. “They could use them to catch fish or squids near the surface and impale them.” The pelagornithid family was known for its ubiquity; species within the family have been discovered on every continent. According to Ksepka, it’s fairly rare for bird families to inhabit so many different climates. “Not that many birds make it to Antarctica,” he says. Based on the structure of its bones, scientists are fairly certain that P. sandersi did fly. This raises one big mystery: How did something so large stay in the air? Bigger animals require more power to keep their bodies in flight. “It’s a scaling problem,” says Ksepka: Theoretically, extremely large birds cannot fly, because the amount of power they need to fly surpasses the power of their muscles. Some researchers calculate that this upper limit is around 17 feet, so by these estimates, a flying Pelagornis sandersi should be impossible. However, these calculations are based on the energy required for birds to stay in flight by flapping their wings; in new calculations, Ksepka proposes that large flying birds could have used other strategies. “They could harvest energy from the environment, like taking advantage of wind gusts,” he says. Like modern-day albatrosses, Pelagornis sandersi could have used their long wings to catch ocean winds and glide across the sky, rather than powering their flight with energy-intensive flapping. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Scientists found a fossil of a huge flying bird that lived 25 million years ago.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who finished the decade on a critical high note? ? In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years.

Plot title: Three Little Bops Movie plot: The short opens with a display of the book that shows the Three Little Pigs who used to play pipes and dance jigs. The short then focuses to the present day and reveals the pigs now play modern instruments and perform as The Three Little Bops. During a gig at the House of Straw, the Big Bad Wolf appears and proves he is friendly by stating that he wants to join the band. The Wolf happens to be terrible at playing his choice instrument (a trumpet) so the pigs throw him out. Feeling insulted, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down the straw house, forcing the pigs to go to the Dew Drop Inn, the House of Sticks. Things go well (including the piano playing pig doing an imitation of Liberace's \\"I wish my brother George was here\\"), until the Wolf comes in and attempts to play his trumpet again. Like the pigs, the people watching also think the wolf's playing is corny, so they call for the pigs to \\"throw the square out\\", which they do. Again, the Wolf retaliates by blowing down, or \\"dropping out,\\" the Dew Drop Inn. The pigs then realize that in order to escape the Wolf's \\"windy tricks,\\" they will go to the House of Bricks (built in May 1st 1776, according to a cornerstone). Coincidentally, another relevant event related to that date is the foundation of the Illuminati Society. For the pigs, the House of Bricks has a \\"No Wolves Allowed\\" rule, so when the Wolf tries to get in, he is punched in the face by a bouncer. Then he tried to ram the door down with a log but with no success. The Wolf runs out of breath in trying to blow away the club, but thinks he can get in by disguising himself. He reenters in fur coat and ukulele with his perfect rendition of the Charleston song (cut short by slipping on a strategically thrown banana peel). He returns in the disguise of a houseplant with his trumpet but gets blasted outside by a plunger shot from the double bass.

Answer the following question: Information: - David Harbater (born December 19, 1952) is an American mathematician at the University of Pennsylvania, well known for his work in Galois theory, algebraic geometry and arithmetic geometry. - \\"Not to be confused with his wife Michèle Raynaud, who is also a French mathematician working in algebraic geometry.\\" - The term proposition has a broad use in contemporary philosophy. It is used to refer to some or all of the following: the primary bearers of truth-value, the objects of belief and other \\"propositional attitudes\\" (i.e., what is believed, doubted, etc.), the referents of that-clauses, and the meanings of declarative sentences. Propositions are the sharable objects of attitudes and the primary bearers of truth and falsity. This stipulation rules out certain candidates for propositions, including thought- and utterance-tokens which are not sharable, and concrete events or facts, which cannot be false. - In abstract algebra , Abhyankar 's conjecture is a 1957 conjecture of Shreeram Abhyankar , on the Galois groups of algebraic function fields of characteristic p. The soluble case was solved by Serre in 1990 and the full conjecture was proved in 1994 by work of Michel Raynaud and David Harbater . The problem involves a finite group G , a prime number p , and the function field of nonsingular integral algebraic curve C defined over an algebraically closed field K of characteristic p. The question addresses the existence of Galois extensions L of K ( C ) , with G as Galois group , and with restricted ramification . From a geometric point of view L corresponds to another curve C , and a morphism : C C. Ramification geometrically , and by analogy with the case of Riemann surfaces , consists of a finite set S of points x on C , such that restricted to the complement of S in C is an étale morphism . In Abhyankar 's conjecture , S is fixed , and the question is what G can be . This is therefore a special type of inverse Galois problem . The subgroup p ( G ) is defined to be the subgroup generated by all the Sylow subgroups of G for the prime number p. This is a normal subgroup , and the parameter n is defined as the minimum number of generators of G / p ( G ) . Then for the case of C the projective line over K , the conjecture states that G can be realised as a Galois group of L , unramified outside S containing s + 1 points , if and only if n s. This was proved by Raynaud . For the general case , proved by Harbater , let g be the genus of C. Then G can be realised if and only if n s + 2 g. - Algebra (from Arabic \\"\\"al-jabr\\"\\" meaning \\"reunion of broken parts\\") is one of the broad parts of mathematics, together with number theory, geometry and analysis. In its most general form, algebra is the study of mathematical symbols and the rules for manipulating these symbols; it is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics. As such, it includes everything from elementary equation solving to the study of abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. The more basic parts of algebra are called elementary algebra, the more abstract parts are called abstract algebra or modern algebra. Elementary algebra is generally considered to be essential for any study of mathematics, science, or engineering, as well as such applications as medicine and economics. Abstract algebra is a major area in advanced mathematics, studied primarily by professional mathematicians. - In mathematics, and more specifically in abstract algebra, an algebraic structure is a set (called carrier set or underlying set) with one or more finitary operations defined on it that satisfies a list of axioms. - In mathematics, a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables (or indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponents. An example of a polynomial of a single indeterminate is . An example in three variables is . - In number theory, Fermat's Last Theorem (sometimes called Fermat's conjecture, especially in older texts) states that no three positive integers , , and satisfy the equation for any integer value of greater than 2. The cases and have been known to have infinitely many solutions since antiquity. - In abstract algebra, field extensions are the main object of study in field theory. The general idea is to start with a base field and construct in some manner a larger field that contains the base field and satisfies additional properties. For instance, the set Q(2) = {\\"a\\" + \\"b\\"2 | \\"a\\", \\"b\\" Q} is the smallest extension of Q that includes every real solution to the equation \\"x\\" = 2. - In mathematics, more specifically in the area of modern algebra known as Galois theory, the Galois group of a certain type of field extension is a specific group associated with the field extension. The study of field extensions and their relationship to the polynomials that give rise to them via Galois groups is called Galois theory, so named in honor of Évariste Galois who first discovered them. - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, Galois theory, named after Évariste Galois, provides a connection between field theory and group theory. Using Galois theory, certain problems in field theory can be reduced to group theory, which is, in some sense, simpler and better understood. - The University of Pennsylvania (commonly known as Penn or UPenn) is a private, Ivy League university located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States. Incorporated as \\"The Trustees of the University of Pennsylvania\\", Penn is one of 14 founding members of the Association of American Universities and one of the nine original colonial colleges. - Évariste Galois (25 October 1811 31 May 1832) was a French mathematician born in Bourg-la-Reine. While still in his teens, he was able to determine a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial to be solvable by radicals, thereby solving a problem standing for 350 years. His work laid the foundations for Galois theory and group theory, two major branches of abstract algebra, and the subfield of Galois connections. He died at age 20 from wounds suffered in a duel. - Mathematics (from Greek \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change. There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories. Even though the words \\"hypothesis\\" and \\"theory\\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory. A working hypothesis is a provisionally accepted hypothesis proposed for further research. - In algebra, which is a broad division of mathematics, abstract algebra (occasionally called modern algebra) is the study of algebraic structures. Algebraic structures include groups, rings, fields, modules, vector spaces, lattices, and algebras. The term \\"abstract algebra\\" was coined in the early 20th century to distinguish this area of study from the other parts of algebra. - In mathematics, a conjecture is a conclusion or proposition based on incomplete information, for which no proof has been found. Conjectures such as the Riemann hypothesis (still a conjecture) or Fermat's Last Theorem (which was a conjecture until proven in 1995) have shaped much of mathematical history as new areas of mathematics are developed in order to prove them. - Algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics, classically studying zeros of multivariate polynomials. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from commutative algebra, for solving geometrical problems about these sets of zeros. - In mathematics, the Riemann hypothesis is a conjecture that the Riemann zeta function has its zeros only at the negative even integers and complex numbers with real part . It was proposed by , after whom it is named. The name is also used for some closely related analogues, such as the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields.

Summarize: If you live in a temperate or warm climate, nearly all plant nurseries in your area should sell jacaranda seedlings. If you need help locating a jacaranda plant, or if a nursery has different options to choose from, ask the sales staff for assistance. If there isn’t a plant nursery in your area, you can also visit the Garden section of large retail stores. Retailers like WalMart and Home Depot will stock a large variety of plants, and will likely carry jacaranda seedlings. If you don’t live near a nursery or garden center, there may not be a way for you to purchase a jacaranda seedling in person. In this case, you can find and order a jacaranda online. Check major online plant retailers, such as Annie’s Annuals, Fast Growing Trees, or Nursery Live. Certain retailers will provide a seedling—with others, you may need to order a packet of seeds. Although jacarandas commonly grow in temperate or humid climates, they can survive in cooler areas as well—even regions that receive light frosts. Jacaranda trees grow best in zone 10 in the hardiness scale, which includes warmer climates. If you know a friend or relative with a jacaranda tree, ask if you can take a cutting of their plant. A cutting is segment taken from a branch; the cutting itself should be at least 15 centimeters (6 inches) long, but can be as long as you would like. Place the jacaranda cutting in water until small roots begin to emerge. Then, plant the cutting in a small pot filled with rich soil, water regularly, and let the tree grow. Jacaranda seedlings also tend to spring up around the base of mature jacaranda trees. If you can safely and legally dig up one of these seedlings, you can transplant it into a planter and so begin growing your own tree.","completion":"To acquire a jacaranda plant, individuals living in temperate or warm climates can visit local plant nurseries, or large retail stores with garden sections like WalMart and Home Depot.

Please answer the following question: Two neighboring countries with similar economies, followed different political and economical agendas. Niger developed its infrastructure and communications technology, while Nigeria didn't. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country will be less developed as a consequence of their agendas? Hint: Distance decay is a geographical term which describes the effect of distance on cultural or spatial interactions. The distance decay effect states that the interaction between two locales declines as the distance between them increases. Once the distance is outside of the two locales' activity space, their interactions begin to decrease. With the advent of faster travel, distance has less effect than it did in the past, except where places previously connected by now-abandoned railways, for example, have fallen off the beaten path. Advances in communications technology, such as telegraphs, telephones, broadcasting, and internet, have further decreased the effects of distance.[1] A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Nigeria will be less developed as a consequence of their agendas compared to Niger. Niger focused on developing its infrastructure and communications technology, which would enable a more connected and accessible society. This would in turn lead to increased economic growth, better education and healthcare systems, and overall higher standards of living. On the other hand, Nigeria did not follow a similar path in terms of political and economic agendas. As a result, they would experience the distance decay effect, which describes the decline of interaction between two locales as the distance between them increases. In this context, it means that Nigeria's lack of infrastructure development and communication advancements will negatively impact the country's development, making it less developed compared to Niger. The hint about distance decay emphasizes that interactions between two places tend to decrease as the distance between them increases. However, with advancements in transportation and communication technologies, this distance decay can be mitigated. Niger's development in infrastructure and communications will lessen the impact of distance decay, while Nigeria's lack of similar development will lead to a stronger distance decay effect and less development overall."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Almost 80% of the Americans have stated their opposition to cloning pet animals such as cats and dogs, yet companies still try to make a business out of selling cloned pets. Pet cloning has been promoted as a way to \\"bring back\\" or \\"copy\\" a beloved companion animal. However, studies have shown that cloning remains an experimental technology with many failures. Behind each lovely picture of a cloned cat or dog lie hundreds of animals that were kept in lab cages, receiving bad treatment to produce just that one cloned animal. For all that, you end up with a cloned animal who is unlikely to appear like the original physically or behaviorally and may experience serious health problems. Also, while pet cloning companies are charging customers up to 150,000 for a cloned pet, millions of homeless animals of the same species are available in US animal shelters for around 100. Unfortunately, most of these animals are killed for lack of adopting homes. With No Pet Cloning campaign, the American Anti-Vivisection Society (AAVS) tries to protect both animals and people from harm. They campaigned until the US companies that sold cloned animals closed their doors. First it was Genetic Savings & Clone Inc. and then it was BioArts International. When BioArts was closed, its owner, Lou Hawthorne, finally had to _ the problems of pet cloning. According to Hawthorne, he has seen numerous failures during his pet cloning attempts, \\"One clone----which was supposed to be black and white----was born greenish-yellow where it should have been white (we still have no good explanation for how that happened).\\" The AAVS is educating the public about the animal suffering and is seeking regulation of cloning activities.

Cultures and attitudes often clash in the classroom, a microcosm of contemporary France. As amusing and inspiring as the teenaged students can be, their difficult behavior can still jeopardize any teacher's enthusiasm for the low-paying job.

But his classroom ethics are put to the test when his students begin to challenge his methods... -JowsieWinner of the Palme d'Or at the 2008 Cannes Film Festival, master French director Laurent Cantet's THE CLASS is an absorbing journey into a multicultural high school in Paris over the course of a school year. François Begaudeau--an actual teacher and the author upon whose work the film was based--is utterly convincing as François, an openminded teacher in charge of a classroom of youngsters from a wide variety of backgrounds. Of course, the mere fact that he's older and in a position of authority causes his students to challenge him on many occasions. François is stuck in the middle. In the teacher conferences, he butts heads with the harsher adults who don't appear to have any sympathy for their students. In class, his attempts to be lenient and understanding are somehow misinterpreted and he finds himself arguing with the kids that he so clearly wants to help. As the school year progresses, tensions rise, until François finds himself in a position he never imagined he'd be in.

WHEN THE MOB LOST ITS MIND: Sinatra Club Psychos killed for no reason Johnny Dio did me a couple of favors in Lewisburg (federal penitentiary) when he got me out of the prison factory and onto the yard detail. Three years after I got out, Dio called in those favors. I don’t know if it was because I said something he didn’t like or I didn’t pay him respect or maybe he could sense that I thought he was a vicious prick. Whatever the reason, he gave me the kind of assignment you’d give your worse enemy. It made me wish I never heard of Johnny Dio. He was inside the joint, but he still had power and influence in both the Lucchese and Gambino Families. The son of a capo in Florida was sleeping with the wife of another made guy. If the kid had been made himself, he would have been whacked for messing with the man’s wife. The old dons back in Sicily knew that’s how family feuds began. The Sicilians figured kill the guy right away and you’ll save yourself a lot of carnage. The Family involved — I don’t know if the capo’s kid and the guy whose wife he was f------ were in the same Family or not; I was never told and I knew better than to ask — they consulted Dio in prison and asked him what to do. He suggested they use the old Murder Incorporated punishment. Instead of killing the f-----, they should cut his balls off. Dio said he knew just the man for the job; an ex-con who owed him — me. I’ll spare you and and me the details, but I did it. And after I did I wished I’d gotten the hell out of the Life before I did. Things sicker even than that were going down that year. There was an orgy of off-the-books killings like the Mob had never seen before. Traditionally all Mob hits had to be approved by a boss, and approval was granted only if there was good reason to perform the murder. Killings to settle personal scores or those motivated purely by greed were forbidden. By the late 1970s, those rules were forgotten or ignored. Guys started doing unsanctioned hits over drugs and money left and right. My own boss and friend Dominic Cataldo was one of the worst offenders. He’d been whacking drug business partners without permission for years. The richer he got, the more paranoid and bloodthirsty he got. Dom used to do hits on guys right in the back of his restaurant, the Villagio Italia (Ozone Park), then he put them in the trunk of his car and drove them up to Boot Hill.

News article: Pension freedoms: withdrawal figures ease fears of 'Lamborghini' pensioners wasting savings It still means a worrying proportion of withdrawals – 43pc – were potentially for sums above 4pc. Some 4.2pc were for sums greater than 10pc. It cannot be said with certainty, however, that these retirees have withdrawn unsustainable sums because individuals may have multiple pots, from different employers, for example, or income from defined benefit pension or other investments. The pension freedoms give those with defined contribution savings greater flexibility over how they spend their pot. Money can be taken out in lump sums, with 25pc of each withdrawal tax-free, leaving the remainder invested inside the scheme, or 25pc of the whole fund can be taken tax free and then further withdrawals can be made through “drawdown”. In this case recipients pay income tax at whatever rate the income takes them to. The ABI reported that, in the first year after the reforms were enacted, £4.3bn had been withdrawn in 300,000 lump-sum payments, with an average withdrawal of £14,500, while £3.9bn has been taken out via 1.03 million drawdown payments, with an average payment of £3,800. The changes in the rules free retirees from the obligation to buy an annuity – where rates of return are at record lows – in order to generate a retirement income. Sceptics had predicted that savers would withdraw unsustainable sums or blow their money on frivolities. Before the introduction of the freedoms, the then pensions minister, Steve Webb, said he was relaxed about how pensioners spent their savings – even if they used them to buy a Lamborghini sports car.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that played at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building? from the following article ? Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

The first piece of data is the accession number \\"XP_852505.1,\\" which is an identifier provided by a nucleotide or protein sequence database. The second piece of information is the dog's common name. In this analysis, I will provide a detailed explanation of both components, as well as any relevant background information. Canis familiaris, the domestic dog, is a highly diverse mammalian species that has been bred and selected over thousands of years for a wide range of physical and behavioral traits, leading to a great variety of breeds and types of dogs. Supported by genomic research, the domestic dog is morphologically, physiologically, and genetically distinguishable from the gray wolf (Canis lupus). The domestication and selective breeding process have created a complex, rich history of relationships between humans and dogs through companionship, work, and support roles. The accession number \\"XP_852505.1\\" is a unique identifier assigned to a specific molecular sequence in a sequence database. These databases store and organize a vast amount of genetic, genomic, and protein sequence information generated through scientific research. In this case, the accession number corresponds to a protein sequence related to the domestic dog (Canis familiaris). The \\"XP\\" prefix in the accession number signifies that the protein sequence is derived from a computationally predicted gene model rather than a directly sequenced protein. These predicted sequences are usually based on evidence from related species and other bioinformatics methods to infer the gene structure. The number following the prefix, \\"852505.1,\\" identifies the specific protein sequence in the database. The \\".1\\" at the end indicates the current revision version. Over time, as more data becomes available and prediction models improve, the sequence may be updated, leading to an incremented version number, such as \\".2,\\" \\".3,\\" etc. Accession numbers play a crucial role in scientific research by enabling scientists to unambiguously refer to and access specific sequences in databases. Through these databases, users can easily find, analyze, and compare sequences for their research projects. Databases like the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and its Entrez System or the European Molecular Biology Laboratory-European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) host numerous accession numbers for a broad range of species, including Canis familiaris. Together, the two main pieces of information given, the accession number and the common name, form a comprehensive package of knowledge that allows researchers to efficiently locate and study the molecular aspects of the domestic dog. By utilizing this information, scientists can better understand the genetics and evolution of this fascinating species, enabling discoveries on topics like dog behavior, physiology, and the impact of domestication on modern dogs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sadly, because of my work over the last twelve months, I had only been able to attend a few of his games; however, I was determined to get to his last game for the school term. Tom's team came out in the first 10 minutes with a burst of goals that saw them leading by just over 20 points at the end of the first half. The second half changed as the other team quickly played themselves back into the game. Tom's team started to miss an increasing number of shots. It was at that point that the coach called his first time out. The noise of the spectators became quiet as the coach spoke to them. He had the team standing in a half circle, but he squatted down, looking up at them and fiving some very calm and clear instructions on what they needed to do in the last couple of minutes. As he stood up to allow the team to return to the court, I saw him give some further words of encouragement to all of them. You could see that he knew that the team was fighting to save the game and that he needed to lift them up. By squatting down he placed himself in a position where he was talking up to them, rather than down or at them, and as the players went back onto the court his words of encouragement served to lift their energy and spirits. Well, Tom's team went on to win the final by 5 points. As I drove away I thought about what can happen to us all in our everyday life.

Here is the breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"The best\\" - \\"Los mejores\\": In this case, we use \\"los mejores\\" because \\"abogados\\" (lawyers) is a masculine plural noun. If it were feminine, we would use \\"las mejores\\". 2. \\"Mount Vernon Washington\\" - \\"Mount Vernon, Washington\\": Proper nouns, like the names of cities or states, don't change in translation, so \\"Mount Vernon Washington\\" remains unchanged in the Spanish phrase. However, we maintain the comma \\",\\" to separate the city's name from the state's name, just like in English. 3. \\"Traffic ticket\\" - \\"infracciones de tráfico\\": In Spanish, we don't have a direct translation for \\"traffic ticket\\" as a singular term. Instead, we use \\"infracciones de tráfico\\" which translates to \\"traffic infractions\\" in English. It conveys the same idea as \\"traffic tickets\\" and is widely used and understood in Spanish-speaking contexts. 4. \\"Lawyers\\" - \\"abogados\\": The direct translation for \\"lawyers\\" is \\"abogados\\" in Spanish. As mentioned previously, this is a masculine plural noun, which is why we used \\"los mejores\\" at the beginning of the phrase.

Here are answers to key questions about the new phase in the conflict with ISIS: Which areas were hit? The bombing has focused on the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa, a city in northern Syria. ISIS has had control of Raqqa for more than a year, imposing its brutal interpretation of Islamic law on the city's residents.

The two boys found themselves drawn further out to sea, captivated by the mystery and beauty of the underwater world, eager to examine the barnacles clinging to the nearby rocks. Little did Isaac and his family know that this would be the last adventure they'd share together, as an unanticipated incident unfolded before them. The two young siblings, siblings who shared everything from laughter to love for the ocean, ventured out together as they often did. On this fateful day, the seemingly calm waters gave way to a life-altering moment. As they began to get into difficulties off the coast, their father, Adam Nash, quickly came to their rescue. With great courage and determination, he successfully saved Xander from the clutches of the fierce currents. However, tragically, Isaac was swept away before his father could reach him. Adding to the heartbreak, Isaac's grandfather was by his side, desperately trying to hold on to his precious grandson. As they clung to rocks for dear life, a huge wave struck with tremendous force, tearing Isaac from his grandfather's grip and carrying him away.

The strength and grace with which Isaac's family faced this crushing adversity is an inspiring lesson in resilience and courage.

Nathan had been friends with Jessica for a while and planned to ask her out, but as approaching her she gets into Kenneth's car. In distress, he returns home, drinks alcohol and prepares to hang himself. At the last minute he hesitates and pulls at the noose, only for his mother to walk into his room, knock him off the chair and turn his music down. Turning around, she notices him hanging there, dead. She then uses the voodoo \\"reanimation\\" book to bring Nathan back to life.The Priest warns the mother that a book has gone missing from the church, and that if used it can create flesh eating people. On awakening, Nathan seems fine, and seems to be hungry but human. He goes to school, unbeknown to his mother bringing him back to life, or his suicide attempt. Nathan overhears a conversation between Samson, Shane and Kenneth about Jessica, and what a whore she is. Nathan then calls Jessica a slut and says \\"you're just like all the other girls\\".

Sentence 1: For nearly 1,000 years the Church of Haghia Sophia was the greatest church in Christendom, an architectural wonder built by the Byzantine Empire to impress the world. Sentence 2: The Church of Hagia Sophia was always a relatively minor and unimportant Christian church. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true, as they contradict each other. Let's analyze each sentence in detail to understand why this is the case. Sentence 1: \\"For nearly 1,000 years the Church of Haghia Sophia was the greatest church in Christendom, an architectural wonder built by the Byzantine Empire to impress the world.\\" This sentence states that for almost a millennium, the Church of Hagia Sophia (also known as \\"Haghia Sophia\\") was considered the most significant church in the Christian world. It highlights the building's impressive architecture and suggests that it was constructed with the intent to amaze and captivate everyone's attention. The Byzantine Empire, which built the church, aimed to showcase its grandeur and importance. Some historical background supports the statement in the first sentence. The Hagia Sophia was constructed in 537 AD in the heart of the Byzantine capital, Constantinople (present-day Istanbul, Turkey). It was the largest church of its time and the epitome of Byzantine architectural innovation, featuring massive dome structures supported by pendentives. As the foremost church in the Byzantine Empire, the Hagia Sophia also played a crucial role in religious ceremonies and the empire's political affairs. Sentence 2: \\"The Church of Hagia Sophia was always a relatively minor and unimportant Christian church.\\" In contrast to Sentence 1, this sentence claims that the Hagia Sophia was never a significant or central figure in the Christian world. It is described as a \\"minor\\" and \\"unimportant\\" institution, which opposes the idea in Sentence 1 that it was the \\"greatest church in Christendom.\\" Given the historical evidence supporting the Church of Hagia Sophia's prominence during the Byzantine Empire, the second sentence cannot be true if the first sentence is accurate. Both statements are mutually exclusive, and if the Church of Hagia Sophia was indeed a marvel of architecture and the center of Christian faith for nearly 1,000 years, it cannot be considered an insignificant or minor place of worship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your summary should not be very short, but it's better if it's not more than 30 words. Problem:Automatic question generation from paragraphs is an important and challenging problem, particularly due to the long context from paragraphs. In this paper, we propose and study two hierarchical models for the task of question generation from paragraphs. Specifically, we propose (a) a novel hierarchical BiLSTM model with selective attention and (b) a novel hierarchical Transformer architecture, both of which learn hierarchical representations of paragraphs. We model a paragraph in terms of its constituent sentences, and a sentence in terms of its constituent words. While the introduction of the attention mechanism benefits the hierarchical BiLSTM model, the hierarchical Transformer, with its inherent attention and positional encoding mechanisms also performs better than flat transformer model. We conducted empirical evaluation on the widely used SQuAD and MS MARCO datasets using standard metrics. The results demonstrate the overall effectiveness of the hierarchical models over their flat counterparts. Qualitatively, our hierarchical models are able to generate fluent and relevant questions. Solution:","completion":"This study proposes two novel hierarchical models, a BiLSTM with selective attention and a Transformer architecture, for automatic question generation from paragraphs.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens as the shy, soft-spoken Joel Barish and the unrestrained free-spirit Clementine Kruczynski begin a relationship on a Long Island Rail Road train from Montauk, New York to Rockville Centre. They are almost immediately drawn to each other despite their different personalities, though both had felt the need to travel to Montauk that day. Although they do not realize it at the time, Joel and Clementine are, in fact, former lovers, now separated after having spent two years together. After a fight, Clementine had hired the New York City firm Lacuna, Inc. to erase all of her memories of their relationship. Upon discovering this from his friends Rob and Carrie, Joel was devastated and decided to undergo the procedure himself, a process that takes place while he sleeps. Much of the film subsequently takes place in Joel's mind during this memory erasure procedure. As his memories are erased, he tries to evade the erasing effects of the procedure by hiding Clementine in remote parts of his unconscious. Joel finds himself revisiting them in reverse. Upon seeing happier times of love with Clementine from earlier in their relationship, he struggles to preserve at least some memory of her and his love for her. Despite his efforts to either hide the memories or wake up and stop the process, the memories are slowly erased. He comes to the last remaining memory of Clementine, the day he first had met her at a beach house in Montauk. As this memory disintegrates around them, she tells him, \\"Meet me in Montauk.\\" Separate, but related, story arcs, which revolve around the employees of Lacuna, are revealed during Joel's memory erasure. Patrick, one of the Lacuna technicians performing the erasure, uses Joel's memories and mannerisms to seduce Clementine. Mary, the Lacuna receptionist, is dating the other memory-erasing technician, Stan. During Joel's memory wipe, Mary discovers she had previously had an affair with Dr. Howard Mierzwiak, the married doctor who heads the company, and had agreed to have this erased...

Why is homosexuality accepted but incest isn't? Why is incest taboo but homosexuality is not? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Both questions seek to understand why homosexuality is accepted while incest is not. Let's analyze each question for a deeper understanding: 1. Why is homosexuality accepted but incest isn't? This question is asking for reasons why society typically accepts homosexuality but considers incest unacceptable. 2. Why is incest taboo but homosexuality is not? This question is essentially asking the same thing but in reverse order, focusing on why incest is generally considered taboo in comparison to homosexuality. To answer the questions: Homosexuality and incest are treated differently by society for several reasons. While they both involve relationships between consenting individuals, the factors that differentiate them include: 1. Biological repercussions: Incestuous relationships, especially between close relatives, can result in offspring with a higher risk of genetic abnormalities due to shared genes. Homosexual relationships do not have this concern as they do not produce biological offspring. 2. Power dynamics: Incestuous relationships often involve familial bonds, which can create imbalanced power dynamics and potential for abuse or coercion. Homosexual relationships generally do not have these imbalances due to familial ties. 3. Cultural and historical context: In many cultures and religious traditions, incest has been considered taboo due to the potential risks it poses to family structures and genetic health. Conversely, attitudes toward homosexuality have evolved over time, and in many places around the world, it is now accepted as a natural variation of human sexuality. 4. Legal implications: In many jurisdictions, incest is explicitly prohibited by law, whereas homosexuality has become decriminalized and, in some cases, legally protected. Although the two questions may be phrased differently, they ultimately inquire about the same information: the reasons behind the differing acceptability of homosexuality and incest in society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ishwar 'Langda' Tyagi (Saif Ali Khan) and Keshav 'Kesu Firangi' Upadhyay (Vivek Oberoi) are his closest lieutenants. The movie starts with Langda Tyagi gate-crashing a baraat and challenging Rajju (Deepak Dobriyal), the bridegroom, to try and stop Omkara from abducting the bride, Dolly Mishra (Kareena Kapoor). Rajju fails and the wedding never takes place. Dollyâs father Advocate Raghunath Mishra (Kamal Tiwari), mostly referred in the movie as vakeel saab (lawyer sir), is furious and confronts Omi. He puts a gun to Omiâs head and demands the return of his daughter. Bhaisaab intervenes and resolves the conflict by mentioning the current political conditions and prevents bloodshed. Still unconvinced, Raghunath grieves to Bhaisaab the next day. To bring an end to this issue, Dolly is made to appear in front of her father and clarify that she eloped with Omi and was not abducted. She also tells the events of how she fell in love with Omkara. The father leaves feeling betrayed and ashamed.

Yeni Demokrasiye yeni lider Translate to English","completion":"A New Leader for New Democracy The phrase \\"Yeni Demokrasiye yeni lider\\" in Turkish translates to \\"A New Leader for New Democracy\\" in English. This sentence could have various interpretations and implications, depending on the context in which it is used. In general, it is referring to a fresh, innovative, and capable individual who is taking the lead in a political movement or situation that is focused on promoting and implementing democratic values, ideals, and processes in a society or nation. Let's delve deeper into what this could imply. 1. A change in leadership: This statement might suggest that a political party or movement, referred to as \\"New Democracy,\\" is experiencing a shift in its leadership. This could be a result of an election, reorganization, or an internal decision to change the direction or focus of the group. The new leader is expected to embody the values and principles of the movement and be ready to work towards achieving the organization's goals and objectives. 2. Renewed commitment to democratic values: Another interpretation of this phrase is that it signifies a renewed commitment to promoting and protecting democratic values, such as freedom, justice, equality, and representation.

Democratisation efforts in a specific context: Another possible interpretation is that the sentence refers to a particular country or geopolitical context where the New Democracy movement is pushing for democratic reforms or political transitions. The new leader might be responsible for guiding the group through these changes, fostering national dialogue, and working with a range of stakeholders to ensure a more democratic future. 5. A response to previous leadership failures: Lastly, the phrase could be understood as a call for change in response to perceived leadership failures within the New Democracy movement or the broader political context. The appointment of a new leader might be an attempt to reinvigorate the organization, redefine its goals, and restore public trust in the principles of democratic governance. In conclusion, the Turkish phrase \\"Yeni Demokrasiye yeni lider\\" translates to \\"A New Leader for New Democracy\\" in English. It can have various interpretations owing to its political, social, and cultural implications, but it generally suggests the appointment of a capable and innovative individual to lead the way in promoting and upholding democratic values and processes in a particular context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first statement, \\"A woman in a black shirt is holding a picture of another person,\\" more details are provided about the person holding the photo and the content of the photo itself. The person is specifically described as a woman wearing a black shirt, which adds a visual element to the description. Moreover, the \\"picture\\" is clarified as being an image of \\"another person.\\" These added details enhance the overall understanding of the situation by providing more context.

So the full paragraph becomes: By David Kent World Cup posterboy Neymar is leaving everyone playing a guessing game over his fitness ahead of Brazil's last-eight clash with Colombia. Brazil's number 10 picked up left thigh and right knee injuries in the second-round win on penalties against Chile but coach Luiz Felipe Scolari has declared him fit. Despite that, Neymar was pictured during Brazil training sporting strapping on his right leg as Scolari led training and his star striker sat on the sidelines alongside him. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Neymar in high spirits in training despite injury concerns Ready? Neymar's right leg shows some strapping just three days before Brazil's quarter final. And he is still yet to complete a full training session with the rest of the squad as the countdown to the quarter final with Colombia keeps ticking. Choosing \\"Colombia keeps ticking\\" makes the most sense as it completes the preceding statement about the countdown to the quarter final, where Brazil is scheduled to go against Colombia. The phrase \\"keeps ticking\\" is used to denote the ongoing preparations or anticipation before an event. Hence, the sentence signifies the impending match with Colombia, and how every moment preceding it is consequential. Other options, although grammatically correct, are either irrelevant to the main context (e.g., \\"David Kent keeps ticking\\") or could distort the initial meaning (e.g., \\"Neymar keeps ticking\\" may be interpreted as Neymar is running out of time to recover fully)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Some viruses live in a dormant state inside the body, and although the herpes virus never leaves the body, it can lay dormant for long periods of time. Given these facts, how does herpes stay in a person among the following options: - It reproduces quickly - hospitalization - decreases - It dies and never comes out - It stays active - It remains dormant - They may not survive. - It helps them survive The answer is:","completion":"It remains dormant. The herpes virus is a complex and fascinating microorganism. When infected, a person carries the virus for life due to its ability to remain dormant inside the body. This viral dormancy, also known as latency, is a crucial factor for the herpes virus's survival and persistence in its host. The other options mentioned do not accurately describe the way herpes stays in a person. Herpesviruses belong to a family of viruses known as Herpesviridae. Within this family, there are two key types: herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus 2 (HSV-2), which are the primary causes of oral herpes and genital herpes, respectively. Both HSV-1 and HSV-2 can enter a dormant state within their host, hiding from the immune system and avoiding destruction. Once a person is infected with the herpes virus, the virus enters and replicates within the epithelial cells of the skin or mucous membranes. From there, the virus moves to the sensory nerve endings and travels along the nerve pathway to the nerve ganglia, which are clusters of nerve cells near the spinal cord. HSV-1 typically resides in the trigeminal ganglia, while HSV-2 resides in the sacral ganglia. Within the ganglia, the virus becomes latent, effectively \\"hiding\\" from the body's immune system. During its dormant state, the herpes virus is not actively replicating, which means it is not causing new sores or symptoms. However, the virus can periodically reactivate, traveling back down the nerve pathway to the site of the initial infection. These reactivation events cause the formation of new sores and can be triggered by factors such as stress, illness, hormonal changes, or sun exposure. The latency period varies between individuals, with some experiencing frequent outbreaks and others having only occasional or no outbreaks at all. The frequency of outbreaks typically decreases over time. It is important to note that during these dormant periods without symptoms, the herpes virus can still be transmitted to others through a process known as asymptomatic shedding. This occurs when the virus becomes active on the surface of the skin but does not cause overt symptoms. In summary, the herpes virus remains dormant within the nerve ganglia for extended periods, allowing it to persist in the host's body indefinitely. During periods of dormancy, the virus is not actively replicating, resulting in a lack of visible symptoms. However, occasional reactivation events can lead to the formation of new sores or asymptomatic viral shedding, making the herpes virus a lifelong infection and a public health concern."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It not only protects them from the elements, but also makes them more difficult to steal than from a traditional above ground garage. Also, it’s just slightly cooler than an rolling garage door. The top can be paved or decorated to match the surrounding surface, or equipped to support a second car of up to 6,600 pounds, doubling your storage capacity within the same square footage. Unfortunately, you’re mother-in-law won’t be able to move into the apartment above it, since there isn’t one, but you can always park a camper for her there.

When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, Leonard Bernstein gave a concert in Berlin, including Beethoven's Ode to Joy, with the word \\"Joy\\" changed to \\"Freedom\\" in the lyrics sung.The orchestra were drawn from both East and West Germany, as well as the United Kingdom, France, the Soviet Union, and the United States. Freedom was in the air and it was not just for people. The wall between East and West Germany had also kept a large population of wild pigs within the eastern forests of Brandenburg.The wall's falling down made it easier for the big pigs--a very big one can weigh over 300 pounds--to leave the woodlands and walk into the town. Warm winters and easy access to food have helped the population increase. Now about 10,000 wild pigs walk around Berlin. The nature of the beast has added to the boom .\\"The pigs are intelligent,\\" says Marc Franusch, a spokesman for the Berlin forestry department. \\"They learn to use the neighborhoods.They get used to people, dogs, and traffic.\\" The wild pigs tend to travel in small groups and have been found searching rubbish and gardens, feeding their piglets in the shadow of parked cars, and crossing busy roads.On average, the animals are involved in one traffic accident every day. And despite the fact that it's illegal, some Berliners have been known to give the pigs food. Though wild pigs are protected under German law, the city's forestry department is permitted to kill 2,000 of the creatures every year, targeting mostly young adult animals in forests surrounding Berlin. Pigs within city limits are only shot if they make an immediate threat.No humans have yet been seriously wounded by them, but local dogs have been the victims of their tusks. \\"The forestry department is not aiming to get rid of the pigs,\\" explains Franusch, \\"but we do have to reduce dangerous situations.\\" The following factors contribute to the boom of wild pigs EXCEPT _ . A) the Berlin Wall B) adequate food C) their own nature D) warm winter The answer to this question is:","completion":"A) the Berlin Wall The Berlin Wall's fall in 1989 had a significant impact on the population of wild pigs in the eastern forests of Brandenburg. The absence of the wall allowed the pigs to easily leave the woodlands and move into the city of Berlin. The increase in the wild pig population can be attributed to several factors, including the availability of food, their adaptable nature, and warm winters. The intelligence of the pigs allowed them to learn to navigate urban environments, becoming accustomed to people, dogs, and traffic. While the Berlin Wall's removal facilitated the migration of the wild pigs into the city, it was not a contributing factor to the boom in their population. Rather, it was the combination of other factors, such as adequate food sources, the creature's adaptable nature, and the warmer winters, which allowed the wild pig population to grow. This population growth has caused some challenges for city officials and residents, as wild pigs have become more prominent in urban areas. Traffic accidents involving the animals have become more common, and the pigs have been known to search through rubbish, feed in gardens, and cause harm to local dogs. Additionally, some Berliners have illegally fed the pigs, further encouraging their presence in the city. While wild pigs are protected by German law, the Berlin forestry department is allowed to cull a certain number of them each year, focusing on young adult animals found in forests surrounding the city. Any pigs within the city limits are only shot if they pose an immediate threat. The department's goal is not to eliminate the population entirely, but to reduce the number of dangerous situations caused by the pigs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the term render mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"No, the term \\"render\\" does not carry the same meaning in both the sentences. The word \\"render\\" is versatile and has several meanings depending upon the context in which it's used. In the first sentence, \\"To render Latin into English\\", the term \\"render\\" pertains to translation or interpretation, meaning to transform content from one language (Latin) into another language (English). Here, \\"render\\" is used in the context of converting or expressing the same ideas in different forms or languages. It relates to the transformational aspect, implying a process of conversion that remains true to the transmission of the original meaning from the source language into the target language. In the second sentence, \\"Render the town to the enemy\\", the term \\"render\\" is used in the sense of surrender or giving up. It suggests the act of turning over or yielding something to somebody, often under duress. In this instance, it is understood as a relinquishing control of the town to the enemy. This usage of \\"render\\" often involves a transfer of possession and tends to be utilized in more militaristic, confrontatal or legal circumstances. Therefore, while the term \\"render\\" may appear in both sentences, its interpretation differs substantially reflecting the word's semantic flexibility. It is important to identify context in order to accurately interpret the meaning. Despite sharing grammatical form, these two meanings of \\"render\\" share little in terms of denotational similaries, demonstrating the wide range the english language has for utilizing individual terms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the group that had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer\\"? from the following article ? McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

The bombing plot described in the article, however, ultimately was carried out by Timothy McVeigh in 1995, which was a separate incident from the CSA's 1983 plot. McVeigh had considered other targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas but decided on the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building due to its housing of multiple federal law enforcement agencies.

The key point in the sentence is the mention of \\"anumāṇa (inference)\\" as one of the six pramāṇas within Hindu philosophy. Pramāṇas are sources of knowledge, and in this particular context, the focus is on the concept of inference, also known as logical reasoning or drawing conclusions based on evidence and reasoning. In Hindu philosophy, anumāṇa is considered a crucial aspect of acquiring knowledge and understanding the underlying truths of the world. Hindu philosophy comprises various schools of thought, such as Vedanta, Sāṅkhya, Yoga, Nyāya, and Mīmāṃsā. Each school has its own specific focus and methodology, but they all share the common aim of attaining knowledge and pursuing spiritual realization. Anumāṇa (inference) is recognized by most Hindu philosophical schools, but it assumes particular significance in the Nyāya school, which is known for its emphasis on logic, analysis, and epistemology. The Nyāya school bases its foundation on the Nyāya Sūtras, attributed to the ancient philosopher Ākṣapāda Gautama. This school is built on a systematic approach to acquiring knowledge, which revolves around a well-defined process using perceptive evidence, inference, analogy, and the testimony of reliable sources. It is centered on the idea that accurate knowledge can be attained by identifying valid and reliable sources of information and distinguishing truth from falsehood. In conclusion, the concept of anumāṇa (inference) forms an integral part of Hindu philosophy, particularly in the Nyāya school. The sentence provided delivers a valid answer to the question concerning which aspect of Hindu philosophy is focused on inference by listing anumāṇa as one of the six pramāṇas, pointing out the significance of inference as a means of obtaining accurate knowledge and discovering truths within the philosophical framework of Hinduism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","completion":"Chewing insects like dragonflies and grasshoppers possess two primary sets of jaws, which play an essential role in their feeding process. These jaws are known as the mandibles and maxillae. Each set of jaws has its functions and features that enable these insects to process and consume their food effectively. 1. Mandibles: Mandibles are the first set of jaws found in chewing insects. They are powerful and robust, responsible for cutting, crushing, and breaking down food into smaller pieces. These are situated just below the insect's head, and their structure typically consists of two opposing, hinge-like parts that move horizontally against each other. The mandibles can vary in their shape, size, and tooth configuration, depending on the insect's dietary preference. For example, a predatory dragonfly will have sharp and powerful mandibles to seize and devour its prey, while grasshoppers will have mandibles designed to cut and grind plant material. 2. Maxillae: Maxillae are the second set of jaws present in chewing insects. They are smaller and more delicate than mandibles and are primarily used for handling, manipulating, and guiding food towards the mandibles for further processing. Maxillae are paired structures, situated just behind the mandibles, and are composed of several components. The two main parts of the maxillae are the maxillary palp and the galea. The maxillary palp is a sensory organ that helps the insect to taste and manipulate food items, while the galea is a lobe-like structure that covers and protects the other delicate parts of the maxillae. In addition to these two primary sets of jaws, chewing insects also have a labium, which serves as the insect's lower lip. The labium is a fused structure that originates from a pair of secondary maxillae. Like the maxillae, the labium also has sensory structures called labial palps that assist the insect in its feeding process. Altogether, the mandibles, maxillae, and labium form a functional and efficient mouthpart assembly that allows chewing insects like dragonflies and grasshoppers to consume a wide range of food sources. These structures work together to ensure that these insects can efficiently capture, process, and ingest their prey or plant-based food items, providing them with the necessary nutrients for growth, reproduction, and survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He told Mr Bone he should not wear it again, \\"preferably at any time, but certainly not in the chamber\\".

They tended to be top hats and of a less colourful type than Mr Bone's. But the Conservative right-winger had an unlikely sartorial ally in former Labour leader Keir Hardie, who preferred a soft cap, and the radical Liberal Joseph Cowen, who complained that \\"the rigidity of the top hat subjected him to headache\\". And, until 1998, any MP wishing to raise a point of order during a division was required to wear a top hat. Special collapsible versions were kept for this purpose.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which township is experiencing fewer tornadoes? Hint: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes. Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Jolt township is experiencing fewer tornadoes compared to Burr township. This is because Jolt township is situated at a higher altitude with a less windy and less cloudy environment.

Often, a record label is also a publishing company that manages such brands and trademarks, coordinates the production, manufacture, distribution, marketing, promotion, and enforcement of copyright for sound recordings and music videos; conducts talent scouting and development of new artists (\\"artists and repertoire\\" or \\"A&R\\"); and maintains contracts with recording artists and their managers.

As \\"Fingerprince\\" was originally meant to be a three-sided album (a concept abandoned due to expense and Monty Python's \\"Matching Tie and Handkerchief\\" beating them to the punch), much of the material was abandoned and the third side remained unfinished until November 1977 although most tracks from the EP was shown at the Residents Radio Special in September 1977. Thus, the group reduced the third side to an extended play record entitled '\\"Babyfingers'\\", and released it in 1979 to people who had been waiting for their copy of \\"The Third Reich and Roll\\" box sets. A second printing was made for members of the W.E.I.R.D. fan club in 1981, and a last pressing, on pink vinyl, in 1985.

Using a dry mop or vacuum is ideal, although you can sweep with a broom if you're in a hurry. Opt for a soft and fluffy dust mop, preferably with a removable end that's machine washable. Options are: 1. Sweep your floors a few times a week. Aim your vacuum at any remaining dirt, mold, or sediment spots.. 2. Look in the bathroom mirror to see if you've collected all of the product. This is potentially hazardous and can introduce odor to the tile floor that will attract hazardous waste and slow down your cleaning process.. 3. Wipe off the mop after every sweep. You can also use a variety of motion-absorbing vacuums, including a handheld handheld mop, a garden broom, and finally a low-pressure nozzle.. 4.

Article: \\"The world has never been a better place to live in\\" says science writer Matt Ridley, \\"and it will keep on getting better.\\" Read on to see how Ridley makes his case. Right or wrong? You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today.

Hypothesis: The PLO remained much to the satisfaction of everyone. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The conclusion that the PLO's exit would satisfy everyone is not directly inferred from the premise. The premise talks about two primary aspects: firstly, that the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization) was forced out, and secondly, that this action was carried out without a lot of support from within Israel. What this means is that a certain body or group compelled the PLO to leave, with the fact being emphasized that this decision or action was not widely or fully supported by Israel. This might be due to a plethora of reasons. For instance, there might be members or groups within Israel that were either sympathetic to the cause of the PLO, were against the use of force, or believed in a peaceful and negotiated settlement. On the other hand, there could have been those who simply felt this would not solve the underlying issue or those who were unsure of the future implications of this forceful eviction. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the PLO’s exit was met with universal satisfaction—which is neither mentioned nor implied in the premise. Given the lack of widespread support for the PLO's eviction within Israel, as stated in the premise, it can be inferred that there might have been differing opinions about the expulsion of the PLO. These differences are likely to include dissatisfaction or disagreement from certain quarters. Therefore, the hypothesis is not an entirely accurate encapsulation or interpretation of the premise. There is ambiguity and the premise does not provide enough information to assert that there was a complete and universal feeling of satisfaction post the PLO's exit. It may be the case that certain parties were satisfied, but the assumption that everyone was satisfied is not supported by the premise. Without specific detail regarding the wider reactions to the event from the parties involved or possibly affected, it cannot be assumed that the exit of the PLO was to everyone's satisfaction.

Q:This article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

Article: One British survivor of the disaster, which claimed 12 lives with 20 people still missing, branded the offer as \\"insulting\\". It was disclosed that in an attempt to help survivors the ship's parent company, Carnival, has been telephoning passengers daily asking if they are suffering nightmares or sleepless nights. But that move also appeared to backfire when a psychologist said such questioning could trigger post traumatic stress rather than relieve it. A little over a week after the ship capsized off the coast of Tuscany, it also emerged that: • An emergency services log showed that the Concordia's captain, Francisco Schettino, abandoned ship more than four hours before the last passenger. • A separate voice recording showed Capt Schettino pledging to be the last man on the ship, suggesting erratic behaviour and that he lied to the authorities. • Divers recovered the ship's safe from the captain's cabin along with the body of a woman they found in a submerged corridor The offer for future discounts is being made by Costa Cruises, which operated the Concordia and whose parent company is Carnival, the world's largest cruise operator. Passengers were also being sent letters by Costa detailing how to claim for lost valuables and offering a full refund on the voyage. Lawyers plan to sue both in the US and in Italy, with more than 100 passengers already reported to have joined a class action that is to be lodged in Miami this week. Each is reported to be demanding between £100,000 and £1 million in compensation. A spokesman for Costa Cruises said: \\"The company is trying to do everything they can for those passengers directly affected. \\"The company is not only going to refund everybody but they will offer a 30 per cent discount on future cruises if they want to stay loyal to the company.\\" Costa's chief executive, Pier Luigi Foschi, who estimated that the impact of the disaster on his firm was £60 million, had expressed confidence that the group would be able to \\"find a solution that, in the material sense, would satisfy\\" the passengers. However, Brian Page, 63, a retired accountant from Southampton, who survived by sliding from one side of the deck to another to find a lifeboat, said: \\"It is a ridiculous and insulting offer. I'm very disappointed in them. \\"They are not accepting their responsibilities at all. Our only back-up is separate legal action.\\" Costa Cruises has laid the blame on Capt Schettino, who steered the liner on to rocks and then abandoned ship before all the passengers got off. But lawyers for the passengers will claim that Costa Cruise ships had \\"regularly\\" deviated from the correct route. The ongoing civil legal battle is complicated by the criminal case against Capt Schettino and the specific contracts signed by passengers. Last week, Carnival began phoning British passengers asking if they were suffering nightmares, sleepless nights and needed counselling. Mr Page and other passengers, including Janice and Ian Donoff, from north London, and Edwin and Liz Gurd, from Hampshire, received calls. Lawyers, however, have questioned the company's motives. Clive Garner, head of the travel law team at Irwin Mitchell, who represents at least one British passenger, said: \\"I would advise Carnival to desist from doing this. \\"In other large-scale incidents, defendants have been very keen to liaise with victims early on with a view to making low offers of settlement.\\" Jill Greenfield, a personal injury partner at Field Fisher Waterhouse who has successfully sued Carnival in the past, said: \\"The poor people on this ship will still be in shock and not yet realise what they have been through. \\"It may be that Carnival are genuinely trying to help but what they should be doing is telling these people to get some legal advice.\\" Jennifer Wild, a consultant clinical psychologist at Oxford University and King's College London, said repeatedly asking victims if they were having nightmares breached guidelines on treating people after disasters. The questions are likely to feed anxiety and possibly even lead to post-traumatic stress, she said. \\"They may be doing it because they just want to monitor people but this is not helpful,\\" she said. Further details of Capt Schettino's erratic behaviour were disclosed with the publication of the official log kept by the harbour master's office, which coordinated the rescue. The log shows how the captain, who is under house arrest, first played down the crisis and then abandoned ship more than four hours before the last passenger. Further voice recordings add to the confusion, with Capt Schettino claiming to coastguards that he will remain on ship as the last man. \\"I'm the only one who will stay here,\\" he told the coastguards in a tape that will be used by prosecutors to support their contention that he lied to port authorities on the night of the disaster and that he abandoned his post in contravention of the naval code. Divers exploring the cruise ship recovered a safe from the captain's cabin on the instructions of the prosecutors. They believe it may contain documents or other evidence that could help their investigation. The body of a 12th victim was found inside the hull of the £370 million, 1,000ft vessel. The victim, a woman, was found wearing a life jacket on the fourth deck, close to a muster station. ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The Costa Concordia disaster occurred in January 2012 when the cruise ship hit rocks and capsized off the coast of Tuscany, Italy, resulting in 12 deaths and 20 people still missing at the time of this article.

Question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the given process is \\"Inhalation of air into the lungs.\\" The detailed sequence of the process would be as follows: 1. Inhalation of air into the lungs: The process begins with the action of inhaling air into our lungs. This is accomplished by the expansion of the ribcage and descent of the diaphragm, creating a vacuum that pulls air into the respiratory system. Air flows into the body through the nose or mouth, travels down the trachea, passes through the bronchi, and finally enters the lungs where the bronchioles and alveoli are located. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: Once the air reaches the alveoli, the exchange of gases takes place. Oxygen molecules in the inhaled air diffuse across the thin walls of the alveolar sacs into the surrounding capillaries, where they bind to hemoglobin in red blood cells. This oxygen-rich blood is then pumped throughout the body by the circulatory system to provide energy and nutrients to cells. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal cords: When a person decides to talk, their brain sends signals to the muscles associated with speech and vocalization. The diaphragm and the muscles surrounding the ribcage contract, increasing pressure in the lungs. This forces air to travel upward through the trachea and over the vocal cords. The vibration of the vocal cords caused by the flow of air creates sound, which is then shaped into words by the tongue, lips, and other structures in the mouth. 4. A person talks: Once the air has passed through the vocal cords and the sound is generated, the person's brain coordinates a series of complex movements and articulations involving the tongue, lips, and jaw. These movements work together with the breath to produce voiced and unvoiced sounds that make up syllables, words, and sentences. Each of these sounds has specific characteristics such as pitch, intonation, and volume, controlled by the muscles in the larynx and throughout the vocal tract. 5. Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment: After the vocalization process, the remaining air within the lungs is released into the environment. This final part of the process is called exhalation. During exhalation, the diaphragm and surrounding muscles relax, allowing the ribcage to compress and reduce the volume of the lungs. As the lung volume decreases, the pressure within the lungs rises, and air is expelled through the trachea, bronchi, and out of the nose or mouth. This completes the cycle of respiration and vocalization, allowing the process to begin again with the next inhalation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1902, Gilbert told a correspondent that this had happened accidentally. He and Sullivan had arrived in New York to produce the new opera, but the composer discovered that he had left his sketches behind in England. Fortunately, the entrance chorus from Thespis fitted the situation almost exactly, so it was substituted instead.Several scholars have doubted that explanation. In Sullivan's autograph score for the later work, the first part of \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\" is actually taken from a Thespis copyist score, with the Thespis words cancelled and the new words written in, which raises the question of why Sullivan had a Thespis score to hand, if not for that purpose.Some suggest that other music from Thespis could have been used in Pirates. Goldberg suggests that \\"It is reasonable to believe that Sullivan made generous use of his Thespis music in other operettas: perhaps owing to the circumstances under which The Pirates of Penzance was written, it contains more than one unacknowledged borrowing from the unlucky firstling of the lucky pair.\\" Reginald Allen says that \\"it seems certain\\" from its \\"rhythmic structure\\" that part of the Act I finale of Thespis, \\"Here's a pretty tale for future Iliads and Odysseys\\" became the original Act II finale in Pirates, \\"At length we are provided with unusual felicity\\", which was later deleted. Tillett and Spencer propose that most of Act I of Pirates was taken from Thespis. However, there is only circumstantial evidence for these suggestions. Except for \\"Climbing over rocky mountain\\", neither author admitted to borrowing from Thespis for later works. contains an answer for the question: What are the last names of the \\"lucky pair\\" that Goldberg speaks of?, what is it ?","completion":"The last names of the \\"lucky pair\\" that Goldberg speaks of are Gilbert and Sullivan."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Almost a Win for Celtic Dragons in the Netball Superleague Hello little friends! Today, we are going to talk about an exciting game that happened recently in the Netball Superleague. Do you know what netball is? It's a sport, like basketball, where two teams try to score points by throwing a ball into a hoop. But there are some differences, like you can't move with the ball in your hands! Now, let me tell you about this thrilling game between the Celtic Dragons and Manchester Thunder. The Celtic Dragons are a netball team from Wales, and they were so close to winning their second game of the season! The Manchester Thunder, a team from England, proved to be a tough opponent for the Dragons. During the game, both teams played really hard, showing off their skills and scoring points by passing the ball to their teammates and shooting it into the hoop. Everyone was on the edge of their seats, waiting to see which team would win. It was a very close match, and both teams should be proud of how well they played. At the end of the game, the Manchester Thunder managed to score just two points more than the Celtic Dragons, winning with a score of 55-53. That's super close, isn't it? Even though the Celtic Dragons didn't win this time, they put up a great fight and came very close to victory. They shouldn't be sad because they showed everyone how hard they worked and that they can compete with strong teams like the Manchester Thunder. So, my little friends, sometimes in life, we give our best effort and still may not come out on top, and that's okay. It's important to learn from our experiences, keep trying, and believe in ourselves. Just like the Celtic Dragons, who showed us that even if they didn't win the game this time, they could still be proud of their amazing effort. Next time you play a game, remember the Celtic Dragons and keep trying your best, even if you don't win!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It became the fastest-selling album of all time, with 3.6 million sold in its first week and 13 million within a month. It topped albums charts in at least 28 countries. As of April 2009, the compilation had sold 31 million copies globally, and is the best-selling album of that decade in the United States.Harrison died from metastatic lung cancer in November 2001. McCartney and Starr were among the musicians who performed at the Concert for George, organised by Eric Clapton and Harrison's widow, Olivia. The tribute event took place at the Royal Albert Hall on the first anniversary of Harrison's death.In 2003, Let It Be... Naked, a reconceived version of the Let It Be album, with McCartney supervising production, was released. One of the main differences from the Spector-produced version was the omission of the original string arrangements. It was a top ten hit in both Britain and America. The US album configurations from 1964 to 1965 were released as box sets in 2004 and 2006; The Capitol Albums, Volume 1 and Volume 2 included both stereo and mono versions based on the mixes that were prepared for vinyl at the time of the music's original American release.As a soundtrack for Cirque du Soleil's Las Vegas Beatles stage revue, Love, George Martin and his son Giles remixed and blended 130 of the band's recordings to create what Martin called \\"a way of re-living the whole Beatles musical lifespan in a very condensed period\\".

When she got home she put one bag of ice in the sink and another in the freezer, but then was distracted by a phone call and forgot to put the other bag in the freezer. When she returned, the bag of ice had melted. Was the temperature of the melted bag higher or lower than the temperature of the frozen bag? Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The temperature of the melted bag of ice was higher than the temperature of the frozen bag. When the bag of ice melts, it means that the ice has absorbed enough heat (energy) to overcome the forces holding its molecules together in a solid state. This energy absorption raises the average kinetic energy of the particles in the matter, leading to an increase in temperature. As a result, the melted bag of ice will have a higher temperature compared to the frozen bag of ice that has not undergone this phase change."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I have a chronic illness, and so I received quite a few sterling gems in the months between onset and accurate diagnosis. I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS. Literally THE most common sign/symptom/syndrome of autonomic dysfunction. The most common one. He could’ve confirmed right there in the office with a poor man’s tilt table test, if he knew to… Mayo Clinic had to confirm with expensive instruments because he’d never heard of a disease that affects 1/100 teenagers and between 1–3 million people in the United States!

Relevance: Among all the given options, a medical center is the most relevant place to find a dentist office, as it is generally a hub for various healthcare providers, including dentists. In a medical center, different medical practitioners operate closely, making it convenient for patients to access multiple services in one spot. 2. Co-location of services: Medical centers usually house a range of healthcare services such as general practitioners, specialists, diagnostic services, and pharmacies. Therefore, it is logical to expect that a dentist office would be located in a medical center to facilitate easy referrals and collaboration with other healthcare providers. 3. Accessibility: Medical centers are often strategically located in central areas, making them conveniently accessible to the general public. Placing a dentist office within a medical center would ensure that more people could easily reach the needed dental services. 4. Infrastructure: Medical centers are already equipped with essential infrastructure and resources required by several medical professionals, including dentists. This allows a dentist office to be easily integrated into a medical center with minimal modifications or upgrades. Although some dentist offices can also be found on main streets or metropolitan cities, a medical center is the most suitable choice among the available options because it directly relates to the healthcare field and offers numerous advantages for both providers and patients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Having gained access to Captain St. Edmund's hidden will with the help of a corrupt former cleaning woman at Candleshoe, Harry recruits American Casey Brown (Foster)âan unwanted foster child and hooliganâinto the plot, employing her to pose as Lady St Edmund's granddaughter, the Honourable Margaret, 4th Marchioness of St Edmund, who was kidnapped at age four by her father and subsequently disappeared after her father's death. Casey is the right age to pass for Margaret and possesses several identifying scars that young Margaret was known to have. Casey agrees to go along with the con and discover further clues in exchange for a cut of the treasure.

Plot title: Serpico Movie plot: Frank Serpico (Al Pacino) covered in blood and slumped in the backseat of a police car as it races to a hospital with lights and sirens blaring. He has just been shot in the face. The rest of the movie tells the story of Serpico's career up to this moment, starting with him becoming a police officer in 1960. He is very idealistic and believes in non-brutal methods to catch criminals. Serpico also refuses to join in on police corruption, specifically that which involves shaking down and taking payoffs from gambling and drug dealing organizations. His refusal to take bribes earns him the suspicion of his fellow officers throughout the majority of the precincts to which he is assigned. Additionally, Serpico finds trouble fitting in due to his embrace of the counterculture of the 1960s: He moves to Greenwich Village, grows his hair and beard long to the point where he must maintain a plainclothes appearance, and associates with a more left-wing crowd that is distrusting of the NYPD.At first Serpico tries appealing to his bosses about the corruption, but gets nowhere. He enlists a highly-connected fellow officer, Bob Blair (Tony Roberts) in his fight against corruption, but not even he can crack the city administration's general indifference. His campaign and the resulting complications and harassment within the department take a toll on his mental health and his relationship with fiancee Laurie (Barbara Eda-Young), who ultimately leaves him.

The condition usually occurs in people who have experienced a head injury or a stroke a sudden loss of consciousness, sensation, or movement caused by a blocked or broken blood vessel in the brain. The condition was first identified during the Second World War in a Norwegian woman whose head was injured during an attack by the German military. The woman recovered but was left with a German-sounding accent, to the horror of fellow villagers who avoided her after that. Researchers have discovered that the combined effect of the damage to several parts of the brain makes victims lengthen certain syllables, mispronounce sounds, and change,the normal pitch of their voice. Those changes in speech add up to what sounds like a foreign accent. Another researcher, a phonetician ,says victims of the syndrome don't acquire a true foreign accent. Their strangely changed speech only resembles the foreign: accent with which it has a few sounds in common.

It reminded me of two movies: Trainspotting (small time criminals scoring some drugs and doing some stupid things in Schotland) and The Blair Witch Project (because of the style of filming). It's about the loyalty between two friends, one of them is coming out of jail, the other one hasn't been caught yet. With a stolen vehicle they drive through the Scottish countryside but than run out of petrol. As they try to find some fuel, they find a farm in the middle of nowhere. The farmer thinks they want to rob him and points a gun at one of them. Than it all goes wrong. One of the friends accidentally shoots the farmer's daughter and they have to run. What follows is a man hunt through the fields and woods of Schotland. The two friends literally have to run for their lives. Apparently this movie was shot in only 12 days time. OK, that's not exactly unbelievable because the biggest part of it is always in the same place: the Scottish countryside, but I still find that quite amazing. Especially because this isn't actually a bad movie. It's perhaps not the greatest movie ever, but they still can be proud of what they achieved.

Given the background: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. and the situation: Tom and Jerry were two 50-year-olds which went to high-school together.

A key figure in helping Stafford to develop her solo career was Mike Nidorf, an agent who first heard her as a member of the Pied Pipers while he was serving as a Captain with the United States Army. Having previously discovered artists such as Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, and Woody Herman, Nidorf was impressed by Stafford's voice, and contacted her when he was demobilized in 1944. After she agreed to let him represent her, he encouraged her to reduce her weight and arranged a string of engagements that raised her profile, and confidence.The success of Stafford's solo career led to a demand for personal appearances, and from February 1945 she embarked on a six-month residency at New York's La Martinique nightclub. Her performance was well-received—an article in the July 1945 edition of Band Leaders magazine described it as \\"sensational\\"—but Stafford did not enjoy singing before live audiences, and it was the only nightclub venue she ever played. Speaking about her discomfort with live performances, Stafford told a 1996 interview with The New Yorker's Nancy Franklin, \\"I'm basically a singer, period, and I think I'm really lousy up in front of an audience—it's just not me.\\"Stafford's tenure with the United Service Organizations (USO) during World War II—which often saw her perform for soldiers stationed in the U.S.—led to her acquiring the nickname \\"G.I.

Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

It was the day of the big fundraiser that Sarah and Megan had planned for the local animal shelter. Sarah was a devout animal lover, dedicating her life to rescuing and rehabilitating homeless and injured animals. Megan, on the other hand, wasn't as invested in the cause — she agreed to help out with the planning and execution as a favor to her lifelong friend. Sarah knew that this fundraiser could make or break the future of the shelter. They needed to raise enough money to keep the facility running and expand their operations, giving homes to even more animals in need. If they didn't, the shelter would be forced to close its doors, leaving countless animals without a safe place. This was an outcome Sarah simply couldn't bear to imagine. Despite knowing how important this event was to Sarah, Megan's actions showed little care or dedication. While Sarah dedicated every spare moment to organizing the event — from reaching out to local businesses for donations to designing flyers — Megan consistently dragged her feet. She seemed uninterested in the planning process, putting off tasks and offering little assistance or constructive input. As the fundraiser day approached, the divide between their efforts became even more apparent. With Megan shirking her responsibilities, Sarah was forced to put in late nights and skip outings with friends to ensure that everything was in order. Her time was consumed by tasks like preparing the venue, creating decorations, and coordinating volunteers and staff. Despite the exhaustion and frustration, Sarah refused to let anything stand in her way; she saw the faces of the animals that she was fighting for, and that drove her on. On the day of the fundraiser, Sarah was delighted to see that her hard work had paid off. Local businesses had generously donated a wide array of items for the silent auction, and the community arrived in droves to show their support. There was live music, delicious food, and heartfelt speeches that touched on the incredible work done by the shelter. It was during Sarah's impassioned speech about the importance of preserving the shelter that Megan finally understood the gravity of the situation. Perhaps it was the tears in Sarah's eyes or the way the crowd hung onto every word she said; something finally clicked for Megan. In that moment, she regretted not putting in the effort that her friend so desperately needed from her. As the fundraiser came to an end, the two friends stood together, exhausted but happy. They had raised a significant amount of funds required to not only keep the doors open but also to expand. At that moment, Megan pulled Sarah aside and apologized sincerely for her previous lack of support. She promised to do better and be there for her friend in the future, understanding how much the shelter meant to Sarah and the countless animals it saved. In the end, the story of Sarah and Megan's efforts serves as a lesson about the importance of dedication and empathy, along with the power of friendship. With perseverance and support, even the most daunting challenges can be overcome."},{"prompt":"What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario? from the following article ? Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound.

Elaine contacts the Chicago control tower for help, and is instructed by tower supervisor Steve McCroskey (Lloyd Bridges) to activate the plane's autopilot, a large inflatable pilot doll (listed as \\"Otto\\" in the end credits), which will get them to Chicago, but will not be able to land the plane. Rumack convinces Striker to fly the plane, though Striker feels unable to handle the pressure and the unfamiliar aircraft. McCroskey knows that he must get someone else to help take the plane down and calls Rex Kramer (Robert Stack), Striker's commanding officer in the war. Despite their hostile relationship, he is the best choice to instruct Striker. As the plane nears Chicago, Striker is overcome by stress and manages to land the plane only after a pep talk from Dr. Rumack. With Kramer's advice, Striker is able to land the plane safely with only minor injuries to some passengers. Striker's courage rekindles Elaine's love for him, and the two share a kiss. \\"Otto\\" takes off in the evacuated plane after inflating a female companion.

Step 1: Research African perspectives on the slave trade I will start by researching different African communities and their views on the slave trade from historical accounts, modern opinions, and scholarly research. Step 2: Analyze and identify common themes Once I have gathered enough information, I will analyze the various viewpoints to identify common themes and opinions related to the slave trade among African communities. Step 3: Formulate my answer Based on my research and analysis, I will formulate an answer that accurately and faithfully represents the African perspectives on the slave trade. As a result of these steps, my answer to the question \\"How do Africans view the slave trade?\\" is as follows: African perspectives on the slave trade vary depending on the historical, cultural, and regional contexts. Some communities that were involved in the slave trade view it as a part of their history that they cannot change, while others may feel anger and resentment towards those who were responsible for it. Additionally, many modern Africans emphasize the need to learn from this dark period in history and work towards a better future. Overall, there is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question, as African perspectives on the slave trade are diverse and complex."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We can only make guesses, of course, but we can be sure that he will be different from what he is today, because man is slowly changing all the time. Let us take an example. Man, even five hundred years ago, was shorter than he is today. Now, on average , men are about three inches taller. 500 years is relatively a short period of time, so we may suppose that man will continue to grow taller. Again, in the modern world we use our brains a great deal. Even so, we still use only about 20% of the brain's capacity . As time goes on, however, we shall have to use our brains more and more, and finally we shall need our brains more and more, and finally we shall need larger ones! This is likely to bring a physical change too. The head, especially the forehead , will grow larger. Nowadays our eyes are used too much. In fact, we use them so much that very often they become weaker and we have to wear glasses. But over a long time it is possible that man's eyes will grow stronger. On the other hand, we make use of our arms and legs less. These, as a result, are likely to grow weaker. At the same time, however, our fingers will grow more sensitive because they are used a lot in modern life. But what about hair? This will probably disappear from the body because it does not serve a useful purpose any longer. In the future, then, both men and women are likely to be hairless.

I can use this background: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice. Now, I have a new situation: John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Answer this question please: Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB?","completion":"According to Aristotle's theory of life-history features in live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals), the tetrapod with a larger body mass and a longer gestation period is likely to have a longer lifespan as well. Furthermore, fecundity (the ability to produce offspring) decreases with an increase in lifespan. In the given situation, tetA is heavier and has a longer gestation period compared to tetB. Thus, following Aristotle's theory, tetA is predicted to have a longer lifespan than tetB. Consequently, tetA would have lower fecundity and produce fewer offsprings in its lifetime, compared to tetB."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Irving Fisher (February 27, 1867 - April 29, 1947) was an American economist, statistician, inventor, and Progressive social campaigner. He was one of the earliest American neoclassical economists, though his later work on debt deflation has been embraced by the Post-Keynesian school. Joseph Schumpeter described him as \\"the greatest economist the United States has ever produced\\", an assessment later repeated by James Tobin and Milton Friedman. Fisher made important contributions to utility theory and general equilibrium. Fisher was born in Saugerties, New York. His father was a teacher and a Congregational minister, who raised his son to believe he must be a useful member of society. Despite being raised in religious family, he later on became an atheist. As a child, he had remarkable mathematical ability and a flair for invention. A week after he was admitted to Yale College his father died, at age 53. Irving then supported his mother, brother, and himself, mainly by tutoring. He graduated first in his class with a B.A degree in 1888, having also been elected as a member of the Skull and Bones society. In 1891, Fisher received the first Ph.D. in economics granted by Yale. His faculty advisors were the theoretical physicist Willard Gibbs and the sociologist William Graham Sumner. As a student, Fisher had shown particular talent and inclination for mathematics, but he found that economics offered greater scope for his ambition and social concerns. His thesis, published by Yale in 1892 as Mathematical Investigations in the Theory of Value and Prices, was a rigorous development of the theory of general equilibrium. When he began writing the thesis, Fisher had not been aware that Leon Walras and his continental European disciples had already covered similar ground. Nonetheless, Fisher's work was a very significant contribution and was immediately recognized and praised as first-rate by such European masters as Francis Edgeworth. After graduating from Yale, Fisher studied in Berlin and Paris. From 1890 onward, he remained at Yale, first as a tutor, then after 1898 as a professor of political economy, and after 1935 as professor emeritus. He edited the Yale Review from 1896 to 1910 and was active in many learned societies, institutes, and welfare organizations. He was president of the American Economic Association in 1918. The American Mathematical Society selected him as its Gibbs Lecturer for 1929. A leading early proponent of econometrics, in 1930 he founded, with Ragnar Frisch and Charles F. Roos the Econometric Society, of which he was the first president. Fisher was a prolific writer, producing journalism as well as technical books and articles, and addressing various social issues surrounding of the First World War, the prosperous 1920s and the depressed 1930s. He made several practical inventions, the most notable of which was an \\"index visible filing system\\" which he patented in 1913 and sold to Kardex Rand (later Remington Rand) in 1925. This, and his subsequent stock investments, made him a wealthy man until his personal finances were badly hit by the Crash of 1929. Fisher was also an active social and health campaigner, as well as an advocate of vegetarianism, Prohibition, and eugenics. He died in New York City in 1947, at the age of 80.

The problem is -39*l + 26*l = 36 - 114, and we need to find out what \\"l\\" is. First, let's simplify the equation. We can start by combining the two \\"l\\" terms on the left side: (-39 + 26) * l = 36 - 114 Now, subtract 39 from 26: (-13) * l = 36 - 114 Next, we can simplify the right side of the equation: -13 * l = -78 Now, to find out what \\"l\\" is, we have to divide by -13 on both sides: l = -78 ÷ -13 And finally, when we divide -78 by -13, we get: l = 6 So the answer is that l = 6.

Respected toymaker, Theodore Bellweather, suffers a breakdown after his beloved toy store goes bankrupt due to competition from large online corporations. Bitter and vengeful, Theodore transforms into the sinister Toyman, determined to teach the city a lesson for abandoning small businesses like his. Drowning in his newfound madness, Toyman secretly designs an enormous mechanical spider, named Arachnobot, capable of capturing and controlling anything in its path. His ultimate plan, fueled by his twisted desire for revenge, is to hold the city's children hostage until the citizens promise to only support local businesses. As Arachnobot prowls through Andersonville, panic and fear spread like wildfire. The city's authorities are helpless against the formidable spider, as it effortlessly weaves webs of terror, ensnaring any child it encounters. Faced with a race against time, a group of unlikely heroes unite to uncover Toyman's true intentions and put a stop to his monstrous creation. The team includes a resourceful teenage hacker, Lily; a retired police officer, Jack; and a gentle robotics expert named Haruto. This trio, each with their unique set of skills and a shared connection to the city's toiling small-business owners, become the city's last hope in rescuing the innocent children from Toyman's twisted scheme. Conflict emerges as the heroes must use their wit, cunning, and technical knowledge to dismantle Arachnobot. Toyman, meanwhile, is forever one step ahead, leaving a trail of puzzles and deceit behind him. The clock is ticking as the shell-shocked city becomes more desperate; the parents plead with the mayor to comply with Toyman's demands. As the heroes unravel the true nature of Toyman's grief, they try to reach out to him, showing him that there is still hope for love and prosperity in the community, both for the families who have lost their children and for failed entrepreneurs like himself. In an emotional climax, Toyman faces his own emotional turmoil as he witnesses the unity the city has attained in its darkest hour. By understanding and addressing the core of Toyman's pain, Lily, Jack, and Haruto finally disarm Arachnobot, freeing the children and capturing Theodore. As they reunite the kids with their families, life in Andersonville starts to rebuild. Theodore, now realizing the error of his ways, begins a journey of redemption behind bars, using his brilliant mind for the betterment of society. In the end, the city comes together in support of local businesses, forging new bonds among its citizens and ensuring future prosperity for local entrepreneurs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more chemicals being dumped into the water will have a direct and indirect effect on the process. Directly, an increased amount of chemicals will cause even higher levels of water pollution, which will further harm the water quality. This will cause the health of plants and animals to deteriorate at a faster rate, leading to shorter, less healthy lives. As a result, the plants and animals will reproduce even less effectively than before. Indirectly, the reduced ability to reproduce and decreased lifespans of plants and animals will cause a more rapid decline in their population. This will, in turn, reduce the ability of the remaining organisms to help clean the water, leading to a faster degradation of water quality.

Although they are not exactly the same, the two sentences convey a very similar meaning. Both sentences describe a person who is preparing okra in a container using heat. The main differences between the sentences lie in the specific methodology of how they are being prepared and the type of container used. In the first sentence, \\"someone is boiling okra in a pot,\\" the method of cooking is boiling. Boiling involves submerging the okra in water and subjecting it to high heat, causing the water and its contents to reach the boiling point. In this scenario, the container used for preparation is a pot, which is typically deep and designed for cooking with large amounts of liquid. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"someone is cooking okra in a pan,\\" uses the more generic term \\"cooking.\\" The specific method of cooking is not specified, and it could include a broader range of culinary techniques, such as frying, sautéing, or simmering. Moreover, the food is prepared in a pan, which is typically shallow and not designed to hold a large amount of liquid. Nevertheless, despite these differences in cooking method and container, the core meaning of both sentences remains highly similar, as they both convey the preparation of okra using heat. Given that both sentences center around the same subject (okra) and action (cooking), their similarity is quite strong, warranting a rating of 4 out of 5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The goal of this transition was to signify a decrease in violence and the onset of stability in Iraq, with an increasing emphasis on diplomatic and economic development. Operation Iraqi Freedom began in March 2003 and aimed to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, to end Saddam Hussein's support for terrorism, and to free the Iraqi people. This operation was marked by major combat operations, including the shock and awe campaign, the battle for control in Fallujah, and the surge, which saw an increase in U.S. troops to quell sectarian violence. In contrast, Operation New Dawn represented a shift from these tactics. The operation reflected the U.S. commitment to a new phase in relations with Iraq, moving from a primarily military presence to a more normalized diplomatic relationship. The focus was on nation-building elements, such as assistance in the development of democratic institutions, support for civil society, and aid in reconstruction efforts. While Operation New Dawn was still ultimately a military operation, it was significantly different from Operation Iraqi Freedom. Naming the operation \\"New Dawn\\" was symbolic, intending to indicate a brighter, more hopeful future for Iraq. In December 2011, Operation New Dawn officially ended with the departure of nearly all U.S. troops, hence ending the United States' military involvement in Iraq. However, the consequences of the Iraq War, both under Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation New Dawn, continue to be felt in the ongoing political, economic, and security challenges in Iraq. Moreover, the impacts extend globally, affecting U.S. foreign policy and military strategy in the Middle East and around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Baskin is an average 11-year-old boy. His father, Billy Baskin, is a struggling artist and temporary sole caregiver of the children while his wife attends to the needs of her recently deceased father in Australia. Upon hearing the news that an abandoned mansion has recently burned down, Michael and his friend Connie decide to explore the remains.

Carla, a lonely woman burdened by lack of respect from her co-workers and her only friend, Annie, begins to change after a younger man enters her life. Carla is introduced immediately with a shot of her putting in her hearing aids. She is an overworked and under-appreciated secretary for a construction company, ridiculed behind her back by her co-workers who do not know she is deaf but despise her homely appearance and subservient position. After she faints from exhaustion she accepts the boss's offer to hire an intern to lighten her load.

Here is a question about this article: The space-consuming analog video signal of a LaserDisc limited playback duration to 30 minutes (CAV) or 60 minutes (CLV) per side because of the hardware manufacturer's refusal to reduce line count for increased playtime. After one side was finished playing, a disc has to be flipped over in order to continue watching a movie, and some titles fill two or more discs. Many players, especially units built after the mid-1980s, can \\"flip\\" discs automatically by rotating the optical pickup to the other side of the disc, but this is accompanied by a pause in the movie during the side change. If the movie is longer than what could be stored on two sides of a single disc, manually swapping to a second disc is necessary at some point during the film. One exception to this rule is the Pioneer LD-W1, which features two disc platters. In addition, perfect still frames and random access to individual still frames is limited only to the more expensive CAV discs, which only had a playing time of approximately 30 minutes per side. In later years, Pioneer and other manufacturers overcame this limitation by incorporating a digital memory buffer, which \\"grabbed\\" a single frame from a CLV disc. What is the answer to this question: Which format allows for more playback tie per side, CLV or CAV?","completion":"The format that allows for more playback time per side is CLV, which stands for Constant Linear Velocity.

Given the background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... and the situation: An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it. Answer the following question: Which island was inhabited by more tuataras? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given background information and the situation described, we cannot definitively determine which island was inhabited by more tuataras. The information provided does not specify any details about the presence of tuataras on either Snake Island or Bird Island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Castellaneta and Oscar Micheaux, it is clear that Oscar Micheaux was the more prolific director in terms of the number of films directed. While both P. J. Castellaneta and Oscar Micheaux were filmmakers known for their contributions to cinema, their backgrounds, career timelines, and accomplishments differed significantly. P. J. Castellaneta is an American independent filmmaker who began his career in the late 1980s. He is best known for his work in the LGBTQ+ genre and has directed a handful of films such as \\"Together Alone\\" (1991), \\"Relax...It's Just Sex\\" (1998), and \\"Convenience\\" (2008). Apart from directing, Castellaneta is also involved in writing and producing some of his films. Overall, he has directed fewer than ten feature films so far in his career, which has spanned over three decades. On the other hand, Oscar Micheaux was a pioneer African American filmmaker in the early 20th century, born in 1884 and passing away in 1951. He significantly influenced Black cinema during the silent and early sound film eras, paralleling the Harlem Renaissance and the struggle for black representation. Notably, Micheaux wrote, produced, and directed the first African-American feature film, \\"The Homesteader\\" (1919). Micheaux directed over 40 films throughout his career, some of the most significant works in his filmography include \\"Within Our Gates” (1920), \\"Body and Soul\\" (1925), \\"The Exile\\" (1931), and \\"God's Step Children\\" (1938). His remarkable accomplishments were not only in the sphere of directing but also extended to the production and writing of numerous books and movies. In conclusion, while both P. J. Castellaneta and Oscar Micheaux made notable contributions to the world of cinema, Oscar Micheaux was the more prolific director in terms of the number of films directed. With over 40 films to his credit spanning across the silent, early sound, and post-production code era, Micheaux left his indelible mark and laid the foundation for future African American filmmakers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Short movie review: fast-moving and Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the provided short movie review, which describes the film as \\"fast-moving,\\" it can be inferred that the critic has a positive opinion of the movie. Fast-moving films typically have a quick pace and can be exciting to watch, keeping the audience engaged throughout the movie. This often implies that the plot is well-thought-out and the story flows smoothly from one scene to another, keeping viewers on the edge of their seats. Furthermore, such descriptions of a film suggest that the critic appreciates various aspects of the movie, such as its editing, cinematography, and storytelling. Good pacing is essential in maintaining audience interest, and a fast-moving film generally indicates that the filmmakers have effectively managed these elements, resulting in a captivating and entertaining movie. Fast-moving films usually have their own set of strengths, such as dynamic action sequences, snappy dialogue, and an energetic atmosphere. All of these aspects contribute to a thrilling movie experience that keeps viewers hooked from the beginning to the end. In that sense, the critic's description reflects a sense of enthusiasm for the film, which can be considered a positive evaluation. Although it is important to note that the provided review is brief and does not offer a comprehensive assessment of the movie, the described quality of being fast-moving points to an overall positive opinion from the critic. Ideally, a more in-depth review would provide greater insight into the critic's thoughts on the film's various components, such as its plot, character development, and visual aspects.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

We have lived in a state prone to hurricanes for eight years and didn’t really have anything ready in case of a natural disaster. Recently, we moved closer to the coast in this region which forced us to make a hurricane emergency kit. If you don’t feel like putting together your own kit, you can order one from Amazon! Here’s an affiliate link to one that’s for four people. (Four Person Perfect Survival Kit Deluxe) They have several variations to choose from. Preparing a Hurricane Emergency Kit I will walk you through a few things to consider when preparing an emergency kit. Saving Money I would be lying if I didn’t say that I was financially driven to prepare a kit. The state of Virginia has one three-day sales tax holiday weekend beginning the first Friday in August. Yes, saving on tax pushed me to buy a bunch of stuff that I just may need one day. In addition to saving taxes on emergency preparedness items, customers can save tax on clothing, footwear, school supplies, and Energy Star and WaterSense products. For complete details on qualifying items and more, please go to Virginia’s Government Tax Page. Not in Virginia? Search “your state” + “emergency preparedness” or “emergency kit.” You can replace “hurricane” with “earthquake” or “tornado” or any other applicable term for your area. Depending on how much you purchase, the saving on taxes can add up pretty quickly. Be Prepared Before Preparing Heading out on a tax-free shopping spree won’t save you much money if you’re buying items that don’t qualify for the tax-free holiday, or you buy a bunch of items you don’t actually need or won’t use.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. For a country that ditched monarchical rule, America has some of the most intriguing \\"castles\\" in the world. OK, maybe not castles in the classic sense. To visit a fortress where ancient monarchs slept on stone pillows and knights bickered about grails, you'll still have to fly across the pond. But for a different sort of castle -- the kind redefined by Gilded Age names such as Vanderbilt and Ringling, by proud Polynesian monarchs or by the occasional heartbroken Latvian-Floridian stonemason -- the United States is home to a melting pot of historic domiciles that would blow an 11th-century Scottish king's mind. Here we crown seven favorites whose gates are open to gaping plebeians. King of Cottages: The Breakers (Newport, Rhode Island) Story: In 1893 Cornelius Vanderbilt II, heir to the New York Central Railroad, commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design this palatial summer home inspired by 16th-century Genoan palazzos. The largest and grandest of Newport's famous \\"cottages\\" (colossal leisure homes erected by America's turn-of-the-century baron class), the Breakers was created in just a few years by a team of 2,500 craftsmen from around the world. Specs: Located on a 13-acre cliff-side estate overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the 70-room house covers 126,000 square feet from attic to basement to mezzanine. Standout rooms include a 22-carat gold-leaf-adorned Great Hall stretching 50 feet in every direction (including overhead) and a two-story, alabaster-columned dining room featuring enormous Baccarat crystal chandeliers and a table for 32. Stopping by: Now in the hands of the Preservation Society of Newport County, the Breakers is one of the five most-visited homes in the country. One-hour audio tours cover about 20 rooms on the first and second floors. The Breakers, 424 Bellevue Ave., Newport, Rhode Island; +1 401 847 1000; admission 19.50. Little Brother Complex: Biltmore (Asheville, North Carolina) Story: George Washington Vanderbilt II clearly had bigger ideas than simply one-upping older sibling Cornelius (of the Breakers) with this massive, 1890s French chateau plunked on the edge of North Carolina's Smoky Mountains. But when you use the same architect to dwarf your big brother's Newport fortress, there's probably some family competition etched into the blueprints. Specs: America's largest privately owned residence occupies 175,000 square feet (or more than four acres) of floor space -- with 250 rooms, 43 bathrooms, 65 fireplaces, three kitchens, an indoor swimming pool, gymnasium and a bowling alley in the basement. Estate holdings include original Renoir paintings, Napoleon's chess set, a 25,000-volume library and a pair of John Singer Sargent portraits of the Hunt and Biltmore landscape designer Frederick Law Olmsted, the man behind New York's Central Park. Stopping by: The 8,000-acre estate receives more than a million annual guests. Five specialty tours of the house include a \\"behind the scenes\\" glimpse at some of its lesser-visited areas -- including the butler's pantry and Biltmore's catacomb-like sub-basement. Private bus rides through the property are also available. Biltmore, One Lodge St., Asheville, North Carolina; +1 800 411 3812; admission varies seasonally from 44 to 69. Forlorn Fortress: Coral Castle (Miami) Story: Heartbroken 26-year-old Edward Leedskalnin would never love another woman after 16-year-old Agnes Scuffs broke off their engagement a day before their wedding. Over the next 28 years, the eccentric Latvian-American artisan would -- as a testimony to lost love, it's been said -- dedicate his life to single-handedly sculpting a massive castellated compound comprised of locally harvested coral rock. Now on the National Register of Historic Places, the place has been called \\"America's Stonehenge\\" and still leaves engineers wondering how a short, 100-pound fellow with a fourth grade education did all this using homemade hand tools and unrequited love. Spect: Within its eight-foot-high, three-foot-thick walls, Coral Castle uses approximately 1,100 tons of coral rock -- including a stone sculpture garden with Flintstones-style furniture (500-pound rocking chairs that work), a nine-ton gate that moves with ease and a home-carved Polaris telescope. Stopping by: Just north of Homestead in South Miami, the Coral Castle Museum is open every day, with audio stands that broadcast in several languages and guided tours also available. Coral Castle, 28655 South Dixie Highway, Miami; +1 305 248 6345; admission 15. Auto Heir's Opus: Edsel & Eleanor Ford House (Grosse Pointe Shores, Michigan) Story: Edsel Ford, lone son of auto titan Henry, would become president of Ford Motor Company by age 25, posing him the challenge of living up to his father's hulking legacy while setting his own bar over the next quarter century. In addition to legendary cars like the Lincoln Continental, Edsel would build an English Cotsworld-style family estate that -- for sheer style, taste and grandeur -- tops dad's Fair Lane digs in nearby Dearborn. Specs: A bold blend of classic European and modern (1930s) styles, the 60-room, 20,000-square-foot house designed by famed architect Albert Kahn is set on 87 lakefront acres in the heart of southeast Michigan's Gold Coast. An extensive collection of art, period furniture and antiquities includes two Cezanne oil paintings, an original Diego Rivera and stained-glass window medallions dating to the 14th century. Stopping by: Standard 50-minute guided tours explore the home's major rooms, including the English-baronial-style gallery and a contrasting art deco room done by eminent industrial designer Walter Dorwin Teague. Behind-the-scenes and special interest tours delve deeper into the property and its stunning grounds. Edsel & Eleanor Ford House, 1100 Lake Shore Road, Grosse Pointe Shores, MI; +1 313 884 4222; admission to all areas 15. California Headliner: Hearst Castle (San Simeon, California) Story: Hearst Castle's predecessor was Camp Hill, a tract of ranchland on the central California coast acquired by 19th-century mining magnate George Hearst for family campouts. After inheriting the property in 1919, George's son -- newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst -- reportedly told noted architect Julia Morgan, \\"We're tired of camping out in the open ... I would like to build a little something.\\" Specs: More than 28 years and 80,000 square feet later, the estate boasted the 115-room Casa Grande and three Mediterranean Revival-style guesthouses, with 27 acres of gardens. Borrowing from just about every classic European style, castle highlights include the spectacular Neptune pool, an indescribably ornate main library (one of two on the property), Mr. Hearst's private Gothic suite and one of the world's most extensive (and manically collected) stashes of art and artifacts. Stopping by: Now a California State Park, the property offers four separate tours covering various floors of Casa Grande and the areas of the estate. A special Evening Tour (spring and fall only) lets visitors experience the mansion at twilight while docents play out the roles of 1930s houseguests and staff. Hearst Castle, 750 Hearst Castle Road, San Simeon, California; +1 800 444 4445; admissions start at 25. Greatest Showpiece on Earth: Ca' d'Zan (Sarasota, Florida) Story: Inspired by their favorite Tuscan villas and Venetian palaces, circus tycoon John Ringling and his wife, Mable, built a 1920s Mediterranean Revival-style dream home that would become known as \\"the last of the Gilded Age mansions\\" -- and the best place for a Gatsby-style party in southwest Florida. Falling into state hands (and some neglect) after Ringling's death in 1936, the huge waterfront mansion overlooking Sarasota Bay entered its second heyday with a recent 15 million restoration effort. Specs: The 36,000-square-foot, five-story (plus full basement) property totals 56 rooms, including 15 bathrooms. It's adorned with Gothic arches, Mexican onyx columns, priceless 17th-century tapestries and a custom-made 1892 Steinway piano in the two-story great court, dolloped with an 81-foot Belvedere tower. Stopping by: Docent-led tours of the mansion's main living space and a special Private Places tour through less frequented areas run daily. After the house tour, you can see the estate's famous art museum, which houses one of the nation's finest collections of 17-century Baroque works. Ca' d'Zan, 5401 Bay Shore Road, Sarasota, Florida; +1 941 359 5700; admission 25. Royal Relic: 'Iolani Palace (Honolulu) Story: The only former official residence of a reigning monarch on U.S. soil, 'Iolani Palace was Hawaii's grandest symbol when it was completed in 1882. Occupied by Hawaii's last two monarchs before American annexation, the palace would subsequently be used as a Red Cross dressing station and the state's first capitol building. Today, the National Historic Landmark is a museum open to the public. Specs: Filled with imported furnishings, royal gifts and art from around the world, the 34,104-square-foot royal abode featured late-19th-century technological luxuries like electric lighting (installed in 1887, four years before the White House) and telephones. Highlights include the Grand Hall, lined with portraits of Hawaiian monarchs, the crimson-gold Throne Rome where King Kalakaua hosted grand balls and state dinners, and the Blue Room, which features a giant portrait of King Louis Philippe of France received in 1848. Stopping by: Docent-led and guided audio tours let guests explore 'Iolani Palace's first and second floors. Guests can peruse Hawaiian regalia exhibits in the basement gallery and explore the spacious grounds, which include the old royal barracks and Coronation Pavilion where Kalakaua was crowned king in 1883.

Slavoj Zizek ( ( listen) SLAH-voy ZHIZH-ek; Slovene: ['slavoj 'ZiZek]; born 21 March 1949) is a Slovenian continental philosopher. He is a senior researcher at the Institute for Sociology and Philosophy at the University of Ljubljana, Global Distinguished Professor of German at New York University, and international director of the Birkbeck Institute for the Humanities of the University of London. He works in subjects including continental philosophy, political theory, cultural studies, psychoanalysis, film criticism, Marxism, Hegelianism and theology. In 1989, Zizek published his first English text, The Sublime Object of Ideology, in which he departed from traditional Marxist theory to develop a materialist conception of ideology that drew heavily on Lacanian psychoanalysis and Hegelian idealism. Zizek argues: The state is a system of regulatory institutions that shape our behavior. Its power is purely symbolic and has no normative force outside of collective behavior. In this way, the term the law signifies society's basic principles, which enable interaction by prohibiting certain acts. Political decisions have become depoliticized and accepted as natural conclusions. For example, controversial policy decisions (such as reductions in social welfare spending) are presented as apparently \\"objective\\" necessities. Although governments make claims about increased citizen participation and democracy, the important decisions are still made in the interests of capital. The two-party system dominant in the United States and elsewhere produces a similar illusion. It is still necessary to engage in particular conflicts - such as labor disputes - but the trick is to relate these individual events to the larger struggle. Particular demands, if executed well, might serve as metaphorical condensation for the system and its injustices. The real political conflict is between an ordered structure of society and those without a place in it. In stark contrast to the intellectual tenets of the European \\"universalist Left\\" in general, and those Jurgen Habermas defined as postnational in particular, pro-sovereignty and pro-independence processes opened in Europe are good. The postmodern subject is cynical toward official institutions, yet at the same time believes in conspiracies. When we lost our shared belief in a single power, we constructed another of the Other in order to escape the unbearable freedom that we faced. It is not enough to merely know that you are being lied to, particularly when continuing to live a normal life under capitalism. For example, that despite people being aware of ideology, they may continue to act as automata, mistakenly believing that they are thereby expressing their radical freedom. Although one may possess a self-awareness, just because one understands what one is doing does not mean that one is doing the right thing. Religion is not an enemy but rather one of the fields of struggle. Atheism is good. Religious fundamentalists are, in a way, no different from \\"godless Stalinist Communists.\\" They both value divine will and salvation over moral or ethical action.

Article: Most recently, Jerome Corsi, a conservative author and friend of the former Trump campaign aide Roger J. Stone Jr., said Mr. Mueller’s team is pressuring him to plead guilty to lying to them about his communications with Mr. Stone about WikiLeaks. Investigators are looking for links between the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks, which distributed emails and other documents that Russian agents stole from Democratic computers before the 2016 election. Mr. Corsi said on Monday that he refused the plea deal because he did not deliberately mislead investigators, but merely forgot about an email chain from two and a half years ago. In his most recent criticism of the special counsel, Mr. Trump has suggested that prosecutors are frustrated because they cannot produce any evidence against his campaign. “The inner workings of the Mueller investigation are a total mess,” he wrote on Twitter recently. “They have found no collusion and have gone absolutely nuts. They are screaming and shouting at people, horribly threatening them to come up with the answers they want,” he declared. “They are a disgrace to our Nation and don’t care how many lives” they ruin. Mr. Trump’s lawyers responded last week to questions Mr. Mueller had for the president about ties between his campaign and Russia. Among the questions were inquiries about what Mr. Trump knew about Russian offers to Mr. Manafort during the campaign to assist Mr. Trump’s presidential run. The president’s lawyers have declined to discuss what he told Mr. Mueller, and it is not clear whether any of his answers conflicted with what Mr. Manafort told investigators. Mr. Manafort’s allies have hoped that his sessions with the special counsel would end soon so he could be sentenced and transferred to a federal prison, where conditions are comparatively better than in a local jail. At a recent court hearing in Alexandria, Mr. Manafort came into the courtroom in a wheelchair, his foot wrapped in a white bandage, possibly from an attack of gout. But few of Mr. Manafort’s friends predicted that his sentencing would be hastened by prosecutors declaring him to be a liar. The development stunned some people close to the White House, as well as legal experts. “Everybody who lies to Mueller gets called on it — so he had to know that Mueller would catch him. So the question is: What was he hiding that is worse than going to jail for the rest of your life?” said Joyce Vance, a professor of law at the University of Alabama law school and former federal prosecutor. “There are often rocky dealings with a cooperator, and Mueller didn’t cut bait at the first sign of trouble. It was likely more than one lie and this would not have been a minor detail — it had to be something material and significant and intentional.” ||||| FILE - In this May 23, 2018, file photo, Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, leaves the Federal District Court after a hearing, in Washington.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this May 23, 2018, file photo, Paul Manafort, President Donald Trump's former campaign chairman, leaves the Federal District Court after a hearing, in Washington. Special counsel Robert Mueller... (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The special counsel in the Russia investigation is accusing former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of violating his plea agreement by repeatedly lying to federal investigators, an extraordinary allegation that could expose him to a lengthier prison sentence — and potentially more criminal charges. The torpedoing of Manafort's plea deal, disclosed in a court filing Monday, also results in special counsel Robert Mueller's team losing a cooperating witness from the top of Donald Trump's presidential campaign who was present for several key episodes under investigation. That includes a Trump Tower meeting involving Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer he was told had derogatory information on Democrat Hillary Clinton. The move signals a return to the acrimonious relationship Manafort has had with the special counsel's office since his indictment last year. Before his plea agreement, Manafort aggressively challenged the special counsel's legitimacy in court, went through a bitter trial and landed himself in jail after prosecutors discovered he had attempted to tamper with witnesses in his case. In the latest filing, Mueller's team said Manafort \\"committed federal crimes\\" by lying about \\"a variety of subject matters\\" even after he agreed to truthfully cooperate with the investigation. Prosecutors said they will detail the \\"nature of the defendant's crimes and lies\\" in writing at a later date to the judge. Through his attorneys, Manafort denied lying, saying he \\"believes he provided truthful information\\" during a series of sessions with Mueller's investigators. He also disagreed that he breached his plea agreement. Still, both sides now agree they can't resolve the conflict, and U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson should set a date to sentence him. Manafort, who remains jailed, had been meeting with the special counsel's office since he pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy against the United States and conspiracy to obstruct justice. He cut that deal to head off a second trial after being convicted last summer of eight felony counts related to millions of dollars he hid from the IRS in offshore accounts. Both cases stemmed from his Ukrainian political work and undisclosed lobbying work he admitted to carrying out in the U.S. in violation of federal law. As part of his plea agreement, Manafort pledged to \\"cooperate fully, truthfully, completely, and forthrightly\\" with the government \\"in any and all matters\\" prosecutors deemed necessary. That included his work on the Trump campaign as well as his Ukrainian political work, which remains under investigation by the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York. Prosecutors there are looking into the conduct of longtime Democratic lobbyist Tony Podesta, former Obama White House counsel Greg Craig and former Republican congressman and lobbyist Vin Weber to determine whether they violated federal law by failing to register as foreign agents with the Justice Department. None of the men has been charged with any crimes. As part of his plea deal, Manafort also forfeited many of his rights as well as his ability to withdraw the plea if he broke any of the terms. In return, prosecutors agreed to not bring additional charges against him and to ask a judge for a reduction of his sentence if he provided \\"substantial assistance.\\" But with prosecutors saying he breached the agreement, Manafort now faces serious repercussions such as the possibility of prosecution on additional charges including the 10 felony counts prosecutors dropped when he made the deal. Manafort already faces up to five years in prison on the two charges in his plea agreement. In his separate Virginia case, Manafort's potential sentencing under federal guidelines has not yet been calculated, but prosecutors have previously said he could face as much as 10 years in prison on those charges. He is scheduled to be sentenced in that case in February. His co-defendant, Rick Gates, who spent a longer time on the campaign and worked on the Trump inaugural committee, has not had a sentencing date set yet. He continues to cooperate with Mueller. ___ Follow Chad Day on Twitter: https://twitter.com/ChadSDay ___ Read the court filing: http://apne.ws/YN2AwkK |||||Summary:","completion":"Special counsel Robert Mueller's team is accusing Paul Manafort, former Trump campaign chairman, of repeatedly lying to federal investigators in violation of his plea agreement.

The promotional stunt for the Zinger sandwich comes two months after the fast food chain unveiled Rob Lowe playing Kentucky Fried Chicken founder Col. Harland Sanders in a space suit as part of an ad campaign, the AP reports. The ads promised to send the breaded chicken sandwich into space. KFC is partnering with balloon maker World View on the project. The chain says the launch window opens June 21 for what it says is the longest controlled stratospheric balloon flight with a commercial payload in history. The sandwich will return to earth and bring back telemetry data. News.com.au notes that the unofficial NASA Watch group has zinged KFC over the stunt, pointing out that the balloon is only going up 80,000 feet, about a quarter of the way to the Karman Line where space is generally considered to begin. That means the sandwich \\"is not going anywhere near 'space,'\\" NASA Watch tweeted.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. Surprised, Mallory and Barnsby improvise an excuse, \\"admitting\\" they buried the samples. Schroeder...

Given the question: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective.

Article: Norah had a cottage on a cliff above a big bay. In winter it could be very unpleasant because of strong winds and sea waves. In fact, when a _ was blowing, Norah and her husband got used to sleeping in a small room downstairs, because their bedroom upstairs, which faced the gales, had a very big window, and they were afraid that an extra violent wind might break it and blow pieces of broken glass over them. Also, the salt wave from the sea put an end to many of the colorful plants Norah planted in her garden. She tried putting up a fence to protect them, but the wind just hit it, went up over the top and then down the other side, so in the end she filled the garden with trees and bushes that liked salt. But most of the summer Norah enjoyed her cottage and garden very much. At weekends she could sit out-of-doors in the sun, looking at the beautiful view, with interesting ships and boats passing by, and she could very easily cycle down to the sea for a swim. Now, Norah and her husband had plenty of friends and relations. In the summer lots of them used to come to enjoy the beautiful place, and in the end it really became quite annoying for the couple. When they were at home, they found friends and relations arriving, expecting to be given unlimited drinks and meals, and to sit in the sun for hours, talking as if Norah and her husband had nothing else to do but entertain and listen to them.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014.

Although there have always been deaf individuals in America, the history really begins in 1817. Before 1817 deaf people communicated by using \\"home signs\\". Gestures were individually created and used within the home for simple communication. There were no schools or formal sign language training for the deaf. So, why was 1817 an important date? Well, the story begins with Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet. Gallaudet met his neighbor's daughter Alice Cogswell. Alice was the young deaf daughter of Dr. Mason Cogswell from Hartford, Connecticut. Gallaudet began teaching Alice to read and write a few simple words. Excited by the success Dr. Cogswell encouraged Gallaudet to establish a school for the deaf. Cogswell raised the money and Gallaudet traveled to Britain to learn the methods used there. However, the schools refused to share their instructional techniques and methods. While in London, there happened to be a demonstration of the French method of deaf education. Britain was using an oral method of instruction; however, the French method used signs. Gallaudet was fascinated with the method and was able to meet with the instructor, Sicard, and his two deaf pupils, Jean Massieu and Laurent Clerc. Sicard agreed to teach Gallaudet his method and Gallaudet went to Paris to learn French signs. After a while, Gallaudet wished to return home and convinced Clerc to go with him and help him establish the school. The trip home was a 52-day voyage during which Clerc taught Gallaudet French signs and Gallaudet taught Clerc English. On April 15, 1817, Laurent Clerc and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet established what is currently known as the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. The opening of the first school for the deaf can be viewed as one of the most important events in current deaf culture. Question: What is the text mainly about? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The text is mainly about the establishment of the American Sign Language and its historical background, particularly focusing on the pivotal year of 1817. The story revolves around Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet and his encounter with Alice Cogswell, a young deaf girl. This interaction led to the initiation of establishing a school for the deaf in America. The text illustrates the challenges Gallaudet faced in obtaining instructions in necessary methods for educating deaf individuals, and his eventual fascination with the French method of sign language taught by Sicard. The narrative unfolds as Gallaudet learns French signs and brings Laurent Clerc back to America to co-found the American School for the Deaf in Hartford, Connecticut. This monumental event marked the beginning of formalized deaf education and laid the foundation of modern deaf culture and American Sign Language as we know it today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Similar claims were made in February last year when government forces finally overran the rebel-held quarter of Baba Amr in Homs. That turned out not to be the seminal victory the regime had hoped for, although, as with Qusair, both sides had invested the battle there with huge political and symbolic significance. The fall of Qusair town had become more or less a formality after government forces and their Hezbollah allies won control of most of the surrounding countryside. In the end, rebel fighters recognised their situation as untenable and withdrew on Tuesday night, apparently under an informal understanding that they would be allowed safe passage. That enabled army troops and Hezbollah to advance into the town unopposed the following morning. Whether the government victory at Qusair will prove to be a real turning point will depend on the wider ebb and flow of the struggle for control of the country. But in immediate terms, it is clearly a major blow to the rebels, denying them easy use of an important supply route from friendly, Sunni-populated enclaves in north-east Lebanon to Homs and central Syria. From Hezbollah's point of view, it gives the Shia movement an easier connection between Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley, where Hezbollah holds sway, and the major Syrian cities, as well as the Alawite coastal heartland to the north-west, which could prove vital if Syria eventually heads towards fragmentation. The move at Qusair was part of a broader regime campaign to sever cross-border supply routes that has scored some success in the south and north as well. Combined with an aggressive campaign to regain control of the suburbs around Damascus, all this has meant that the threat of a rebel assault on the centre of the capital, which seemed imminent towards the end of last year, has been staved off, at least for the time being. But diplomats believe these gains could not have been made without help from Hezbollah, not just at Qusair but also around Damascus, where Iraqi Shia militias have also been playing a role. The assumption is that Hezbollah will continue its spearheading role in other areas, perhaps Homs and Aleppo. But its resources and manpower are not infinite, and unless there is a wholesale collapse of rebel morale and capabilities, it is hard to imagine regime and allied forces rapidly reconquering the whole country, as government officials have pledged. But the Qusair affair has highlighted not just the fragmented nature of the rebel fighters on the ground, but also the total disarray of the Istanbul-based political opposition. While that contrasts with the regime's singleness of purpose, there is a similarly glaring discrepancy between the focused commitment Damascus has been able to count on from its key allies, Russia, Iran and Hezbollah, and the discordant, hesitant and ineffective backing provided to the opposition by its motley array of regional and Western supporters. If an international peace conference does indeed emerge from the American and Russian proposal, Qusair leaves the opposition in disastrous shape in terms of confronting a tough, cohesive regime team.","completion":"The government's victory in Qusair dealt a major blow to rebels by denying them access to crucial supply routes and highlighting the fragmented nature of their forces, while also showcasing the importance of Hezbollah's support to the regime's efforts in the ongoing struggle for control in Syria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These all work seamlessly together, providing a user experience that some find worth paying a premium for. 2. **Operating System**: The macOS, in comparison to other operating systems, is known for being lean, intuitive, and user-friendly. It also works perfectly with the hardware since both are crafted by Apple. This integration helps to increase general system performance and make all operations smooth and efficient. 3. **Customer Service and Support**: Apple’s customer service is often seen as superior to that of other brands. From their physical retail stores to their online support, Apple's renowned customer care is another facet of the brand that users often take into account when deciding whether to make the investment. 4. **Design and Aesthetic Appeal**: Apple's products, including the MacBook Pro, are well-known for their sleek and modern designs. To many users, the aesthetic appeal and the build quality of the aluminum body are worth the premium price. 5. **Longevity and Resale Value**: MacBooks in general have a reputation for longer-lasting performance. While it's true that the initial cost is quite high compared to PCs with similar specs, many users view it as a long-term investment. Furthermore, MacBooks retain their value quite well over time. Even after a few years, you can still get a decent amount of money if you decide to sell your machine. 6. **Software Integration**: Many professionals, particularly in the creative industries, rely heavily on certain Mac-specific software. Whether it's for photo editing, music production, or video editing, some applications simply run better (or exclusively) on macOS. 7. **Security**: Macs are not immune to malware, but they are less susceptible to viruses than PCs. This is due to a variety of reasons, including Apple's more stringent app review process, a smaller target market, and built-in security features in macOS that make it harder for malicious software to wreak havoc. While there are computers available with comparable or even superior technical specs at a lower price, what customers are really paying for with a MacBook Pro is often more than just the sum of its technological parts. It's also the intangibles: the operating system, the customer service, the design, the brand, the ecosystem, the relatively high resale value, and yes - to some extent - the prestige of owning a premium product. However, whether it's 'worth it' is subjective and depends entirely on the user's personal requirements and preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She mentions the \\"39 Steps\\", but does not explain its meaning. Later that night Smith, fatally stabbed, bursts into Hannay's bedroom and warns him to flee. He finds a map of the Scottish Highlands clutched in her hand, showing the area around Killin, with a house or farm named \\"Alt-na-Shellach\\" circled. He sneaks out of the watched flat disguised as a milkman and boards the Flying Scotsman express train to Scotland. He learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt for Smith's murderer. When he sees the police searching the train, he enters a compartment and kisses the sole occupant, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), in a desperate attempt to escape detection. She frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen, who stop the train on the Forth Bridge. Hannay escapes, however. He walks toward Alt-na-Shellach, staying the night in the house of a poor crofter (John Laurie) and his much younger wife (Peggy Ashcroft). Early the next morning, she sees a police car approaching and warns Hannay. Hannay flees, wearing the crofter's coat. At a bridge, he finds a sign for Alt-na-Shellach. He arrives at the house of the seemingly respectable Professor Jordan (Godfrey Tearle) and is let in after saying he has been sent by Annabella Smith.

One March morning, Susan sees Alex off to school, which is only two blocks away. Alex turns to wave to his mother, then disappears around the corner. Susan returns home after work, and becomes increasingly alarmed when Alex is late. She calls her friend and neighbor Jocelyn Norris, whose daughter is a classmate of Alex's, and learns Alex never went to school. She immediately calls the New York City Police Department, and officers descend on the townhouse, led by Lieutenant Al Menetti. Susan is questioned closely on all aspects of her life and her son's, and initially suspect her estranged husband, Graham, a professor at New York University, but he produces an alibi. Susan's case generates attention from the local media, and citizens help in the search by distributing posters. Susan is initially criticized for allowing her son to walk to school by himself. Susan takes a polygraph test that clears her as a suspect. Numerous leads are checked out, including several reports that Alex may have been seen in the back seat of a blue 1965 Chevy. A psychic is also called in, but each lead fizzles. The investigation drags on, and Graham is at odds with Menetti after budget cuts force Menetti to dismantle the command center in Susan's apartment and run the case from the precinct. Menetti's attention is soon diverted to other cases, but the Selky case is always a priority. At one point, Graham takes matters into his own hands after he receives a ransom call. Given a beating, he requires a hospital stay. A break in the case finally happens on the Fourth of July, when Susan's housecleaner, Philippe, is arrested as a suspect.

In the first quarter, Carolina pounced first as RB DeAngelo Williams got a 1-yard TD run. In the second quarter, the Packers responded with kicker Mason Crosby getting a 32-yard field goal. The Panthers would answer with QB Jake Delhomme getting a 1-yard TD run. Green Bay replied with QB Aaron Rodgers completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Donald Driver, yet Carolina ended the half with Williams getting another 1-yard TD run.

In the fourth quarter, Green Bay took the lead as Rodgers hooked up with Jennings on a 21-yard TD pass, yet the Panthers answered with Williams getting his third 1-yard TD run. The Packers would retake the lead as Crosby nailed a 19-yard field goal, yet Carolina sealed the victory with Williams getting his fourth 1-yard TD run (setting the single-game franchise record for the most rushing touchdowns). How many more yards of field goals did Crosby score in the second half than the first half?","completion":"To determine how many more yards of field goals Crosby scored in the second half than the first half, we need to identify the field goals made by Crosby in each half and calculate the difference in yards.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Start saving quarters for the giant 'Flappy Bird' arcade game The only thing better than playing Flappy Bird on your iPhone 6 is playing the same thing on a giant display. At least, that's the thinking of arcade company Bay Tek Games, which is introducing the first coin-operated Flappy Bird arcade cabinet. First spotted by Engadget, the 300-pound, 91-inch-tall arcade cabinet features a 42-inch portrait screen and a big red button, which players use to keep the Flappy Bird aloft. The coin-operated game will spit out tickets, the number depending on how far you get. It will collect daily high scores and all-time high scores. This is both a natural and somewhat surprising conclusion to the Flappy Bird saga. In the space of a year, the incredibly basic and highly addictive iOS game went from obscurity to massive success to self-immolation. Vietnamese developer Dong Nguyen said he was so overwhelmed (and maybe unnerved) by the unprecedented success of his game that he decided to pull it from the App Store. Since then, Nguyen has emerged from hiding and introduced another similar game called Swing Copters, and Flappy Bird arrived on a new platform: Amazon Fire TV. A healthy number of Flappy Bird clones also cropped up. Now, however, you can play the real thing on a really large screen. In the arcade game, the object of the game remains unchanged: You control a tiny bird, which flies forward on its own, by tapping the big red button to navigate it through a series of pipes. Hit a pipe and start all over again. It sounds simple, but Flappy Bird was actually designed so that only the most patient players can master it. Bay Tek Games states on its website that this is a \\"licensed\\" game and the trademarks were used with permission; the arcade cabinet has Nguyen's company name \\"Gears\\" on the Flappy Bird sign, which sits above the giant screen. It's an indication that Nguyen gave his okay, but Mashable has contacted him for confirmation. Bay Tek doesn't list a price for the Flappy Bird arcade cabinet. Have something to add to this story?

However, it seemed that Boaz Yakin's sole purpose in making this film was Orthodox-bashing. With our wigs, modest attire, and separate seating, we're a pretty easy target already. Yakin never made it past the surface. The result is a film with more holes than Swiss cheese: 1. Yosi tells Sonia off for loving him more than G-d or their parents. Then he deliberately defies his father's order that he not go swimming because of his poor health. 2. Sonia flips out at her son's bris. Why would a Hasidic woman from Monsey have such a strong reaction? It's hard to believe that she never attended one before. Let's face it, even Reform Jews hold bris milah ceremonies nowadays. 3. Was Mendel sleeping during his chosson classes? He's supposed to satisfy his wife's passions in bed and refrain from kissing her in the street. Especially in the middle of the busiest street in Boro Park! 4. Sonia and Mendel had to have been married for over a year, and he just now noticed that they were not meant for each other? A little clue--arranged marriage does not mean that the girl has to take the first guy her parents set her up with. Nor will she be shunned by the community if the marriage doesn't work out. 5. If Sonia really wanted to get into the jewelry business that badly, she did not have to go through her lecherous brother-in-law. There are Orthodox female doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. Sonia came off as more whiny than sympathetic. Instead of taking control of her life, she sat back and waited for things to happen, and then complained that she didn't like the outcome. That's not standing up to one's environment; that's pandering to stereotype. Frankly, I think she got what she deserved. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review is predominantly negative. The reviewer points out several inconsistencies and issues they found with the film, accusing the filmmaker of Orthodox-bashing and perpetuating stereotypes.

Choices: - furan - sulfide - phosphate - benzene A: Answer:","completion":"The smallest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene. Benzene (C6H6) is the smallest and most fundamental aromatic hydrocarbon, comprised of a six-carbon ring with three double bonds and six hydrogen atoms. The carbon atoms in benzene are sp2 hybridized, creating a planar structure with bond angles of approximately 120° around each carbon atom. The double bonds in benzene are delocalized, which means that the electrons forming the double bonds are shared evenly between all six carbon atoms in the ring. The result of this delocalization is that the molecule becomes extremely stable and exhibits a unique set of characteristics that define aromaticity. This special stability is due to the molecule's resonance energy, which makes it more stable than if the double bonds were localized. This resonance is represented by resonance structures, alternating single and double bonds in the ring. Aromaticity refers to the exceptional stability and unique chemical properties of certain compounds with cyclic, planar, and conjugated (alternating single and double bonds) structures. The most famous aromatic compounds are those containing benzene rings, but other molecules, such as furans and thiophenes, can also be considered aromatic. However, these latter compounds are heterocyclic aromatic compounds, as they contain at least one heteroatom (an atom other than carbon) within their ring structure. Sulfides and phosphates are not considered aromatic hydrocarbons, as they do not possess the necessary characteristics of aromatic molecules. In summary, the smallest aromatic hydrocarbon is benzene, a simple yet highly stable and influential molecule in the realm of organic chemistry. Its unique structure and properties have given rise to a vast array of aromatic derivatives, which play crucial roles in industries ranging from petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals to polymers and dyes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After reading reviews here I see, in retrospect, that going out and buying something cute and small with out sound advice is Stooopid! This player started malfunctioning 4 months into our relationship together. First, tracks would repeat themselves on the shuffle mode, then whole cds wouldn't play on \\"All cd shuffle\\" mode. This is the second time the tray has refused to open. I'm afraid I didn't notice the hiss because I often sing along, but I'm sure it's there. I'll take all of your words for it.I'm putting the panels back on and depositing this player at the nearest Goodwill.

Answer:","completion":"The given product review would significantly decrease the chances of me buying the product. It is clear from the reviewer's experience that they have encountered multiple problems with the product that have led to immense dissatisfaction. Here are some of the noteworthy issues and reasons that contribute to this decision: 1. Tray Malfunction: The reviewer mentioned that the CD tray would not open, leaving two CDs stuck inside the player. This is an evident indication of a functional issue with the product, which could potentially lead to the same or similar problems for me if I bought the product. 2. Performance Inconsistencies: The reviewer faced issues with the CD player's functionalities, such as tracks repeating themselves in shuffle mode and whole CDs not playing in the \\"All CDs shuffle\\" mode. Performance inconsistencies in a product are often frustrating for the user, and I would prefer not to experience such issues. 3. Deteriorating Experience within a short period: The stated problems began to emerge just four months into the reviewer's time with the product. This raises concerns about the product's reliability and durability. As a consumer, I would expect the product I buy to function smoothly without encountering major issues during initial usage. 4. Potential Hissing Sound: Although the reviewer is unsure about the hissing sound mentioned in other reviews, it is an aspect that deserves consideration, especially if multiple users have observed it. This could be an indication of the product's subpar audio quality, which is an essential factor when selecting a CD player. 5. Overall Negative User Experience: The reviewer's ultimate decision to donate the player to Goodwill signifies extreme dissatisfaction with the product. This not only reflects how the product has failed to meet their expectations but also assures that the user would not recommend it to anyone else. Considering all these factors, the chances of me purchasing the product are significantly decreased due to the multiple concerns and issues mentioned in this review.

When I saw the Broadway version of the musical, the audience roared at Timon's even more exaggerated gay mannerisms. Hypothesis: The Broadway audience didn't appreciate Timon's gay mannerisms in the musical. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the premise and hypothesis. Premise: The audience roared at Timon's even more exaggerated gay mannerisms in the Broadway musical. Hypothesis: The Broadway audience didn't appreciate Timon's gay mannerisms in the musical. Step 2: Determine the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. In this case, the premise describes the audience's reaction to Timon's exaggerated gay mannerisms, stating that they roared (which generally implies laughter or positive response). The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that the audience didn't appreciate these mannerisms. Step 3: Compare the premise and hypothesis to determine if one follows from the other. Given that the audience's roaring reaction generally implies a positive response, this directly contradicts the hypothesis's claim that the audience didn't appreciate the mannerisms. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise, as the premise states a positive reaction from the Broadway audience, while the hypothesis suggests a negative reaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Sandy is running around the house doing laps. The faster she runs, the amount of energy she has is more or less? Paragraph : Faster-moving water has more energy. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can draw a parallel between the faster-moving water and Sandy running around the house. The paragraph states that faster-moving water has more energy. Using this concept, we can infer that the faster Sandy runs, the more energy she has. As Sandy increases her speed, she is exerting greater force against air resistance and requires more energy to maintain her faster pace. This relationship between speed and energy can be illustrated through the concept of kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. Kinetic energy can be calculated using the formula: Kinetic Energy (KE) = 0.5 * mass * (velocity^2) In this formula, the mass refers to Sandy's body weight and the velocity represents her running speed. As Sandy's velocity increases, her kinetic energy also increases since velocity is squared in the formula. This demonstrates a direct relationship between her running speed and the amount of energy she possesses. In conclusion, based on the provided paragraph and the concept of kinetic energy, we can determine that the faster Sandy runs around the house doing laps, the more energy she has."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Ross of Mull (Scottish Gaelic: \\"An Ros Mhuileach\\") is the largest peninsula of the island of Mull, about long, and makes up the south-western part of the island. It is bounded to the north by Loch Scridain and to the south by the Firth of Lorne. The main villages are Bunessan and Fionnphort, with smaller settlements including Ardtun, Camas, Carsaig, Knockan, Pennyghael and Uisken. Knocknafenaig, Suidhe, and Shiaba are three of the many cleared settlements on the Ross. - Fionnphort ( English pronunciation : / fnfrt / , Scottish Gaelic pronunciation : ( fjunafrt ) ) is the principal port of the Ross of Mull , and the second largest settlement in the area ( its population is approximately 80 ) .

Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role. - Bunessan is a small village on the Ross of Mull in the south-west of the island of Mull, off the west coast of Scotland. The settlement is within the parish of Kilfinichen and Kilvickeon, and is situated on the A849. - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - Saint Columba ('church dove'; 7 December 521 9 June 597) was an Irish abbot and missionary credited with spreading Christianity in what is today Scotland at the start of the Hiberno-Scottish mission. He founded the important abbey on Iona, which became a dominant religious and political institution in the region for centuries. He is the Patron Saint of Derry. He was highly regarded by both the Gaels of Dál Riata and the Picts, and is remembered today as a Christian saint and one of the Twelve Apostles of Ireland. - Iona is a small island in the Inner Hebrides off the Ross of Mull on the western coast of Scotland. It was a centre of Gaelic monasticism for four centuries and is today renowned for its tranquility and natural beauty. It is a popular tourist destination and a place for retreats.

To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi. Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. The answer is:","completion":"Scenario D, which uses the unit psi (pounds per square inch), would most likely be used in the everyday world. While both Pascals (Scenario A) and psi (Scenario D) are units of pressure, psi is more commonly used in everyday applications, particularly in countries that utilize the United States customary (USC) or imperial systems of measurement. Pascals serve as the SI (International System of Units) for measuring pressure, but they are predominantly used in scientific and engineering contexts. In everyday situations, people often encounter psi when dealing with air pressure in tires, hydraulic systems, or gas cylinders. For example, tire pressure is generally measured in psi, with recommended values typically ranging from 30 to 35 psi depending on the vehicle and load. This makes psi a more relatable and familiar unit for many people, especially outside of academic or scientific settings. In contrast, Pascals, while useful in providing uniformity and precision for scientific measurements and calculations, are not as widely recognized or utilized by the general public. Their use might be more prevalent in certain professional fields and, as mentioned earlier, within the context of specific scientific and engineering research. The other units mentioned, such as atmospheres (atm) and torr (millimeters mercury), also have their respective applications but are not as commonly encountered in day-to-day life for most people compared to psi. Atm can be found in some meteorology and chemistry applications, while torr is primarily used in vacuum-related applications. To summarize, Scenario D, which gives pressure in psi, would most likely be used in the everyday world due to its prevalence in commonly encountered situations such as tire pressure and other pressure-related applications. This makes psi a more familiar and relatable unit to a wider audience compared to the other pressure units mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Fogging up of a surface involves the change of water vapor (gas) to water droplets (liquid). 3. This change from gas to liquid is due to the cooling of water vapor and its subsequent condensation. 4. Based on the description of the process, the correct answer is d. condensation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review title: Good, but hard to clean Product review: I love the concept of this chair, and my 11 month old son adores it. It would be great for once in awhile use, but it is so difficult to clean with everyday use.The puffy cover comes off and you could clean that, but the rest of it does not. The cloth arms get so messy, and food gets caught in the crevices. I wipe it out after every meal, and hose it in my sink every couple of days, but it doesn't keep it clean. If you could remove the cloth to clean it would be fabulous. I plan on looking for another seat that is simliar, but easier to wipe down. On positive side, it is easy to hook up, the seatbelt is a 5 point harness so the child stays in securely, and it adjusts to a variety of table widths. A:","completion":"The given review could decrease the chances of you buying the product, due to the following points raised: 1. Difficulty in cleaning: The reviewer highlights that the chair is hard to clean with everyday use. The cloth arms get messy, and food gets caught in the crevices, making cleaning a challenge. 2. Non-removable parts: The reviewer mentions that while the puffy cover is removable, the rest of the cloth cannot be removed for cleaning. This limits the options to maintain the chair's cleanliness effectively. However, it is essential to note some positive factors that the reviewer also mentioned: 1. Ease of use: The chair is easy to hook up and has a 5-point harness for the child's safety. 2. Adjustable: The chair can adapt to a variety of table widths, offering flexibility. In conclusion, while the review highlights some benefits, the difficulty in cleaning and maintaining the chair might be a crucial factor to consider before purchasing, potentially decreasing the chances of buying the product.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the lead single from the 10th album of the band that were content to work without deadlines? , can you please find it? Following the mixed success of their musical pursuits in the 1990s, U2 sought to simplify their sound; the Edge said that with Pop, the group had \\"taken the deconstruction of the rock 'n' roll band format to its absolute 'nth degree\\". For their tenth album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, the group wanted to return to their old recording ethos of \\"the band in a room playing together\\". Reuniting with Eno and Lanois, U2 began working on the album in late 1998. After their experiences with being pressured to complete Pop, the band were content to work without deadlines. With Bono's schedule limited by his commitments to debt relief for Jubilee 2000 and the other band members spending time with their families, the recording sessions stretched through August 2000.Released in October of that year, All That You Can't Leave Behind was seen by critics as a \\"back to basics\\" album, on which the group returned to a more mainstream, conventional rock sound. For many of those not won over by the band's forays into dance music, it was considered a return to grace; Rolling Stone called it U2's \\"third masterpiece\\" alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. The album debuted at number one in 32 countries and sold 12 million copies. Its lead single, \\"Beautiful Day\\", was a worldwide hit, reaching number one in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada, while peaking at number 21 in the US. The song earned Grammy Awards for Song of the Year, Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and Record of the Year. At the awards ceremony, Bono declared that U2 were \\"reapplying for the job ... [of] the best band in the world\\". The album's other singles were worldwide hits as well; \\"Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of\\", \\"Elevation\\", and \\"Walk On\\" reached number one in Canada, while charting in the top five in the UK and top ten in Australia. Answer:","completion":"The lead single from the 10th album of the band that were content to work without deadlines is \\"Beautiful Day.\\" This song is from U2's album, All That You Can't Leave Behind, released in October 2000. \\"Beautiful Day\\" was a worldwide hit and achieved the number one position in Ireland, the UK, Australia, and Canada while peaking at number 21 in the US.

Consult the user manual or the manufacturer's website to determine which devices are compatible with your alarm system. 2. Acquire the necessary devices: Once you have identified the devices that are compatible with your alarm system, purchase them from a reputable store or online retailer. Ensure that the devices come with an installation guide and the necessary hardware required for mounting. 3. Install the devices: Follow the installation guide provided with each device and mount them in appropriate locations around your home. For instance, security cameras should cover entry points like doors and windows, while motion detectors should be placed in high-traffic areas inside the house. 4. Connect the devices to the alarm system: Upon completing the installation, you need to connect the devices to your alarm system. This process may vary based on the specific alarm system you have. You may need to refer to your alarm system's user manual for detailed instructions on how to connect different devices. 5. Test the devices: After connecting the devices, you must test them to ensure that they are functioning correctly and can communicate with the alarm system.

The context specifically discusses the situation in the African country of Somalia, which is facing severe challenges such as heavy violence, drought, and soaring food prices. These factors are causing half of the population of Somalia to be in immediate need of food aid to prevent famine, with a significant 77% increase in people needing immediate aid compared to the prior year. The context also mentions that every sixth child under the age of five in Somalia is acutely malnourished. While the Food Security Analysis Unit (FSAU), which is mentioned in the context, is based in Nairobi, Kenya, it does not provide any direct information or implications about the food security situation in Kenya itself. The FSAU is an organization aimed at providing analyses and reports on food security in the places it serves, one of which is Somalia. It is important not to infer the food security situation of one country from the organization's location. To determine the food security and needs in Kenya, we would require additional context or information specifically related to Kenya's agricultural, economic, and social circumstances or other reports from organizations like the FSAU focusing on the situation in Kenya.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose music career began in Memphis in 1954, recording at Sun Records? ? Elvis Aaron Presley (January 8, 1935 – August 16, 1977) was an American singer and actor. Regarded as one of the most significant cultural icons of the 20th century, he is often referred to as the \\"King of Rock and Roll\\" or simply \\"the King\\". Presley was born in Tupelo, Mississippi, and relocated to Memphis, Tennessee, with his family when he was 13 years old. His music career began there in 1954, recording at Sun Records with producer Sam Phillips, who wanted to bring the sound of African-American music to a wider audience. Accompanied by guitarist Scotty Moore and bassist Bill Black, Presley was a pioneer of rockabilly, an uptempo, backbeat-driven fusion of country music and rhythm and blues. In 1955, drummer D. J. Fontana joined to complete the lineup of Presley's classic quartet and RCA Victor acquired his contract in a deal arranged by Colonel Tom Parker, who would manage him for more than two decades. Presley's first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", was released in January 1956 and became a number-one hit in the United States. With a series of successful network television appearances and chart-topping records, he became the leading figure of the newly popular sound of rock and roll. His energized interpretations of songs and sexually provocative performance style, combined with a singularly potent mix of influences across color lines during a transformative era in race relations, made him enormously popular—and controversial. In November 1956, Presley made his film debut in Love Me Tender. Drafted into military service in 1958, Presley relaunched his recording career two years later with some of his most commercially successful work. He held few concerts however, and guided by Parker, proceeded to devote much of the 1960s to making Hollywood films and soundtrack albums, most of them critically derided. In 1968, following a seven-year break from live performances, he returned to the stage in the acclaimed television comeback special Elvis, which led to an extended Las Vegas concert residency and a string...

He lives in a flophouse and works as a dance instructor and a waiter at a dance club and searches for a big break in the modern dance productions on Broadway. The break from his Brooklyn life, family, and friends seems to have matured Tony and refined his personality, including his diminished Brooklyn accent, an avoidance of alcohol and less use of profanity. Other attitudes remain unchanged, such as his disregard for his most recent girlfriend, the forgiving Jackie (Cynthia Rhodes). Still immature, Tony maintains some of his other macho and childish double standards, such as seeing other women but offended if he sees Jackie with other men. Tony watches a show which features Jackie as a dancer in the chorus, but focuses on the lead, a seemingly-wealthy English dancer, Laura (Finola Hughes). Tony pursues her with seduction in mind, and spends the night with her. He's annoyed when she dismisses him afterward, not understanding that she intended their encounter to be a one-night stand.

Instead, the military wife and mom from Fort Drum, NY, was handed almost unimaginable news following her March 3 emergency C-section: a diagnosis of stage 3 choriocarcinoma, an incredibly rare cancer tied to pregnancy. The 26-year-old has since been put in a medically induced coma, reports ABC News, with tumors having spread to her lungs. As Dr. David Landsberg of Crouse Hospital explains, \\"Placental tissue grows at a very rapid rate to support the fetus, which explains why the cancer is so aggressively metastatic. It grows into the uterus and once it gets out, it's looking for somewhere else to grow.\\" At most, seven pregnancies out of every 100,000 are thought to be affected by choriocarcinoma; making Hinman's situation all the more rare: Doctors say her condition would be \\"100% fatal\\" without the use of ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, which the Post-Standard calls an \\"unprecedented and unorthodox\\" treatment plan. The technology employs a pump that circulates blood through an artificial lung and then back into the body. Says Landsberg, \\"The ECMO is keeping her alive for the chemo to do its job ... but the danger to the patient is just from being on ECMO.\\" Hinman's girls, who were born at 30 weeks and named Kinleigh Ann Hinman (2 pounds, 9 ounces) and Azlynn Mary Hinman (3 pounds, 6 ounces), are doing well.

Article:","completion":"Jenna Hinman's Story: Fighting a Rare Pregnancy Cancer Once upon a time, there was a brave and strong mom named Jenna Hinman. She was a military wife and lived in Fort Drum, New York. Jenna was expecting two beautiful twin girls. Usually, when mommies have babies, it's a happy and special time, but sadly, Jenna got some very unexpected and scary news after her babies were born. On March 3rd, Jenna had to have an emergency C-section, which is a special kind of surgery to help deliver the babies. But after her babies were born, doctors told Jenna that she had a very rare sickness called stage 3 choriocarcinoma. This is a type of cancer that can happen during pregnancy, and it was making Jenna very sick. You see, when a mommy is pregnant, there is something called \\"placental tissue\\" that helps a baby grow inside the mommy's belly. Dr. David Landsberg from Crouse Hospital says that sometimes placental tissue can grow too fast and turn into cancer, like it did with Jenna. The bad part is that this cancer can spread to other parts of the body very quickly. Jenna's cancer was so uncommon that only about seven out of every 100,000 pregnancies are affected by it. The doctors said she needed a special treatment called ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, to help her fight the cancer. ECMO is a machine that takes over the work of the organs in the body, helping them rest and heal. It was a very expensive treatment, costing about 100,000 each day. The doctors knew it would be very hard for Jenna, but they believed that ECMO was the best chance to help her get better. Meanwhile, her twin girls, Kinleigh Ann Hinman and Azlynn Mary Hinman, were born a little early, at 30 weeks, but they were doing well and growing stronger each day. To help Jenna and her family, kind and caring people came together and set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for her treatment. They were able to raise over 100,000 to help Jenna and her family. Jenna is a brave mommy fighting against a rare and scary sickness, but she has her family, friends, and strangers supporting her. Her baby girls are growing stronger, and together, they hope for a happy and healthy future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. While your pet fish may appear to be ignorant of your presence, chances are that it knows you extremely well and can probably even identify you from a crowd of human faces! At least, that is the conclusion reached by scientists the University of Oxford in the U.K. and the University of Queensland in Australia, following an extensive study of the archerfish , a species of tropical fish that can be found all the way from India to Indonesia, the Philippines, and Australia. The ability to distinguish between human faces is a complex task. That's because we all have the same basic features -- two eyes sitting above a nose and a mouth. It's only the subtle differences that make humans distinct from one another. Since this requires a combination of both visual sense and memory, researchers had always assumed that _ was a skill possessed only by those with complicated brains, i.e., humans, a few select animals -- such as horses, cows, dogs, monkeys and some birds, like pigeons. To test if this assumption was accurate, a team of scientists led by Dr. Cait Newport, Marie Curie Research Fellow in the Department of Zoology at Oxford University, decided to study fish. The aquatic animals have small brains that lack the neocortex , or neocortex-like structure, believed to help recognize the subtle differences between human facial features. The team began by presenting four archerfish with images of two human faces. Initially, the fish spat randomly at both. However, they soon learned that pouring water at the one selected by the researchers earned them a food treat. After that, they focused primarily on that image. The researchers then took the experiment one step further, by introducing 44 other human faces to the mix. To the researcher's astonishment, the trained archerfish were able to recall the learned image almost 81% of the time. And this accuracy improved to 86% when the researchers made the identification even harder, by replacing the colored photos with a set of black and white images and hiding the shape of the head. In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish _ . A) by taking photos of fish B) by improving people's images C) by rewarding them with food D) by covering their heads","completion":"In the experiment, the researchers trained the archerfish by rewarding them with food (C)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Body: The tragic case unfolded when De La Riva admitted herself into a hospital on New Year's Day, suffering from respiratory issues. She tragically passed away 20 days later, with her untimely death allegedly being the result of unregulated silicone injections administered by Ramos. These injections, which were allegedly given by Liborio De La Luz Ramos, are typically administered using a cattle syringe and sealed with super glue – a horrifying thought when considering the extent to which people are willing to go in order to achieve a desired aesthetic result. It is important to note that Ramos has been charged with one felony count of voluntary manslaughter by an unlawful act and two felony counts of unauthorized practice of medicine. This tragic incident serves as a chilling reminder of the importance of only seeking such treatments from regulated, trained professionals. The potential risks and complications from unregulated silicone injections far outweigh any intended benefits, with potentially life-threatening consequences. Conclusion: As we mourn the loss of Felipe \\"Katya\\" De La Riva, it is crucial for the public to remain vigilant and educate themselves on the dangers of unregulated medical treatments. Always opt for consultations with licensed professionals to avoid disastrous outcomes.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The sun collides with another object happens, how will it affect a SMALLER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If the sun were to collide with another object, it would likely cause a significant disruption in the solar system, including changes in the sun's energy output and potentially altering the Earth's orbit. This event could lead to changes in the greenhouse effect in several ways. 1. A change in the sun's energy output could result in varying levels of solar radiation reaching the Earth. If the energy output decreases significantly, it could lead to a smaller greenhouse effect as less radiation would be absorbed by the Earth. Conversely, if the energy output increases, it could exacerbate the greenhouse effect. 2. An alteration in the Earth's orbit might cause the planet to move closer or further away from the sun. This would also impact the amount of solar radiation received and consequently the intensity of the greenhouse effect. 3. The collision event might also cause the release of large amounts of dust and debris into the solar system, which could affect the amount of sunlight reaching Earth. If less sunlight reaches Earth due to the debris blocking or scattering incoming radiation, the greenhouse effect may be lessened as less radiation is being absorbed and trapped by the atmosphere. Overall, the perturbation of the sun colliding with another object would have a direct impact on the process of the greenhouse effect. However, it is difficult to predict the exact outcome as it would depend on several factors such as the size of the colliding object, the resulting changes in the sun's energy output, and the specific alterations to Earth's orbit and incoming solar radiation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Though prehistoric remains from the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages have been unearthed in the Manzanares Valley, prior to Madrid's sudden elevation to capital city in 1561 its history was rather undistinguished. Over a period of many centuries crucial in Spanish history, Madrid's significance was negligible. The Romans built their most advanced outpost on the Iberian peninsula, but left nothing of consequence in Madrid. Armies of North African nomads, intent on disseminating Islam, invaded the peninsula in a.d. Within 10 years, they had overrun most of Spain. If Madrid played any role in these pivotal events, no record of it remains. The first solid references to this obscure settlement on the Castilian plateau, guarded by the looming Guadarrama mountain range, appear in the 9th century. The Arabic name for \\"place of many springs,\\" variously recorded as Magerit, Mayrit or Magrit, eventually evolved into Madrid. The hamlet entered historical chronicles for its military significance; it was located near the main line of resistance to the Christian reconquest. Over centuries of struggle, the defending Moorish army built a full-scale fort, or Alcázar, on the heights of Madrid commanding the Manzanares valley. After several unsuccessful skirmishes, the Christian forces of Alfonso VI captured Madrid in 1083. The Alcázar became a fort of the crown of Castile. During a counter-offensive in 1109, the town was overrun by the Moors, but the Christianized fortress held. The Moors were expelled from the town, but they remained in control of southern Spain for almost four centuries. Meanwhile, Madrid enjoyed brief prominence in 1308 when king Ferdinand IV and his Cortes, an early version of parliament, held a formal meeting in the fledgling town. From then on, the kings of Spain began to visit Madrid, where the air was invigorating and the hunting excellent. Ferdinand and Isabella, the Catholic monarchs that united all the provinces of Spain, first visited Madrid in 1477. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"The kings did not visit\\" correctly answer the question \\"Why was Madrid's significance negligible in Spanish history?\\"?","completion":"No, the response \\"The kings did not visit\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Why was Madrid's significance negligible in Spanish history?\\" Based on the paragraph, Madrid's significance was negligible because it did not play any major role in the crucial historical events during the Paleolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages, and even during the Roman and Islamic invasions on the Iberian Peninsula. The paragraph mentions that kings of Spain began to visit Madrid from 1308, but its significance remained negligible until its elevation to capital city in 1561."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Brigitte and Ginger are lost with their horse in the Canadian wilderness when they come across a seemingly abandoned camp. An elderly Indian woman, who warns them that they must kill a boy to prevent one sister from killing the other, gives them each a pendant. As their startled horse runs off, Brigitte's foot is caught in a trap. Ginger seeks help, but the hunter frees Brigitte before she returns. He leads them to Fort Bailey, where they take refuge. Ginger says they are the daughters of a drowned trader and are seeking passage east. Werewolves have besieged the fort for some time. Murphy, the fort's physician, inspects Brigitteâs wound and applies a leech, surreptitiously testing for werewolf infection. They are given a room that belonged to Wallace's son Geoffrey. Awakened by a voice, Ginger investigates the corridors, where she eventually finds the source: a deformed boy kept in a small, bolted unlit room; he bites her shoulder as he flees. When Ginger and Brigitte attempt to leave, James confronts them. While Ginger and James are fighting, werewolves attack, killing one of the residents.

The sub-group was very closely related to STS and the Society for the Social Studies of Science. Donna Haraway's 1985 Cyborg Manifesto could be considered the founding document of cyborg anthropology by first exploring the philosophical and sociological ramifications of the term.

This is not a star, but it is indeed a planet. Also, it's called an 'exoplanet' because it exists outside of our solar system and orbits around another star which is not the Sun. Lupus-TR-3b is specifically classified as a \\"Hot Jupiter\\", the type of exoplanet characterized by their similarity in mass to Jupiter, but with higher surface temperatures as they reside very close to their host stars. The Lupus-TR-3b was discovered on 7 June 2007. It is located approximately 8,950 light-years away from us, in the constellation Lupus in the southern sky. It orbits its host star (Lupus-TR-3) within a very short period of about 3.91 days, making its year much shorter than that of our planet which orbits the Sun within 365.25 days. The planet has a mass about 0.81 times that of Jupiter, but its radius is approximately 0.89 times of Jupiter, thus Lupus-TR-3b is somewhat denser than Jupiter. Another interesting fact to note about it is that this planet was detected using the transit method. The transit method involves watching a star's light for a repetitive dimming, which can potentially indicate the presence of a planet crossing in front of the star from our point of view. However, if we were to shift from planets and discuss stars that start with an \\"L\\", we could mention \\"La Superba\\". This is a well-known star which is categorized as a red giant. It's found in the constellation Canes Venatici and its name \\"La Superba\\" is a reflection of the star's high visibility and vibrant color, especially during the spring season in the northern hemisphere. This star has one of the most notable colors in the sky and is famous among stargazers. Lastly, it's worth noting that our understanding and knowledge about these celestial bodies are constantly evolving. Scientists and astronomers continue studying and discovering new planets, exoplanets, and stars, and our knowledge of these celestial bodies, especially the ones in the far corners of the known universe, will likely continue to expand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country didn't cause the extinction of natural habitats? Hint: The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul.

French truckers are threatening to blockade the port of Calais in protest at steep fines imposed for British-bound migrants found hiding in their lorries. Haulage firms are fined £2,000 for each illegal immigrant they bring across the Channel from France. Drivers complain that lax border controls in Calais allow stowaways to climb into their vehicles and sneak into Britain. Penalty protest: French truckers could be set to copy British counterparts who organised a demonstration in Dover a week ago, above, claiming they were being wrongly punished for a lack of proper border controls. And the harsh penalties imposed if they are caught is driving some firms to bankruptcy. Hundreds of truckers staged a mass protest in Dover a week ago claiming they were being unfairly punished for the lack of proper checks across the Channel. David Sagnard, president of France's National Road Haulage Federation, said: 'We have reached the point of no return. 'Many firms can not afford these hefty fines if they are caught in Britain, and some are going bust. 'If those in charge do not act now to resolve this issue, we plan a blockade.' Lorry drivers are now forbidden from parking overnight within 100 miles of Calais in case immigrants sneak aboard. But many climb into lorries at service stations near the port, or break into the secure truck parking area at the ferry terminal. Truckers and their supporters gathered in Dover last week to complain about the financial penalties imposed on hauliers who are found with illegal migrants in their vehicles. Two weeks ago, Home Secretary Theresa May promised to give France £12 million to tighten security in Calais after 250 illegal immigrants stormed the ferry terminal hoping to make it across the Channel. The UK also offered Calais an 11-mile-long high security fence used at a NATO summit in Wales to keep the migrants out of the ferry terminal. Calais mayor Natacha Bouchart also recently threatened to blockade the ferry port unless Britain did more to help her town tackle the crisis. Ms Bouchart also wants the UK border to be moved from Calais to Britain, and for Prime Minister David Cameron to visit her town. She recently blamed the UK's 'generous' state benefits for refugees for the squalid migrant camps in her town. She said: 'Calais is a hostage to the British. That's enough. It's no longer tenable. It's necessary to renegotiate these accords. We're not here to do their job.' There are an estimated 2,000 migrants in Calais, where tensions have been mounting in recent months as hundreds more refugees fleeing war zones in the Middle East and poverty in Africa flood into the town. Mass brawls between rival gangs have left more than 70 people injured during July and August. Many refugees are now taking increasingly dangerous risks to sneak into the UK. Last month two migrants were plucked to safety from the English Channel after trying to climb aboard a moving ferry off Calais.

Q:Title: The Blue Butterfly Product review: It was the same as any other story similar to many others and I thought the insects were computerized.... Nice story BUT has been done many times,in many movies... Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review can be considered to depict the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer's opinions and observations highlight several elements that may be perceived as negative aspects of the product. Here, the product appears to be a story or movie revolving around The Blue Butterfly. Let us delve deeper into the reasons that contribute to this unflattering depiction. 1. Lack of originality: The reviewer mentions that this story is similar to many others, which suggests that it may lack uniqueness or creativity. By comparing it to other stories or movies within the same genre, it implies that The Blue Butterfly may not offer anything new or groundbreaking for audiences. This can lower its appeal, as it does not stand out from the competition. 2. Old trope: The critic points out that the theme or concept of the story has been done many times before in various movies. This highlights the repetitive nature of the content, which might be perceived as stagnant or tedious. Audiences often seek fresh and engaging perspectives, and a product that merely retells a commonly used narrative can be deemed uninteresting. 3. Technical aspects: The reviewer's comment on the computerized insects implies that the visual effects (if it is a movie) or the descriptions of the insect characters (if it is a written story) might not be very convincing or impressive. In today's world of high-quality CGI, a visually underwhelming presentation can disappoint viewers, especially when it pertains to a critical aspect of the storyline like the titular butterfly. 4. Backhanded compliment: The critic refers to the story as nice, which might seem to offer a small compliment on the surface. However, it is immediately followed by \\"BUT\\", highlighting that the reviewer's opinion remains negative despite acknowledging a positive attribute. This helps to reinforce the unflattering elements discussed earlier. 5. Overall tone: Throughout the review, the language and tone reveal a general lack of enthusiasm about the product. Dispassion can be contagious, so if a reviewer does not find the product remarkable or worth recommending, potential consumers could be discouraged from giving it a try. In summary, the review puts The Blue Butterfly in an unfavorable light by emphasizing its lack of originality, repetitive theme, unsatisfactory technical aspects, and overall lack of excitement. Potential audiences may be swayed to explore other options, as this product appears to falter when compared to movies or stories with similar themes that successfully avoid the aforementioned pitfalls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Gavin McInnes, center, founder of the far-right group Proud Boys, is surrounded by supporters after speaking at a rally in Berkeley, Calif., in 2017. (Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP) The male-chauvinist group Proud Boys has been described by federal authorities as an “extremist group with ties to white nationalism” — and has been the subject of warnings to local police agencies by the FBI, according to a report issued by a Washington state sheriff’s office. The report, from the office of Clark County Sheriff Chuck E. Atkins in southwestern Washington, was issued as the office analyzed the dismissal of a deputy who was fired after her affiliation with a female offshoot of the group, Proud Boys' Girls, came to light. “The FBI categorizes the Proud Boys as an extremist group with ties to White Nationalism,” noted the report, which was acquired and published by Property of the People, a nonprofit focused on government transparency. “The FBI has warned local law enforcement that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific Northwest and that some in the group have contributed to the escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses.” The Proud Boys are one of many predominantly male, right-wing groups to come to the fore since President Trump’s election. They describe themselves as a “Western chauvinist” fraternal group that believes in ending welfare, closing the borders and adhering to traditional gender roles. But critics point to other statements and behavior to argue that these aims are a subterfuge for racist and hateful beliefs. “Their disavowals of bigotry are belied by their actions: rank-and-file Proud Boys and leaders regularly spout white nationalist memes and maintain affiliations with known extremists,” the Southern Poverty Law Center, which considers the Proud Boys a hate group, wrote in a report. “They are known for anti-Muslim and misogynistic rhetoric.” The group captured national media attention for its involvement in a fight that broke out on the streets of New York after it was invited to a Republican club in town. Police sought to charge nine people who were affiliated with the group after the incident. The Proud Boys, who did not respond to a request for comment sent to their New York chapter, have pushed back on assertions like those made by the Southern Poverty Law Center. Founder Gavin McInnes, who was also a co-founder of Vice, has argued that his ideology is not motivated by racism. “When pestered about their pedagoguery, the politically correct left insists they need to police our language because ‘words are powerful’ and ‘words have meaning,’” he wrote in a 2011 essay. “It is not racist for white people to be unashamed of their race. Few people mind hearing ‘Navajo Power,’ but there’s this implication that for whites to show any kind of pride means they want to extinguish other races. That’s as absurd as saying a Dallas Cowboys fan wants all the other teams to die. To say black people are totally responsible for their lot in life now that it’s 2011 is not racist.\\" The FBI’s field office in Seattle referred inquiries about its designation to its headquarters in Washington. In a statement distributed by spokeswoman Kelsey Pietranton, the FBI said it did not regulate political ideology or any other rights guaranteed by the First Amendment. “Our focus is not on membership in particular groups but on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or poses a threat to national security,” the statement said. “When it comes to domestic terrorism, our investigations focus solely on criminal activity of individuals — regardless of group membership — which appears to be intended to intimidate or coerce the civilian population or influence the policy of the government by intimidation or coercion. The FBI does not and will not police ideology.” As is its practice, the bureau declined to deny or confirm whether the group was the subject of an investigation. The author of the Clark County Sheriff’s report, Cmdr. Michael S. McCabe, told the Guardian, which first reported on the documents, that the FBI’s classification was revealed in an FBI briefing in August. As the Guardian reported: The briefing included agency heads from local law enforcement, and in it the FBI said that they “have been warning [local law enforcement] for a while” about the Proud Boys, “not just in Washington, but around the nation.” The briefing including the Proud Boys was delivered by an FBI analyst, according to information forwarded to the Guardian by McCabe. It touched on topics including “How the FBI tracks hate/extremist groups”, “Brief history of these groups in the Pacific NW”, “A description of currently active groups with a focus on the Portland/Vancouver area”, and “Current trends or concerns over law enforcement officers/employees involvement with these groups”. McCabe’s report found that Deputy Erin Willey’s participation with the Proud Boys and the Proud Boys' Girls violated two of the office’s policies, governing off-duty conduct and nondiscrimination and harassment, as well as her oath of office.

The FBI’s 2018 designation of the self-confessed “western chauvinist group” as extremist has not been previously made public. Who are the Proud Boys, 'western chauvinists' involved in political violence? Read more The Proud Boys was founded by the Vice Media co-founder Gavin McInnes. McInnes has insisted that his group is not white nationalist or “alt-right” but the Proud Boys have a history of misogyny and glorifying violence. The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) lists them as a hate group. The document also says: “The FBI has warned local law enforcement agencies that the Proud Boys are actively recruiting in the Pacific north-west”, and: “Proud Boys members have contributed to the recent escalation of violence at political rallies held on college campuses, and in cities like Charlottesville, Virginia, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, Washington.” Sign up for the new US morning briefing The report, and the FBI’s warning to south-west Washington police agencies about the Proud Boys’ role in escalating violence at these events came in August, two months before the group was involved in an infamous weekend of street violence in New York City and Portland, and not long after they participated in street violence in downtown Portland on 30 June. The document, provided to the Guardian by the government transparency non-profit Property of the People, was part of an internal affairs investigation into a probationary deputy in the Clark county sheriff’s department. The former clark county deputy, Erin Willey, was fired last July after a photo of her wearing a “Proud Boys Girls” sweatshirt was published by the Vancouver, Washington newspaper the Columbian. The Proud Boys Girls is the female auxiliary of the men-only group founded by McInnes in 2016. The author of the document, headquarters commander Michael McCabe, is in charge of internal affairs, training, background investigation and courthouse security in the Clark county sheriff’s department. After confirming the authenticity of the document, he told the Guardian in a telephone interview that the FBI’s classification of the Proud Boys as an extremist group was revealed to him in “a briefing we were given by the FBI” on 2 August, at Clark county’s west precinct. The briefing included agency heads from local law enforcement, and in it the FBI said that they “have been warning [local law enforcement] for a while” about the Proud Boys, “not just in Washington but around the nation”. The briefing including the Proud Boys was delivered by an FBI analyst, according to information forwarded to the Guardian by McCabe. It touched on topics including “How the FBI tracks hate/extremist groups”, “Brief history of these groups in the Pacific NW”, “A description of currently active groups with a focus on the Portland/Vancouver area”, and “Current trends or concerns over law enforcement officers/employees involvement with these groups”.

Photograph: John Rudoff/Sipa USA/REX/Shutterstock The document says that Willey was an active Proud Boys Girls member between November 2016 and October 2017, and in February 2017 she “actively participated in the manufacturing, advertising and selling of Proud Boys Girls’ merchandise on a website”. The document concludes that membership in the Proud Boys may constitute a violation of the Clark county sheriff’s department oath to support and protect the laws of the United States, since Proud Boys “members have been documented as having called for the closure of all prisons, the issuing of firearms to everyone, the legalization of all drugs, the deportation of all illegal immigrants and the shutdown of the government”. Another concern expressed in the document produced by McCabe – which was handed to the sheriff, Chuck E Atkins, so he could make a decision on Willey’s future in the department – was the possibility that the deputy’s membership in the group would constitute a so-called “Brady violation”. The Brady doctrine requires prosecutors to disclose any potentially exculpatory evidence to defenses in the discovery phase of criminal trials. Membership in the Proud Boys, the document says, may constitute “evidence that a deputy is biased or has some motive to lie” which could constitute a prosecutorial risk. According to the report, Willey was placed on administrative leave after the Columbian contacted the sheriff’s department on 2 July. She was fired on 17 July, before the report was completed, and just before the Columbian published its story. The report also states Willey’s belief that the photo of her in a Proud Boys sweatshirt was given to the Columbian by her former boyfriend, and “active Proud Boy member”, Graham Jorgensen. Jorgensen has been a regular participant in rallies organized by the Clark county-based Patriot Prayer group, whose events have included Proud Boys, and which have frequently culminated in violence. Other law enforcement agencies have discovered Proud Boys in their midst and responded in a similar manner. A month after Willey was fired, Brian Green, a patrol deputy in Louisiana, was also let go after social media posts revealed his allegiance to the group. Willey and Jorgensen could not be reached for comment. In Clark county, Proud Boys have been integral to the Patriot Prayer movement, which organizes rightwing street marches and rallies in Portland, Seattle, Vancouver and other cities in the Pacific north-west. ‘Call me a racist, but don’t say I’m a Buddhist’: America's alt right Read more Asked about the apparent high level of Proud Boy activity and rightwing organizing in Clark county, McCabe said: “I think both as an agency and me, personally, we worry about that. “Anybody who has watched the news recently can see that the United States appears divided. Any time you are dealing with groups who are espousing hate, it’s certainly a concern for law enforcement,” he added. McCabe pointed to a joint statement by Atkins and the Clark county prosecuting attorney Tony Golik in the wake of reporting on Willey’s firing. In that statement, the men said in part: “We reject hate, bigotry, harassment, violence or the inciting of violence, and all actions intended to harm or intimidate others.” The FBI did not directly address the designation or the briefing in response to specific email questions, but did say that while “the FBI does not and will not police ideology”, the agency “regularly assesses intelligence regarding possible threats and works closely to share that information with our federal, state and local law enforcement partners”. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The Proud Boys, a far-right male group, has been designated an \\"extremist group with ties to white nationalism\\" by the FBI, according to a document released by the office of Clark County Sheriff Chuck E. Atkins. The group has been the subject of warnings to local police agencies. The report came as the office analyzed the dismissal of a deputy, who was affiliated with the Proud Boys' Girls, a female offshoot of the group. The Proud Boys describes itself as a “Western chauvinist” group that has a controversial history with events involving violence. Gavin McInnes, the group's founder, has however insisted that his group is not motivated by racism. The FBI clarified that it does not police ideology, focusing instead on individuals who commit violence and criminal activity that constitutes a federal crime or national security threat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The terms international policing, transnational policing, and/or global policing began to be used from the early 1990s onwards to describe forms of policing that transcended the boundaries of the sovereign nation-state (Nadelmann, 1993), (Sheptycki, 1995). These terms refer in variable ways to practices and forms for policing that, in some sense, transcend national borders.

I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why did Nalini think that her acne would fade once she left her teens? Options: A. Because her parents had acne when they were younger ( and not beyond). B. Because of stress. C. not enough information D. Because of the weather.","completion":"A.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

Because of the close proximity and linguistic similarities, many words in the two languages are almost identical, while others are quite similar but may have slight differences in spelling or grammar. To perform the translation, I used my knowledge of the similarities between Portuguese and Galician. I kept the sentence structure mostly the same, as the grammar rules for both languages are very similar. I focused on translating individual words and phrases, considering the differences in spelling and vocabulary between the two languages. For example, \\"pessoas\\" in Portuguese became \\"persoas\\" in Galician due to the preference for the 's' over the 'c'. Additionally, \\"atingidas\\" in Portuguese was changed to \\"afectadas\\" based on the difference in terminology usage for 'affect'.

It took a considerable amount of time for us to choose from the numerous mouthwatering options! Onto the star of the show—the food! The dishes we ordered were nothing short of impeccable. To start with, we ordered the seasonal heirloom tomato salad, served with burrata cheese, fresh basil, and a tangy balsamic reduction. This summer delight was filled with an exciting mix of textures and flavors, an absolute treat for the palate. For our entrees, I chose the pan-seared sea bass with sweet potato puree and sautéed asparagus, while my companion opted for the herb-crusted rack of lamb served with a truffled potato gratin and garlic-infused broccolini. The sea bass was cooked to perfection, its flaky texture contrasting with the velvety sweet potato puree, and the harmony of flavors and freshness of ingredients was something I haven't experienced in any other restaurant. My dining partner raved about the tenderness and juiciness of the lamb, noting it to be the best they've ever tasted. Finally, to complete our meal, we shared the decadent chocolate soufflé with raspberry coulis and vanilla bean ice cream. This heavenly dessert was the perfect end to the spectacular culinary journey we embarked upon at The Silver Spoon Eatery. Each bite was divine, and we couldn't help but savor every spoonful. Overall, our experience left us in awe, and I am already planning our next visit. The combination of exquisite food, impeccably attentive service, and an atmosphere to match makes The Silver Spoon Eatery a must-visit dining destination. So, I implore you, do not miss out on this gem! Trust me, your taste buds will thank you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the sentiment of the following review? Average food, average service. Marinara sauce over spaghetti was far too sweet. Tasted like canned. Italian sausage was bland at best. Wine selection was average and overpriced. Would not recommend.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several elements of their dining experience. Here's a detailed overview of the sentiment portrayed in the review: 1. The use of the word \\"average\\" for both food and service implies that the reviewer found the restaurant's offerings unimpressive and lacking in any standout qualities. Typically, customers expect dining experiences to be above average, especially considering the time and money spent. 2. The mention of the marinara sauce being \\"far too sweet\\" and tasting like \\"canned\\" sauce demonstrates dissatisfaction with the quality of the meal. This comment indicates that the reviewer expected a higher standard of food quality, perhaps a homemade and authentic marinara sauce, but was let down by the restaurant's offering. 3. Describing the Italian sausage as \\"bland at best\\" further emphasizes the negative sentiment in the review. The reviewer is highlighting another aspect of their meal that they found unenjoyable, adding to the overall negative tone. 4. The \\"average and overpriced\\" wine selection is another point of criticism in the review. It suggests that the reviewer was not only unimpressed with the variety of wines available but also found them to be excessively priced in relation to their quality. 5. The final statement, \\"Would not recommend,\\" encapsulates the reviewer's negative sentiment. This declaration makes it evident that the dining experience didn't meet their expectations and that they wouldn't encourage others to visit this restaurant, further reinforcing the predominantly negative sentiment of the review. In summary, the reviewer found the food quality, service, and wine selection to be unremarkable and not worth the investment. As a result, they expressed a mainly negative sentiment toward the restaurant, ultimately not recommending it to others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Shotgun -- Aside from the most common use against small, fast moving targets, the shotgun has several advantages when used against still targets. First, it has enormous stopping power at short range, more than nearly all handguns and many rifles. Though many believe the shotgun is a great firearm for inexperienced shooters, the truth is, at close range, the spread of shot is not very large at all, and competency in aiming is still required. A typical self-defense load of buckshot contains 8--27 large lead pellets, resulting in many wound tracks in the target. Also, unlike a fully jacketed rifle bullet, each pellet of shot is less likely to penetrate walls and hit bystanders. It is favored by law enforcement for its low penetration and high stopping power. A:","completion":"Question: Is the spread of shot from a shotgun at close range very large, making it easy for inexperienced shooters to hit targets?

In this context, \\"clean\\" refers to the process of removing any impurities, such as dirt, dust, or debris, from the grain before it is milled. This is an essential step in preparing the grain for consumption, as milling involves grinding the grain into flour, which is then used in various food products. The cleaning process helps ensure that the final product is safe to eat, free of contaminants, and of higher quality. It can include sieving, air separation, and even washing the grain under certain circumstances. 2. Clean the spots off the rug. In this context, \\"clean\\" means removing stains, dirt, or other blemishes from the rug's surface. This is typically achieved through a combination of methods, such as applying a cleaning solution to the affected area, gently scrubbing or agitating the fibers, and then extracting the solution and any loosened dirt with a vacuum, cloth, or sponge. Cleaning a rug helps restore its appearance and maintain its overall condition, ensuring it continues to provide comfort and aesthetics to the living space. Though both meanings of \\"clean\\" involve the removal of dirt or impurities, the difference lies in the implication of the specific processes or mechanisms used to achieve the desired results. In the first context, it applies to a preparatory stage for the grain prior to processing, while in the second context, it denotes the act of restoring and maintaining the aesthetics and condition of a rug by removing blemishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London. - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Eton Wick is a village currently in the English ceremonial county of Berkshire, but traditionally in Buckinghamshire, on the River Thames. According to the Grid Ref at the 2011 Census the population was included in the civil parish of Eton. It is very close to both the historic towns of Windsor and Eton, as well as Slough and Dorney Lake, the rowing venue for the 2012 Summer Olympics.

Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Windsor is a historic market town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is widely known as the site of Windsor Castle, one of the official residences of the British Royal Family. - Bush Ait is an island of Clewer , Berkshire in the Thames on the reach above Boveney Lock at the mouth of the Clewer Mill Stream which leads to Windsor Racecourse Marina . The island is unpopulated and wooded . - Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea. - The Thames Navigation Commission used to manage the River Thames in southern England. In particular, they were responsible for installing or renovating many of the locks on the river in the 18th and early 19th centuries - Clewer Mill Stream is a narrow twisting backwater of the River Thames near Windsor, Berkshire, England, which leaves the main river at Bush Ait and rejoins just above Queen Elizabeth Bridge.

The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm.

Answer the following question: Information: - The IBM Personal Computer, commonly known as the IBM PC, is the original version and progenitor of the IBM PC compatible hardware platform. It is IBM model number 5150, and was introduced on August 12, 1981. It was created by a team of engineers and designers under the direction of Don Estridge of the IBM Entry Systems Division in Boca Raton, Florida. - IBM PC compatible computers are those similar to the original IBM PC, XT, and AT, able to run the same software and support the same expansion cards as those. Such computers used to be referred to as PC clones, or IBM clones. They duplicate almost exactly all the significant features of the PC architecture, facilitated by IBM's choice of commodity hardware components and various manufacturers' ability to reverse engineer the BIOS firmware using a \\"clean room design\\" technique. Columbia Data Products built the first clone of the IBM personal computer by a clean room implementation of its BIOS. - The expansion card (also expansion board, adapter card or accessory card) in computing is a printed circuit board that can be inserted into an electrical connector, or expansion slot on a computer motherboard, backplane or riser card to add functionality to a computer system via the expansion bus. - Columbia Data Products (CDP) is a company that produced some of the first IBM PC clones. It faltered in that market after only a few years, and later reinvented itself as a software development company. - Clean room design (also known as the Chinese wall technique) is the method of copying a design by reverse engineering and then recreating it without infringing any of the copyrights associated with the original design. Clean room design is useful as a defense against copyright infringement because it relies on independent invention. However, because independent invention is not a defense against patents, clean room designs typically cannot be used to circumvent patent restrictions. - The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, the Internet bubble, the dot-com collapse, and the information technology bubble) was a historic speculative bubble covering roughly 19952001 during which stock markets in industrialized nations saw their equity value rise rapidly from growth in the Internet sector and related fields. While the latter part was a boom and bust cycle, the Internet boom is sometimes meant to refer to the steady commercial growth of the Internet with the advent of the World Wide Web, as exemplified by the first release of the Mosaic web browser in 1993, and continuing through the 1990s. - The BIOS (an acronym for Basic Input/Output System and also known as the System BIOS, ROM BIOS or PC BIOS) is a type of firmware used to perform hardware initialization during the booting process (power-on startup) on IBM PC compatible computers, and to provide runtime services for operating systems and programs. The BIOS firmware is built into personal computers (PCs), and it is the first software they run when powered on. The name itself originates from the Basic Input/Output System used in the CP/M operating system in 1975. Originally proprietary to the IBM PC, the BIOS has been reverse engineered by companies looking to create compatible systems and the interface of that original system serves as a \\"de facto\\" standard. - A personal computer (PC) is a multi-purpose electronic computer whose size, capabilities, and price make it feasible for individual use. PCs are intended to be operated directly by a person using a graphical user interface such as Windows. The versatility of a personal computer is greatly enhanced by the use of peripheral devices such as a keyboard, monitor, printer, mouse, speakers, and an external hard drive. - The World Wide Web (abbreviated WWW or the Web) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. English scientist Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989. He wrote the first web browser computer program in 1990 while employed at CERN in Switzerland. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Compaq Computer Corporation was a company founded in 1982 that developed , sold , and supported computers and related products and services . Compaq produced some of the first IBM PC compatible computers , being the first company to legally reverse engineer the IBM Personal Computer . It rose to become the largest supplier of PC systems during the 1990s before being overtaken by HP in 2001 . Struggling in the aftermath of the dot - com bubble bust , Compaq was acquired for US 25 billion by HP in 2002 . The Compaq brand remained in use by HP for lower - end systems until 2013 when , without warning , the Compaq name was quietly discontinued . The company was formed by Rod Canion , Jim Harris and Bill Murto -- former Texas Instruments senior managers . Murto ( SVP of Sales ) departed Compaq in 1987 , while Canion ( President and CEO ) and Harris ( SVP of Engineering ) left under a shakeup in 1991 , which saw Eckhard Pfeiffer appointed President and CEO . Pfeiffer served through the 1990s . Ben Rosen provided the venture capital financing for the fledgling company and served as chairman of the board for 18 years from 1983 until September 28 , 2000 , when he retired and was succeeded by Michael Capellas , who served as the last Chairman and CEO until its merger with HP.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: How many crew members from the ship that was crushed in January 1914 were eventually rescued? The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the...

Q: Given a sequence of actions to navigate an agent in its environment, provide the correct command in a limited form of natural language that matches the sequence of actions when executed. Commands are lowercase and encapsulate the logic of the sequence of actions. Actions are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'. These actions respectively align with the commands 'look', 'walk', 'run', 'jump', 'turn left', and 'turn right'. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. opposite turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. Actions and commands do not have quotations in the input and output. I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_RIGHT I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP I_TURN_LEFT I_TURN_LEFT I_JUMP A:","completion":"The command for the given sequence of actions is: \\"turn right thrice and turn left twice and jump and turn left twice and jump and turn left twice and jump\\". The justification for this proposed command is as follows: 1. The action I_TURN_RIGHT is repeated thrice at the start, so it is transformed into \\"turn right thrice\\". 2. The action I_TURN_LEFT is repeated twice, followed by an I_JUMP, so it is transformed into \\"turn left twice and jump\\". This phrase is repeated three times in the action sequence, so it is repeated three times in the command. 3. All the phrases are connected by the conjunction \\"and\\" following the rule presented in the task description."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands. Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794. - The Netherlands is the main constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

Answer: Schell and Van Montagu (1977) hypothesised that the Ti plasmid could be a natural vector for introducing the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation in the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: The introduction and transfer mentioned in the question refer to a technique used in genetic engineering involving the use of the Ti plasmid as a vector to transfer specific genes, such as the Nif gene responsible for nitrogen fixation, into the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. This process is known as genetic transformation and has significant applications in the field of agriculture and plant biotechnology. The Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid is a large circular piece of DNA found in some strains of Agrobacterium, a soil bacterium. When Agrobacterium infects a plant, it transfers a part of its Ti plasmid, called the T-DNA (transferred DNA) into the host plant's genetic material. The T-DNA then integrates into the plant genome and can cause the formation of tumors (crown galls). However, scientists like Schell and Van Montagu (1977) saw the potential in utilizing this naturally occurring process to introduce beneficial genes to plants. The hypothesis put forth by Schell and Van Montagu (1977) is based on the concept of harnessing the natural process of Ti plasmid-mediated gene transfer for the purpose of introducing the Nif gene into the root nodules of legumes and other plant species. The Nif gene is responsible for nitrogen fixation, a process through which atmospheric nitrogen is converted to ammonia, which is then assimilated by the plants as a nitrogen source. The ability to fix nitrogen allows legumes and certain other plants to grow in nitrogen-deficient environments, reducing the need for synthetic nitrogen fertilizers. The use of the Ti plasmid as a vector for gene transfer has several advantages: 1. Wide host range: Ti plasmid can be used to introduce genes into a variety of plant species, including both monocots and dicots. 2. Transfer of large DNA fragments: The Ti plasmid can carry and transfer large segments of foreign DNA, making it suitable for the transfer of complex genes and regulatory elements. 3. Stable integration: Once the foreign DNA is integrated into the host plant genome, it is stably inherited through successive generations. The transfer of the Nif gene using the Ti plasmid has the potential to confer nitrogen-fixation capability to non-leguminous plants, leading to more sustainable and ecologically sound agricultural practices. Furthermore, Ti plasmid-mediated gene transfer has been widely used to introduce other desirable traits like pest resistance, herbicide tolerance, and improved nutritional content in various crop species. In summary, the introduction and transfer technique mentioned in the question, involving the use of the Ti plasmid as a vector for introducing specific genes like the Nif gene, has significant applications in the field of agriculture and plant biotechnology. This method allows scientists to genetically engineer plants with desired traits, such as nitrogen fixation, to improve crop yield, reduce the need for chemical fertilizers, and contribute to more sustainable agricultural practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What exactly is a lie ?Is it anything we say which we know is untrue ?Or is it something more than that ?For example, suppose a friend wants to borrow some money from you. You say \\"I wish I could help you, but I am short of money myself.\\" In fact , you are not short of money but your friend is in the habit of not paying his debts and you don't want to hurt his feelings by reminding him of this. Is this really a lie ? Professor Jerald Jellison of the University of southern California has made a scientific study of lying. According to him, women are better liars than men, particularly when telling a \\"white lie\\", such as when a woman at a party tells another woman that she likes her dress when she really thinks it's terrible. However, this is only one side of the story. Other researchers say that men are more likely to tell more serious lies, such as making a promise that they have no intention of carrying out. This is the kind of lie politicians and businessmen are supposed to be particularly skilled at :the lie from which the liar hopes to profit or gain in some way. Research has been done into the way people's behavior changes in a number of small, unimportant ways when they lie. It has been found that if they are sitting down at the time, they tend to move about in their chairs more than usual. To the trained observer they are saying \\"I wish I were somewhere else now\\". They also tend to touch certain parts of the face, particularly the nose. One explanation of this may be that lying causes a slight increase in blood pressure. The tip of the nose is very sensitive to changes and the increased pressure makes it itch. Another gesture that gives liars away is what the writer Decmond Morris in his bookMan Watching calls the \\"mouth cover\\". He says that there are several typical forms of this ,such as covering part of the mouth with the fingers, touching the upper lip or putting a finger of the hand at one side off the mouth. Such a gesture can be understood as an unconscious attempt on the part of the liar to... Question: The writer of the passage _ .

Question: What is the blast radius on 200ML of CTX Movie title: Shiri Movie plot: An elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who systematically kills several key South Korean government figures over the next few years.Meanwhile, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also currently engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Kim Yoon-jin), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. They are happy together, but Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance.Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a single liter of it can explode with enough force to level a fifteen-story building. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\"? Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\". He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\". Nevertheless, the overture became, for many, \\"the piece by Tchaikovsky they know best\\"., particularly well-known for the use of cannon in the scores.On 23 March 1881, Nikolai...

He spent tons of money at the store, but not even a dollar at the fair, because the store had great deals. Our protagonist, John, was a frugal man, always looking for the best bargains and discounts. He had an insatiable thirst for savings, which is why he religiously followed every sale and discount offered in town. This week, his favorite department store was having an incredible clearance sale, and John knew he couldn't miss out. As he walked through the maze of aisles in the store, his sharp eyes scanned every price tag searching for its yellow discount sticker. He delved deeper into the tangled web of shelves, guided by the beacons of low prices. It was as if John had a sixth sense for deals, an uncanny ability to track down the most elusive discounts lurking in the corner of the store. He found clothes, electronics, kitchen appliances, and even some pricey items, all at a fraction of their original cost. His heart raced with excitement as he filled his cart higher and higher, not wanting to leave a single bargain behind. He knew this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, the perfect chance to update his wardrobe and home essentials without breaking the bank. Meanwhile, at the fair just a few blocks away, throngs of people enjoyed games, rides, and the sweet smell of cotton candy in the air. Unlike the store, the fair never had any sales or discounts, but instead relied on the whimsy and excitement of its attractions to draw in customers. Even though John enjoyed the fair, he couldn't bring himself to indulge in buying a single ticket for a ride, knowing that his hard-earned money could be better spent elsewhere. After spending hours exploring every inch of the store, John finally approached the checkout line, his cart overflowing with discounted items. As he waited in line, he tallied up the total cost in his head and couldn't believe his luck; he'd managed to save hundreds of dollars. The cheerful cashier rang up his items, and with each beep of the barcode scanner, John felt an immense sense of satisfaction knowing that he was walking away with a steal. As John wheeled his cart of treasures out of the store, he couldn't help but glance towards the fair in the distance. He could hear the distant laughter and see the bright lights of the Ferris wheel, spinning tirelessly against the sunset sky. For a moment, he felt a pang of longing for the simple pleasures that the fair could offer. But John brushed the thought aside. He knew that the satisfaction he derived from finding the best deals and saving money gave him a sense of accomplishment like no other. The fair would always be there, ready to welcome back visitors each season. In contrast, sales like the one he had just experienced were rare and fleeting. He loaded his purchases into his car and drove away, grateful for the store with its great deals that allowed him to indulge in his passion for bargain hunting. While he may not have spent a dollar at the fair, John didn't feel like he missed out. For him, the store's treasures and the delight of saving were worth more than any thrill ride at the fair. And so, John couldn't help but feel a sense of pride as he unpacked his discounted items at home, a testament to his perseverance and devotion to finding the best deals. The fair might offer an escape from reality, but it was John's triumph at the store that truly brought him joy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Kosumi a declarat cotidianului Kosova Sot că acest lucru demonstrează impactul eliminării anumitor bariere reprezentate de taxe şi al deschiderii autostrăzii Albania-Kosovo. Translate this to English?","completion":"Kosumi has stated to the Kosova Sot daily that this demonstrates the impact of elimination of certain barriers represented by taxes and the opening of the Albania-Kosovo highway. The statement from Kosumi reflects on how removing hurdles, here in the form of taxes, and the introduction of infrastructure that improves accessibility and connection, like the Albania-Kosovo highway, can have substantial impacts. He is speaking to Kosova Sot, which is a daily newspaper, indicating that this message is being disseminated to the wider public. The point he is making can be interpreted in a wider economic and social context. In economic terms, removing taxes can encourage trade, stimulate economic activity, and foster business growth. For example, the elimination of trade taxes can make goods cheaper, which can increase demand, boost trade, and potentially stimulate production and employment. Infrastructural developments like opening new highways can similarly boost economic activity by reducing transportation costs and time, facilitating the movement of goods and services, and increasing connection between regions. Moreover, there are social implications as well. Lower taxes can improve the affordability of goods and services for individuals, potentially raising living standards. The opening of new highways can bring regions closer together, enable people to travel more easily, and promote cultural and social exchange. By mentioning the impact of these changes, Kosumi is likely emphasizing the importance of policy decisions in shaping economic and social outcomes, and stressing the potential benefits of reducing restrictions and improving connectivity. The context would suggest that these are likely recent developments in the Albania-Kosovo region, and that Kosumi is highlighting their importance to the audience of the Kosova Sot daily newspaper."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Every time an election rolls around, people want to know what each candidate's stance is on the issues that are important to them. In deciding which candidateIwant to vote for, there are two main issues for me:the economy and education. These issues are important to me because they affect me the most right now. The economy affects everyone,and education is important because I am about to enter college. When I looked at how each candidate views these issues, one man stood out to me,and that is Democratic candidate Barack Obama. I like a11 of Senator Obama's ideas for improving the economy. He wants to bring the troops home from Iraq,thereby saving the 12 billion we spend there every month. Another point that Obama makes is that the United States' current energy policy is hurting the economy. He believes that if new energy bills are passed, it will help the U. S. get out of its current economic slump,and I agree. With these ideas and strategies, I strongly believe that Obama can improve the current state of the economy. Obama also has a plan to improve education. He believes that we need to start educating children at a young age. He also hopes to close the gap of achievement between students, which means improving schools that need help. He wants to pay teachers more and treat them like professionals,but in exchange he calls for higher responsibility. Obama also has a plan to make college more affordable. He wants public colleges to be free for students who maintain a \\"B\\" average during high school. And he plans to give a 4,000 tax credit for college and university students who complete 100 hours of community service each year. I believe these ideas to improve education are good enough and will help many students. Therefore, there is no longer any doubt in my mind who will be receiving my vote: Barack Obama.

No two dandruff shampoos are exactly alike; similarly, no two dandruff sufferers are exactly alike, either. The best dandruff shampoo for one person may not be the best one for you, so be prepared to try out a few different options before finding one that works. Zinc pyrithione shampoos tend to have fewer negative side effects and are generally well tolerated, making them a popular first option. If you have darker hair, tar shampoos and selenium sulfide shampoos are equally good options as long as you follow the label instructions closely. Since salicylic acid shampoos can cause additional dryness, they are generally a less popular choice, but are still safe for most people. Ketoconazole shampoos are generally used when other anti-dandruff shampoo types fail to work or stop working. For a more precise recommendation suited to your hair type and scalp needs, consult a dermatologist. You should always follow the label instructions closely for any dandruff shampoo you use, but generally, you'll need to apply the shampoo to wet hair and thoroughly massage it into the scalp using your fingers. In most cases, you'll need to let the shampoo sit on your scalp for about five minutes before rinsing it out. Others, however, should be rinsed out immediately after application (especially those containing selenium sulfide). To bring severe cases of dandruff under control, you'll typically need to use your anti-dandruff shampoo once every one to two days. The exception is Ketoconazole shampoo, which should be used only twice per week. As your dandruff subsides, you can cut back the amount used to about twice per week, or once per week if you have coarser hair. One shampoo may work for a period of time before suddenly becoming less effective. If this happens, consider switching back and forth between two different ingredient types, using each one at least once per week. You may also consider switching entirely to another type of dandruff shampoo instead of alternating between the old and new ingredients, but doing so may prove less effective than alternating between two. Summary:","completion":"1. Be prepared to try out different dandruff shampoos to find the best one for you. 2. Zinc pyrithione shampoos are a popular first option due to fewer side effects. 3.

Context: Steigers early roles, although minor, were numerous, especially in television series during the early 1950s, when he appeared in more than 250 live television productions over a five-year period. He was spotted by Fred Coe, NBCs manager of program development, who increasingly gave him bigger parts. Steiger considered television to be what repertory theatre had been for an earlier generation, and saw it as a place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles.

Q:Background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Paragraph: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would zone A have less or more oxygen than zone B? A:","completion":"Zone A would have less oxygen than Zone B. This is because Zone A is near agricultural lands, where fertilizer runoff causes an overgrowth of algae. When the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and consume the oxygen in the water, leading to a dead zone with little to no oxygen. In contrast, Zone B is near a national park and not impacted by agricultural runoff, so it does not experience the same depletion of oxygen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sri Lanka felt the full force of Alex Hales bat again but it was not quite enough for England to gain victory over the World Twenty20 champions at the Kia Oval because of the enduring unorthodox brilliance of Lasith Malinga. It was an unbeaten 116 from Hales that enabled England to become the only team to defeat Sri Lanka in that world tournament in Bangladesh in March. He appeared poised to do the same in the first big match of the Peter Moores era. Hales smashed 66 off 41 balls to lift England within reach of their formidable target of 184. But Malinga, still the best ‘death bowler’ in the world, deceived him with a perfect slower ball to earn Sri Lanka the spoils. The fact they will attempt to do so without Hales, whose technique is still considered too loose for the 50-over game, might be something","completion":"of a surprise for many cricket fans. However, the decision to exclude him from the longer format could be a strategic move by the team management, focusing on his strengths in the shorter, high-intensity version of the game. Hales' aggressive batting style makes him a force to be reckoned with in Twenty20 cricket, where scoring quickly is the key to success. His robust technique and ability to hit big shots under pressure have often been the difference between victory and defeat for England in crunch matches. England's team management likely believes that Hales' skill set is better suited for the fast-paced nature of Twenty20 cricket, rather than the more patient, tactical game of one-day international (ODI) cricket. This decision may also be designed to preserve his form and condition for future T20i competitions, where his impact can be more significant. Nevertheless, Hales' absence from the 50-over format might leave the door open for other emerging talents or seasoned campaigners to prove their worth in the longer version of the game. As the battle for supremacy among cricket-playing nations intensifies, it will be fascinating to see how England's strategy of utilizing Hales exclusively in the shorter format pays off in the long run. In conclusion, while Alex Hales’ unmatched power hitting did not secure a win for England over Sri Lanka in their recent encounter, his continued value in the shortest form of the sport remains undeniable. With Lasith Malinga's exceptional death bowling skills still proving to be potent, both teams continue to showcase their unique strengths and remain formidable forces in the cricketing world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Wilson was born on November 26, 1895, in East Dorset, Vermont, the son of Emily (nee Griffith) and Gilman Barrows Wilson. He was born at his parents' home and business, the Mount Aeolus Inn and Tavern. His paternal grandfather, William C. Wilson, was also an alcoholic. William C. Wilson decided to stop drinking alcohol immediately after having a \\"religious experience\\" when he was under the influence of psilocybin ( sy-l@-SY-bin) during a \\"soul searching\\" hike on Mount Aeolus. Wilson met his wife Lois Burnham during the summer of 1913, while sailing on Vermont's Emerald Lake; two years later the couple became engaged. He entered Norwich University, but depression and panic attacks forced him to leave during his second semester. The next year he returned, but was soon suspended with a group of students involved in a hazing incident. Because no one would take responsibility, and no one would identify the perpetrators, the entire class was punished. The June 1916 incursion into the U.S. by Pancho Villa resulted in Wilson's class being mobilized as part of the Vermont National Guard and he was reinstated to serve. The following year he was commissioned as an artillery officer. During military training in Massachusetts, the young officers were often invited to dinner by the locals, and Wilson had his first drink, a glass of beer, to little effect. A few weeks later at another dinner party, Wilson drank some Bronx cocktails, and felt at ease with the guests and liberated from his awkward shyness; \\"I had found the elixir of life,\\" he wrote. \\"Even that first evening I got thoroughly drunk, and within the next time or two I passed out completely. But as everyone drank hard, not too much was made of that.\\" Wilson married Lois on January 24, 1918, just before he left to serve in World War I as a 2nd Lieutenant in the Coast Artillery. After his military service, Wilson returned to live with his wife in New York. He failed to graduate from law school because he was too drunk to pick up his diploma. Wilson became a stock speculator and had success traveling the country with his wife, evaluating companies for potential investors. (During these trips Lois had a hidden agenda: she hoped the travel would keep Wilson from drinking.) However, Wilson's constant drinking made business impossible and ruined his reputation. In 1933 Wilson was committed to the Charles B. Towns Hospital for Drug and Alcohol Addictions in New York City four times under the care of Dr. William D. Silkworth. Silkworth's theory was that alcoholism was a matter of both physical and mental control: a craving, the manifestation of a physical allergy (the physical inability to stop drinking once started) and an obsession of the mind (to take the first drink). Wilson gained hope from Silkworth's assertion that alcoholism was a medical condition rather than a moral failing, but even that knowledge could not help him. He was eventually told that he would either die from his alcoholism or have to be locked up permanently due to Wernicke encephalopathy (commonly referred to as \\"wet brain\\").Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was he married to?","completion":"Wilson was married to Lois Burnham."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Even though the reviewer starts by stating that the music album is typically familiar to an older generation (40 and over), the sentiment of the review is highly positive. The reviewer, who discovered the album when they were 17 and is now 28, clearly expresses enduring appreciation for the music. The passage of time hasn't diminished their liking; in fact, it seems to have increased it. The line \\"Lets just say that its a shame that you don't hear music like this these days\\" presents a strong point of comparison and distinguishes the music positively from others, suggesting they consider the album's style superior or more to their taste than most current music. The reviewer expresses a great desire to share this music with their peers and therefore is searching to purchase it in a more modern format (CD, as compared to vinyl). Wanting to share something usually indicates a strong positive sentiment towards it, underlining the positive nature of the review. These aspects affirm that the reviewer has a positive perspective of the product (here, a music album). They appreciate its quality and value.

Movie title: Alice in Wonderland Context: Alice is sitting by the riverbank all alone reading her book entitled The Principles of Logical Calculus when she decides she simply could not stand to read any further. She's bored and she hates being stuck in that \\"horrible place\\", as she refers to her beautiful outdoor garden. Suddenly out of nowhere, a talking white rabbit wearing a waistcoat and a pocket watch appears, and Alice sees that he is in a big hurry. Running with curiosity, Alice follows the white rabbit down his rabbit hole, and the girl soon finds herself falling deep into the hole. She then balloons her dress out and she begins to float. Down, down, down past shelves and cupboards, mirrors and other curious objects are lined up on shelves. Alice continues to float until she lands and is then in a place called Wonderland. Inside a hall with many different passages, Alice opens a tiny door leading to what she believes is the most beautiful garden she could have ever imagined. In the distance, Alice spots a very curious sort of race, a caucus race, and watches the animals cheer as a small snail defeats the other animals. During her day in Wonderland, Alice questions all of the interesting characters she meets, including the Duchess and her Cheshire Cat about the beautiful garden and how to get there. The girl attends a very extraordinary tea party with two very unusual characters, the Mad Hatter and the March Hare, and is finally invited for a game of croquet with her majesty, the Queen of Hearts. When the Knave of Hearts is unjustly accused of stealing some of the queen's tarts, Alice confesses the truth and tells the jury that it was really she who took the tarts when they had been offered to her.

The hosts managed to close the gap to just three points as they thrashed the Rangers 4-0 on their home ground, sending shockwaves through the league standings and heralding an exciting finish to the season. Rangers entered the game as the second-placed team in the Scottish Championship, enjoying a comfortable seven-point lead over their third-placed adversaries, Hibernian. However, the once comfortable lead quickly evaporated as Hibs took control of the game with a breathtaking display of skill and teamwork. The scoring began with Hibernian's David Gray capitalizing on a well-executed corner kick in the early stages of the match. Gray's powerful header soared past Rangers' goalkeeper, leaving the team in blue reeling from this early setback. Before Rangers had the chance to regroup and retaliate, Hibs' talisman Jason Cummings doubled the lead just a few minutes later in spectacular fashion. Cummings' powerful strike from outside the box provided no chance for the goalkeeper to react and sent the home fans into a frenzy. The Rangers, now down 2-0, were struggling to keep up with the dominant Hibs' play, and Scott Robertson decided to extend the lead even further just before halftime. Robertson's low shot from a tight angle made it past the goalkeeper and into the far corner of the net, making it 3-0. In what was turning out to be quite the rout, Hibernian showed no signs of slowing down in the second half. Liam Craig capped off the scoring in the final minutes with a well-placed penalty kick, putting the final nail in the Rangers' coffin and securing the 4-0 victory for the home side. This defeat marked the first game in charge for Rangers' manager Kenny McDowall, who must now make some difficult strategic decisions in order to keep his team's hopes of promotion alive. Though Rangers still retain the second spot in the Scottish Championship, only a meagre three-point difference separates them from the hard-charging Hibernian squad as the season enters its final stages. Hibernian's magnificent performance in this match has surely given both their fans and the team itself a renewed sense of belief in their potential to secure promotion. With both teams now poised to push for a strong finish to the season, the battle for promotion in the Scottish Championship is only getting more heated and electrifying.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Louise Cheer. The slip, slop, slap message is proving to be effective with melanoma rates plummeting in the past 18 years. A long-term study of teenagers and young adults has revealed the cases of melanoma in young people fell 5 per cent each year from the mid-1990s to 2010. Research leader Adele Green said it showed the effectiveness of sun safety messages. Skin cancer is declining, according to a major new study. Prof Green has been studying skin cancer at QIMR Beghofer Medical Reasearch Institute in Queensland for more than three decades. She and her team looked at melanoma cases among 15 to 24 year olds in Queensland from 1982 to 2010. 'It's been one of the most successful cancer prevention campaigns,' Prof Green said of the slip, slop, slap campaign. '(We looked at) young people who have been exposed to the sun safe message and early detection programs since birth.' Results could also be similar across the rest of Australia, she added. According to the study published online in the International Journal of Cancer, the rate of melanoma cases has fallen from 25 per 100,000 in 1996 to 14 per 100,000 in 2010 among people aged 20 to 24. It follows data released by the institute in April that showed a decline in the most common skin cancers, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, among people aged up to 45. 'This shows the improvements are broader than just the adolescents and young adults in the melanoma study,' Prof Green said. 'The effectiveness of the sun safe message is up there with the anti-smoking and the asbestos campaigns. 'I am convinced we can make people much healthier and happier if we prevent chronic diseases rather than treat them. Professor Green said sun safety campaigns like slip, slop, slap were having a significant effect on the decline of melanoma cases. 'The culture is changing. Australians know the sun is dangerous as well as wonderful.' But despite the good news, Queensland still has the highest rate of melanoma cases in the world. Cancer Council CEO Professor Ian Olver said the sun safe message was an excellent example of a public health campaign. But Cancer Council CEO Ian Olver said people needed to be vigilant with their sun safety - Queensland still has the highest rate of melanoma in the world. 'Australia is known for its high rate of melanoma, but it has been able to lead the world in prevention,' he said. 'We are into the second generation with the sun smart message. 'The important thing is to keep the message going. 'This is not a time to relax just because it is working.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi offered a thinly veiled criticism of China, even while insisting on closer relations with Beijing, during a speech Friday in Singapore. Speaking at the annual Shangri-La Dialogue defense conference, Modi called for the Indo-Pacific region to embrace freedom of navigation, territorial integrity, and respect for all nations, regardless of their size. \\"We will promote a democratic and rules-based international order in which all nations, small and large, count as equal and sovereign,\\" the Indian prime minister said. \\"We will work with others to keep our seas, space and airways free and open.\\" While those comments did not specifically mention China, Modi's remarks are seen as a reference to Beijing's increasingly assertive behavior toward its smaller neighbors in disputed areas of the South China Sea. Modi also implicitly criticized the United States. He slammed growing protectionism, presumably a reference to recent tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. He also said nations should keep their commitments — a possible reference to Trump's decision to pull out of the Iran nuclear deal.

Answer the following question: A team of researchers from Oxford University has demonstrated a self-driving car that is different from such cars being tested by Audi, Ford, etc. It' s much cheaper because it's based on off-the-shelf technology and controlled by an ordinary iPad. Instead of using GPS to understand the location, the car learns routes when a person is driving, and then asks after it's got it down, if the driver would like the computer to take over. As time passes, it's becoming very clear that people believe computers would be better drivers than humans. This has been proven by extensive research that indicates that computers are able to react more quickly to driving conditions, make smarter decisions, don't take risks, and don't make mistakes in concentration. They don't drink either, of course, which means accidents due to drunk driving could be reduced dramatically if the computer could take over when someone needs to get home from the bar. And the team says drivers don't need their cars to know everything about every road, condition or possible danger. Instead, they just need to know how to get from one point to another, and to do a good job of it when asked. To that end, the researchers have added cameras, lasers, a central computer to process information and a regular iPad. In practice, the car would learn how to get to and from places that the driver frequents, such as their work place, the local pub or grocery store. Once it has it down, the computer asks the driver if they' d like a rest. If so, they simply tap the iPad, and the car takes over. It' s very simple and doesn't require nearly the same number of devices as those being tested by other car companies. The researchers say people might be able to get the total price of the system below a hundred dollars. And of course, the iPad can be lifted out and carried away for other purposes when not being used as a driver assistant. Computers are believed to be better drivers than humans mainly because they _ .

Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

Article: The difference in size will leave a portion of the underlying rug exposed, producing a harmonious framing effect. This is probably the simplest way to layer rugs, and one of the most pleasant and effective from a design standpoint. Top elaborately patterned rugs with neutral colors in rooms in need of a modest infusion of flair. Make sure the rugs are made to the same basic dimensions. Otherwise, concentric layering can end up looking lopsided. If your goal is to make a given room look a little more relaxed, leaving the rugs slightly askew will help you achieve this. Uneven layers will also allow you to switch things up in areas with overly linear organization and fill oddly-shaped nooks. For a more effortlessly casual style, drape the rugs in a more or less random manner. You can also offset rugs at regular intervals, keeping the edges and corners lined up, to add depth without making the setup look sloppy. Avoid covering up more than half of a rug with another, or they make look unbalanced. Choose a thin, pliable rug to go on top of another rug in order to minimize trip hazards. An oblong or rectangular rug stretched over a broader covering performs the same function as a traditional table runner, only from below. Position a long, narrow patterned rug in the center of a wider neutral one serving as a base. You can reserve a space for a combination runner under a dining table, inside an alcove or down the middle of a short hallway. Layered runner rugs tend to look best when they’re the same length but differ in width. Assemble your own custom runner by connecting several smaller rugs. Disrupt the monotony of plain, dull carpeting with an array of attractive rugs. For instance, a bold solid color draped over an intricate woven pattern can lend a much-need jolt of personality to a basic beige carpet. A good rule of thumb is to look for layers that fall at the opposite end of the design spectrum of your base, such as bold or dark colors on top of lighter ones, or vibrant designs that offer a place for the eye to wander above neutral carpets. As an added bonus, these rugs can be swapped out at any time, giving you a nearly unlimited number of decorating options. Use a rug a that’s close to the carpeting, but not an exact match, to highlight subtle textural shifts. What is a summary?","completion":"Layering rugs can create a harmonious framing effect and add depth to a room. To achieve a balanced look, use rugs with similar dimensions and avoid covering more than half of one rug with another. Neutral colors can be used to top patterned rugs for a modest infusion of flair. Positioning a long, narrow patterned rug at the center of a wider, neutral rug can create a runner effect. For a relaxed look, try uneven layering or draping the rugs in a casual style. Consider using rugs with contrasting colors or patterns, which can be easily swapped out for different decorating options. Textured rugs close in color to the carpet can also be used to highlight subtle shifts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Cold water taken in through a hose to the bottom - Heating element heats water - Pump forces water up in pipes connected to spinning paddles - The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler - Water comes out of small holes in paddles - Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean - Water is drained through a filter - Filter collects particles of food - Water was so hot that it evaporates for dry dishes. Question: suppose there is no water available happens, how will it affect water is heated in pipe. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If there is no water available in the specified process, the entire functioning of the system will be significantly impacted, including the heating of water within the pipes. In the case of no water being supplied through the hose to the bottom, the heating element will not have any water to heat. This means that there will be no water in the pipes getting heated, leading to no water being available for the pump to force up through the pipes connected to the spinning paddles. With an absence of water, the paddles will not spin like a sprinkler, causing a cascading effect throughout the entire process. The absence of water will have a profound influence on the second effect, which is the heating of water in the pipes. The heating process will have no effect in this scenario because there will be no water present for heat transfer to occur. Consequently, the water's temperature will remain constant – in this case, nonexistent – as the heating element will not have any water to heat. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of not having water available will lead to a substantial impact on the entire process, rendering the heating of water in the pipes ineffective.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Space Tourism Promotion Act of 2001''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. The Congress finds that-- (1) humans have long had a yearning to travel in space and experience conditions beyond Earth's atmosphere; (2) forty years of human space flight experience have demonstrated the feasibility of safe travel to and from space as well as the ability of humans to live and work in space; (3) the Nation's human space flight program has developed technologies and operational procedures that the private sector could make use of to enable American citizens to experience space travel; (4) space tourism has the potential to become a significant industry and a powerful stimulus for advances in space transportation; (5) the Federal Government could play an important role in stimulating the development of space tourism by means of guaranteed loans, tax credits, expeditious establishment of a straightforward and predictable regulatory structure, and research and development in technologies that may enable the private sector to develop operational passenger-carrying space transportation systems and on-orbit habitations; (6) as the agency of the Federal Government primarily responsible for the development of America's commercial sector, the Department of Commerce, and in particular its Office of Space Commercialization, should have the lead role in encouraging the growth of space tourism; (7) as the agency of the Federal Government currently responsible for regulating America's commercial space transportation industry, the Federal Aviation Administration, and in particular its Office of Commercial Space Transportation, should have the lead role in establishing the regulatory structure necessary to ensure the safety of United States space tourism; (8) as the agency of the Federal Government responsible for carrying out the major share of the Nation's civil space activities, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration should continue its traditional role of conducting research and development related to new space technologies and systems and facilitating their transfer to the private sector; (9) it is an appropriate role for the Federal Government to undertake measures to encourage the development of space tourism in the United States; and (10) at the same time, it is an inappropriate role and a misallocation of taxpayer-provided resources for the Federal Government to compete with the private sector in the provision of transportation vehicles or facilities for space tourism. SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS. In this Act-- (1) terms that are defined in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 have the meaning given those terms in that Act; and (2) the term \`\`space tourism'' means travel to, from, or within outer space, or to the surface of a body in space other than Earth, or habitation in outer space, for the purpose of recreation.

(d) Lien on Interests in Assets.--Upon providing a loan guarantee to a borrower under this section, the Secretary of Commerce shall have liens which shall be superior to all other liens on assets of the borrower equal to 85 percent of the unpaid balance of the loan subject to the guarantee. (e) Protection.--No loan shall be guaranteed under this section unless the Secretary of Commerce determines that the borrower is responsible and that adequate provision is made for servicing the loan on reasonable terms and for protecting the interests of the United States. (f) Validity.--A loan guarantee under this section shall be conclusive evidence that such guarantee has been properly obtained, and that the underlying loan qualifies for such guarantee. In an action for fraud or material misrepresentation by the holder of a loan guaranteed under this section, such guarantee shall be presumed to be valid, legal, and enforceable. (g) Forbearance.--The Secretary of Commerce may approve an agreement, between the parties to a loan guaranteed under this section, that provides for forbearance for the benefit of the borrower if the forbearance will result in no cost to the Federal Government. (h) Administration and Oversight Responsibility.--The Office of Space Commercialization shall be responsible for the administration and oversight of this section on behalf of the Department of Commerce.

Title: The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl Movie plot: Max is a lonely child who creates a dreamworld named Planet Drool (similar to Fantasia), where all of his imagination and dreams come to life. He creates two characters, with the first one being Sharkboy who was raised by sharks and his dad. The second character is Lavagirl who can produce fire and lava, but has trouble touching objects without setting them alight. The two left Max to guard Planet Drool. In real life, Max's parents have little time for him, and he is bullied by fellow schoolmate Linus. However, he does receive friendship from Marissa, Mr. Electricidad's (whose name is Spanish for \\"electricity\\") daughter. Linus steals Max's Dream Journal, where all of his ideas are kept, and vandalizes it. The next day, a tornado rages outside the school, and moments later Sharkboy and Lavagirl appear and ask Max to come with them to Planet Drool. They reach Planet Drool via a shark-like spacecraft, where Max learns that the dreamworld is turning bad, courtesy of Mr. Electric (also portrayed by George Lopez), originally the guardian of the dreamworld but now corrupted.Sharkboy and Lavagirl save some children from an out-of-control roller coaster; then, with Max, confront Mr. Electric, who quickly drops them in a part of Planet Drool called the Dream Graveyard where some of Max's dreams have been dumped. They find Tobor (voiced by George Lopez), a robot toy that was never finished being built by Max, but offers them a lift to other parts of the planet. Whilst on the journey, the three form a friendship but they face hardships, such as Sharkboy's anger for the oceans being frozen over, and Lavagirl's desperation to find her true purpose on Planet Drool.

The movie starts by showing what Maggie goes through every day at school. We discover that her best friend Casey (Lily Holleman) is not as unpopular as Maggie is due to her relationship with one of the popular guys. Casey is invited to a party by the boy and accepts the invite on the premise that Maggie is allowed to come as well. The popular boys cringe but don't say anything. At the party Casey is dragged away by her sort of boyfriend, leaving Maggie alone to be laughed at by the preppy click, including Liz (Liz McGeever), a very hated but feared girl at school. Maggie gets food down the front of her shirt and retreats to the kitchen to clean it off (only after being photographed eating in an unflattering manner). From the kitchen she can see Casey and her boyfriend making out in the adjacent hallway before her friend Louis (Fabian C. Moreno) greets her. It is clear that Louis has a thing for Maggie and vice versa.

Answer the following question: How many specials were aired on the series that Buddy Van Horn doubled for Guy Williams on? Answer:","completion":"Answering this question will require us to break it down into multiple parts. First, we need to establish the series in which Buddy Van Horn doubled for Guy Williams. Then, we can find out how many specials were aired during the series. Buddy Van Horn was a well-known stuntman and director in Hollywood, responsible for handling the stunts for several actors in various TV series and movies. Guy Williams, on the other hand, was a popular actor most famous for his roles in the TV series Zorro and Lost in Space. The TV series where Buddy Van Horn doubled for Guy Williams was the 1957-1959 show, Zorro. Produced by Walt Disney, this show starred Guy Williams as Don Diego de la Vega, a man who secretively adopts the identity of the masked vigilante, Zorro, to defend the people of Spanish California against corrupt officials and other villains. Now that we know Buddy Van Horn doubled for Guy Williams in Zorro, we can proceed to find out how many specials were aired during its run. Zorro's initial run (from 1957 to 1959) comprised 78 episodes, split across two seasons. In addition to the regular episodes, Zorro had four hour-long specials aired during the original series run. The four specials in question were: 1. The Secret of El Zorro (1960; aired on Walt Disney's anthology TV series, Walt Disney Presents) 2. Zorro: El Bandido (1960; aired on Walt Disney's anthology TV series, Walt Disney Presents) 3. Zorro: Adios El Cuchillo (1960; aired on Walt Disney's anthology TV series, Walt Disney Presents) 4. Zorro: The Postponed Wedding (1961; aired on the anthology TV series, Walt Disney’s Wonderful World of Color) In conclusion, the series in which Buddy Van Horn doubled for Guy Williams was Zorro, and there were four specials aired during the show's original run."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] and the situation: The fruit harvest was awesome this year, so Mary decided to experiment by candying some raspberries, apricots and apples. She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious. Answer the following question: Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries? Answer:","completion":"Given the background information and the situation, the fruit that Mary candied were raspberries, apricots, and apples. She did not candy plums, cherries, or pears. Since the candying process involves saturating the fruit with sugar, it is the apricots, not the cherries, that are saturated with sugar in this scenario."},{"prompt":"Title: What is forever - Green Grass, Running Water Review: Thomas King captures Native Humor as an excellent tool for teaching, for sharing wisdom and as a means to cope when others cannot grasp the meaning of what Natives have to say.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Moon Jae-in said he urged North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to directly engage with Washington to salvage the June 12 nuclear summit with the U.S., when the two leaders held a surprise second inter-Korean summit Saturday. “I emphasized that the two sides must directly communicate in order to eradicate any misunderstandings, and preliminary talks through working-level negotiations on key agendas are necessary,” said President Moon at a press briefing in Seoul Sunday. North Korea requested the meeting between Kim and Moon after U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday canceled the Singapore summit. Trump said his decision was based on the “tremendous anger and open hostility displayed” by North Korea officials recently over U.S. demands that Pyongyang follow the Libya denuclearization model. North Korea sees that model for rapid and complete denuclearization as a threat to the Kim government’s security, since Libyan leader Moammar Ghadafi was later overthrown and killed by his own people, with support from a multinational military coalition that included the U.S. Pyongyang has called for a more incremental process that links concessions to partial nuclear reductions and postpones complete denuclearization until the North’s security demands are met. Moon met with Kim on the North side of the inter-Korean border, in the same village of Panmunjom where the two leaders held a summit in April. At that meeting, on the south side of the border, the two leaders jointly declared their support for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. On Saturday Moon said Kim reaffirmed his commitment to end his country’s nuclear weapons program, but shared his key concern that the U.S. would work to destabilize his rule despite any security guarantees it offers. “What is uncertain for Chairman Kim Jong Un is not his willingness for denuclearization, but he has concerns over whether North Korea can trust the fact that Washington will end its hostile relations, and guarantee the security... When did Moon Jae-in urge the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un to try to repair relations and have a summit?

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person whose popularity declined markedly in the US after her marriage? is inside the article: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day.

Question: I read this background article the other day: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. I am facing a new situation today: Rob was in his chemistry lab, experimenting with different states of matter. He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which state has less possible arrangements, state A or state B? Answer:","completion":"State A has less possible arrangements compared to state B. This is because state A is in a liquid state, where the particles are still confined to a certain volume and are closer to each other compared to state B, which is in a gaseous state.

After Politkovskaya became widely known in the West, she was commissioned to write Putin's Russia (later subtitled Life in a Failing Democracy), a broader account of her views and experiences after former KGB lieutenant colonel Vladimir Putin became Boris Yeltsin's Prime Minister, and then succeeded him as President of Russia. This included Putin's pursuit of the Second Chechen War.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences. Question: After learning about what happened to the health clinic that offered the narrator a job: Options: - not enough information - The narrator is confused why the health clinic decided to commit illegal acts. - The narrator decided he should look for other job offers in case his organization is also at fault for fraud. - The narrator felt more confident that he made the right choice to accept the other job offer. === The correct answer is A:","completion":"The narrator felt more confident that he made the right choice to accept the other job offer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Thinking about your words allows you to organize your thoughts and prepare to say something meaningful. Especially if you’re about to have an important conversation, make sure your words are organized so that you can say what you mean. Remember that your attitude and tone can communicate quite a lot. Keep your focus narrow and try not to get off topic. If you have trouble saying what you want to say, write down some bullet points to make sure you cover all you want to say. Take an intentional pause before speaking. Very often the instinct is to hurl headlong into a discussion. But purposefully putting in pauses and taking a moment to compose your thoughts before speaking will make it more likely your communication is clear, and your audience ready to listen. Having a person's attention means making sure they are listening and understanding the words you say. Make eye contact and check in to make sure they are listening. If the other person is distracted or in the middle of doing something else, either get their attention or try another time. If they seem distracted by other things, ask for their attention by saying, “I need to make sure you understand this” or, “I’d appreciate your full attention.” If the person seems distracted, say that you’ll talk later when they are more available. For example, if you need to talk to someone yet they’re in the middle of something, let them know that you need to talk and want their attention. Avoid calling out or yelling at people to get attention--go up to them and speak face to face whenever possible. You might assume that people understand what you’re saying or asking them to do. However, clarify anything that the person might be unsure about. For example, if you’re giving directions, clarify anything the person might need to do as prep-work. You may over- or under-estimate the amount of knowledge or ability someone has, so it’s best to ask. This is especially true if you’re talking to someone from a different culture than yourself. You might assume they understand slang or other speech, but it doesn’t hurt to ask. If someone looks confused, try explaining it better. Being courteous in your communication means being open, honest, and kind. You don’t say anything that might be passive-aggressive, sarcastic, or jabbing toward or about the person you’re talking to. Focus on being friendly and saying what you mean in a way that’s easily understood. If you're interrupting other people, being rude, and disrespectful, you will not communicate effectively. Sarcasm can be easily misunderstood. While it may be meant to be humorous, saying the opposite of what you really mean can lead to misunderstandings. People may be confused to what you actually mean. Sarcasm can also inadvertently become mean. Check in with the person to make sure they have understood you. This can be as simple as saying, “Does that make sense?” or, “Do you have any questions?” This gives them the opportunity to voice any concerns or problems they have. This can help people feel comfortable to ask questions or seek clarification. If you’re giving directions, ask them to be repeated back to you to ensure understanding. In some circumstances, it is appropriate to give a quick summary. For example: \\"So I just want to be clear: We're going to address the Garcia account first, then we will do a quick meeting on how to problem solve the communication issues. Got it?\\" Follow-up with the person you’re communicating with to make sure you communicated clearly. For example, if you sent an email, send another asking, “How is everything going? Do you have any questions?” if you spoke to someone, ask them a day or two later, “Just checking in. Everything okay?” If you think you may have miscommunicated, use this time to communicate clearly and clear anything that may be confusing.","completion":"This article says that to communicate well, we should think before we speak, stay focused, be respectful, clear, and kind, ask if others understood, and check in with them later."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Great wasted night stuff. Al Hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs (estate agent???). But how Clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other TV productions of low quality (Grange Hill) or soon to go on to poor quality drama (Eastenders) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable.

China to suspend share flotations The Chinese Government is to suspend all share flotations for a month in order to try to stop a stock market slide and revive interest in future floats. What is this text about?","completion":"This text provides a brief overview of the decision made by the Chinese government to suspend all share flotations, or initial public offerings (IPOs), for a month. This action aims to address a downturn in the stock market and encourage interest in future share flotations among investors. In more detail, stock market slides can lead to widespread negative economic consequences, including reduced market confidence, potential business slowdowns or failures, and lower overall economic growth. Consequently, governments and regulators, such as those in China, may intervene in the market to prevent further declines and stabilize the financial ecosystem. By suspending share flotations for a month, the Chinese government is likely attempting to control the supply of new shares being offered to the public, effectively limiting the market's liquidity. The idea is to mitigate any potential dilution of shares in the market, as releasing too many shares too quickly can result in driving down prices and devaluing existing investments. Moreover, if the government can successfully stop the stock market slide and stabilize investor sentiment, it can create a more favorable environment for upcoming share flotations. This may ensure that when IPOs are reintroduced in the market, there will be a higher likelihood of success in terms of demand for shares, which, in turn, will lead to increased capital, growth, and innovation for companies going public. In summary, the text discusses the Chinese government's decision to halt share flotations for a certain period with the intention of curbing the stock market decline and fostering a positive outlook for future IPOs. This government intervention aims to ultimately protect the financial market stability and promote a more favorable environment for new public offerings, thus benefiting investors and businesses alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But for real, it's not their fault. No outsider can know what our family is really like. They don't hear us laughing over each other's jokes. They don't see us eating our hamburgers with fried rice. They don't know how much fun we have when the six of us dogs included squeeze into one bed and argue about what movies to download from Netflix. I admit it: Having you as a mother was no tea party. There were some play dates I wish I'd gone to and some piano camps I wish I'd got away from. But now that I'm 18 and about to leave the tiger den , I'm glad you and Daddy raised me the way you did. A lot of people have accused you of producing robot kids who can't think for themselves. Well, I came to the opposite conclusion: your strict parenting made me more independent . Everybody's talking about the birthday cards we once made for you, which you refused to take because they weren't good enough. Funny how some people believe that Lulu and I will feel hurt for life. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't put my heart into it. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel hurt at all. There's one more thing: I have come to understand what it really means to live a meaningful life to the fullest. To me, it's about knowing that you've tried your best, body and mind.

When you apply for college, you will have to be honest with yourself and do a bit of research to find the right fit. Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list . This process will be different for everyone. The number of colleges you apply to can vary, from applying to 1 school (not recommended) to 30 schools (not recommended),each applicant can choose how many colleges they apply to. Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee. . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success. Talk to an admissions counselor at your high school if you have questions about this. Step 3: Completing and Sending Applications to Colleges Once your list is complete you are ready to apply to college by completing and sending in applications! College applications take time to complete --you have to write essays, ask for recommendations and get test scores sent to schools--so stay organized! All colleges will require these types of application materials, so start thinking about these items well before October or December. Once you complete and send them, then you have successfully applied to college. To make a list of colleges, you _ . A) needn't consider about your ability B) had better take your academy into account C) are supposed to choose merely one most fit D) are required to pick out more than 30 colleges Answer:","completion":"B) had better take your academy into account"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Two signatures. That's all that's needed to force a wide-ranging House debate — and votes — on border security and the immigration status of 700,000 undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children. Since moderate Republicans opposed House leadership two weeks ago with a rare discharge petition to force a so-called \\"queen of the hill\\" debate (House rule based on the most votes) on immigration, the measure has steadily accumulated support within their own party. The petition needs 218 signatures to start that debate and — with the assumption that all 193 House Democrats will sign on — Republicans need just two more signatures. But that effort now goes on hold as Congress leaves town for an 11-day holiday recess, giving all sides breathing room to figure out what comes next. Many of the 23 Republican signers of the petition face tough re-election races in their districts this November. The debate over Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients has challenged lawmakers since last September, when U.S. President Donald Trump ended the program, calling on Congress to find a permanent legislative solution. Lawmakers will return to Washington facing an immediate deadline. Representative Jeff Denham, a California Republican who is one of the leaders of the petition effort, told reporters that June 7 would be the absolute last moment to allow the petition to mature before lawmakers run up against a seven-week summer recess. Denham said talks with House leadership and the House Freedom Caucus, a conservative voting bloc seeking significant security concessions in return for a citizenship path for DACA recipients, have been productive. \\"We've had an agreement in principle,\\" Denham said of a deal that would provide a 12-year path to citizenship for DACA recipients, known colloquially as Dreamers. \\"Now it's trying to put that information on paper.

Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process that leads to rock breaking apart can be attributed to a combination of physical, chemical, and biological weathering. However, the very first step mostly involves physical weathering, primarily through the freeze-thaw cycle. In this initial step, water enters the cracks and crevices of the rock. When the temperature drops to freezing point, the water inside the rock's cracks expands as it turns into ice. This expansion exerts great pressure on the rock's walls, causing them to widen and deepen. As a result, the cracks in the rock grow larger, making it more susceptible to further weathering by other mechanisms, such as clay expansion or the growth of plants like mosses and lichens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The palace measures 108 metres (354 ft) by 120 metres (390 ft), is 24 metres (79 ft) high and contains over 77,000 m2 (830,000 sq ft) of floorspace. The floor area is smaller than the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, or the Forbidden City. There are 775 rooms, including 19 state rooms, 52 principal bedrooms, 188 staff bedrooms, 92 offices, and 78 bathrooms. The principal rooms are contained on the piano nobile behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear of the palace. The centre of this ornate suite of state rooms is the Music Room, its large bow the dominant feature of the façade. Flanking the Music Room are the Blue and the White Drawing Rooms. At the centre of the suite, serving as a corridor to link the state rooms, is the Picture Gallery, which is top-lit and 55 yards (50 m) long. The Gallery is hung with numerous works including some by Rembrandt, van Dyck, Rubens and Vermeer; other rooms leading from the Picture Gallery are the Throne Room and the Green Drawing Room. The Green Drawing Room serves as a huge anteroom to the Throne Room, and is part of the ceremonial route to the throne from the Guard Room at the top of the Grand Staircase. The Guard Room contains white marble statues of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert, in Roman costume, set in a tribune lined with tapestries. These very formal rooms are used only for ceremonial and official entertaining, but are open to the public every summer. Question: What is the floor space of the palace?","completion":"The floor space of the palace is over 77,000 square metres or 830,000 square feet. It is an extensive space, though it is smaller when compared to several other worldwide renowned palaces such as the Royal Palace of Madrid, the Papal Palace in Rome, the Louvre in Paris, the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, and the Forbidden City. Despite being smaller in comparison, the palace still boasts considerable scale and grandeur. It is a multi-functional space consisting of a series of state rooms, bedrooms, offices, and bathrooms, spread out over its expansive area. Furthermore, a number of these rooms are principally located on the piano nobile, the principal floor of the palace that is placed behind the west-facing garden façade at the rear. Hence, while the main floor area may be less than some other significant global palaces, it still encompasses a remarkable wealth of architectural features, artistic merit, and functional spaces that contribute to its status and reputation.

This article: Nicholas Rodney Drake (19 June 1948 – 25 November 1974) was an English singer-songwriter and musician known for his acoustic guitar-based songs. He failed to find a wide audience during his lifetime, but his work has since achieved wider recognition.Drake signed to Island Records when he was 20, while a student at the University of Cambridge, and released his debut album, Five Leaves Left, in 1969. By 1972, he had recorded two more albums, Bryter Layter and Pink Moon. Neither sold more than 5,000 copies on initial release. His reluctance to perform live or give interviews contributed to his lack of commercial success. No footage of the adult Drake has been released, only still photographs.Drake is believed to have suffered from depression, reflected in his lyrics. After making Pink Moon, he withdrew from performance and recording, retreating to his parents' home in rural Warwickshire. At the age of 26, Drake died from an overdose of approximately 30 amitriptyline pills, a prescribed antidepressant. His cause of death was determined as suicide.The 1979 release of the retrospective album Fruit Tree triggered a reassessment of Drake's music. By the mid-1980s, he was credited as an influence by such artists as Robert Smith, David Sylvian, and Peter Buck. In 1985, the Dream Academy reached the UK and US charts with \\"Life in a Northern Town\\", a song written for and dedicated to Drake. By the early 1990s, he had come to represent a \\"doomed romantic\\" musician in the UK music press. The first Drake biography was published in 1997, followed in 1998 by the documentary film A Stranger Among Us. In 1999, his song \\"Pink Moon\\" was used in a Volkswagen commercial, resulting in an increase in his U.S. album sales.

In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year. A great amount of time and effort is spent to try to limit or prevent corrosion. Paragraph: Jordan is conducting an experiment to see how Iron rusts. He first takes Iron Bar A and puts it out on his porch on a rainy day. Then he puts Iron bar B in an airtight bag and removes all of the oxygen and air to vacuum seal it. After some time passes the bar he left outside is completely covered in rust. He removes the bar in the vacuum sealed bag and to his surprise it has no rust at all. Because there was no oxygen and water in the air tight bag, iron bar B has no rust at all. Iron bar A was exposed to a lot of water and oxygen and there for it rusted completely.

Q:- Coal is heated in the boiler - The water tank over the boiler is heated - Creates steam - The steam is funneled to the piston - Piston uses the steam as energy What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"The last step of the process would likely be the conversion of the energy from the steam into mechanical energy through the movement of the piston. As the steam pushes against the piston, the piston moves, and this motion can then be used to perform work, such as propelling a steam locomotive or operating a piece of machinery. After exerting its energy, the steam then cools down and condenses back into water. This condensed water can be recycled back into the boiler to start the process all over again, making it an efficient cycle. It's important to note that this process is what typically happens in a steam engine where a heat source is applied to a closed system, causing the water to vaporize into steam, that steam then does work on the piston, and the whole process continues in a cyclic manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence? ? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

The Dutch garrison of Recife was increased in March 1640 by 2,500 soldiers carried aboard 28 ships under Amidrals Cornelis Jol and Jan Lichthart, who was in charge of naval operations to disrupt the Portuguese sugar trade. In December Portugal revolted against the Spanish Habsburg rule, proclaiming the seventh Duke of Bragança as King João IV in place of Philip IV of Spain. Although the Dutch welcomed the news of the revolt, expecting the Portuguese to become their allies, this did not happen, as the Dutch had no wish to restore the occupied territories to Portugal. Recife served as base for an expedition under Jol and Lichthart, in 1641, to seize Portugal's slaving depots in Angola before any treaty could be concluded in Europe, and despite a ten-year truce between both countries that was signed on 12 June, the hostilities continued, resulting in the expulsion of the Dutch from Brazil in 1654.

Community Reacts to West Philadelphia Rampage Shooting NBC10's Aundrea Cline-Thomas spoke to community members as well as the Philly FOP about Friday's deadly shooting rampage in West Philadelphia. (Published Monday, Sept. 19, 2016) Police say Nicholas Glenn took a handgun with obliterated serial number and a cache of extra magazines and began his rampage after 11 p.m. Friday on Sansom Street near 52nd in West Philadelphia. In the span of a few minutes, Glenn shot two police officers and four civilians, leaving one young woman with injuries that would later kill her. Investigation Into Shooting Rampage That Wounded 2 Officers, 4 Others Turns to Motive Two days after a rampaging gunman opened fire in West Philadelphia, wounding two police officers, killing a young woman and leaving three other people injured, police are still trying to determine what sparked the shooting. Nicholas Glenn, whom police identified as the shooter, died in a conrfontation with police just after the mass shooting. NBC10's Lauren Mayk is outside Police Headquarters with the very latest on the investigation.

Unfortunately, we may never know.\\" Police were interviewing Glenn's relatives and friends in hopes of determining what led him to go on his rampage, shooting random people whom he didn't even know. Investigators also want to know where Glenn got the 9mm handgun he used, but tracing it will be a more daunting task without the weapon's serial number.

(Published Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016) Glenn, 25, allegedly mentioned his parole officer in the letter that police found after shooting him dead in an alley near 48th and Sansom streets. Ross said he has no apparent ties to any larger organization. Nicholas Glenn Photo credit: Philadelphia Police The rampage started about 11:20 p.m. Friday when Glenn walked up to Sgt. Sylvia Young's marked police cruiser on 52nd and Sansom streets. Young, who is assigned to the 22nd District, was working a patrol detail in the 18th District. As Young sat inside her vehicle, Glenn opened fire at the driver's side, police said.

Audio of Police Officers During Gunman's Rampage in West Philly Philadelphia Police Sgt. Sylvia Young can be heard yelling for help over police radio. Later, another officer declares, \\"He is down and in custody.\\" (Published Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016) Ross said it's a miracle the 19-year veteran wasn't killed, considering Glenn fired 18 rounds before he started his seemingly random shooting spree east on Sansom Street. Following the shooting, Young was taken to Penn-Presbyterian Hospital where she was in stable condition. NBC10 obtained surveillance video that sources say shows Glenn walking away shortly after shooting Young. As Glenn continued walking, he passed the Maximum Level Lounge on 5118 Sansom Street, where a 42-year-old manager and a 41-year-old bartender were in the open doorway attending to a wheelchair-bound patron, police said. Glenn then fired about five rounds into the doorway, striking the manager in both legs and the woman in the right ankle. The two victims were taken to Penn-Presbyterian Hospital, where they were listed in stable condition. Glenn then continued running eastbound on Sansom Street and approached a 2011 Nissan Altima with a 36-year-old man and 27-year-old Sara Salih inside. Police say Glenn opened fire, striking the man in his arm and chest and Salih several times in her chest. Both victims were taken to Penn-Presbyterian Hospital, where Salih succumbed to her injuries. The man was in critical condition. New Details on Suspect in West Philly Shooting Rampage We're learning more about the slain suspect in a rampage shooting that left a woman dead and five people, including two police officers in West Philadelphia. NBC10's Deanna Durante has the details. (Published Saturday, Sept. 17, 2016) Glenn then continued eastbound on Sansom Street and was pursued by two 16th District officers in a marked police Ford Explorer, officials said. Glenn opened fire on the officers, striking their vehicle on the hood and driver's side door, according to police. The officers were not injured during the shooting. Glenn continued running from police and was confronted in the 100 block of South 48th Street by University of Pennsylvania Police officer Edward Miller, police said.

Glenn then continued exchanging gunfire with the responding officers. Glenn was struck several times during the shootout and finally died from his wounds at 11:45 p.m., officials said. Police say Glenn was in possession of a note with the headline, \\"Doomed People.\\" They also said the note included rambling, unclear statements that indicated Glenn's hatred toward his probation/parole officers as well as police. \\"It is rambling,\\" Ross said. \\"It would be very difficult to glean anything from that. It's more about himself than it is about who he wanted to harm.\\" Police recovered Glenn's weapon, a Ruger Model SR9, 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Officials say the gun was loaded with 14 live 9mm rounds. There were also three empty magazines throughout the scene that Glenn had discarded as he emptied the magazines and reloaded, police said. In all, Glenn discharged his gun at least 51 times during the incident, according to investigators. Young and Miller were awake and talking with relatives after being hospitalized, Mayor Jim Kenney said. \\"[Miller] actually was cracking jokes with his kids and wife. The other officer [Young] was talking with her family,\\" Kenney said. \\"We’re very blessed that that’s the way it turned out. But we have to keep in our prayers the civilians.\\" Penn Safety Director Maureen Rush said Miller served 33 years on the Philadelphia police department, retiring as a sergeant, before joining the Penn PD. Ross, who termed the shooter's note a \\"bunch of rantings,\\" said officers would patrol in pairs following the incident. Kenney asked that everyone pray for the injured officers and civilians. \\"All in all it was a really terrible, scary night,\\" he said.

Police sources told NBC10 Glenn had a lengthy criminal record and was arrested more than a dozen times. Glenn's attorney Anthony Petrone also told NBC10 that he spent much of his prison time in solitary due to fighting. “I did notice with him a serious change in his attitude and overall demeanor during the period of time that he was incarcerated up in the county prison,” Petrone said. “I remember visiting him frequently and he had to be pulled out of solitary and I remember he was having a very difficult time in dealing with the solitary confinement.” ||||| PHILADELPHIA (AP) — A wild chase and shootout through the streets of West Philadelphia left two police officers and four civilians wounded and a suspect fatally shot.

Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead.

I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids. My daughter told me she could not stand to go to the movies with me because I used to cry during movies. She never forgets one time I got emotional during a movie “Spirit” my husband and I took her to when she was little.

Broad shallow seas advanced across central North America (the Western Interior Seaway) and Europe, then receded late in the period, leaving thick marine deposits sandwiched between coal beds. At the peak of the Cretaceous transgression, one-third of Earth's present land area was submerged. The Cretaceous is justly famous for its chalk; indeed, more chalk formed in the Cretaceous than in any other period in the Phanerozoic. Mid-ocean ridge activity—or rather, the circulation of seawater through the enlarged ridges—enriched the oceans in calcium; this made the oceans more saturated, as well as increased the bioavailability of the element for calcareous nanoplankton. These widespread carbonates and other sedimentary deposits make the Cretaceous rock record especially fine. Famous formations from North America include the rich marine fossils of Kansas's Smoky Hill Chalk Member and the terrestrial fauna of the late Cretaceous Hell Creek Formation. Other important Cretaceous exposures occur in Europe and China. In the area that is now India, massive lava beds called the Deccan Traps were laid down in the very late Cretaceous and early Paleocene.\\", answer the following question.

Q:Fertilization occurs when sperm swim to an egg inside an archegonium, and archegonium secretes sucrose to attract the sperm. Given these facts, sucrose attracts sperm to the what for fertilization among the following options: - egg - ovum - omelet - nest - male - ova - uterus - pistil A:","completion":"Sucrose attracts sperm to the egg for fertilization. Fertilization is a critical process in sexual reproduction, where a sperm cell from the male fuses with an egg cell from the female, resulting in the formation of a diploid zygote. This event ensures the continuation of the species by enabling the transfer and combination of genetic material to produce a new generation of offspring. In the context provided, we can examine each of the given options and understand why the egg is the correct answer: 1. Egg: The correct answer. Sperm are attracted to the egg inside the archegonium, where they swim to meet and fertilize it, ultimately leading to a successful reproduction process. 2. Ovum: Although \\"ovum\\" is another term for the egg cell, in the context of the statement provided, it specified that sperm are attracted to the egg within the archegonium. 3. Omelet: An omelet is a food item prepared from beaten eggs cooked with various ingredients such as vegetables, cheese, or meat. It is unrelated to the process of fertilization. 4. Nest: A nest is a structure built by animals, primarily birds, to hold their eggs, offspring, or the animal itself. It has no connection to the process of sperm being attracted to the egg for fertilization. 5. Male: The male is the organism contributing the sperm for fertilization. The male is not the attraction point for sperm but is instead the source of the sperm swimming towards the egg. 6. Ova: Ova is the plural form of ovum, referring to multiple egg cells. Despite being related to egg cells, the context provided specifies that sperm are attracted to the egg inside the archegonium for fertilization. 7. Uterus: The uterus is the muscular organ in females where the fertilized egg implants and develops into an embryo, and later, a fetus. While it plays a crucial role in reproduction, it is not involved in the process of attracting sperm with sucrose, as described in the statement. 8. Pistil: The pistil is the female reproductive part of a flower in angiosperms (flowering plants). It is composed of the stigma, style, and ovary. In the context of the statement, sucrose is used to attract sperm in an archegonium (which is found in non-flowering plants, like bryophytes and ferns), making this option incorrect. In conclusion, sucrose attracts sperm to the egg for fertilization, as mentioned in the initial statement. The other options presented do not accurately reflect the specific context of sperm attraction and fertilization involving the release of sucrose within the archegonium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
