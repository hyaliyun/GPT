Article: After almost 30 years of arguing that a black hole swallows up everything that falls into it, British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking moved backward last week. The world-famous writer of \\"Brief History of Time\\" said he and other scientists had got it wrong. \\"I've been thinking about this problem for the last 30 years, and I think I now have the answer to it,\\" said Hawking. \\"A black hole only appears to form but later opens up and set free information about what fell inside. So we can be sure of the past and can predict the future.\\" The findings could help solve the \\"black hole information paradox \\", an important puzzle in modern physics. A black hole is an area in space where matter is under such pressure that even light can not escape from its gravitational pull . But, exactly what happens there has long puzzled scientists. Black holes occur when a powerful star burns up its nuclear fuel and gravity forces it to break down in on itself. The great weight of the star's outer layers moves in towards its center. The force of gravity keeps nearly all light from escaping and nothing inside can be seen from the outside. The star actually disappears from the universe into a point of infinite density . That is a place where the laws of general relativity that govern space and time break down. Hawking has devoted most of his life to studying these questions. At the beginning, _ believed the holes were like a \\"universal vacuum cleaner\\", sucking up everything in their path. Hawking revolutionized the study of black holes when he proved, in 1976 that, under the strange rules of quantum physics , when black holes form they send out energy and lose mass in the process. In thinking up this so-called \\"Hawking radiation\\", the prefix = st1 /Cambridgemathematician also created one of the biggest puzzles in physics. These particles , he said, contained no information about what has been occurring inside the black hole, or how it formed. Under his theory, once the black hole disappears, all the information within it is lost. Answer: They could help solve the puzzle about black holes. A:","completion":"Part #1: British astrophysicist Stephen Hawking changed his viewpoint on black holes. Usage: Hawking revised his opinion that black holes swallow up everything that falls into them. He spent 30 years researching this topic and concluded that black holes can actually release information about what fell inside them. Part #2: A black hole only appears to form but later opens up and sets free information about what fell inside. Usage: A black hole was believed to trap and swallow everything, but Hawking discovered that it can reveal information about the trapped objects, enabling scientists to predict the past and the future based on the contents. Part #3: The importance of the puzzle in modern physics. Usage: The answer to the black hole information paradox helps advance our understanding of physics, especially regarding black hole formation and behavior. Part #4: Black holes are created when a massive star burns up its nuclear fuel and collapses.

This Act may be cited as the \`\`Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act''. SEC. 2. FINDINGS. Congress finds that: (1) Consent decrees are for remedying violations of rights, and they should not be used to advance any policy extraneous to the protection of those rights. (2) Consent decrees are also for protecting the party who faces injury and should not be expanded to apply to parties not involved in the litigation. (3) In structuring consent decrees, courts should take into account the interests of State and local governments in managing their own affairs. (4) Consent decrees should be structured to give due deference to the policy judgments of State and local officials as to how to obey the law. (5) Whenever possible, courts should not impose consent decrees that require technically complex and evolving policy choices, especially in the absence of judicially discoverable and manageable standards. (6) Consent decrees should not be unlimited, but should contain an explicit and realistic strategy for ending court supervision. SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CONSENT DECREES. (a) In General.--Chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: \`\`Sec. 1660.

(b) Technical and Conforming Amendment.--The table of sections for chapter 111 of title 28, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the following: \`\`Sec. 1660. Consent decrees.''. SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE. The amendments made by this Act shall take effect on the date of enactment of this Act and apply to all consent decrees regardless of-- (1) the date on which the final order of a consent decree is entered; or (2) whether any relief has been obtained under a consent decree before the date of enactment of this Act.","completion":"The Federal Consent Decree Fairness Act aims to regulate the use and enforcement of consent decrees in legal cases involving US States and local governments. The key provisions of the Act are: 1. Consent decrees must only be used to remedy violations of rights and not to advance unrelated policies. 2. Consent decrees should protect injured parties and not extend to others uninvolved in the litigation. 3. Courts should consider the interests of State and local governments in managing their own affairs when structuring decrees. 4. Consent decrees should respect the policy judgments of State and local officials on how to obey the law. 5. Courts should avoid imposing decrees that require complex and constantly changing policy decisions. 6. Consent decrees should have a clear and realistic strategy for ending court supervision. The Act states that a State or local government or official can file a motion to modify or vacate a consent decree after four years from its implementation or after the term of the highest elected official who consented to the decree. The party that filed the original civil action must then prove that the continued enforcement of the decree is necessary to uphold a federal right.

The Mom of Betty has passed away, but Katrina's is still living, so","completion":"Katrina's mother has naturally taken on a more significant role in both of their lives. As the two friends navigate through the various stages of grief and acceptance, they find comfort and solace in their shared experiences and the warmth that Katrina's mother provides. Over time, Katrina's mother comes to consider Betty as her own daughter, showering her with the same love and affection that she had reserved for Katrina. For Betty, having lost her own mother, this new bond brings a sense of belonging that had been missing in her life. Meanwhile, for Katrina, seeing her mother extend such kindness towards her friend fills her heart with immense gratitude and strengthens their friendship even more. Apart from the emotional support that Katrina's mother offers, she also lends a helping hand in practical matters. From accompanying the girls to school events and shopping for essentials, to guiding them through important life decisions, she becomes a steadfast presence in their lives. In many ways, this nurturing figure plays an essential role in helping Betty overcome the immense void left by her mother's demise. As the years pass, the bond between the three of them only grows stronger. They share countless memories together, from celebrating graduations and birthdays, to comforting each other in times of heartbreak. It is evident that the love between Katrina, Betty, and Katrina's mother transcends the boundaries of blood relations, and has instead bloomed into a beautiful, chosen family. With the passage of time, both Betty and Katrina grow into confident and compassionate young women, their paths uniquely shaped by the nurturing presence of Katrina's mother. Even as they pursue their individual dreams and ambitions, they never lose sight of the love and support that has been their constant anchor, always coming back to one another and to the mother figure who unconditionally tied them together. Eventually, the day comes when Katrina's mother grows old and frail, and it is now Betty and Katrina's turn to take on the responsibility of caring for her. United by their love and gratitude, the two friends tirelessly look after their beloved mother figure, who graciously accepts their support, just as she had given them in their time of need. And through the inevitable heartaches and challenges that come with life, the unbreakable bond between Betty, Katrina, and Katrina's mother endures, a testament to the transcendent power of friendship, love, and the families we create for ourselves. As they continue to face life's many ups and downs, they always find strength in their shared connection, a true embodiment of the saying that friends who become family are among life's most precious gifts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:It is the biggest game in English football and a massive occasion for his first United appearance - if he features at Old Trafford. But the very fact I am wondering whether Martial will start, or even play at all, says a lot about the £36m transfer and suggests that United have paid such a massive initial fee for his potential, rather than anything he has done in his career so far. Martial is 19, and before the start of this season had only completed four first-team games for Monaco. He has played a total of 30 minutes of senior international football for France, all in the past week. Like myself, not many United fans will have seen much of him in action but, starting this weekend, he is going to be under major scrutiny because of how much he has cost, his record up to this point and the fact a club of their size has signed him. The pressure will be immense. So I hope that he proves to be the absolute gem of a player that United think they have bought, for his own sake and for the sake of English football too. Media playback is not supported on this device Otherwise, United spending so much on a teenager who has scored only 11 goals in 52 matches in Ligue 1 will just be used to show how the money in our game has gone completely crazy. At the moment, that is what most people seem to be thinking. His fee could rise to £58m and every single former player I have spoken to has been amazed by how much he has cost considering how little football he has played. On paper, what he has done is not that impressive either. If Martial had scored 25-30 goals I would be thinking 'that's only in Ligue 1' and he has not even got close to that. His goalscoring record does not say to me that he is going to be the new Sergio Aguero, but I am hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I am not on my own in not knowing what to expect from him, let alone where he will play, but being a bit of an unknown quantity will help him against Liverpool. So far, Martial has said all the right things in interviews and, considering he has joined one of the biggest clubs in the world, he seems to be dealing with everything pretty well. It is on the pitch where he will be judged, though, and it could be that this weekend he goes 'bang' - with a performance that shouts \\"here I am, and this is what I can do\\". That could happen, especially in a team like United's. They will create chances and, if Martial has got the strength and pace I keep hearing about, then he could have a big impact very quickly. I hope he does, because it would be great for the Premier League to have a new star. The best scenario, especially for a forward player, is obviously that he hits the ground running at his new club by scoring some goals straightaway. There was pressure on me when I joined Arsenal for what was then a club record fee of £2.5m in September 1991 but I scored in my first game, got a hat-trick in my second and never looked back. Any pressure disappeared and, instead, I was full of confidence. The way I looked at it then was that I could go four games without scoring and my average would still be good but the way I was feeling, I knew more goals would come - and they did. Not every player gets off to a flying start like I did at Arsenal. Also for the Gunners, Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp both had to wait a while to get off the mark. I have heard Martial being compared to Henry a lot because of his playing style and the way he can come off the left or right wing as well as down the middle. That is great if it is true and, if he is not an out-and-out striker, he will need to be able to make goals for others like Henry could. Yes, those comparisons add even more pressure but they are inevitable because both players left Monaco at a young age and came to England for big money - Henry had a brief spell at Juventus in between, but his £10.5m fee was the third-biggest in English football when he came to Highbury in 1999. Henry, who was a couple of years older than Martial and a lot more experienced at first-team level, scored 26 goals in his first season for Arsenal, but did not find the net until his ninth game for the club. There is an argument that Henry's early days are an example of why Martial will need time before showing us what he can do. That is true, but I still saw Henry's ability in those first few games. I had left Arsenal by then but on his left foot or right foot, he had skill and athleticism and was such a dynamic player. He was not scoring goals but I remember looking at him and thinking 'wow - when he kicks in, he is going to be awesome'. In Memphis Depay, United already have one young player who makes me think the same whenever I watch him. You can see Memphis is not quite firing on all cylinders at the moment but there is still something really explosive building up in him, and you can tell he is going to do something special soon. What I saw from Thierry and what we are seeing now from Memphis is what I want from Martial on Saturday. It would be even better if he can nick a goal or two as well. One thing that Martial can rely on at his new club is that his team-mates will look after him and help him as much as they can, especially because of his age, his price tag and the fact he has moved to a different country. Even a player of Bergkamp's experience needed that while he settled in. He went six games without scoring after joining Arsenal for a British record fee of £7.5m in 1995, but we were unbeaten during that time and I scored four goals, which took a lot of the pressure off him. Media playback is not supported on this device You can be sure that Wayne Rooney will look to do the same for Martial and I think it is brilliant news for United that he has just broken Sir Bobby Charlton's record as England's top goalscorer. Rooney has had a difficult start to the Premier League season but his international goals in the past week will have lifted a weight off his shoulders and, whether Martial plays or not, I think Liverpool could feel the backlash of that at the weekend. Ian Wright was speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.

The pressure is immense, and the coming weeks will likely reveal whether Martial proves to be an exceptional talent, helping to shape the future of English football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Watling Street is the name given to an ancient trackway in England and Wales that was first used by the Britons mainly between the areas of modern Canterbury and using a natural ford near Westminster. The Romans later paved the route, which then connected the Kentish ports of Dubris (Dover), Rutupiae (Richborough), Lemanis (Lympne), and Regulbium (Reculver) to their bridge over the Thames at Londinium (London). The continuation northwest passed Verulamium (St Albans) on its way to Viroconium (Wroxeter). The Romans considered the continuation on to Blatobulgium (Birrens) beyond Hadrian's Wall to be part of the same route, leading some scholars to call this Watling Street as well, although others restrict it to the southern leg. Watling Street was the site of Boudica's defeat by the Romans and the southwestern border of the Danelaw. In the early 19th century, the course between London and the sea was paved and became known as the Great Dover Road. Today, the route from Dover to London forms part of the A2 road and the route from London to Wroxeter forms much of the A5 road. - Loughborough (or ) is a town within the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England. It is the seat of Charnwood Borough Council and home to Loughborough University.

Question: Title: SLEEPER PRODUCT, MORE HEALTHFUL THAN THE REST Product review: Came across this sports drink in a health food store. No, the makers do not endorse a sports team, does not have that transverse blue line on the can (which took that other company a full year to decide on).That being said, full disclosure of the ingredients show natural ingredients. Blue agave, a low glycemic sweetener taken from the same plant that is used to produce tequila, replaces refined sugar and aspartame. The color is derived from vegetables.The taste? Not any worse than the name brand, so the only question is which do you prefer to run through your bloodstream?The fact there are only eight reviews shows a clear need for this company to hire a branding expert. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review depicts the product in a generally flattering light.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Hardy was born in Cameron, North Carolina, the son of Gilbert and Ruby Moore Hardy. He is the older brother of Jeff Hardy. Their mother died of brain cancer in 1986. Hardy played baseball as a child and throughout high school, but had stopped by his senior year. Shortly after the departure of Matt and Jeff from TNA was made public, Matt's wife, Reby, went on a social media tirade in which she repeatedly slammed TNA, the company's new management and the way in which contract negotiations between the company and the Hardy family were conducted. A few weeks following this, the bad blood between the two sides intensified, so much so that the new management of TNA (now renamed Impact Wrestling) Anthem Sports & Entertainment issued a cease and desist letter to The Hardys' new promotion Ring of Honor (ROH), in which Anthem essentially ordered ROH as well as any broadcasting company airing ROH's 15th Anniversary pay-per-view show (on which The Hardys were to participate in a match) to not in any way speak of, indicate or acknowledge the existence of the Broken Matt and Brother Nero characters and instead to refer to The Hardys as simply Matt Hardy and Jeff Hardy. The issue with this is that while The Hardys were in TNA, they had full creative control over the Broken gimmick, with them even filming their own segments to air on TNA programming in some circumstances, thus making the Hardy family (in their belief) the owners of the Broken gimmick. It is believed that civil litigation will follow and a potential court hearing will take place regarding the final outcome on who owns the Broken gimmick: Anthem or the Hardy family. Until then, the status of the Broken gimmick remains undecided. Despite this, Matt continues to use the Broken gimmick through his social media accounts, but neither him or Jeff use the Broken gimmick at any professional wrestling shows for ROH or on the independent circuit, presumably until the results of the expected legal proceedings have been finalized. Newly-appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Broken gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan, and while Borash specifically had the most input into the gimmick of the three aside from Matt, the Hardy family deny that Borash was the sole person behind the gimmick. In November 2017, Impact Wrestling changed their policy, allowing all talent to retain complete ownership over their intellectual property, essentially forfeiting ownership of the \\"Broken\\" character to Hardy. On January 31, 2018, the legal battle officially concluded when Matt legally acquired ownership of all trademarks related to the Broken universe and the Broken gimmick, which includes 'Broken Matt', 'Brother Nero', 'Broken Brilliance' and 'Vanguard1'. Matt is now able to use the Broken gimmick as he sees fit, regardless of the promotion he competes in with the one caveat being that the promotion green-lights the use of the gimmick in that promotion, which includes major domestic U.S. promotions such as WWE or ROH. Who else claims to own the broken gimmick?","completion":"\\"Newly-appointed Impact Wrestling President Ed Nordholm credits the invention of and the vision behind the Broken gimmick to Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana and Billy Corgan.\\" This quote suggests that aside from the Hardy family, Ed Nordholm of Impact Wrestling and the mentioned individuals - Jeremy Borash, Dave Lagana, and Billy Corgan - have also claimed to have ownership over the Broken gimmick."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER IV THE WAY INTO PRINT Sam Cotting's General Store at Millville divided importance with Bob West's hardware store but was a more popular loafing place for the sparse population of the tiny town. The post office was located in one corner and the telephone booth in another, and this latter institution was regarded with much awe by the simple natives. Once in awhile some one would telephone over to the Junction on some trivial business, but the long-distance call was never employed except by the \\"nabobs\\"--the local name for John Merrick and his nieces--or by the manager of the new mill at Royal, who had extended the line to his own office in the heart of the pine forest. So, when Uncle John and the girls entered Cotting's store and the little gentleman shut himself up in the telephone booth, a ripple of excitement spread throughout the neighborhood. Skim Clark, the youthful hope of the Widow Clark, who \\"run the Emporium,\\" happened to be in the store and he rushed out to spread the news that \\"the nabob's talkin' to New Yoruk!\\" This information demanded immediate attention. Marshall McMahon McNutt, familiarly known as \\"Peggy\\" McNutt--because he had once lost a foot in a mowing machine--and who was alleged to be a real estate agent, horse doctor, fancy poultry breeder and palmist, and who also dabbled in the sale of subscription books, life insurance, liniment and watermelons, quickly slid off his front porch across the way and sauntered into Cotting's to participate in the excitement. Seth Davis, the blacksmith, dropped his tools and hurried to the store, and the druggist three doors away--a dapper gentleman known as Nib Corkins--hurriedly locked his door and attended the meeting. Presently the curious group was enlarged by the addition of Nick Thome the liveryman, Lon Taft, a carpenter and general man-of-all-work, and Silas Caldwell the miller, the latter a serious individual who had \\"jest happened to come acrost from the mill in the nick o' time.\\" Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. who used long-distance calls? 2. what was the name of the town? 3. what was nabob the local name for? 4. whose store was more popular, Sam's or Bob's? 5. was it a specific store or a general store? 6. what did people like to do there? 7. who went in the telephone booth? 8. did it cause excitement? 9. whose nickname was Peggy? 10. who was Widow Clark related to? 11. were they the one who talked about the phone call? 12. how many professions was Peggy alleged to have? 13. what chopped off his foot? 14. what was Nick Thome's job? 15. was Peggy excited? 16. where did he go to participate? 17. did Seth Davis also go? 18. what were they doing?","completion":"1.

What happens to the amount of oxygen contained in the water as the temperature increases increases or decreases? Assuming that: Warm water cant hold as much dissolved oxygen as cool water, so an increase in the temperature of water decreases the amount of oxygen it contains. Answer:","completion":"As the temperature of the water increases, the amount of dissolved oxygen in the water decreases. Step 1: Jimbo heats a pot of water on his stove, which causes the water temperature to rise. Rationale: Heating the pot increases the kinetic energy of the water molecules, causing an increase in temperature. Step 2: As the water temperature increases, its ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases, in accordance with the given assumption. Rationale: The solubility of oxygen in water decreases with an increase in temperature. This is because the increased kinetic energy of the water molecules makes it more difficult for them to maintain bonds with oxygen molecules. Step 3: Since the water's ability to hold dissolved oxygen decreases as temperature increases, the amount of oxygen contained in the water will decrease. Rationale: As the water loses its ability to hold oxygen, the dissolved oxygen will leave the water, either by being released into the atmosphere or used up by aerobic organisms in the water, which further lowers the remaining oxygen concentration in the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jafar, the Grand Vizier of the Sultan, and his parrot Iago, seek the lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders but is told that only a âdiamond in the roughâ may enter. Jafar identifies a street urchin named Aladdin as worthy. Aladdin and his pet monkey Abu cross paths with Princess Jasmine, who has run away from the palace, unwilling to be married off to another snobbish suitor. Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and fall in love, but Jafar has Aladdin apprehended, tricking Jasmine into thinking that he was decapitated. Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu, taking them to the Cave and promises to reward them if they retrieve the lamp. Inside, Aladdin befriends a magic carpet. Abu greedily tries to steal a jewel, despite the Caveâs request, and it collapses.

Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them from the Cave without wasting a wish, and then uses his first to become a prince to be near Jasmine. Jafar, on Iagoâs suggestion, plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine, but Aladdin parades into the city as âPrince Ali of Ababwaâ. However, Jasmine is unimpressed with Aladdinâs bravado.

Anis Mohamed Youssef Ferchichi (born 28 September 1978), better known as Bushido, is a German rapper, producer and entrepreneur in real estate industry. The word \\"bushido\\" is Japanese and means \\"Way of the Warrior\\". He also uses the pseudonym Sonny Black, based on Dominic Napolitano. In 2004, he and fellow rapper D- Bushido provoked much discussion through his use of controversial song lyrics, which can be interpreted as being misogynistic, homophobic, sexist and violence-glorifying. For example, the song \\"Nutte Bounce\\", from his demo album King of KingZ (2001), frequently uses the term \\"Nutte\\" (German for prostitute or \\"bitch\\"). When questioned, Bushido explained that he doesn't mean women in general but rather the \\"real bitches\\". The song \\"Berlin\\" from his debut Vom Bordstein bis zur Skyline (2003) has the following line, which can be interpreted as homophobic: In November 2005, Bushido hit the headlines after he made a scornful remark about Paris Hilton in an interview with net.zeitung.de: \\"She is just a stupid piece of meat... I would like to have her for the sexual act: humiliating and then bye.\\" On ersguterjunge Sampler Vol. 2 - Vendetta (2006) he made a reference to Natascha Kampusch on the song \\"Eine Nummer fur sich\\", which has been criticized as \\"crude\\". Quoted as following: In late August 2007, it also caused a lot criticism against Bushido's involvement on the concert Schau nicht weg, a campaign against violence at schools, organized by Bravo and VIVA. The critics argue that Bushido could not count as a role model because of his \\"homophobic and anti-women lyrics\\". But since 2006 he was, according to Bravo, very involved in the project, so his live performance could not be canceled. During the performance, Bushido appealed in an aggressive manner to a small group of homosexual protesters by saying: \\"You fuckers can demonstrate, hang yourself - I don't give a shit\\". This led to more criticism and controversy. In June 2009, after participants of the Kreuzberg Pride spotted Bushido on the Berlin U-Bahn Schlesisches Tor, a verbal conflict ensued between the rapper and the participants in which Bushido insulted individuals by referring to their sexual orientation. As result, he and his entourage were splashed with drinks and the organizers of the pride sued him for libel.

Moreover, it inhibited the establishment of broader economic linkages internally and with other parts of the world, as it redirected energies towards slave hunting and keeping rather than state-building or productive activities.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is that the isotope is unstable. An unstable isotope, also known as a radioactive isotope or radioisotope, has an imbalance of protons and neutrons in its nucleus, causing it to be unstable.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian. In Darwin's lifetime, Origin was published in Swedish in 1871, Danish in 1872, Polish in 1873, Hungarian in 1873–1874, Spanish in 1877 and Serbian in 1878.

A:","completion":"There could be several reasons why Cameron supported the view that pizza is the best food, given the context. Here, I'll provide a detailed analysis of various potential factors that might have influenced Cameron's decision: 1. Personal preference: One of the primary reasons Cameron might have supported the notion that pizza is the best food is because of their own personal preference. People tend to be passionate about the food they love, and Cameron's personal taste might have played a significant role in their decision to support the view. 2. Versatility of pizza: Pizza is a highly versatile food that can cater to different tastes, preferences, and dietary restrictions. The endless possibilities of toppings and crusts make pizza a favorite choice among many people. This versatility may have resonated with Cameron, leading them to believe that pizza is the best food. 3. Popularity and social influence: Pizza is a popular food choice worldwide, and its appeal cuts across various age groups, cultures, and demographics. The social influence of pizza as a beloved food might have swayed Cameron's opinion, encouraging them to support the view that pizza is the best food. 4. Convenience and ease of access: Pizzas are easily accessible, and they can be delivered to your doorstep or picked up from a nearby pizza place. The convenience factor might have made Cameron appreciate pizza more, leading them to believe that it's the best food. 5. Emotional attachment or nostalgia: The preference for pizza might also be rooted in Cameron's memories, emotions, or nostalgia associated with the food. Perhaps they've shared special moments with their family, friends, or loved ones while enjoying pizza, which might have made them feel emotionally attached to it and consequently support the view that it's the best food. 6. Nutritional aspects: Although not the healthiest choice on its own, pizza can be nutritionally balanced if made with wholesome ingredients such as whole-grain crust, fresh vegetables, lean proteins, and moderate amounts of cheese. Cameron might be aware of these healthier options, which might have made them more inclined to support the view that pizza is the best food. 7. Cultural or regional pride: It's possible that Cameron might have close ties with the Italian culture or a specific region where pizza is highly regarded. Their support for the view that pizza is the best food might be a reflection of their cultural or regional pride. 8. Shared opinion and solidarity: Lastly, Cameron might have supported the view simply because they wanted to express solidarity with their peers or associates who are also passionate about pizza. By agreeing that pizza is the best food, Cameron may have strengthened their connection and bond with the people who share this belief. In summary, Cameron's support for the view that pizza is the best food may have been influenced by various factors, including personal preference, versatility, popularity, convenience, emotional attachment, nutritional benefits, cultural aspects, and a desire to connect with others who share this opinion. Without knowing more about the specific context and Cameron's personal experiences, it's impossible to pinpoint a single reason for their support. However, considering these factors can help elucidate the possible influences behind Cameron's decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A physical change involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points. Extensive properties depend on the amount of material and include mass and volume. The ratio of two extensive properties, mass and volume, is an important intensive property called density.

Justification of steps: 1. Less body movement occurs, which means muscles are not used as much, leading to a potential decrease in their overall activity. 2. With reduced muscle activity, the muscles will tend to adapt to this lower level of usage, possibly leading to atrophy or muscle weakening. The body tries to conserve energy and resources when it senses muscles are not being used as frequently or intensively. 3. When infrequent or intense muscle contractions happen, the muscles have not been regularly trained for such activity, so they may contract more intensely in an effort to compensate for the reduced activity and effectiveness of the muscle fibers. 4. While the physiological process of muscle contraction (electrical signals, filaments, and opposing muscle pairs) remains the same, the intensity of the contractions seems to be influenced indirectly by the overall decrease in body movement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many rulers was Hyder Ali asking to receive payment from?","completion":"Title: Hyder Ali's Quest for Payments: How Many Rulers Found Themselves on His List? Introduction Hyder Ali, the 18th-century ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore in Southern India, was a well-known historical figure of high ambition and military prowess. A strategic leader who took on the British East India Company in the first and second Anglo-Mysore wars in the latter part of his life. Amidst the various bold endeavors he undertook, his lesser-known effort to seek payments from fellow rulers in India is often overlooked. This article seeks to find out just how many rulers Hyder Ali was asking to receive payment from and the reasons behind it. Step 1: Understanding the historical context To better comprehend the number of rulers Hyder Ali requested payments from, it is vital to consider the historical context in which he lived. Hyder Ali ascended to power during a turbulent time in India when the once-grand Mughal Empire was disintegrating. This decline led to the rise of several regional kingdoms. Being a pragmatist, Hyder Ali seized this opportunity to consolidate his power and sought alliances or tributes from other kingdoms to secure his position and resources. Step 2: Identifying Hyder Ali's targets In Hyder Ali's quest for payments, he targeted kingdoms of varying sizes and influence. It is crucial to identify these rulers and their respective territories to reach an accurate estimate. 1. Maratha Empire: As Mysore began to expand under Hyder Ali's rule, he inevitably faced conflicts with the Marathas. He persisted in his efforts to create a balance of power with the Marathas, seeking tributes or payments during times of conflict or peace agreement. 2. Nawab of Arcot: The Nawab of Arcot had requested Hyder Ali's assistance in dealing with threats to his territory. Hyder Ali obliged but expected payment in return for the protection and military support he provided. 3. Kingdom of Travancore: Hyder Ali sought payment from the southern kingdom of Travancore in exchange for military aid in their fight against the Dutch. 4. Kingdom of Tanjore: The ruler of Tanjore had approached Hyder Ali for help in his struggle against a powerful local chieftain. In return for his aid, Hyder Ali expected payment from the king of Tanjore as well. Step 3: Counting the rulers Adding up the rulers from the list of their respective territories, we find that Hyder Ali asked for payments from four rulers in total. Conclusion Hyder Ali's strategic approach to power consolidation led him to seek payments from four distinct rulers across the Indian subcontinent. His dealings with these rulers were marked by a clear sense of pragmatism, as he pursued alliances and financial assistance to bolster his position and military strength. Hyder Ali's interactions with these rulers highlight his ability to capitalize on the fractured political landscape of 18th-century India, paving the way for his eventual military showdowns against the British East India Company."},{"prompt":"Q:Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.

Organozinc chemistry is the science of organozinc compounds describing their physical properties, synthesis and reactions.

The Barbier reaction (1899) is the zinc equivalent of the magnesium Grignard reaction and is better of the two. In presence of just about any water the formation of the organomagnesium halide will fail, whereas the Barbier reaction can even take place in water. On the downside organozincs are much less nucleophilic than Grignards, are expensive and difficult to handle.

Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Q: Obligatory excuse the grammar and stuff, etc. Long post so tl;dr at the bottom &amp;#x200B; So here's a bit of history first that's probably needed - I was in college away from home. I moved in with these two girls I sort of knew at the time, but they were still kind of new friends to me. It wasn't a great living situation, more like the \\"I'll fake conversion until you go away so I can go back into my room\\" stuff. They both got more bitchy as time went on but I just sucked it up while I was there until my (then) boyfriend got home and I could go stay with him. They invited people over on weeknights without my consent who smoke and drank and were loud until 2am even after I asked them to quiet down because I had classes in the morning. One girl has her boyfriend over almost literally 24/7. The only time he would leave was when he would go home maybe once a week. He showered (in our shared bathroom, can't tell you how many times I stepped on what was hopefully mucus whenever I tried to shower), did laundry, kept his food in our pantry, and kept his weed outside on our balcony and sometimes inside. He is basically an illegal tenant, not on the lease, not paying rent or any utilities yet living with us. He also invited his friends and family over to stay our place rather than his own without asking. These girls also poisoned my cat with ibuprofen. Whether purposely or accidentally, I don't know. They hated him despite knowing I had him before agreeing to live with me. When I confronted them about it, they said the cat must have opened the childproof bottle himself (which I tested by throwing the bottle off the counter - the lock stayed on surprisingly!) and denied even accidentally leaving a pill out. That was a fun emergency vet bill. &amp;#x200B; Around the beginning of October, things were really rough for me. My depression and anxiety were through the roof, my grades were failing, my living situation with my roommates was incredibly hostile, my cat was poisoned, my boyfriend of two years broke up with me with no explanation, and I just couldn't take it anymore. I packed my things up and went home. &amp;#x200B; I've been home for three months now. I've paid rent (600) every month I haven't been there while trying to find a girl to take over my lease. The only way they will let me out of the lease is if the girls both agree to taking me out. But in order to do so, I have to help find a replacement. 'Help' being the key word. I've found three girls over the course of this who were interested in taking over my lease, all who \\"didn't work out\\" when my roommates told me why they wouldn't be taking over my lease. They've done nothing to help find someone to replace me. I have another girl (a foreign exchange student) who is interested in taking over the lease when she arrives, but they haven't been able to FaceTime yet so I don't know if it will work out. &amp;#x200B; Rent is due on the 5th and my parents just told me they won't be paying. So my hope was that things would work out with this girl quickly and she could take over before I have to use my credit card to pay (which of course I'd really prefer not to do for obvious reasons.) I sent a text to my roommates basically telling them of my situation, and saying that I really need things to work out with this girl for me. They replied back hostilely saying I was responsible no matter what (which I understand of course) and that I couldn't tell them how to make things work with this girl, who again, is the third one I've found after they refused the first two. &amp;#x200B; Obviously, I'm pissed. I've been paying for the months I'm not there which I understand is fair, however: this is the third girl I've found. I've done my part three times, each time that \\"didn't work out\\", while they've done nothing. I understand that I'm the one who left and so I have to help, but in the lease, it only says I have to HELP find a replacement, not find one altogether. Let alone three times. &amp;#x200B; My parent's view on this is just the same. They're tired of paying rent for a place I'm not living at when I've done my part and the roommates have done nothing. So here's the part I'm asking if I'm going to be an asshole on - My parents want to hire a lawyer (my dad's friend) to tell them basically this: Remove me from the lease or we tell the apartment every breach of lease they've done and get it terminated altogether. &amp;#x200B; This is where the history comes in. The illegal tenant, the weed (which is legal in my state if you're over 21, however none of them are), the poisoning of my cat (animal abuse), and everything else they've done the lawyer says will terminate the lease entirely. This will not only get me out of the lease, but them as well and they'll have to find a new place to live. &amp;#x200B; I do feel bad for having to possibly resort to this, but both my parents and I are tired of dealing with them and feel this is the only way to get me out now. Depending on how things go with the foreign exchange student I've found who's willing to move in, I'll update this. &amp;#x200B; TL;DR - I lived with hostile roommates, moved out, and have found multiple people to take over my lease all who my roommates have refused.

State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein.

Benschop’s arrival at Central Detectives headquarters, just off the Benjamin Franklin Parkway on North 21st Street, capped several days of scrutiny surrounding the Hunting Park resident. He was charged with six counts of involuntary manslaughter, 13 counts of recklessly endangering another person, and one count of risking a catastrophe, police said. At the time of the collapse, he was working for Griffin T. Campbell, the contractor hired by property owner Richard C. Basciano to tear down a four-story building next to the thrift store. On Wednesday, the remaining portion of that building collapsed during demolition and fell onto the store. There were 20 people inside. Salvation Army employees Kimberly Finnegan and Borbor Davis and shoppers Juanita Harmon, Mary Simpson, Anne Bryan, and Roseline Conteh were killed. Fourteen others were injured. One survivor, Myra Plekan, spent more than 12 hours in the rubble before she was rescued by firefighters. Sunday at noon, experts retained by the law firm Saltz Mongeluzzi Barrett & Bendesky will be inspecting the site for evidence. The firm filed suit against the owner and contractor on behalf of Nadine White, a Salvation Army store clerk who survived. According to a toxicology report, Benschop, of the 4900 block of North Seventh Street, had marijuana in his system at levels showing \\"he was unfit to perform safety-sensitive, job-related duties.\\" The report found it \\"reasonably scientifically certain\\" that Benschop was an \\"active recent user of marijuana.\\" Benschop has a long criminal record, with 11 arrests and 16 Traffic Court convictions. He served two terms in prison on drug charges in the 1990s. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials sought to deport him to his native Guyana in 2005, but an immigration judge allowed him to remain in the country, according to an ICE official. The agency sought to remove Benschop because of his convictions on drug charges, said the official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to release the information. He declined to say why the judge rejected the request, noting that such details of cases are confidential. The hearing occurred in York, according to another source familiar with the proceedings. The case was not unusual. ICE routinely moves to deport immigrants who have been convicted of crimes in this country.

Lizzie promises this is the last move, but, as Frankie observes, \\"she says that every time\\". As they are settling into a flat, we learn explicitly that Frankie is deaf.We hear Frankie's voice over as he writes a letter to his father, Petty Officer Davey Morrison, care of his ship the Accra. It's clear Frankie is a frequent letter-writer, with a stamp collection supplied from his correspondent -- which, it turns out is his mother. Frankie's father is clearly not on the scene, and from Nell's reaction to a personal ad seeking Lizzie, it's clear the family is anxious to avoid being found.At a new school (again) Frankie suffers some predictable petty bullying, and some counter-balancing friendship from another classmate, Catriona (Jayd Johnson). Frankie agrees to a bet with the chief pest, Ricky Munroe (Sean Brown), who asserts that Frankie's Da won't show up when the ship arrives.Desperate as the day of the ship's arrival nears, Lizzie embarks on a pick-up outing to the local pub, but quickly leaves, disgusted and distraught. When Lizzie admits her predicament -- to find a total stranger to act as Frankie's Da for one day -- to her friend (and boss) Marie, Marie provides her a name and number. Lizzie meets the man, and when he agrees to the charade she hands him all the letters from Frankie to his Da.Early the day the ship is due, Frankie bolts out of the flat and goes missing for hours. His surrogate Da is at the flat when Frankie returns. He gives Frankie a book that is somewhat skeptically received, until he tells Frankie that chose it based on what he read in Frankie's letters. Frankie's face lights up, and he runs to embrace the man.At the football tryouts, Frankie delightedly claims the spoils of his bet from Ricky Munroe.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers.

Did Arne Sucksdorff and Seth Grahame-Smith work in the same industry? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, Arne Sucksdorff and Seth Grahame-Smith both worked in the same industry – the film and entertainment industry. However, their careers were in different time periods and they had different roles within the industry. Arne Sucksdorff (1917 – 2001) was a Swedish filmmaker, primarily known for his work as a director of nature documentaries, short films, and feature films. He was active in the film industry from the late 1930s to the 1970s. Sucksdorff achieved international recognition with films such as \\"The Great Adventure\\" (1953), \\"The Wind is My Adventure\\" (1961), and \\"Rhythm of a City\\" (1950). He won numerous awards throughout his career, including an Academy Award for Best Short Subject for \\"Symphony of a City\\" in 1948. Seth Grahame-Smith, on the other hand, is an American author, screenwriter, and producer, best known for his works such as \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" (2010) and \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\" (2009). Grahame-Smith began his career in the entertainment industry in the early 2000s.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: On campus, is heckling free speech? Or just rude? Every few minutes during a talk last week at the University of at Irvine, the same thing happened. A student would get up, shout something critical of , be applauded by some in the audience, and be led away by police. The speaker —Michael Oren, Israel's ambassador to the United States— was repeatedly forced to stop his talk. He pleaded for the right to continue, and continued. University administrators lectured the students and asked them to let Oren speak. In the end, 11 students were arrested and they may also face charges of violating university rules. (Video of the event, distributed by a pro-Israel group, can be found here.) Those who interrupted Oren, not surprisingly, are strong critics of Israel who believe that they must draw attention to the Palestinian cause. But an argument put forward by some national Muslim leaders in the last week has sent the discussion in a new direction. Those groups maintain that interrupting a campus speech — even repeatedly — should be seen as a protected form of speech. \\"The students voiced political views to shame the representative of a foreign government embroiled in controversy for its outrageous violations of international humanitarian and human rights law. Delivering this message in a loud and shocking manner expressed the gravity of the charges leveled against Israeli policies, and falls within the purview of protected speech,\\" said a letter released by the Council on American-Islamic Relations. That statement followed one by Salam Al-Marayati, executive director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council, which said: \\"These students had the courage and conscience to stand up against aggression, using peaceful means. We cannot allow our educational institutions to be used as a platform to threaten and discourage students who choose to practice their First Amendment right.\\" Those statements are quite different from the view of Irvine officials. Michael Drake, the chancellor, had this to say after the interruptions: \\"This behavior is intolerable. Freedom of speech is among the most fundamental, and among the most cherished, of the bedrock values our nation is built upon. A great university depends on the free exchange of ideas. This is non-negotiable. Those who attempt to suppress the rights of others violate core principles that are the foundation of any learning community. We cannot and do not allow such behavior.\\" All of this raises the question: Is interrupting a campus speaker ever a legitimate form of free expression? Most higher education leaders welcome vocal protests outside a speaking venue and quiet protest (leaflets, for example) inside, but draw the line at interrupting speakers. Last year, protesters disrupted a speech at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill by the former Rep. Tom Tancredo, a leader of the movement to limit the government and other benefits of those who do not have the legal right to live in the USA. The incident prompted Holden Thorp, chancellor at Chapel Hill, to condemn the protest. He said at the time: \\"We expect protests about controversial subjects at Carolina. That's part of our culture. But we also pride ourselves on being a place where all points of view can be expressed and heard. There's a way to protest that respects free speech and allows people with opposing views to be heard. Here that's often meant that groups protesting a speaker have displayed signs or banners, silently expressing their opinions while the speaker had his or her say. That didn't happen last night.\\" Many other experts on free speech and protest agree — and some are disappointed that national organizations are defending the right to shout repeatedly during a campus talk. \\"That's definitely not free speech,\\" Jarret S. Lovell, a professor of politics at California State University at Fullerton, said of the interruptions at Irvine and similar tactics elsewhere. Lovell is a scholar of protest and the author of Crimes of Dissent: Civil Disobedience, Criminal Justice, and the Politics of Conscience (New York University Press). Not only does Lovell think the tactic is wrong in that it denies a hearing to whoever is being interrupted, but he thinks it fails to win over anyone. \\"When you only hear sound bites\\" from those interrupting, the students come off as intolerant, he said. \\"There are so many better ways to demonstrate.\\" Lovell said that he believes students' willingness to shout down someone they don't like reflects the state of discourse in an era when people pick Fox News or NPR because they want to find information sources whose coverage they agree with. \\"People think there is no real reason for free speech when you can just change the channel. They believe that the marketplace of ideas means that if they don't buy it, it doesn't go in their shopping-cart.\\" As one who identifies himself as critical of Israel's policies and sympathetic to the Palestinian cause, Lovell said that the Irvine hecklers should realize what will happen next. \\"It's only a matter of time until Norman Finkelstein speaks at UCI and Jewish groups shout him down,\\" Lovell said of the controversial scholar viewed by many Jews as anti-Israel. Wayne Firestone, national president of Hillel, takes a similar view. He said that the interruptions of Israel's ambassador of course mattered to many Jewish students. But Firestone noted that the ambassador was invited by the law school and political science department, and he said that the issues involved would matter regardless of the topic of the talk or the views of the speaker. He said that the idea that interruptions of a speaker are part of free speech is \\"a candidate for the worst idea of the year.\\" He added that \\"if a precedent is set on this issue\\" that it's OK to shout during a campus talk, \\"then any group that opposes any speaker can literally stop discussion and debate from taking place\\" by interrupting repeatedly during a talk. Firestone said that there should be many opinions on campus, and that all views should be expressed, but that to do so, you need \\"a notion of respect and fair play\\" that allows people to give their talks. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education blog featured similar views: \\"Failing to punish offenders appropriately is likely to threaten the free speech of future speakers by effectively condoning a 'heckler's veto' through disruptive actions. That would make a mockery of the First Amendment.\\" Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the Los Angeles branch of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, defended his group's defense of the interruptions at Irvine. He said that it was unfair to say that the students who interrupted were trying to shut down the talk because they voluntarily left the room after each interruption, and let the talk start again (until the next outburst at least) and eventually let it finish. \\"Let's put it in perspective. The speaker had an hour to speak, and they each had less than a minute.\\" Ayloush noted that he is frequently interrupted when he gives lectures, and that it goes with the territory. \\"We firmly believe that both the representative of the foreign government had the full right to speak and the students being addressed have the right to express their speech, too,\\" he said. Asked why it might not be better to organize protests with a rally outside or leaflets or signs that don't interrupt a talk, Ayloush said such approaches might well be better, but that this was beside the point and that he wouldn't exclude the heckling strategy used at Irvine. \\"These are all tactics and different methods of expressing their free speech, and everyone might have their favorite,\\" he said. \\"The First Amendment was never intended to be exclusively polite and courteous.\\" Yet another perspective holds that some, modest interruption (less than what took place at Irvine) may be seen as an expression of free speech that doesn't limit the right of a speaker to be heard. Cary Nelson, national president of the American Association of University Professors, said he holds that view, although he said this was not a question on which AAUP has a policy. And he said that he believes that \\"most faculty members regard interruption as unacceptable.\\" Nelson said he is a fan of the speech/protest policy of the University of Michigan. That policy says: \\"Within the confines of a hall or physical facility, or in the vicinity of the place in which a member of the university community, invited speaker, or invited artist is addressing an assembled audience, protesters must not interfere unduly with communication between a speaker or artist and members of the audience. This prohibition against undue interference does not include suppression of the usual range of human reactions commonly displayed by an audience during heated discussions of controversial topics. Nor does this prohibition include various expressions of protest, including heckling and the display of signs (without sticks or poles), so long as such activities are consistent with the continuation of a speech or performance and the communication of its content to the audience.\\" Along these lines, Nelson said that some brief demonstration against a speaker doesn't strike him as an assault on free speech \\"so long as the speaker is allowed to continue.\\" He added that \\"an interruption that signals extreme objection to a speaker's views is part of the acceptable intellectual life of a campus, but you have to let the speech go on,\\" and he said that he did not believe that repeated interruptions were appropriate in that they would disrupt a talk. \\"Free speech doesn't mean you are able to trample a campus event.\\" While defending such a tactic as potentially consistent with ideals of free expression, Nelson added that he personally always favored other approaches. Nelson was at a speech by John Sexton, the president of New York University, after that institution ended recognition of its graduate student union and fought off a strike by supporters of the union. Nelson said he walked to the front of the auditorium, turned his back on Sexton and stood silently through the talk. While the speech was not about graduate unions, Nelson said he wanted to show \\"my rejection of everything he stood for.\\" But he said he wouldn't have interrupted. Nelson said that one of the most moving and effective protests he ever attended was as an undergraduate at Antioch College in the early 1960s. George Lincoln Rockwell, the founder of the American Nazi Party, was the speaker. No one shouted at him, although the students considered him hateful. \\"The audience was totally silent and then, during the question period, no one would ask him a question and he began cursing at the audience, but no one would speak,\\" Nelson said. \\"To me it was incredibly moving because of the solidarity of the audience, and of the possibility of a certain kind of silent witness,\\" he said. Nelson said he wished more protests today used such an approach in which opposition is totally clear but no one tries to stop the talk. \\"There is a tremendous sense of dignity in silent witness,\\" he said.

What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article talks about a situation at a university where a speaker was giving a talk, but some students kept interrupting him to criticize what he was saying. The people who interrupted the speaker are part of a group that does not agree with what the speaker stands for, and they wanted to show their disagreement by saying things loudly during his talk. This made many people wonder if interrupting someone like this is a form of free speech or if it's just being rude. Some people believe that interrupting a speaker in this way is part of their right to free speech, while others think that it's not fair to the speaker and does not help them get their message across. The university leaders, however, want everyone to be able to express their opinions, but they think that there are better ways to protest that do not interrupt the speaker. Some suggested ways to protest without interrupting include holding signs or having a rally outside the event. At the end of the day, the question is whether or not interrupting someone during their speech, even if it's to express disagreement, is a right protected by the idea of free speech. Different people have different opinions on this, and there doesn't seem to be a clear answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Article: We've all heard about the power of positive thinking, but a recent study found that people who think they're getting fit actually get more positive benefits from activity, according to a Reuters Health article. The study examined hotel housekeepers over a period of four weeks. Some of the housekeepers were told that their work duties gave them enough activity to meet the Surgeon General's health guidelines . Another group of housekeepers were told nothing. After four weeks, the housekeepers who believed their work activity counted as exercise lost weight and body fat, and their blood pressure went down. The results of this study suggest that it's important to understand and believe in the positive benefits of your activity. So here are a few things to think about the next time you exercise: Just thirty minutes of quick walking each day can greatly reduce your risk of a heart attack. Even your housework -- like yard work and house cleaning -- can help you burn calories and increase your fitness levels. Weight bearing activity just a few times a week can build bone density and reduce your chances of developing osteoporosis . Three 10-minute workouts throughout the day are just as good to your health as one long workout. Moderate amounts of exercise have been linked to lower rates of heart disease, stroke and even cancer. Strength training can help make daily activities like carrying bags or laundry feel easier. Regular exercise will reduce stress, keep you in a good mood and improve the quality of your sleep. Question: Which of the following is NOT the suggested things to think about when you exercise? - Housework helps burn calories. - Regular exercise leads to better sleep. - Weight bearing activity does good to people.[:ZXXK] - Walking a dog reduces the chance of a heart disease.

Q: Michael Morzeny put his hands into the pockets of his overcoat and hugged the fabric tighter around his body. The winter wind hurried down Columbus Avenue and the hem of his coat flapped around his knees letting little pockets of cold waft up to invade the warmth his body had spent so much time preparing and storing around his torso. With a bitter squeeze of his hands, his knuckles now getting cold, Morzeny bowed his square shoulders to the wind and continued walking. At sixty-seven years old the New York winters bothered Morzeny more than he cared to admit. And, although no doctor would admit it to him, he was positive that the first faint hints of arthritis tweaking through his hands were made worse by the cold. At every cross street the setting sun flashed through to the avenue in shades of crisp pink and red. Morzeny didn't want to be working right now. But these outings were the price he paid for having a hybrid job, owning buildings and brokering as many of his own leases as possible. When he had first come to the city he had been told that he needed a job, not for income, his providers took care of that, but for his own sanity. Something to keep him going. He had asked for something in real estate and had never bothered to wonder what other paths he might have taken. He had always been able to focus to the point of blindness. It helped him in every aspect of his work. He arrived at the brownstone building housing the apartment he was to show tonight.

Step 1: Identify the words: - The words \\"generic\\" and \\"title\\" are significant in defining the tone of the phrase. Step 2: Examine the context: - The word \\"generic\\" typically means something that is general, unspecific, or not unique. It has a slightly negative connotation because it's often used to describe something that's lacking originality or creativity. Step 3: Analyze the phrase: - The phrase \\"is as generic as its title\\" makes a comparison between the subject being discussed and its title. It's saying that the subject is just as generic (unoriginal, common, or typical) as the title.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not for vote for in either of his presidential runs? from the following article ? Minnesota is known for a politically active citizenry, and populism has been a long-standing force among the state's political parties. Minnesota has a consistently high voter turnout. In the 2008 U.S. presidential election, 78.2% of eligible Minnesotans voted—the highest percentage of any U.S. state—versus the national average of 61.2%. Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President).

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons.

Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre.

Phrase: \\"rarely comes alive as its own fire-breathing entity in this picture\\" 1. \\"Rarely\\" - This word typically carries a negative connotation, as it implies something does not occur often or is uncommon. 2. \\"comes alive\\" - This phrase suggests a subject becoming lively, engaged, or full of energy. 3. \\"its own fire-breathing entity\\" - A metaphor that indicates something powerful, passionate, or intense. 4. \\"in this picture\\" - Referring to a specific context, such as a movie or artwork.

Bertie is approximately 24 years old when he first meets Jeeves in \\"Jeeves Takes Charge\\". His age is not stated in any other story. In the reference work Wodehouse in Woostershire by Wodehouse scholars Geoffrey Jaggard and Tony Ring, it is speculated that Bertie's age ranges from appproximately 24 to 29 over the course of the stories, excluding Ring for Jeeves. Nigel Cawthorne, author of A Brief Guide to Jeeves and Wooster, also suggested that Bertie is approximately 29 at the end of the saga. Tall and slim, Bertie is elegantly dressed, largely because of Jeeves. He has blue eyes. Normally clean-shaven, he grows a moustache in two different stories, and ultimately loses the moustache, as Jeeves does not think a moustache suits Bertie. It seems that he has an innocent-looking appearance; when Bertie wants to wear an alpine hat in Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves, he states, \\"I was prepared to concede that it would have been more suitable for rural wear, but against this had to be set the fact that it unquestionably lent a diablerie to my appearance, and mine is an appearance that needs all the diablerie it can get.\\" Bertie has an expressive face that Jeeves can read easily. In illustrations, Bertie Wooster has frequently been depicted wearing a monocle. However, this is probably merely a stereotypical depiction of an upper-class gentleman, as Bertie does not seem to wear a monocle in the original stories. The only evidence of Bertie wearing a monocle occurs in \\"The Spot of Art\\", when Bertie sees a portrait of himself, wearing a monocle, in a poster advertising soup. Bertie is revolted by the image, which gives him a look of \\"bestial greed\\". The monocle seems to exaggerate this expression, and Bertie makes fun of how large the monocle looks, calling it \\"about six inches in circumference\\". Bertie is never described as wearing a monocle elsewhere. It is unlikely that Bertie would wear a monocle that would not be mentioned, since the glasses of other characters, particularly Bertie's friend Gussie Fink-Nottle, are well-described, and another prominent Wodehouse character, Psmith, has a distinctive monocle that is mentioned many times.","completion":"This text is about Bertram \\"Bertie\\" Wilberforce Wooster, a fictional character in the comedic Jeeves stories written by British author P. G. Wodehouse. Bertie Wooster is a young English gentleman who is part of the \\"idle rich.\\" He often finds himself in awkward situations, which are resolved with the help of his intelligent valet, Jeeves. Bertie Wooster serves as the first-person narrator in ten novels and over 30 short stories, making him one of the most iconic comic creations in popular literature. The character appears in the majority of Wodehouse's Jeeves short stories and novels, published between 1915 and 1974."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Armando Anthony \\"Chick\\" Corea (born June 12, 1941) is an American jazz pianist/electric keyboardist and composer. His compositions \\"Spain\\", \\"500 Miles High\\", \\"La Fiesta\\" and \\"Windows\\", are considered jazz standards. As a member of Miles Davis's band in the late 1960s, he participated in the birth of jazz fusion. In the 1970s he formed the fusion band Return to Forever. In the 1970s Corea started working with vibraphonist Gary Burton, with whom he recorded several duet albums for ECM, including 1972's Crystal Silence. They reunited in 2006 for a concert tour. A new record called The New Crystal Silence was issued in 2008 and won a Grammy Award in 2009. The package includes a disc of duets and another disc with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. Toward the end of the 1970s, Corea embarked on a series of concerts and two albums with Hancock. These concerts were presented in elegant settings with both pianists dressed formally and performing on Yamaha concert grand pianos. The two traded playing each other's compositions, as well as pieces by other composers such as Bela Bartok. In 1982, Corea performed The Meeting, a live duet with the classical pianist Friedrich Gulda. In December 2007 Corea recorded a duet album, The Enchantment, with banjoist Bela Fleck. Fleck and Corea toured extensively for the album in 2007. Fleck was nominated in the Best Instrumental Composition category at the 49th Grammy Awards for the track \\"Spectacle\\". In 2008 Corea collaborated with Japanese pianist Hiromi Uehara on the live album Duet (Chick Corea and Hiromi). The duo played a concert at Tokyo's Budokan arena on April 30. In 2015 Corea reprised the duet concert series with Hancock, again sticking to a dueling-piano format, though both also had synthesizers at their station. The first concert in this series was played at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle, and featured improvised music along with iconic songs from each of the duo and standards from other composers.","completion":"This text is about Armando Anthony \\"Chick\\" Corea, an American jazz pianist, electric keyboardist, and composer.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\". Question: What picked Joanna out of the water around midnight? Movie plot title: Overboard Movie plot: The initial scenes establish that Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn), is a spoiled brat who always gets her way, the ultimate rich bitch, and the pampered wife of pretentious socialite Grant Stayton III (Edward Herrmann).Using Roman numerals after your name is Hollywood shorthand for \\"pretentious snob\\", and Grant is that, and self centered to boot, however, Joanna is far worse. She is not only snobbish but also idle, pampered, sharp-tongued, impossible to please and unfailingly rude to anyone she considers her social inferior, which is virtually all of the human race. To describe Joanna as unsympathetic is a huge understatement, a better description would be \\"prize bitch\\".When Grant's luxury yacht develops engine trouble, Grant is forced to put into the small Oregon coastal town of Elk Snout for repairs.While the huge yacht is in port, Joanna hires Dean Proffitt (Kurt Russell), a poor carpenter who has just moved to Oregon, to build better shoe storage for her closet in the yacht. Dean is a skilled craftsman, rather picky about what he uses, such as the wood that should be used to protect the leather from salt spray in a ship. Joanna is also not impressed by his taking so long, as he designed intricate shelves that confuse and annoy her.An early funny scene in the movie has Joanna lecturing Andrew the butler ( Roddy McDowall), on why the caviar he had just delivered her was no good, while Dean, standing in the background, has his tape measure pointing suggestively skyward.When the work is complete she refuses to pay him in a dispute over the quality of his workmanship, claiming that the closet is not up to her standards. In the ensuing argument Joanna loses her temper, pushes Dean overboard and throws his tools after him.The yacht crew has long ago gotten used to keep quiet and accept the guff from Joanna and Grant, despite that they have been treated like dirt, particularly family butler Andrew.After a typically stormy dinner that night, Joanna drops her wedding ring behind a seat on the deck.

Sentence 2: The man looked down at the ground. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"It is essential to understand that both of these sentences are independent sentences, which means that they can exist in complete autonomy from one another. They may well be part of a larger narrative, but without that context, we can't definitively say that they relate to or impact one another. Simply because the first sentence states that \\"He dared to look up\\" does not inherently mean the second sentence, \\"The man looked down at the ground,\\" cannot be true. They could be describing completely unrelated instances or involve different people, settings, or timeframes. However, there is a possibility that these sentences do relate to each other within their particular context. If we look at them as part of a larger story or narrative, several scenarios could justify both sentences being true: 1. The sentences could involve different people or characters: In this case, the two actions might happen concurrently, or one might follow the other. For example, one character could be looking up at the sky, while another person is looking down at the ground. Thus, both sentences are true, given that they refer to various individuals in a narrative. 2. The sentences could reflect a change in mood or situation: If we are dealing with a single character, the scene described in the first sentence (\\"He dared to look up\\") might initially depict a situation where the character was unsure or hesitant about looking up at something. After overcoming that hesitation, the character might then turn their attention to the ground in the second scene, making both sentences true. 3. The sentences could represent different temporal contexts: The first sentence might occur at an earlier point in the story, with the protagonist looking up. As the narrative continues or unfolds, there could be a point in time when the protagonist looks down at the ground. If these temporal contexts are distinct, both sentences can coexist as true within the broader storyline. 4. The sentences could be part of a poetic or metaphorical context: In this case, the act of \\"looking up\\" and \\"looking down\\" might symbolize contrasting emotions, beliefs, or attitudes. If the character undergoes a transformation or development, both sentences might be true reflections of the character's internal state at different stages in the story. In conclusion, although the two sentences do not directly rely on one another for truth or falsity, they could still exist as part of a larger narrative or context. It is essential to understand the broader setting or circumstance in which both sentences are embedded to accurately assess their relationship and authenticity. Without the necessary context, it would be inaccurate to assume that the truth of one sentence determines the truth of the other, as they are independent statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Former American Apparel employee accuses CEO Dov Charney of sexual assault in lawsuit Dov Charney, American Apparel Inc.'s embattled chief executive, has been sued by a former employee who says he sexually assaulted her \\"during what she believed to be a hiring interview\\" at his home. Charney declined to comment on the suit filed by Kimbra Lo in L.A. County Superior Court on Wednesday. The complaint marks the second suit filed this month accusing him of sexual assault. The complaint says Charney began sending Lo \\"sexual text messages\\" in July 2010, and that he called her and said \\"he was masturbating on the phone while they spoke.\\" According to the suit, Lo ignored his calls and messages until Charney offered her a modeling and photography job in December, inviting her to meet him in his home to discuss the position. After she arrived, Charney, wearing only a towel, \\"violently kissed her\\" and forced her to perform sexual acts, the suit alleges. Afterward, Lo's mother called Charney and told the company founder and majority owner to stay away from her daughter, \\"whereupon Charney begged forgiveness and admitted he had a problem,\\" according to the suit, which was first reported by the New York Times. Three other women filed the suit along with Lo, saying in the court document that American Apparel improperly forced them to sign confidential arbitration agreements with the company before they would be hired, and that the company had initiated arbitration proceedings with them, but details as to what dispute the arbitration matters were dealing with weren't made public. Earlier this month, former American Apparel employee Irene Morales sued Charney in New York state court, saying he had attempted to force her to perform oral sex on him in his New York apartment in 2008, when she was 18, and sexually harassed her for months, including demanding that she send him explicit photographs, e-mails and text messages. American Apparel has said in court papers that Morales sued \\"after making a number of extortion-like threats to expose the company to a threatened avalanche of litigation and negative publicity.\\" The company has asked the court to send her case to confidential arbitration. In recent years, Charney has been named a defendant in several sexual harassment suits, but none has gone to trial. American Apparel's board of directors has publicly stood behind him. The company has said in court papers that Charney seeks to foster a \\"sexually charged workplace\\" in an effort to stimulate creativity.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... I am facing a new situation today: Team A and Team B were two teams of students studying zoology. Team A learned about reptiles, while Team B studied more about amphibians. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which team learned more about turtles? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article, Team A, which studied reptiles, learned more about turtles. Turtles are classified as reptiles, along with other animals such as tuataras, lizards, snakes, and crocodiles. As reptiles, turtles share various characteristics with the other members of this class, such as having a more efficient respiratory system, a heart with a septum that better separates oxygenated and deoxygenated blood, and involving internal fertilization with amniotic membranes for their eggs. Turtles are particularly known for their protective shells, which consist of a carapace above and a plastron below. These shells are made from both bony and horny plates that can fuse partially with their spine and ribs. Additionally, turtles usually have long and flexible necks, and their heads and legs can be drawn back into their shells for protection. In terms of diet, turtles are mostly vegetarian, and their typical reptile teeth have evolved into sharp, horny plates. On the other hand, Team B focused on amphibians, which have different characteristics and do not include turtles in their classification.

Modern criticism of Pope focuses on the man, his circumstances and motivations, prompted by theoretical perspectives such as Marxism, feminism and other forms of post-structuralism. Brean Hammond focuses on Pope's singular achievement in making an independent living solely from his writing. Laura Brown (1985) adopts a Marxist approach and accuses Pope of being an apologist for the oppressive upper classes. Hammond (1986) has studied Pope's work from the perspectives of cultural materialism and new historicism. Along Hammond's lines, Raymond Williams explains art as a set of practices influenced by broad cultural factors rather than simply the vague ideas of genius alone. Hayden Carruth, wrote that it was \\"Pope's rationalism and pandeism with which he wrote the greatest mock-epic in English literature.\\" In Politics and Poetics of Transgression (1985) Peter Stallybrass and Allon White charge that Pope drew upon the low culture which he despised in order to produce his own \\"high art\\". They assert Pope was implicated in the very material he was attempting to exclude, not dissimilar to observations made in Pope's time. Colin Nicholson reads the poetry in terms of the Financial Revolution, showing how Pope responded to the corruption of the traditional 'landed interest' by the newly dominant 'moneyed interest'. Feminists have also criticised Pope's works. Ellen Pollak's The Poetics of Sexual Myth (1985) argues that Pope followed an anti-feminist tradition, that regarded women as inferior to men both intellectually and physically. Carolyn Williams contends that a crisis in the male role during the 18th century in Britain impacted Pope and his writing.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of this process is the inhalation of oxygen. Oxygen enters the body through the nose or mouth, where it then travels down the trachea and into the bronchi, which branch out into smaller bronchioles within the lungs. These bronchioles eventually lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli. It is in the alveoli where oxygen diffuses across their thin walls and enters the bloodstream through the surrounding capillaries. Once in the blood, oxygen binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, which is then transported to tissues and cells throughout the body. This oxygen is subsequently used in cellular respiration, a process that breaks down glucose to generate energy (in the form of adenosine triphosphate, or ATP), with carbon dioxide as a byproduct. The carbon dioxide then diffuses back into the bloodstream and is carried to the lungs, where it is expelled from the body during exhalation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: In England, Professor Harrington (Maurice Denham) visits his rival, Dr. Julian Karswell (Niall MacGinnis). Harrington promises to cancel an investigation of Karswell's involvement in Satanism if Karswell will rescind a threat he has made against Harrington. After learning that a parchment given to Harrington has disintegrated, Karswell glances at the clock and ushers Harrington out, promising to do all that he can. As Harrington drives home, a gigantic demon materialises and pursues him. Losing control of the car, Harrington crashes into an electrical pole and is electrocuted. Dr. John Holden (Dana Andrews) arrives in England to attend a convention at which Harrington had intended to expose Karswell's cult. Holden is informed of Harrington's death and that the only link between it and Karswell's cult is an accused murderer, Rand Hobart (Brian Wilde), who has fallen into a catatonic stupor. While Harrington's collaborators consider the possibility of supernatural forces, Holden rejects the idea as superstition. Following Harrington's notes, Holden visits the British Museum's library to examine books on witchcraft. A book Holden requests is discovered to be missing. Karswell offers to show Holden his own copy at his mansion. At Harrington's funeral, Holden meets the dead man's niece, Joanna (Peggy Cummins), who gives him Harrington's diary. It reveals Harrington's increasing fear of Karswell's power. Holden remains sceptical, but goes with Joanna to Karswell's mansion the next day. There, Holden and Karswell mock each another's beliefs. A very strong windstorm abruptly starts, which Karswell claims to have created with a spell. When Holden continues to mock him, Karswell grows angry and predicts that Holden will die in three days.

During his marriage to Cynthia, Lennon's first son Julian was born at the same time that his commitments with the Beatles were intensifying at the height of Beatlemania. Lennon was touring with the Beatles when Julian was born on 8 April 1963. Julian's birth, like his mother Cynthia's marriage to Lennon, was kept secret because Epstein was convinced that public knowledge of such things would threaten the Beatles' commercial success. Julian recalled that as a small child in Weybridge some four years later, \\"I was trundled home from school and came walking up with one of my watercolour paintings. It was just a bunch of stars and this blonde girl I knew at school. And Dad said, 'What's this?' I said, 'It's Lucy in the sky with diamonds.'\\" Lennon used it as the title of a Beatles song, and though it was later reported to have been derived from the initials LSD, Lennon insisted, \\"It's not an acid song.\\" McCartney corroborated Lennon's explanation that Julian innocently came up with the name. Lennon was distant from Julian, who felt closer to McCartney than to his father. During a car journey to visit Cynthia and Julian during Lennon's divorce, McCartney composed a song, \\"Hey Jules\\", to comfort him. It would evolve into the Beatles song \\"Hey Jude\\". Lennon later said, \\"That's his best song. It started off as a song about my son Julian ... he turned it into 'Hey Jude'. I always thought it was about me and Yoko but he said it wasn't.\\" Lennon's relationship with Julian was already strained, and after Lennon and Ono moved to Manhattan in 1971, Julian would not see his father again until 1973. With Pang's encouragement, arrangements were made for Julian (and his mother) to visit Lennon in Los Angeles, where they went to Disneyland. Julian started to see his father regularly, and Lennon gave him a drumming part on a Walls and Bridges track. He bought Julian a Gibson Les Paul guitar and other instruments, and encouraged his interest in music by demonstrating guitar chord techniques. Julian recalls that he and his father \\"got on a great deal better\\" during the time he spent in New York: \\"We had a lot of fun, laughed a lot and had a great time in general.\\" In a Playboy interview with David Sheff shortly before his death, Lennon said, \\"Sean was a planned child, and therein lies the difference. I don't love Julian any less as a child. He's still my son, whether he came from a bottle of whiskey or because they didn't have pills in those days. He's here, he belongs to me, and he always will.\\" He said he was trying to re-establish a connection with the then 17-year-old, and confidently predicted, \\"Julian and I will have a relationship in the future.\\" After his death it was revealed that he had left Julian very little in his will.

The review also mentions a win by the reviewer themselves - a small, positive detail. Although the reviewer points out that the casino does not have a large number of tables and expresses surprise at the automated roulette wheel, these are neutral to slightly negative observations rather than strong negative sentiments. The caution about speed patrols on Beeline Highway is an impartial piece of advice unrelated to the casino's quality.

Weymouth originated as a settlement on a constricted site to the south and west of Weymouth Harbour, an outlying part of Wyke Regis. The town developed from the mid 12th century onwards, but was not noted until the 13th century. By 1252 it was established as a seaport and became a chartered borough. Melcombe Regis developed separately on the peninsula to the north of the harbour; it was mentioned as a licensed wool port in 1310. French raiders found the port so accessible that in 1433 the staple was transferred to Poole. Melcombe Regis is thought to be the first port at which the Black Death came into England in June 1348, possibly either aboard a spice ship or an army ship. In their early history Weymouth and Melcombe Regis were rivals for trade and industry, but the towns were united in an Act of Parliament in 1571 to form a double borough. Both towns have become known as Weymouth, despite Melcombe Regis being the main centre. The villages of Upwey, Broadwey, Preston, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Southill, Radipole and Littlemoor have become part of the built-up area. King Henry VIII had two Device Forts built to protect the south Dorset coast from invasion in the 1530s: Sandsfoot Castle in Wyke Regis and Portland Castle in Castletown. Parts of Sandsfoot have fallen into the sea due to coastal erosion. During the English Civil War, around 250 people were killed in the local Crabchurch Conspiracy in February 1645. In 1635, on board the ship Charity, around 100 emigrants from the town crossed the Atlantic Ocean and settled in Weymouth, Massachusetts. More townspeople emigrated to the Americas to bolster the population of Weymouth, Nova Scotia and Salem, Massachusetts; then called Naumking. There are memorials to this on the side of Weymouth Harbour and near to Weymouth Pavilion and Weymouth Sea Life Tower.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What is a famous university in the western United States? Context: Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.","completion":"The context provided does not give any information about a famous university in the western United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) It's cut so clean it could have been left yesterday. Only the date next to it — April 1, 1917 — roots it in the horrors of World War I. The piece of graffiti by a soldier in a British infantry unit is just one of nearly 2,000 century-old inscriptions that have recently come to light in Naours, a two-hour drive north of Paris. Many marked a note for posterity in the face of the doom that trench warfare a few dozen miles away would bring to many. \\"It shows how soldiers form a sense of place and an understanding of their role in a harsh and hostile environment,\\" said historian Ross Wilson of Chichester University in Britain. Etchings, even scratched bas-reliefs, were left by many soldiers during the war. But those in Naours \\"would be one of the highest concentrations of inscriptions on the Western Front\\" that stretches from Switzerland to the North Sea, said Wilson. The site's proximity to the Somme battlefields, where more than a million men were killed or wounded, adds to the discovery's importance. \\"It provides insight into how they found a sense of meaning in the conflict,\\" said Wilson. Naours' underground city is a 3-kilometer (2-mile) -long complex of tunnels with hundreds of chambers dug out over centuries in the chalky Picardy plateau. During the Middle Ages villagers took shelter there from marauding armies crisscrossing northern France. By the 18th century the quarry's entrance was blocked off and forgotten. In 1887 a local priest rediscovered the site and it eventually became a tourist attraction. That's what likely drew the soldiers to it during the war, said Gilles Prilaux, an archaeologist for France's national archaeology institute. He began a three-year study of the tunnels last July, intending to focus on the site's medieval past — only to stumble upon this more recent slice of history. \\"It was a big surprise,\\" Prilaux said of the discovery of the World War I graffiti left by soldiers from Australia, Britain, Canada and the U.S. Soldiers left similar inscriptions in tunnels at Arras and Vimy. But unlike those sites, Naours is well back from the front lines. And it wasn't known to have been used as a shelter or hospital like other Western Front quarries. Photographer Jeff Gusky has tallied 1,821 individual names: 731 Australians, 339 British, 55 Americans, a handful of French and Canadians and 662 others whose nationalities have yet to be traced. \\"All these guys wanted to be remembered,\\" Gusky says, pointing out examples from Texas and Florida. Naours is only a few miles from Vignacourt, a town used as a staging area for troops moving up to and back from the Somme battlefields some 25 miles to the east. Prilaux thinks that the young soldiers from distant countries would have heard about the famous \\"Naours caves\\" and taken advantage of a break from war to do some sight-seeing. That idea is backed by an entry in the diary of Wilfred Joseph Allan Allsop, a 23-year-old private from Sydney, Australia. \\"At 1 p.m. 10 of us went to the famous Caves near Naours where refugees used to hide in times of Invasion\\" Allsop wrote on Jan. 2, 1917. Wilson said the importance of studying graffiti like this has only emerged in the last 10 to 20 years. \\"What were previously regarded as incidental acts that occur away from the battlefield have been shown to be highly important in understanding the lives of those who experienced the conflict,\\" Wilson said. One of the most moving inscriptions at Naours was made by Herbert John Leach, a 25-year-old from Adelaide. His inscription reads \\"HJ Leach. Merely a private. 13/7/16. SA Australia.\\" Barely a month after Leach added his name to the wall he was killed in action on Aug. 23, 1916, during the Battle of Pozieres. On his grave, in the Australian cemetery in nearby Flers, his father inscribed \\"Duty Nobly Done.\\" ___ Follow Greg Keller on Twitter at https://twitter.com/Greg_Keller ||||| Secrets of the Somme: Hidden ANZAC messages unearthed In an international exclusive, Victoria Cross recipient Corporal Mark Donaldson uncovers a ‘secret of the Somme’; an historical treasure trove and legacy left underground by our original diggers. 7News travelled a long way to find century-old Australian secrets beneath the snowy Somme with a delegation from our Paris embassy, including military attaches. From the third century, French locals sheltered in a maze of 300 rooms over three kilometres, including an underground chapel, from invaders. From nearby camps and towns, our first diggers came here between battles. Their footsteps have long faded but their handiwork echoes down the decades. Typical Australians, they left their mark, carved or penciled, on wall upon wall, thousands of names. All seem to be Australian, a couple of French and not that many British. Two brothers, Ellis and Elli,14th platoon, July 1916. Names, dates, places, touching a national nerve. It appears as though the marks are in groups of states, and their battalions. It’s all an unexpected treasure trove. From nearby camps and towns, our first diggers came here between battles. Jenny Stephenson from the Department of Veterans Affairs was very surprised to see the caves. \\"It's an interesting story in itself but then to come and discover that you've got these hidden little chambers with the names of so many Australians here, “ she said. “Hidden away as a little secret in the Somme… I was absolutely moved by seeing so many Australians and thinking about their histories and the links back to Australia and Australian families.” One link has already excited French archaeologists. Leslie Russell Blake was a wounded Lieutenant when he wrote on a wall in 1917. A captain when his photos were taken under the famous Hill 60. Leslie Russell Blake was a wounded Lieutenant when he wrote on a wall in 1917. Photo: 7News Pre-war, Blake was a member of Douglas Mawson's historic Antarctica expedition as team geologist and cartographer. He is pictured in a historic 1911 film of that epic trip alongside Mawson. Blake's mapping skills made him a hero of Pozieres, braving extreme fire to chart frontline details and win the Military Cross. Sadly, he was killed in the last weeks of the war. The find has excited the French also. “This is actually the first troops involved in the Western Front,” French Historian Laurent Mirouze said. “We know that a lot of them have been killed or injured, disappeared forever in Fromelles in all that terrible battles of 1916. So it's extremely moving to have these names of all these Diggers. “What happened to them? What is their history? Maybe the historians now are going to find their fate,” he said. Laurent himself has a long history of exploring Australian-French bonds. Despatch rider Allan Allsop came to light in a major discovery of WW1 glass plate negatives found by Laurent and Channel Seven's Sunday Night program nearby. 7News tracked despatch rider Allan Allsop diary and his entry with the exact date he and his motor cycle mates visited the caves. Photo: 7News Even though the Diggers' names have survived for nearly a century, there are serious concerns about their future. The chalk is soft and gradually wearing away. Specialist treatment is needed to seal and preserve the signatures. “To find such testimony of French, of Australian Diggers fighting in France is extremely important for the French,” Laurent said. “I'm sure that they are going to do the best to protect and save these graffitis for the public, for the general interest.” Authorities now expect a surge of Australian visitors connecting with their digger ancestors and legacy. 7News is proud to announce that Victoria Cross recipient Mark Donaldson will be part of our extensive coverage of the ANZAC Centenary with a special series of reports from the Western Front battlefields of World War One. About the Underground City of Naours Located at the eastern-side of the town is the famous site known as the Underground City of Naours, with its entrance in the side of a tree-covered plateau of land near the D60 Rue de ‘l’Abba Danucourt highway, a little way along the Rue de Carreres road. There is an admission fee to pay but guided tours are available. The underground caves, grottos, passageways and chapels that make up this ancient settlement are 33 metres below ground and the pathways linking these run for between 1-2 miles in a westerly direction, under the streets of Naours itself. It is thought the underground settlement, also called a souterraine, dates from the 3rd century AD. The town of Naours is in the far north-east corner of France not far from the border with Belgium. Amiens is 10 miles to the south. A major discovery of WW1 glass plate negatives was found by Laurent and Channel Seven's Sunday Night program nearby. The Romans were the first people to dig into the plateau back in the 3rd century and, in subsequent centuries, local people continued digging out the caves and grottos. Early Christians may have hidden below the ground in order to escape their persecutors – they would certainly have had plenty of places to hide and set up little chapels. Later, in the 9th century AD, viking invaders lived in these underground caves. In more recent times, local peasants made their homes in the vast network of caves turning the place into a large underground settlement, complete with extensive passageways and more chapels, shelters and wells. It is said that up to 3000 peasants lived in the underground settlement, and even farm animals were kept underground. Timeline Third Century - First excavations 1618-48 - Longest continuous occupation of the caves during the 30 Years War. 1750-1830 - Caves by salt smugglers. 1887 - Caves rediscovered by Abbot Danicourt, the village priest.

In 18th/19th century England, mercury was used in the production of felt, which was used in the manufacturing of hats. Some workers in these factories developed dementia because of mercury poisoning. What expression for insanity has this etymological origin?","completion":"The expression for insanity that has its etymological origin in the mercury poisoning of hat makers in 18th/19th century England is \\"mad as a hatter.\\" This phrase is often associated with the Hatter character in Lewis Carroll's \\"Alice's Adventures in Wonderland\\" (1865), although the character itself is not actually referred to as \\"mad\\" in the text. The term \\"mad as a hatter\\" predates Carroll's work and emerged from the hat-making industry in England. During the 18th and 19th centuries, hat makers, also known as hatters or milliners, used mercury in the process of making felt. Felt was a popular material for producing hats such as top hats, bowlers, and other fashionable headwear of the time. Hatters made felt by pressing, heating, and condensing animal hairs, primarily from beaver or rabbit, until they matted together. To process the animal fur, hatters treated it with a solution containing mercury. Mercuric nitrate was mixed into an acidic solution to dissolve the dense, unfashionably waxy coating on the hairs. The resulting softer and more pliable hairs could then be pressed and manipulated more easily to make felt. During this procedure, mercury vapors were released into the air and could be inhaled or absorbed through the skin by the workers. Long-term exposure to this toxic metal led to mercury poisoning, or 'erethism', in many hatters. The symptoms of mercury poisoning included confusion, poor muscle coordination, slurred speech, tremors, irritability, memory loss, and mental disturbances, similar to dementia. These symptoms were both mental and physical; consequently, affected hatters were labeled \\"mad\\" as they exhibited abnormal behavior and delusions. The phrase \\"mad as a hatter\\" gained widespread recognition and became synonymous with insanity. While it originated with the unfortunate occupational hazard of 18th/19th century hat makers, the idiom became more widely known and used in a broader context to describe someone behaving irrationally, erratically, or displaying signs of mental imbalance. Today, the use of mercury in hat-making is a thing of the past, and the phrase \\"mad as a hatter\\" is now more of a literary or historical reference rather than an indication of the dangers faced by hat makers in the past."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their plan is to put her cane out in their dirty pool and force her at gunpoint to retrieve it. The prank goes awry when Vicki, believing the gun to be loaded with blanks, shoots Slater who collapses and appears to be dead. The girls agree to hide the body in the pool until their graduation party is finished. As the party begins, a guest wanders around the pool and an unidentified figure stabs him through the throat with Slater's cane. When other guests attempt to throw Jeanie in the pool, they are stopped by the sorority sisters. The girls realize that if the pool lights get switched on they will reveal Slater's body, so Stevie goes into the power room to disable them. While doing so, she is brutally stabbed to death by the same cane-wielding figure. Later, the pool lights do come on, but Slater's body is no longer in the pool. The girls speculate about what could have happened to both Stevie and the body. Deciding that Slater must still be alive, Vicki orders the girls to search for her. Morgan enters Slater's room where Slater's trussed-up body falls on her from the attic. She is joined by the sisters, and Vickie suggests hiding the body in the old cemetery.

The sexist double standards hurting Hillary Clinton Much of Hillary Clinton’s difficulty in this campaign stems from a single, unalterable fact: She is a woman. I’m not referring primarily to the Bernie Bros, those Bernie Sanders supporters who fill the Internet with misogynistic filth about Clinton. What drags down her candidacy is more pervasive and far subtler — unconscious, even. Dana Milbank writes about political theater in the nation’s capital. He joined the Post as a political reporter in 2000. The criticism is the same as in 2008: She doesn’t connect. She isn’t likeable. She doesn’t inspire. She seems shrill. “She shouts,” Bob Woodward said on MSNBC this month, also suggesting she “get off this screaming stuff.” Joe Scarborough, the host, agreed: “Has nobody told her that the microphone works?” At that, Clinton supporters hollered — about the double standard that condemns her but not Sanders, who bellows at the top of his lungs. The episode was part of a constant stream of commentators (generally men) taking issue with Clinton’s demeanor and conduct — “She’s got to become herself,” David Gergen advised on CNN before Thursday night’s debate — in a way they don’t do with Sanders. At a Clinton rally last week in New Hampshire, I discussed the decibel dilemma with Jay Newton-Small of Time magazine. “It’s very hard for a woman to telegraph passion,” she explained. “When Bernie yells, it shows his dedication to the cause. When she yells, it’s interpreted in a very different way: She’s yelling at you.” That’s not about Clinton; it’s about us. “It is a subtle kind of sexism that exists that we don’t recognize,” said Newton-Small, who literally wrote the book on the matter. “Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works,” out last month, includes a chapter on Clinton. “When women raise their voices, people tend to get their hackles up. People I talk to at Clinton events put her in a maternal role: Why is she screaming at me? Am I in trouble?” Campaigning While Female also deprives Clinton of the ability to make lofty promises. Sanders, for example, has a 15 trillion non-starter of a health-care plan. If Clinton floated such a plan, the media would mock it as patently absurd. But Sanders gets a pass. Why the double standard? “Men are the guys who want to go out and buy the motorcycle, and women are the purse-string holders,” Newton-Small said. “It’s a very traditional role we are putting women into by making them the one saying, no, we can’t do all these really fun things. This is a very stereotypical box she gets put into, which then makes it very hard for her to be inspirational.” This is the essence of Clinton’s trouble: If she can’t plausibly offer pie in the sky, and she can’t raise her voice, how does she inspire people? This hurts particularly with young voters — the same segment that shunned Clinton in 2008. Clinton’s “likeability” problem also has something to do with her lack of a Y chromosome. It’s a direct consequence of the imperative that she demonstrate her toughness. Men can be tough and warm at the same time — think Ronald Reagan — but for women, it’s a trade-off. In 2008, she played down gender and positioned herself as “ready to lead on day one.” This time she took a softer approach but eventually found herself back in the position of arguing that she’d be a better wartime leader than Sanders. For Clinton, “it’s a really tough needle to thread to be tough enough to be a commander in chief and still be likeable,” Newton-Small said. I disagree with those who scream “sexism” every time somebody criticizes Clinton. But there’s no denying that women are more often the victims of online savagery. That was true long before the Bernie Bros (who could be heard booing a mention of Madeleine Albright at Thursday’s debate). Sanders objects to the Bernie Bros but may encourage them when he talks about the “drama” Clinton creates and her “shouting.” It’s also hard to imagine a male candidate being faulted for his wife’s misbehavior the way Clinton is blamed for her husband’s. There’s not much Clinton can do about this. But she can make the case that while Sanders talks “revolution,” her presidency actually would be one, because the first female president would govern differently from her 44 predecessors. Clinton has been at the vanguard of the women’s movement for decades, but the movement has been so successful that young voters, even women, don’t realize how much has changed — and how having a woman as president could complete that Quiet Revolution. “Women in general are better listeners, are more collegial, more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for win-win outcomes,” Clinton told Newton-Small in “Broad Influence.” Now that’s something worth shouting about.

So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process.

I read this background article the other day: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds. I am facing a new situation today: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which cousin studied less about the small particles that make up all matter? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dawn's cousin, Greg, likely studied less about the small particles that make up all matter. Here's the step-by-step thought process and justification for this answer: 1. In the new situation, Greg studied Biology while Dawn studied Chemistry. 2. From the background article, we know that chemists often look at the world in terms of macroscopic and microscopic perspectives. 3. The microscopic perspective deals with the small particles that make up all matter, such as atoms and molecules. 4. As a Chemistry major, Dawn would have been exposed to more microscopic perspectives and studies on small particles, including atomic-level interactions, while studying chemistry. 5. Greg, on the other hand, as a Biology major, would primarily focus on the study of living organisms, which includes macroscopic and microscopic perspectives but is generally less focused on the atomic and molecular level that defines the small particles making up all matter. 6. Therefore, Greg, the cousin who studied Biology, likely studied less about the small particles that make up all matter compared to Dawn, who studied Chemistry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: 1. yes. 2. it is not possible to tell. 3. no.","completion":"It seems that you have some concerns regarding the number of appeals one should be allowed to have. I understand that this is an important topic and that different opinions may exist. In order to provide you with a detailed and thoughtful answer, let's examine the reasons for and against having at least two appeals. Pros: 1. Fairness: Allowing for at least two appeals ensures that a person has multiple chances to present their case or arguments. This could be construed as a more equitable and fair system, where the individual has the opportunity to voice their point of view and make sure that all relevant information is taken into consideration. 2. Avoiding errors: By granting at least two appeals, there is a higher likelihood that mistakes or errors can be identified and rectified. This not only allows the appealing party to remedy any shortcomings in their case, but it also ensures the integrity of the overall decision-making process. 3. Balancing power dynamics: In some situations or legal systems, there might be considerable power imbalances between the parties involved. Allowing for at least two appeals provides a counterbalance mechanism, where the weaker party has ample opportunity to engage in the process and advocate for their rights. Cons: 1. Time-consuming and cost-intensive: Having two or more appeal opportunities can significantly prolong the decision-making process, resulting in administrative, financial, and even emotional burden for all parties involved. This may also have a broader societal impact, with prolonged resolution times affecting families, businesses, or communities. 2. Potential abuse of the system: With multiple appeals, there might be a greater possibility of people using the appeals process as a delay tactic or even abusing the system. This could lead to unnecessary strain on the appeals system and an overall decrease in its efficiency. 3. Judicial uncertainty: Granting multiple appeals may give rise to judicial uncertainty, as continual appeal opportunities might undermine the finality of decisions. This could weaken the authoritative nature of the initial judgment and compromise the stability of the overall legal framework. Considering these factors, it is essential to strike a balance between providing equitable opportunities for appeal while maintaining the efficiency and integrity of the legal system. While it is impossible to give a definitive answer for all contexts, it is clear that a well-functioning appeals system should consider the pros and cons discussed above. Whether at least two appeals should be granted ultimately depends on the specific context and the values a society chooses to prioritize."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This second attitude of communication, referred to as the constitutive model or constructionist view, focuses on how an individual communicates as the determining factor of the way the message will be interpreted. Communication is viewed as a conduit; a passage in which information travels from one individual to another and this information becomes separate from the communication itself. A particular instance of communication is called a speech act. The sender's personal filters and the receiver's personal filters may vary depending upon different regional traditions, cultures, or gender; which may alter the intended meaning of message contents. In the presence of \\"communication noise\\" on the transmission channel (air, in this case), reception and decoding of content may be faulty, and thus the speech act may not achieve the desired effect. One problem with this encode-transmit-receive-decode model is that the processes of encoding and decoding imply that the sender and receiver each possess something that functions as a codebook, and that these two code books are, at the very least, similar if not identical. Although something like code books is implied by the model, they are nowhere represented in the model, which creates many conceptual difficulties. Question: What is something that may cause the reception and decoding of the content of a message to be faulty?","completion":"There are several factors that may cause the reception and decoding of the content of a message to be faulty. Some of these factors include communication noise, personal filters, cultural differences, language barriers, and contextual misunderstandings. Each of these factors can interfere with the accurate transmission and interpretation of a message, leading to communication breakdowns or misinterpretations. 1. Communication Noise: Noise refers to any external or internal interference that can disrupt the communication process. This can include physical noise, such as loud environments or poor audio quality, as well as psychological noise, such as distractions or emotional states that may hinder a person's ability to focus on the message. Noise can affect the clarity and coherence of a message, making it difficult for the receiver to accurately understand the content. 2. Personal Filters: The sender and receiver of a message each have their own unique set of experiences, beliefs, and expectations that can influence their interpretation of a message. These personal filters can cause the sender to encode the message with certain assumptions or biases, and the receiver to interpret the message through their own subjective lens. This can lead to misunderstandings or miscommunications, as the intended meaning of the message may not fully align with the perceived meaning. 3. Cultural Differences: Communication styles and norms can vary greatly across different cultures, and these differences can impact the way a message is both encoded and decoded. For instance, certain gestures, expressions, idioms, or customs that hold specific meanings in one culture may not be well-understood or may have different interpretations in another culture. Misunderstandings can arise when communicators are not aware of these differences or fail to adapt their communication style to accommodate them. 4. Language Barriers: If the sender and receiver of a message speak different languages or have varying language proficiencies, the effectiveness of communication can be greatly diminished. There may be difficulties in accurately translating words or phrases, or in understanding colloquialisms or slang. Misinterpretations or miscommunications can occur when a person is unable to fully comprehend or express their ideas in the language being used. 5. Contextual Misunderstandings: The context in which a message is delivered can greatly affect its interpretation. If the receiver is not aware of the context or background information, they may misinterpret the message or miss important details that impact its meaning. Additionally, the sender may assume that the receiver understands the context, which could result in miscommunication if that assumption is incorrect. In conclusion, various factors can lead to faulty reception and decoding of the content of a message, such as communication noise, personal filters, cultural differences, language barriers, and contextual misunderstandings. Recognizing these potential challenges and adapting communication strategies accordingly can help improve the effectiveness and accuracy of the communication process."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task you will be given a process, and a question.

Instead, they want to know things like “How do I keep my mother from falling?” or “What should I do? My grandfather’s been falling.” After all, falls are a scary thing. Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult’s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving. So, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it’s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall. If you want to learn more, you’re in the right place. In this post, I’ll cover: * How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent — or yourself — safer, * Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips, * The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls, * A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself. First, understand why older people fall There are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons. So how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk? Now, you can — and should — try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews. But if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall.

Answer the following question: Process: - Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes - The pollution negatively affects the water quality - The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals - The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives - The plants and animals do not reproduce very well - The number of plants and animals decreases over time - The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it - Eventually there is nothing living in the water and it is unusable - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose companies might be moved overseas happens, how will it affect LESS bad effects of pollution. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, we will analyze the supposed perturbation and each step of the process to understand if there is any effect (direct or indirect) on the process: Perturbation hypothesis: Companies might be moved overseas. Step 1: Pollution enters natural water sources such as rivers and lakes: - If companies with polluting activities are moved overseas, this might reduce the amount of pollution entering water sources in the original location. There would be an indirect effect on this step of the process, potentially causing less pollution in the area. Step 2: The pollution negatively affects the water quality: - With less pollution in the water sources, water quality may improve. Thus, the perturbation has an indirect positive effect on this step. Step 3: The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals: - If water quality improves due to less pollution, it may positively affect the health of local plants and animals. This is an indirect positive effect of the perturbation. Step 4: The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives: - Improved water quality and better health among plants and animals may lead to longer and healthier lives for them. This is an indirect positive effect of the perturbation. Step 5: The plants and animals do not reproduce very well: - If plants and animals are healthier, they may reproduce more effectively, leading to a more stable population. This is another indirect positive effect of the perturbation. Step 6: The number of plants and animals decreases over time: - Healthier and more productive populations will likely not experience the same decline in numbers. This represents an indirect positive effect of the perturbation. Step 7: The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it: - As the plants and animals thrive due to improved water quality, they can help maintain better water quality as well. This is an indirect positive effect of the perturbation. Step 8: Eventually there is nothing living in the water, and it is unusable: - If the perturbation results in healthier plants and animals and improved water quality, it is less likely that the water will become unusable. This is another indirect positive effect of the perturbation. In conclusion, the perturbation of moving polluting companies overseas may have an indirect positive effect on the process of reducing the bad effects of pollution in the original location. However, it should be noted that while the original location may experience improvements, the new location where the companies are moved to might experience an increase in pollution and the associated negative effects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1933 double eagle, a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president, a king and a Secret Service sting operation, was auctioned Tuesday last night for a record price for a coin, 7.59 million, nearly double the previous record. The anonymous buyer, believed to be an individual collector who lives in the United States, made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nine-minute auction at Sotheby's in Manhattan. Eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders, while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on eBay. As auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy, the sale price \\"suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong,\\" said David Redden, a vice chairman at Sotheby's, who was the auctioneer. \\"This is an astonishing new record for a coin,\\" he said. In an unprecedented move, the auction proceeds were split by the U.S. Mint and a London coin dealer, Stephen Fenton, who had won that right in court after having been arrested by Secret Service agents for trying to sell the coin in the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in Manhattan in 1996. Henrietta Holsman Fore, the director of the U.S. Mint, who witnessed the sale, said, \\"The monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism.\\" Fenton commented that the double eagle had been on \\"a long historic journey, with a very satisfying ending.\\" He added, \\"I am thrilled with the price.\\" The previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 U.S. silver dollar, which sold for 4.14 million in 1999. Sotheby's partner in the one-lot auction was Stack's Rare Coins, with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission. \\"I have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business,\\" said Lawrence R. Stack, the company's managing director. \\"This is the Mona Lisa of coins,\\" said Beth Deisher, editor of Coin World, the largest weekly coin publication in the United States, with a circulation of 85,000. \\"It is unique.

It has a long, metal part with sharp teeth called the \\"chain\\" and a motor that makes it go fast in a circle. To use a chainsaw, a grown-up will usually follow these steps: 1. Wear safety gear: They put on special clothes, gloves, goggles, and ear protection to stay safe and not get hurt. 2. Check the chainsaw: They make sure it's clean, and everything is working well, like the chain tension and the sharpness of the teeth. 3. Start the chainsaw: They turn it on with a switch or a pull cord. This wakes up the motor, and you might hear a loud noise, like a big bee. 4. Hold it properly: They hold the chainsaw with both hands, keeping their fingers and thumbs wrapped around the handles. 5. Cut the tree or branch: They carefully touch the running chain to the object they want to cut, using their body weight to help push the chainsaw. The sharp teeth of the chain chew through the wood like a cookie monster eating a cookie. 6. Finish the cut: When they're almost through the wood, they slow down, making the final cut, and letting the object fall gently. 7. Turn off the chainsaw: After finishing the work, they turn it off and let the chainsaw cool down. Remember, chainsaws can be very dangerous, so only grown-ups with experience should use them.

Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September... answer the following question: What partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas?

Student:","completion":"To complete this task, we need to identify the author's sentiment towards the entity Wang in the given text. Let's follow these simple steps: 1. Read the text carefully and identify any statements or descriptions related to Wang. 2. Analyze if the statements about Wang are positive, neutral, or negative. 3. Based on the overall sentiment of the statements, select the final sentiment. Here, we have the following statements about Wang: - Skyler Wang is a Ph.D. candidate in sociology at the University of California, Berkeley. - Wang also taught an undergraduate course at the University of British Columbia called \\"What Makes Us Click\\" about online dating. - He gave NPR permission to use his course title for Morning Edition's series on online dating. Now, let's analyze these statements: - The first statement mentions Wang as a Ph.D. candidate, which is a neutral fact. - The second statement talks about Wang teaching a course and is also considered a neutral fact. - The third statement shows Wang giving permission for using his course title, which could be seen as a slightly positive action. Based on these statements, the overall sentiment towards Wang appears mostly neutral with a slight positive undertone. However, given the guidelines, we can conclude the sentiment as Neutral since there is no clear positive or negative view towards Wang in the text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oscar is still hosting a regular poker game and is still an untidy slob, now living in Sarasota, Florida, but still a sportswriter. One day, he is called by his son Brucey with an invitation to California for his wedding the following Sunday. A second shock for Oscarâthe woman his son is marrying is Felix's daughter, Hannah. On the flight from New York to Los Angeles, it becomes clear that Felix has not changed his waysâhe is still a fussy, allergy-suffering neat freak nuisance. Oscar and Felix are reunited at the airport and very happy to be together again after 17 years of separationâat least for a couple of minutes. They intend to share a rental car to San Malina for the wedding. But the trip begins with Oscar forgetting Felix's suitcase at the Budget car rental, including wedding gifts and wardrobe inside. Oscar also loses the directions to San Malina when his cigar ashes burn them. He and Felix become hopelessly lost, unable to even remember the name of the town where they are headed, so many California city names sounding alike.

Does \\"In the early 10th century, the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany, and was engaged in driving back the Magyars.\\" correctly answer the question of What group did Otto I defeat?","completion":"While the statement \\"In the early 10th century, the Ottonian dynasty had established itself in Germany and was engaged in driving back the Magyars\\" does provide some information about the group that Otto I defeated, it does not provide a comprehensive and detailed answer to the question. To fully address the question of the group that Otto I defeated, let's delve more deeply into the historical context, key events, and the legacy of Otto I's victory. Otto I, also known as Otto the Great, was a significant figure of the Ottonian dynasty and the king of East Francia from 936 to 973. He later became the first emperor of the Holy Roman Empire in 962, strengthening the power of the Ottonian dynasty and laying the groundwork for the empire's future development. During his reign, Otto I faced a threat from the Magyars, a nomadic people originating from Central Asia who later founded the Kingdom of Hungary. The Magyars, known for their fierce fighting skills and horse archery, frequently invaded and raided Western territories, including Otto's kingdom. One of the essential aspects of Otto's reign was his desire to thwart the aggression of the Magyars and to ensure his people's safety. The group that Otto I defeated was, indeed, the Magyars. In August 955, Otto I led an army that fought against the Magyar forces at the Battle of Lechfeld, near present-day Augsburg in Bavaria. The battle was a decisive victory for Otto and his forces, effectively putting an end to the Magyar's westward expansions and raids. A few factors contributed to Otto's success at the Battle of Lechfeld. First, his forces were well-prepared and numerically superior, with a mix of heavy infantry, cavalry, and archers. He also established a strong alliance with various regional leaders, thus ensuring a united front against the common enemy. Additionally, Otto utilized superior strategy and tactics, outmaneuvering the Magyars on the battlefield and exploiting their weaknesses. The outcome of the battle had lasting consequences and marked a turning point for both sides. For the Ottonians, the victory over the Magyars secured their preeminence in Central Europe and laid the foundations for the future Holy Roman Empire. The triumph also played a significant role in Otto's coronation as emperor in 962, solidifying his authority and influence. Meanwhile, the defeat forced the Magyars to abandon their nomadic ways and focus on the establishment of the Kingdom of Hungary. It led to their Christianization and integration into the European political and cultural landscape. To summarize, the statement provided does identify the Magyars as the group Otto I defeated. However, a more comprehensive answer should include an account of Otto I's background and reign, the significance of the Magyars and their incursions, the Battle of Lechfeld as the turning point where Otto I defeated them, and the broader implications and historical consequences of this victory."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Russian animal rights activists accuse authorities of campaign to exterminate street dogs. Government-backed shelter met with distrust by animal rights groups. Reports of the widespread culling of animals put city and Olympic officials on the defensive. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Allegations of Street Dog Extermination Campaign in Russia Raises Concern Introduction: Recently, Russian animal rights activists have raised alarm bells over what they believe is a campaign by authorities to eliminate street dogs in the country. While the government has backed the construction of shelters as a response, these efforts are met with distrust by animal rights groups. The situation has put both city and Olympic officials on the defensive as reports of widespread culling create an atmosphere of tension and concern. Step 1: Discuss the accusations from animal rights activists Animal rights activists in Russia have accused authorities of launching a campaign to exterminate stray dogs crawling the streets. They claim that mass culling of the animals is taking place without any regard to humane procedures. The accusatory reports have triggered widespread concern among animal rights groups and the general public, as people demand a more compassionate approach to dealing with the stray dog problem in the country. Step 2: Present the government-backed shelter action In response to the accusations, the government has backed the construction of shelters to accommodate street dogs. These shelters aim to provide a safe haven for the animals while giving animal welfare organizations a chance to find permanent homes for them. However, the government's response has not been enough to appease the concerns of animal rights groups. Step 3: Explain the distrust from animal rights groups Despite the government's efforts in establishing shelters for street dogs, animal rights groups remain skeptical. They fear that these shelters are merely a guise for more inhumane actions, such as forced euthanasia or mass culling. They argue that the transparency of actions taken by the authorities is crucial in ensuring the well-being of the animals. Step 4: Describe how city and Olympic officials are on the defensive The disseminating reports regarding the possible extermination campaign have placed city and Olympic officials on the defensive. With growing concerns over the street dog population, pressure mounts on these officials to deliver a humane and acceptable solution. They must also ensure that any accusations of cruelty are thoroughly investigated to uphold their reputation on the global stage, especially in the lead-up to the Olympic Games. Conclusion: The allegations of a street dog extermination campaign in Russia have unearthed a pressing need for humane methods in dealing with the stray dog population. As city and Olympic officials scramble to address the issue, it is essential that transparency and compassion remain at the forefront of their efforts. Animal rights groups will continue to monitor the situation closely, advocating for a future where all animals are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In both instances, \\"run\\" implies that a process or action is being carried out. However, the context and specific meaning differ significantly. 1. In the sentence \\"Run a new program on the Mac,\\" run is used in the context of executing a software application on a computer (in this case, on a Mac). The word \\"run\\" describes the action of launching or starting the program, allowing the computer to process the application's instructions and perform its designated tasks. In computer science, a program needs to be run (executed) to perform its functions and accomplish what it was designed for. So, in this sentence, \\"run\\" signifies the act of starting or executing a software application on a specific device. 2. In the sentence \\"They ran twenty blood tests on me and they still don't know what's wrong,\\" run is used in the context of performing a series of tests or examinations of samples, particularly blood samples, in order to obtain information or results. The process involved in the execution of these various tests could be considered as \\"running\\" the tests. The purpose of this action is to analyze and gather information to draw a conclusion, diagnose, or address a specific situation (in this case, identifying potential health issues). In this context, \\"run\\" stands for conducting or carrying out a series of tests or procedures in order to collect relevant data. While both usages of \\"run\\" involve conducting or carrying out a particular action, the specific meaning varies depending on the context. In the first sentence, \\"run\\" relates to executing a software program on a Mac computer. In the second sentence, \\"run\\" relates to performing a set of medical diagnostic tests.

In March 2012, researchers in the United States announce that they have developed the first wirelessly controlled device that can supply a drug directly into the body. A small chip is implanted under the skin. It contains the medicine, which it releases at preset times. The developers say the device could improve the lives of millions of people who take medicine for long-term illnesses. A company called MicroCHIPS began developing the device about fifteen years ago. Last month, the company released the results of its first successful tests in humans. The tests took place in Denmark with seven women with osteoporosis. Osteoporosis causes bones to become weak and break easily. The disorder is common among older people, especially women. Many patients have to give themselves daily injections of medicine. One type of treatment requires injections for two years. Robert farra is the president of MicroCHIPS. He says many patients stop taking the medicine because of the pain and stress of the injections and that only twenty-five percent of the patients will go through the entire twenty-four months of treatment. The microchip is a few centimeters long. It has small sections that each hold a single dose of medicine. Mr. Farra says the device has to be programmed with the times to release the drug and that doctors will be able to reprogram the device from a computer or even a cell phone. The seven women in the study were aged sixty-five to seventy. The researchers say the implants were just as effective as daily injections. And they say the dosage amounts were more exact than patients often give themselves. The microchips in the study held only twenty doses of medicine. Mr. Farra and his team are now designing a version that could hold a full year's worth of medicine.

Article: Besides providing an ideal environment for sea plants and animals to live in, seawater has other values, one of which is that it constantly moves, and its movements produce energy. The most obvious movements are waves and the tides. Winds causes the waves, and the gravitational pull of the moon and the son causes tides. In places like the Bay of Fundy in Canada, the difference between the high and low tide level can be as much as 40 feet. France and Britain are now trying to use energy in the tides to produce electricity. Waves can produce electricity and some experiments are taking place to learn more about this. One of the most encouraging areas of research uses the difference between the temperature of seawater at the surface and deep down to produce electricity.

A team of scientists from Scotland says \\"yes.\\" They've kept some special chickens that lay eggs with disease-treating drugs inside. These drugs are made of molecules called proteins. Animals make thousands of proteins--they're the main ingredients in skin, hair, milk, and meat. Since animals can make proteins easily, they're good animals for making protein drugs. Researchers have already made cows, sheep, and goats that pump out protein drugs in their milk. But chickens are cheaper to take care of, need less room, and grow faster than these other animals. \\"Those qualities could make chickens a better choice to become living drug factories.\\" says Simon Lillico of the Roslin Institute near Edinburgh, Scotland. Lillico and a team of researchers changed chickens' DNA--the code that tells cells how to make proteins--so that the birds' cells made two protein drugs. One drug can treat skin cancer, and the other treats a nerve disease called multiple sclerosis. The scientists changed the chickens' DNA so that the birds made these drugs only in their egg whites. This protects the chickens' bodies from the drugs' possible harmful effects and makes it easy for scientists to collect the drugs. These special chickens can pass on their drug-laying abilities to their chicks. So far, the Scottish researchers have kept five generations of drug-producing chickens. But the scientists need to improve these chickens. The chickens don't make enough drugs to treat people yet. Once the researchers perfect their technique, you might eventually take your medicine from chicken eggs. What is the best title of the passage? A) Animals and Protein Drugs.

The technology works in the same way as it does with mobile phone payments: users must have their finger over the sensor when making a purchase. Security experts have said that while using fingerprints is not foolproof, it is a \\"sensible\\" use of biometric technology. Mastercard's chief of safety and security, Ajay Bhalla, said that the fingerprint technology would help \\"to deliver additional convenience and security. It is not something that can be taken or replicated.\\" However, fingerprint sensors can be compromised. Karsten Nohl, chief scientist at Berlin's Security Research Labs, told the BBC: \\"All I need is a glass or something you have touched in the past.\\" He adds that if that information is stolen, \\"you only have nine fingerprint changes before you run out of options\\". But Mr Nohl is cautiously optimistic about the technology, saying it is \\"better than what we have at the moment\\". \\"With the combination of chip and PIN, the PIN is the weaker element. Using a fingerprint gets rid of that.\\" \\"Fingerprints have helped us avoid using terrible passwords, and even the most gullible person is not going to cut off their finger if [a criminal] asks nicely.\\" The cards are thought to be the first to include both the digital template of the user's fingerprint and the sensor required to read their fingerprints at the point of sale. Previous biometric payment cards only worked when used in conjunction with a separate fingerprint scanner. That limited their usefulness, as only stores with the correct equipment could accept them. Having both the data and the scanner on the same card means that they should be accepted everywhere a normal chip and PIN payment card can be used. But the biometric verification can only be used for in-store purchases: online and other so-called \\"card not present\\" transactions will still require further security measures. What was that article about?","completion":"This article is about a new type of payment card introduced by Mastercard. These cards have a special fingerprint sensor on them, which means people can pay for things by putting their finger on the card, instead of using a PIN code.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns. Thankfully, hard work and good will from all parties allowed us to find a solution that works for everyone.\\" Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services are non-profit organizations that provide civil legal assistance to low-income individuals and families throughout Washington state. Members of the state's Access to Justice Network, these organizations work with thousands of volunteer attorneys to ensure that justice is available to those who face critical legal problems and can't afford private legal counsel.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Merlin, his retired wizard teacher for the following movie plot: Harold has fallen ill and his ogre son-in-law Shrek and daughter Fiona are next in line to be king and queen. Shrek declines, insisting that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there has to be someone else for the job. With his final few breaths, the king tells Shrek that there is one other heir who can become the new King of Far Far Away: his nephew, Arthur. Shrek sets out to find this new king, along with Donkey and Puss in Boots. As they're sailing off, Fiona runs to the dock and announces to Shrek that he's going to be a father. Shocked, Shrek begins to have nightmares about his future children on the journey to Worcestershire Academy, where they eventually discover that \\"Artie,\\" who is an academy student, is a loser picked on by the other students - even the nerds.

When Yao Ming retired from professional basketball seven months ago, there were fears that interest in the NBA among China's 1.3 billion people would dwindle. But now the former Houston Rockets center -- one of the most successful overseas players in the league's history -- could be forgiven for feeling like yesterday's star in China thanks to Jeremy Lin, the American-born New York Knicks point guard with roots in mainland China and Taiwan. \\"We have a lot of talented young athletes here who are passionate about basketball,\\" Yao told CNN in an interview Wednesday. \\"They all want be the next Jeremy. \\"I think they can relate more to Jeremy because they're more common-sized.\\" For Yao, 31, who stands at seven feet six inches (2.29 meters) tall and remains a towering presence off court, Lin's natural talent more than makes up for his below average six-foot-three-inch (1.91 meters) frame in the league. Cha: In Lin, China loves a winner. \\"The easy part is to find a strong basketball player -- I have the size; Shaquille O'Neal: big and strong; Kobe, LeBron, all those names,\\" he said. \\"Jeremy has basketball IQ -- you can't program that. \\"He's the kind of player I'd like to play with if I'm still a player -- he's a team player and everybody likes the way he wins a game,\\" he added. \\"Honestly, he did much more than I'd expected.\\" Lin, 23, only recently a little known back-up player sitting on the Knicks bench, has been leading his team to a wave of recent victories without their established stars -- pulling off an average of 20 points and eight assists in six successive games. Halfway across the globe, Lin's fan base on Sina Weibo, China's top micro-blogging site, has already hit the two million mark, four times the number of his followers on Twitter. Inside the Yuanshen stadium Wednesday night, in between cheering Yao-owned Shanghai Sharks at a tight playoff game, local basketball enthusiasts gave a huge thumbs up to a player far from their court. Jeremy 'Lin-demand' in China. \\"Jeremy Lin is great,\\" one man gushed. \\"He plays so good -- lots of Chinese love him.\\" Another added: \\"He was born in America, but his blood is Chinese.\\" Echoing this fan, Chinese media -- to the chagrin of its Taiwanese counterpart -- has been quick to claim Lin, whose parents emigrated from Taiwan but have family roots in mainland China. The two sides split after a Chinese civil war in the 1940s, but the Beijing government regards Taiwan as a renegade province that must be reunited with the mainland. Ever the sports diplomat, Yao has a simple answer to solve the contentious issue of Lin's identity: \\"He's a great basketball player.\\" Politics aside, comparisons between the two seem inevitable. Shanghai native Yao grew up in China's state-sponsored sports system and, amid much fanfare, was signed by the Rockets in 2002 as the NBA's top overall pick. Paid 93 million by the league during his nine-year career, Yao scored an average of 19 points per game and was voted an All-Star player eight times. Lin, born and bred in California, was overlooked by most NBA teams before the Knicks picked him. Even with his new-found stardom, the Harvard graduate earns much less than many of his teammates. Despite their different paths to professional basketball, the two bonded through similar cultural experiences after meeting at an event for Yao's charity two years ago. \\"He gives a lot of hope to kids with the same background like his: Asian-Americans, second generation or maybe third,\\" Yao said of Lin's recent achievements. \\"They can follow his footprints and have more confidence in playing basketball.\\" While both have been called trailblazers, some argue it would be difficult for anyone to fill the void left by Yao, whose popularity helped the NBA franchise make huge inroads in the world's most populous nation. \\"I don't think anybody in the NBA, from the Chinese perspective, will ever become a bigger star than Yao,\\" NBA commissioner David Stern told China Daily, the country's official English-language newspaper, early this month. \\"Yao was the first, the biggest and the most successful -- and he will always have a special place in the heart of NBA and Chinese fans.\\" \\"(Lin's success) was wonderful for our league... but I don't want to overburden him with expectations,\\" he added. \\"We have to see how he does in the next 300 games before we make any judgments.\\" Yao, however, appears to have made up his mind about Lin. The two talk on the phone or exchange messages after the younger player's games. \\"I know people talk about me giving him tips -- it's really not that,\\" Yao said with a laugh. \\"I just congratulated him and said I'm happy for him.\\" \\"I told him we'll support him and I'm a big fan of his.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1. Yao Ming's retirement from professional basketball raised concerns about NBA interest in China. 2. Jeremy Lin, an American-born New York Knicks point guard with Chinese and Taiwanese roots, has gained immense popularity in China, mitigating such concerns. 3. Yao Ming praises Jeremy Lin, stating his natural talent and basketball IQ more than makes up for his below-average height in the league. 4. Lin has already gained two million followers on Sina Weibo, China's top micro-blogging site, which is four times the number of his Twitter followers. 5. Chinese media claims Lin as one of their own, despite his parents emigrating from Taiwan. 6.

In other words, it is the smallest meaningful unit of a language. The field of study dedicated to morphemes is called morphology. A morpheme is not identical to a word, and the principal difference between the two is that a morpheme may or may not stand alone, whereas a word, by definition, is freestanding. When it stands by itself, it is considered as a root because it has a meaning of its own (e.g. the morpheme \\"cat\\") and when it depends on another morpheme to express an idea, it is an affix because it has a grammatical function (e.g. the \\"s\\" in \\"cats\\" to indicate that it is plural). Every word comprises one or more morphemes. - A syllable is a unit of organization for a sequence of speech sounds. For example, the word \\"water\\" is composed of two syllables: \\"wa\\" and \\"ter\\". A syllable is typically made up of a syllable nucleus (most often a vowel) with optional initial and final margins (typically, consonants). - The Berber Latin alphabet is the version of the Latin alphabet used to write the Berber languages. It was adopted in the 19th century, using varieties of letters. Today, the Latin alphabet is preferred by most Berber writers and linguists in North Africa and abroad for practical reasons. - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels. - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit). - In phonetics, a vowel is a sound in spoken language, with two competing definitions. In the more common phonetic definition, a vowel is a sound pronounced with an open vocal tract, so that the tongue does not touch the lips, teeth, or roof of the mouth, such as the English \\"ah\\" or \\"oh\\" . There is no build-up of air pressure at any point above the glottis. This contrasts with consonants, such as the English \\"sh\\" , which have a constriction or closure at some point along the vocal tract. In the other, phonological definition, a vowel is defined as syllabic, the sound that forms the peak of a syllable. A phonetically equivalent but non-syllabic sound is a semivowel. - North Africa or Northern Africa is the northernmost region of Africa. The United Nations definition of \\"North Africa\\" includes seven countries and territories; Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. The countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya are often collectively referred to as the Maghreb, which is the Arabic word for \\"sunset\\". Egypt lies to the northeast and encompasses part of West Asia, while Sudan is situated on the edge of the Sahel, to the south of Egypt. - In linguistics, a grapheme is the smallest unit of a writing system of any given language. An individual grapheme may or may not carry meaning by itself, and may or may not correspond to a single phoneme of the spoken language. Graphemes include alphabetic letters, typographic ligatures, Chinese characters, numerical digits, punctuation marks, and other individual symbols. - A spoken language is a language produced by articulate sounds, as opposed to a written language. Many languages have no written form and so are only spoken. An oral language or vocal language is a language produced with the vocal tract, as opposed to a sign language, which is produced with the hands and face. The term \\"spoken language\\" is sometimes used to mean only vocal languages, especially by linguists, making all three terms synonyms by excluding sign languages. Others refer to sign language as \\"spoken\\", especially in contrast to written transcriptions of signs. - A phoneme is one of the units of sound (or gesture in the case of sign languages, see chereme) that distinguish one word from another in a particular language. The difference in meaning between the English words \\"kill\\" and \\"kiss\\" is a result of the exchange of the phoneme for the phoneme . Two words that differ in meaning through a contrast of a single phoneme form a minimal pair. - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition. - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky. - A syllabary is a set of written symbols that represent the syllables or (more frequently) moras which make up words. A symbol in a syllabary, called a syllabogram, typically represents an (optional) consonant sound (simple onset) followed by a vowel sound (nucleus)that is, a CV or V syllablebut other phonographic mappings such as CVC, CV- tone, and C (normally nasals at the end of syllables) are also found in syllabaries. - The Berber language or Amazigh languages (Berber name: , Tamazit, Tamazight, pronounced ) are a family of similar and closely related languages and dialects indigenous to North Africa. - An abjad (pronounced or ) is a type of writing system where each symbol stands for a consonant, leaving the reader to supply the appropriate vowel. The name \\"abjad\\" is based on the old Arabic alphabet's first four letters - a, b, j, d, to replace the common terms \\"consonantary\\", \\"consonantal alphabet\\" or \\"syllabary\\" to refer to the family of scripts called West Semitic. - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet. - Arabic (' or ' ) is a Central Semitic language that was first spoken in Iron Age northwestern Arabia and is now the \\"lingua franca\\" of the Arab world. Arabic also is a liturgical language of 1.7 billion Muslims. It is one of six official languages of the United Nations. It is named after the Arabs, a term initially used to describe peoples living from Mesopotamia in the east to the Anti-Lebanon mountains in the west, and from northwestern Arabia to the Sinai in the south. - Tifinagh ( Berber pronunciation : ( tifina ) ; also written Tifina in the Berber Latin alphabet , in Neo-Tifinagh , and in the Berber Arabic alphabet ) is a series of abjad and alphabetic scripts used to write Berber languages . A modern derivate of the traditional script , known as Neo-Tifinagh , was introduced in the 20th century . A slightly modified version of the traditional script , called Tifinagh Ircam , is used in a number of Moroccan elementary schools in teaching the Berber language to children as well as a number of publications . The word tifinagh is thought to be a Berberized feminine plural cognate of Punic , through the Berber feminine prefix ti - and Latin Punicus ; thus tifinagh could possibly mean \`\` the Phoenician ( letters ) '' or \`\` the Punic letters '' . - A writing system is any conventional method of visually representing verbal communication. While both writing and speech are useful in conveying messages, writing differs in also being a reliable form of information storage and transfer. The processes of encoding and decoding writing systems involve shared understanding between writers and readers of the meaning behind the sets of characters that make up a script. Writing is usually recorded onto a durable medium, such as paper or electronic storage, although non-durable methods may also be used, such as writing on a computer display, in sand, or by skywriting. What is the relationship between 'tifinagh' and 'writing system'? Answer:","completion":"Tifinagh is a series of abjad and alphabetic scripts used to write Berber languages, which makes it a specific type of writing system. In other words, Tifinagh is an instance or example of a writing system used for a particular set of languages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Born James Eugene Carrey on January 17, 1962, he is a Canadian-American actor known for his exceptional talent in both comedic and dramatic roles. Carrey rose to fame in the early 1990s after a series of successful comedic performances, including the sketch comedy television series \\"In Living Color.\\" Though he had various roles in television and films before his breakthrough, it was his portrayal of the lead character in the 1994 film \\"Ace Ventura: Pet Detective\\" that propelled him into the limelight and solidified his status as a leading comedian. Following the success of \\"Ace Ventura,\\" Carrey starred in a string of box office hits, such as \\"The Mask\\" (1994) and \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" (1994). His performance as The Riddler in \\"Batman Forever\\" (1995) was another notable addition to his filmography; the film is the third installment in the initial Warner Bros. Batman film series. In \\"Batman Forever,\\" The Riddler, also known as Edward Nygma, is a former employee of Wayne Enterprises who becomes obsessed with puzzles, riddles, and mind games after being rejected and humiliated by Bruce Wayne, played by Val Kilmer. As The Riddler, Carrey exhibits his characteristic over-the-top and eccentric comedic style, replete with colorful costumes and exaggerated mannerisms. The Riddler teams up with another villain, Two-Face, played by Tommy Lee Jones, in an attempt to learn Batman's true identity and defeat him. Jim Carrey's performance as The Riddler garnered mixed reviews; some critics praised his unique take on the character, while others felt his portrayal was too extravagant. Nonetheless, Carrey's talent for physical comedy and expressive facial movements was undeniable and contributed to memorable scenes throughout the film. In addition to his comedic roles, Carrey has also demonstrated great depth as an actor, notably in films like \\"The Truman Show\\" (1998), \\"Man on the Moon\\" (1999), \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\" (2004), and \\"The Majestic\\" (2001)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Many years before, El Mariachi and his wife Carolina confronted Marquez in a shootout and wounded the general; in retaliation, Marquez took the lives of Carolina and their daughter in an ambush. In addition to El Mariachi, Sands persuades former FBI agent Jorge Ramírez to come out of retirement and kill Barillo, who had murdered his partner Archuleta in the past.

While monitoring Barillo's activities, Ramírez meets Billy Chambers, an American fugitive who has been living under the protection of Barillo, but can no longer stomach the horrible tasks he's been forced to carry out for him. Ramírez convinces Chambers he will provide him protection in exchange for getting closer to Barillo by tagging Chambers' pet chihuahua with a hidden microphone, and Chambers agrees to complete the deal by surrendering to U.S. authorities once Barillo has been taken down.

Question: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Over the past twenty years the development of antiretroviral drugs (also known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART) has increased rapidly. This has been driven by the AIDS epidemic. The Doctor studied two teams of people. Team N had no viral infections, while Team W had many people with HIV among its members. Obviously, team N had fewer health issues. Which team had more people receiving interferon? Answer:","completion":"To determine which team had more people receiving interferon, I will consider the information provided and compare the health status and needs of both teams. Step 1: Identify the health status of both teams. - Team N: No viral infections - Team W: Many people with HIV (a viral infection) among its members Step 2: Consider the use of interferon in treating viral diseases. - Interferon is the first antiviral drug, a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected. Step 3: Compare the health status of both teams with the use of interferon. - Team N: Since there are no viral infections in this team, it is less likely that interferon is needed or administered to members of this team. - Team W: This team has many people with HIV, a viral infection. Therefore, it is more likely that interferon is needed and administered to members of this team. Answer: Team W had more people receiving interferon due to the presence of HIV, a viral infection, among its members."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: Disappointing Review: I read on Wikipedia that this is Clive Barker's personal favorite of his writings, so I was looking forward to something good. Alas! The book is way too long for its own good with no sense of pacing. I found myself waiting for the end before I had even reached the middle. I kept going in hopes that it would somehow recover, but it never did. The action grinds and trudges and heaves its rambling way along for pages and pages, pausing only for the occasional moment of pointless sex and/or violence. Characterization is poor, so the numerous character die-offs littered throughout the book are mere wastes of time rather than emotional climaxes of any kind. The book seemed to aim towards grand themes and emotions but merely came off as grandiose. All in all, this book was a huge disappointment. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of the product review can be characterized as negative. The reviewer had high expectations for the book due to the author's personal endorsement, but ultimately found it to be a disappointment. Several elements contribute to the negative tone of the review, as detailed below: 1. Length: The reviewer feels the book's length is excessive, causing the story to drag on and diminishing their investment in the outcome. 2. Lack of pacing: The pacing, or the speed at which a narrative unfolds, is criticized as ineffective. The reviewer implies that, due to a lack of well-timed events or developments, they became disinterested in the story well before reaching the midpoint. 3. Uninteresting action: Although the book contains numerous action scenes, the reviewer suggests that these sequences lack excitement and appear as tedious rather than thrilling. 4. Superfluous content: The reviewer takes issue with \\"pointless sex and/or violence,\\" arguing that these elements do not add any value to the story, and serve merely as an interruption to the narrative structure. 5. Poor characterization: According to the reviewer, the characters are not well-developed, causing the emotional impact of their deaths to be inconsequential. This lack of engagement with the characters further adds to the reviewer's disappointment. 6. Unfulfilled ambitions: The reviewer perceives that the book attempts to explore grand themes and emotions but instead comes across as pretentious. In conclusion, the tone of this product review is undoubtedly negative, with the reviewer expressing significant dissatisfaction with multiple aspects of the book. These concerns range from the narrative's pacing and content to the characterization and thematic depth, ultimately culminating in a disappointing reading experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Available options: a). Yes; b). No; If I tell you that If an object in water is more dense than water it will sink because of gravity, and ask you the question \\"an object will sink in what if it's more dense?\\", is the correct answer \\"water\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"an object will sink in what if it's more dense?\\" is \\"water.\\" This is because the relative density of an object, which is often referred to as its specific gravity, is an essential factor that determines whether it will float or sink in a given fluid. In the context of this question, water is the fluid, and the object's density is being compared to that of water. The fundamental principle behind this phenomenon is buoyancy - the force exerted on an object submerged in a fluid, either fully or partially. Buoyancy arises due to the pressure differences in the fluid at various depths. This force acts in the upward direction and opposes the gravitational force acting on the object. Archimedes' principle is crucial in understanding buoyancy, which states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward buoyant force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. In simpler terms, when an object is submerged in water, it will displace a certain volume of water, and the upward force acting on it will be equal to the weight of the water displaced. The object's density, or mass per unit volume, is significant in determining whether it sinks or floats in water. If the object's density is greater than that of water, then the gravitational force acting on the object (its weight) will be more significant than the buoyant force. As a result, the object will sink. On the other hand, if the object's density is less than that of water, the upward buoyant force will be more significant than its weight, and the object will float. To answer the question, when an object is more dense than water, it will sink in the water due to the gravitational force acting on it. The object's higher density relative to water results in an insufficient buoyant force to keep it afloat, so it sinks. In contrast, objects with lower density than water will float on the surface due to the greater buoyant force compared to their weight."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Under-30s Should Demand an Opt Out of Social Security I don’t know anyone under the age of 30 who thinks Social Security will be there when they retire. (For that matter, I don’t know many middle-agers who expect to draw from it either.) And yet the under-30s dutifully pay their 12.4 percent payroll tax every paycheck with little complaining. It’s high time they stand up, push back and demand they be allowed to opt out. While millions of Americans have been snookered into thinking Social Security is solvent, and will be for years to come—see the comments from my recent piece on the Social Security Trust Fund—young adults haven’t been fooled. Washington Post reporter Lori Montgomery—one of Washington’s best—recently published an excellent exposé in the Post on Social Security’s financial struggles, and they are legion. Montgomery points out that in 2010, when a sagging economy significantly reduced tax revenues, the government paid out more in Social Security benefits than it collected in payroll taxes, for the first time since 1980. Since President Obama’s multiple stimulus packages and deficit spending have had little or no positive impact on the economy, Social Security will again spend more than it takes in this year—about 46 billion. And the payroll tax holiday—a 2-percentage point reduction in workers’ share of the payroll tax, from 6.2 percent to 4.2 percent, passed last December—means an extra 105 billion was never paid in to the system. Montgomery concludes, “Social Security is sucking money out of the Treasury.” But wait, that can’t be because there is 2.6 trillion in the Social Security Trust Fund. Why doesn’t the government just draw down on that account? Again, Montgomery gets it absolutely right: “The government has borrowed every cent and now must raise taxes, cut spending or borrow more heavily from outside investors to keep benefit checks flowing.” Our under-30s perceptively understand that all of the financial game playing bodes ill for their chances of getting Social Security when they retire. And the truth is it’s already a bad deal for my generation, the baby boomers. Just look at the numbers. Urban Institute economists Eugene Steuerle and Stephanie Rennane calculate that a single man earning the average wage in his working life and retiring in 2010 at age 65 will have paid 294,000 in lifetime Social Security taxes and can expect to receive 265,000 in lifetime Social Security benefits.* Not what you’d call a heckova deal. Of course, Social Security is social insurance rather than a personal retirement account, and so it uses a formula to cross-subsidize certain beneficiaries. That same male in a one-earner family would contribute the same but could expect 447,000 in lifetime benefits because of the non-working spouse. But I don’t begrudge them that extra money. A worker who had invested his payroll taxes in a broad-based mutual fund could expect to have significantly more money at retirement than he paid in. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the idea that individuals under the age of 30 should be allowed to opt out of Social Security, as many of them doubt the system's solvency and ability to provide benefits when they retire. The author highlights recent financial struggles faced by Social Security, such as paying out more in benefits than it collected in payroll taxes in 2010, and the additional 105 billion that was never paid into the system due to the payroll tax holiday. The article also mentions the Social Security Trust Fund, which has been entirely borrowed by the government, requiring more taxation, spending cuts, or borrowing from external investors to continue providing benefits. The author cites Urban Institute economists who provide data on the unfavorable returns for certain demographics, particularly single men earning average wages. They argue that Social Security is a bad deal for the younger generation who would likely have a significantly higher return if they chose to invest their payroll taxes in a broad-based mutual fund. Overall, the article advocates for younger individuals to push back against the current Social Security system and demand the option to opt out of it, as they perceive the system to be failing and unable to provide sufficient benefits during their retirement."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What type of details about ziva ben-porat can be gathered from the following bio?

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose death and the ensuing succession crisis prompted Hulagu Khan to pull the bulk of the Mongol forces out of the Middle East? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Mongols were allied with the Song, but this alliance was broken when the Song recaptured the former imperial capitals of Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Chang'an at the collapse of the Jin dynasty. The Mongol leader Möngke Khan led a campaign against the Song in 1259 but died on August 11 during the Siege of Diaoyu Castle in Chongqing. Möngke's death and the ensuing succession crisis prompted Hulagu Khan to pull the bulk of the Mongol forces out of the Middle East where they were poised to fight the Egyptian Mamluks (who defeated the remaining Mongols at Ain Jalut). Although Hulagu was allied with Kublai Khan, his forces were unable to help in the assault against the Song, due to Hulagu's war with the Golden Horde.Kublai continued the assault against the Song, gaining a temporary foothold on the southern banks of the Yangtze. Kublai made preparations to take Ezhou, but a pending civil war with his brother Ariq Böke—a rival claimant to the Mongol Khaganate—forced Kublai to move back north with the bulk of his forces. In Kublai's absence, the Song forces were ordered by Chancellor Jia Sidao to make an immediate assault and succeeded in pushing the Mongol forces back to the northern banks of the Yangtze. There were minor border skirmishes until 1265, when Kublai won a significant battle in Sichuan.From 1268 to 1273, Kublai blockaded the Yangtze River with his navy and besieged Xiangyang, the last obstacle in his way to invading the rich Yangtze River basin. Kublai officially declared the creation of the Yuan dynasty in 1271. In 1275, a Song force of 130,000 troops under Chancellor Jia Sidao was defeated by Kublai's newly appointed commander-in-chief, general Bayan. By 1276, most of the Song territory had been captured by Yuan forces, including the capital Lin'an.In the Battle of Yamen on the Pearl River Delta in 1279, the Yuan army, led by the general Zhang Hongfan, finally crushed the Song resistance.

One accessory that is often overlooked is headwear. The right kind of headwear not only sets the tone for your outfit but can also become a statement piece that draws attention to your face and accentuates your features. From thick headbands to wigs, there's a variety of options that you can choose to complete your look. In this article, we will explore some of the most popular types of headwear and provide styling tips to incorporate them into your wardrobe. Step 1: Wear a Thick Headband Thick headbands have recently made a massive comeback, thanks to their versatility in both casual and formal settings. They can be worn to keep your hair out of your face during workouts or to add a touch of elegance to your evening attire. To wear a thick headband successfully: 1. Choose the right color – A headband in a complementary color can enhance your outfit. Select a color that either matches or contrasts your hair and clothing. 2. Position correctly – Place the headband about an inch back from your hairline to avoid creating a bulge at the front. 3. Adjust for comfort – Ensure the headband sits snugly on your head without causing discomfort or slipping. Step 2: Put on a Silk Scarf Silk scarves have been a timeless accessory in fashion for decades. Apart from draping them around your neck, you can also wear them as headwear for a chic and elegant look. To style a silk scarf on your head: 1. Fold the scarf diagonally to create a triangle shape. 2. Place the center of the folded edge over your forehead. 3. Tie the two ends at the nape of your neck or on the side, depending on your preference. Step 3: Throw on a Hat Hats are a classic accessory that can add a touch of sophistication or playfulness to your outfit. With various styles available, such as fedoras, beanies, and sun hats, there's a hat for every occasion. To choose and style the perfect hat: 1. Analyze your face shape – Different hat styles suit different face shapes. For example, wide-brimmed hats complement round faces, while cloche hats flatter longer faces. 2. Choose an appropriate hat for the occasion – Formal events call for structured fedoras or pillbox hats, while casual outings welcome the laid-back vibe of beanies or sun hats. 3. Adjust your hair – Depending on the hat, you may want to wear your hair up or down or even slightly off-center to balance the overall look. Step 4: Wear a Wig Wigs are versatile accessories that can change your hairstyle without committing to a permanent look. They can be a way to experiment with new styles or just to have some fun with different hair colors and textures. To wear a wig successfully: 1. Choose a wig that complements your face shape and skin tone – Some wigs will look more natural on you than others, so choose accordingly. 2. Prepare your natural hair by pinning it back or using a wig cap to create a smooth foundation. 3. Secure the wig properly – Adjust the straps and use pins if necessary to keep the wig in place. 4. Style the wig – Use wig-friendly products to style the wig and make it look as natural as possible. Conclusion Adding headwear to your outfit is an easy way to enhance your overall look and make a stylish statement. From thick headbands to stunning wigs, each type of headwear has its unique charm. Mix and match these accessories to create various looks that suit your style and make you stand out in a crowd."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 12:29 EST, 10 September 2012 | UPDATED: 01:44 EST, 11 September 2012 A chef was killed by a single punch in a takeaway when he intervened in a trivial dispute over cheesy chips, a court heard today. Ricky Guest-Binns, 44, suffered a fatal bleed to the brain after he was felled by a blow to the side of his head from roofer Allan Glenny, 24, at the shop in Blackpool. Glenny had complained to staff they had not melted cheese properly on a portion of chips he had ordered for his girlfriend and then exchanged words with several customers. His victim is thought to have been ushering him out of the premises in the early hours of May 5 when OPTIONS: - Allan Glenny turned around and swung a punch at him. - Blackpool turned around and swung a punch at him. - Daily Mail turned around and swung a punch at him. - Glenny turned around and swung a punch at him. - Ricky Guest-Binns turned around and swung a punch at him.","completion":"- Allan Glenny turned around and swung a punch at him. The correct answer is Allan Glenny turned around and swung a punch at him. In the passage, Allan Glenny is described as the person causing the dispute over cheesy chips and exchanging words with customers. It's reasonable to infer that he would be the one to punch Ricky Guest-Binns, who was trying to usher him out of the premises. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons: - Blackpool is the location of the shop and not a person who could swing a punch. - Daily Mail is a news publication and not involved in the actual event. - Glenny is a repeat of the correct answer Allan Glenny. However, it is valid to refer Allen Glenny as Glenny in the context. So, \\"Glenny turned around the swung a punch at him\\" is also a correct option. - Ricky Guest-Binns is the victim in this situation and not the one swinging a punch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Democratic Party candidates were consistently elected to local office, increasing the city's ties to the South and its dominant party. In 1861, Mayor Fernando Wood called on the aldermen to declare independence from Albany and the United States after the South seceded, but his proposal was not acted on. Anger at new military conscription laws during the American Civil War (1861–1865), which spared wealthier men who could afford to pay a 300 (equivalent to 5,766 in 2016) commutation fee to hire a substitute, led to the Draft Riots of 1863, whose most visible participants were ethnic Irish working class. The situation deteriorated into attacks on New York's elite, followed by attacks on black New Yorkers and their property after fierce competition for a decade between Irish immigrants and blacks for work. Rioters burned the Colored Orphan Asylum to the ground, but more than 200 children escaped harm due to efforts of the New York City Police Department, which was mainly made up of Irish immigrants. According to historian James M. McPherson (2001), at least 120 people were killed. In all, eleven black men were lynched over five days, and the riots forced hundreds of blacks to flee the city for Williamsburg, Brooklyn, as well as New Jersey; the black population in Manhattan fell below 10,000 by 1865, which it had last been in 1820. The white working class had established dominance. Violence by longshoremen against black men was especially fierce in the docks area. It was one of the worst incidents of civil unrest in American history.

No; A:","completion":"a. Yes \\"Angry\\" can be considered a valid answer for how Kai might feel in this situation. When someone gets lost or separated from others, various emotions can emerge, and anger is one such emotion. Kai's anger could stem from different reasons or circumstances, such as: 1. Feeling abandoned - Kai could feel left out because Sydney didn't bother to look for her. This could lead to a sense of betrayal, especially if they were close friends or family members. 2. Helplessness or frustration - Being in an unfamiliar or uncomfortable situation and not knowing how to find one's way back can be disconcerting. Kai might feel frustrated with herself for getting lost in the first place, and this frustration could turn into anger towards Sydney. 3. Miscommunication or misunderstanding - Kai might have expected Sydney to notice her absence quickly, but Sydney either didn't notice or wasn't as concerned about Kai's whereabouts. This could create feelings of anger stemming from a possible breach of trust or lack of consideration for each other's well-being.

Process: - Networks of trees start forming - The trees die off - The dead material provides nutrients for more trees - The rising trees provide shelter - And more organisms begin to thrive - The ecosystem known as a forest is made. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less human activity happens, how will it affect less forest formation. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation of less human activity can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of forest formation. This can result in the formation of more diverse and resilient forest ecosystems. However, the specific impacts of reduced human activity on forest ecosystems are highly dependent on the type and extent of the activities in question. Direct Effects: 1. Reduction in deforestation: Reduced human activity can potentially lead to a decrease in deforestation, as there would be less demand for land for agricultural purposes, infrastructural development, or resource extraction. This reduction in deforestation allows more space for the natural process of forest formation to occur, giving rise to new forest ecosystems. 2. Less disruption to ecological succession: Ecological succession is the process by which ecosystems change and develop over time, eventually reaching a more stable and mature state. Human activities can disrupt this process, such as through logging, grazing, or pollution. With less human activity, the process of ecological succession can proceed unhindered, allowing forests to form and mature more efficiently. 3. Reduced pollution and habitat fragmentation: Less human activity can lead to a decrease in pollution and habitat fragmentation caused by industrial activities, transportation networks, and urbanization. These factors can harm the health of forests and hinder the natural processes that drive forest formation. By reducing these stressors, the potential for forest formation and development may increase. Indirect Effects: 1. Climate change mitigation: Reduced human activity could potentially contribute to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through the reduction of fossil fuel dependency, deforestation, and agricultural practices. This could help mitigate the effects of climate change on forest ecosystems, ensuring more stable conditions for the formation and maintenance of forests in the long term. 2. Biodiversity restoration: Biodiversity plays a crucial role in the formation and maintenance of healthy forest ecosystems. Human activities such as deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and the introduction of invasive species can negatively impact biodiversity. With less human activity, there could be more opportunities for native species to thrive, which can promote the establishment of resilient forest ecosystems. 3. Enhanced ecosystem services: Forests provide essential ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, water filtration, habitat provision, and recreation opportunities. Reducing human activity can have positive effects on these services by allowing more space for forest ecosystems to form and function without disturbance. This, in turn, can benefit the overall health of the environment, as well as the well-being and the socio-economic condition of human societies that depend on these services. It is essential to note that less human activity can also have negative consequences for forest formation, such as in cases where active forest management is necessary to prevent the spread of pests or diseases. The key is finding a balance between human intervention and allowing natural processes to take place to promote the formation of healthy, diverse, and resilient forest ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose sermons were described as \\"not so much opposed, as simply not understood\\"? ? During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city, commerce and industry flourished, and the suburbs expanded. As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city, the congregation of St James' Church shrank. The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers, rather than dwellers, to serve the poor of the city, and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual, topical preaching that distinguished St James' from many of the newly created parish churches. The young Henry Latimer Jackson, from Cambridge, was appointed in 1885. He introduced weekday services and a magazine called The Kalendar, one of Australia's first parish papers. He also lectured at Sydney University, addressed conferences, spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established Sydney Church of England Boys' Grammar School. However, his sermons were described as \\"not so much opposed, as simply not understood\\". He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the Diocese of Ely. Although Sydney was prospering, St James' had an acute shortage of money and \\"the government considered resuming the site for a city railway\\". The trustees at this time leased the parsonage and, in 1894, used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building. The architect Varney Parkes replaced the old spire, using copper that was pre-weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance. He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry. The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect.Jackson's successor was William Carr Smith, a man with socialist ideals and a commitment to social reform and spiritual outreach. He preached long and engaging sermons inside the church and for a time in the open air in The Domain as well.

At sea, Cassidy opens his sealed orders, which direct him to proceed first to the Aleutian Islands to pick up meteorologist Lt. Raymond, then to Tokyo Bay to obtain vital weather intelligence for the upcoming Doolittle Raid. On the way, two Japanese planes attack; both are shot down, but one pilot manages to parachute into the water. When Mike goes to pick him up, he is stabbed to death. New recruit Tommy Adams shoots the pilot, but because he was slow to react, Tommy blames himself for Mike's death and volunteers to defuse an unexploded bomb stuck under the deck. When Mike is buried at sea, Greek-American \\"Tin Can\\" (Dane Clark) does not attend the service, which angers the other men until he explains that every Allied death causes him great pain. Meanwhile, Raymond, who lived in Japan, discusses how the Japanese people were led into the war by the military faction. As the submarine nears Tokyo Bay, the Copperfin has to negotiate its way through protective minefields and anti-torpedo nets. When a Japanese ship enters the bay, Cassidy follows in its wake.

I read this background article the other day: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. I am facing a new situation today: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Mures river would have a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen. This is because, as per the information from the background article, slower moving water in pools generally has lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen when compared to faster moving, turbulent water. Since the Mures river is characterized by slow moving and deep water, it would likely have lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen than the Olt river, which is a fast moving river. The lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen in the Mures river might result in lower biodiversity when compared to the Olt river, as higher concentrations of dissolved oxygen typically support greater biodiversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"Hoda Kotb on overcoming adversity\\"","completion":"Title: Hoda Kotb on Overcoming Hard Times Once upon a time, there was a very strong and inspiring lady named Hoda Kotb. Hoda is famous for talking to people and sharing stories on television. Sometimes, bad things can happen in life, but Hoda has shown us how to face them and come out even stronger. Hoda had to face many tough situations in her life. One of these challenges was when she became really sick. The sickness she had was called breast cancer. While many people might become very sad and scared when they are sick, Hoda did something amazing - she decided to be brave and share her journey with other people. This way, she could help others understand what it's like to fight against this sickness, and give them hope that they can also get better. Another challenge Hoda had to face was when she wanted to become a mommy. Sometimes, mommies have babies grow in their tummies, but Hoda couldn't do that. So, she decided to adopt, which means she chose to love and take care of a baby who didn't have a family. Hoda adopted a beautiful baby girl named Haley Joy. Then, she adopted another lovely baby girl named Hope Catherine. This showed how big Hoda's heart is and how love can make a family, even if it doesn't happen the usual way. Hoda also had to work hard to become great at her job. Sometimes, people didn't believe she could be a fantastic television host because she is a woman, or because of how she looks. But Hoda never gave up. She kept learning and trying, and she showed the world that she can be just as good as anyone else. Today, lots of people watch Hoda on TV and love her because she is kind, smart, and funny. So, what can we learn from Hoda Kotb's story? We can learn that when life gives us difficult times, we shouldn't give up. We should be brave and keep going. Hoda teaches us that we can find new ways to make our dreams come true, and create happiness for ourselves and the people we love. Hoda also helps us understand that we all have the power to help others. By sharing our stories and showing kindness, we can help people who may also be going through tough times. Just like Hoda, we can be strong and loving in our own ways, and make the world a better place for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"A mill engine from Stott Park Bobbin Mill , Cumbria, England\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"A steam engine is a heat engine that operates by using steam to perform mechanical work. It primarily functions through the conversion of thermal energy (heat) into mechanical energy (work). Here is a step-by-step breakdown of how a steam engine works: Step 1: Water is heated in a boiler. In a steam engine, water is poured into a boiler, which is a closed chamber. The water is heated using a fuel source (like wood, coal, or oil) until it turns into steam. Step 2: High-pressure steam is produced. As the water in the boiler turns into steam, the pressure inside the boiler increases due to the steam occupying a larger volume than the water it replaced. The boiler is designed to handle this high pressure. Step 3: Steam is channeled to the steam cylinder. The high-pressure steam is then directed to the steam cylinder via a series of valves. Step 4: Steam pushes the piston. Inside the steam cylinder is a movable piston. The high-pressure steam enters the cylinder, pushing the piston to one side, and this movement is what generates mechanical work. Step 5: Reciprocating motion is converted to rotary motion. The piston's linear movement (reciprocating motion) is connected to a crankshaft through a connecting rod. This connection transforms the linear movement into rotary motion, which can then be used to power various types of machinery. Step 6: Steam is condensed and recycled or released. After pushing the piston, the steam is either allowed to release into the atmosphere through a valve or directed to a condenser. In a condenser, the steam is cooled and turns back into water to be reused in the boiler. Regarding your suggested answer, \\"A mill engine from Stott Park Bobbin Mill, Cumbria, England,\\" it is not a comprehensive explanation of how a steam engine works. It is simply the name and location of a specific mill engine, which is a type of steam engine used to produce rotary motion directly to power factory machinery. To fully answer your question, you would need to explain the steps listed above that outline the workings of a steam engine in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Vince: (nonchalantly) Oh, I went to the yacht club with a friend of mine. We had a few drinks and just hung out for a while. Sorry I wasn't here when you needed me. Pearl: Well, I guess that explains it. But you should've let me know about your plans, especially since we agreed to work on the yacht together. Vince: True, I apologize for that.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - An extremophile (from Latin ' meaning \\"extreme\\" and Greek ' meaning \\"love\\") is an organism that thrives in physically or geochemically extreme conditions that are detrimental to most life on Earth. In contrast, organisms that live in more moderate environments may be termed mesophiles or neutrophiles. - Phototaxis is a kind of taxis, or locomotory movement, that occurs when a whole organism moves towards or away from stimulus of light. This is advantageous for phototrophic organisms as they can orient themselves most efficiently to receive light for photosynthesis. Phototaxis is called positive if the movement is in the direction of increasing light intensity and negative if the direction is opposite. - In cell biology, an organelle is a specialized subunit within a cell that has a specific function. Individual organelles are usually separately enclosed within their own lipid bilayers. - A taxis (plural taxes , from the Ancient Greek , meaning \\"arrangement\\") is the movement of an organism in response to a stimulus such as light or the presence of food. Taxes are innate behavioral responses. A taxis differs from a tropism (turning response, often growth towards or away from a stimulus) in that the organism has motility and demonstrates guided movement towards or away from the stimulus source. It is sometimes distinguished from a kinesis, a non-directional change in activity in response to a stimulus. - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz). - Saltern is a word with a number of differing (but interrelated) meanings. In English archaeology, a saltern is an area used for salt making, especially in the East Anglian fenlands. - Peripheral membrane proteins are membrane proteins that adhere only temporarily to the biological membrane with which they are associated. These proteins attach to integral membrane proteins, or penetrate the peripheral regions of the lipid bilayer. The regulatory protein subunits of many ion channels and transmembrane receptors, for example, may be defined as peripheral membrane proteins. In contrast to integral membrane proteins, peripheral membrane proteins tend to collect in the water-soluble component, or fraction, of all the proteins extracted during a protein purification procedure. Proteins with GPI anchors are an exception to this rule and can have purification properties similar to those of integral membrane proteins. - Globular proteins or spheroproteins are spherical (\\"globe-like\\") proteins and are one of the common protein types (the others being fibrous, disordered and membrane proteins). Globular proteins are somewhat water-soluble (forming colloids in water), unlike the fibrous or membrane proteins. There are multiple fold classes of globular proteins, since there are many different architectures that can fold into a roughly spherical shape. - Phototrophs (\\"Gr\\": , = light, = nourishment) are the organisms that carry out photon capture to acquire energy. They use the energy from light to carry out various cellular metabolic processes. It is a common misconception that phototrophs are obligatorily photosynthetic. Many, but not all, phototrophs often photosynthesize: they anabolically convert carbon dioxide into organic material to be utilized structurally, functionally, or as a source for later catabolic processes (e.g. in the form of starches, sugars and fats). All phototrophs either use electron transport chains or direct proton pumping to establish an electro-chemical gradient which is utilized by ATP synthase, to provide the molecular energy currency for the cell. Phototrophs can be either autotrophs or heterotrophs. - Sensory rhodopsin II ( SRII ) , also known as pharaonis phoborhodopsin ( ppR ) , is a membrane protein of archaea , responsible for generation of phototaxis signal . Sensory rhodopsin II is found in Halobacterium salinarum and Natronomonas pharaonis - Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation). This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide and water hence the name \\"photosynthesis\\", from the Greek , \\"phs\\", \\"light\\", and , \\"synthesis\\", \\"putting together\\". In most cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary for life on Earth. - The Archaea (or or ) constitute a domain and kingdom of single-celled microorganisms. These microbes (archaea; singular archaeon) are prokaryotes, meaning that they have no cell nucleus or any other membrane-bound organelles in their cells. - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity. - An integral membrane protein (IMP) is a type of membrane protein that is permanently attached to the biological membrane. All transmembrane proteins are IMPs, but not all IMPs are transmembrane proteins. IMPs comprise a significant fraction of the proteins encoded in an organism's genome. Proteins that cross the membrane are surrounded by \\"annular\\" lipids (see annular lipid shell), which are defined as lipids that are in direct contact with a membrane protein. Such proteins can be separated from the biological membranes only using detergents, nonpolar solvents, or sometimes denaturing agents. - In modern molecular biology and genetics, a genome is the genetic material of an organism. It consists of DNA (or RNA in RNA viruses). The genome includes both the genes, (the coding regions), the noncoding DNA and the genomes of the mitochondria and chloroplasts. - A biological membrane or biomembrane is an enclosing or separating membrane that acts as a selectively permeable barrier within living things. Biological membranes, in the form of cell membranes, often consist of a phospholipid bilayer with embedded, integral and peripheral proteins used in communication and transportation of chemicals and ions. Bulk lipid in membrane provides a fluid matrix for proteins to rotate and laterally diffuse for physiological functioning. Proteins are adapted to high membrane fluidity environment of lipid bilayer with the presence of an annular lipid shell, consisting of lipid molecules bound tightly to surface of integral membrane proteins. The cellular membranes should not be confused with isolating tissues formed by layers of cells, such as mucous membranes and basement membranes. - Salt pork is salt-cured pork. It is prepared from one of three primal cuts: pork side, pork belly, or fatback. Depending on the cut, respectively, salt pork may be lean, streaky or entirely fatty. Made from the same cuts as bacon, salt pork resembles uncut slab bacon, but is considerably saltier and not bacon-cured or smoked. It is thus virtually identical to the Ukrainian food \\"salo\\", which also displays similar variation in meat-to-fat ratio. Long used as a shipboard ration, salt pork now finds use in traditional American cuisine, particularly Boston baked beans, pork and beans, and to add its flavor to vegetables cooked in water, or with greens as in soul food. It is also central to the flavoring of clam chowder. It generally is cut and cooked (blanched or rendered) before use. - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life. - The lipid bilayer (or phospholipid bilayer) is a thin polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, even though they are only a few nanometers in width, they are impermeable to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly impermeable to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps. - In cell biology, the nucleus (pl. \\"nuclei\\"; from Latin or , meaning \\"kernel\\" or \\"seed\\") is a membrane-enclosed organelle found in eukaryotic cells. Eukaryotes usually have a single nucleus, but a few cell types, such as mammalian red blood cells, have no nuclei, and a few others have many. - Membrane proteins are proteins that interact with, or are part of, biological membranes. They include integral membrane proteins that are permanently anchored or part of the membrane and peripheral membrane proteins that are only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins. The integral membrane proteins are classified as transmembrane proteins that span across the membrane and integral monotopic proteins that are attached to only one side of the membrane. Membrane proteins are a common type of proteins along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 2030% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins. - Halobacterium salinarum is an extremely halophilic marine Gram-negative obligate aerobic archaeon. Despite its name, this microorganism is not a bacterium, but rather a member of the domain Archaea. It is found in salted fish, hides, hypersaline lakes, and salterns. As these salterns reach the minimum salinity limits for extreme halophiles, their waters become purple or reddish color due to the high densities of halophilic Archaea. \\"H. salinarum\\" has also been found in high-salt food such as salt pork, marine fish, and sausages. The ability of \\"H. salinarum\\" to survive at such high salt concentrations has led to its classification as an extremophile.

Texting is not dating, says Harvey, just easier way for men to tell more lies. Men use terms like \\"gold digger\\" and \\"nagging\\" as weapons against women.","completion":"Title: Steve Harvey's Stand on Dating Standards: Are Women Setting the Bar Too Low? Introduction: Comedian Steve Harvey is not only a hilarious personality but also has a deep insight into the dynamics of modern relationships. He has touched upon the challenges women face in dating and believes they are setting the bar too low for themselves. In this article, we will explore Harvey's perspective on dating, the importance of waiting 90 days before engaging in sexual activities, and the deceptive nature of texting in relationships. 1. Women Set the Bar Too Low When Dating According to Steve Harvey, women set the bar too low when dating. This implies that women accept less than they deserve from potential partners. Harvey believes this tendency to prioritize partners willingly can lead to disappointment in relationships, with women settling for partners who don't live up to their potential or treat them with the respect and love they deserve. 2. The 90-Day Rule: Workers Wait 90 Days for Benefits; Women Should Date 90 Days Before Sex Steve Harvey famously promotes the idea that women should wait 90 days before deciding to engage in sexual activities with a potential partner. He compares this period to the probationary period employees go through before receiving benefits at work. By waiting for this period, Harvey argues that women can better gauge a man's commitment and sincerity while establishing an emotional connection first. This helps build the foundation needed for a healthy and long-lasting relationship. 3. Texting is Not Dating: The Deceptive Nature of Modern Communication Another concern Harvey has is the prevalence of texting in modern dating. He emphasizes that texting should not be considered dating as it is an easy way for men to communicate and potentially tell more lies. Without face-to-face interaction, it is difficult for women to verify the truthfulness behind a man's word. Harvey advises women to prioritize actual conversations and meetings instead of relying heavily on texts to build a meaningful connection. 4. Men's Demeaning Terms: 'Gold Digger' and 'Nagging' as Weapons Against Women Steve Harvey also raises the issue of men using derogatory terms like 'gold digger' and 'nagging' as a means to belittle women and their expectations in a relationship. These terms create a negative stereotype and become a tool for men to manipulate and control women, forcing them to lower their expectations. Rejecting these terms and insisting on respectful communication helps women counteract the harmful stereotypes and maintain their self-worth. Conclusion: Steve Harvey's insights on modern dating reflect the need for women to set higher standards and value themselves in relationships. By adopting the 90-day rule, prioritizing face-to-face conversations over texting, and disregarding demeaning terminology, women can establish healthier boundaries and develop meaningful relationships. Ultimately, self-worth, respect, and open communication serve as the cornerstones for long-lasting and satisfying partnerships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The paragraph mentions that Larry Ruvo serves on the American Gaming Association Board of Directors and is a member of the Gaming Hall of Fame. The American Gaming Association is a trade group that represents the casino industry. Being a member of the Gaming Hall of Fame likely means that he has made significant contributions to the casino or gaming industry. Given this information, it would be highly unlikely for Larry Ruvo to have never stepped foot in a casino and still achieve his status in the gaming industry.

Process: - Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - The water is boiled to a very high tempature - The salt becomes seperated from the water - The salt is removed - The water is able to be drank at this point. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less heat available happens, how will it affect higher temperature used. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Firstly, let's understand the process described: 1. Saltwater is contained in a factory or plant: In the initial stage of this process, raw or unprocessed saltwater is stored in a factory or plant. 2. The water is boiled to a very high temperature: In the second step, the stored saltwater is heated until it boils. This heating process is likely being used for distillation, where water is turned into steam, leaving the salt behind. 3. The salt becomes separated from the water: As the water boils and turns into steam, the salt doesn't vaporize, hence becomes separated from the water. 4. The salt is removed: The remaining salt is physically removed from the container where boiling took place. 5. The water is able to be drank at this point: The steam from the boiled water is condensed back into the liquid state, devoid of salt, making it safe to drink. Now, let's consider your proposed perturbation and its effect on the process. The perturbation hypothesis suggests: what if less heat is available? Heat availability directly affects step 2 of the process, where water is boiled to a high temperature. This heat is required not only to boil the water (separating it from the salt) but also to generate enough steam which can be captured and condensed back into drinkable water. If less heat is available, the water may not reach the boiling point necessary to start the distillation process, and even if it does, it might not generate enough steam to provide a sufficient amount of drinking water. This less heat scenario directly hinders the effectiveness of subsequent steps - the salt won't separate from the water adequately (step 3), there would be less or possibly no salt to remove (step 4), and a diminished amount or none of the clean, drinkable water would be produced (step 5). Therefore, the supposed perturbation of less heat indeed does have a significant direct effect on the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In the wake of the French Revolution, the Unlawful Societies Act 1799 banned any meetings of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation. The Grand Masters of both the Moderns and the Antients Grand Lodges called on Prime Minister William Pitt (who was not a Freemason) and explained to him that Freemasonry was a supporter of the law and lawfully constituted authority and was much involved in charitable work. As a result, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of the Act, provided that each private lodge's Secretary placed with the local \\"Clerk of the Peace\\" a list of the members of his lodge once a year. This continued until 1967 when the obligation of the provision was rescinded by Parliament. What put English Freemasonry at risk?","completion":"English Freemasonry was put at risk by the Unlawful Societies Act of 1799 that was passed by the Parliament. This legislation was enacted in the aftermath of the French Revolution and its primary purpose was to prohibit the assemblies of groups that required their members to take an oath or obligation. Given that freemasonry generally entails initiation processes that involve some type of sworn pledge or obligation made by its members, this Act posed a significant threat to the continuation of freemasonry in England subsequently putting it into a halt prior to exempted from the Act. The government likely introduced this Act as a response to the social and political turbulence that was spreading across Europe following the French Revolution. During this time, revolutionary movements often convened in secret, using oaths and other forms of pledges to maintain confidentiality and commitment among their members. It is probable that the English government perceived these factors as threats to the stability of the state, inspiring them to introduce the Unlawful Societies Act to counteract these dangers. However, Freemasonry was able to avoid the implications of this Act after the Grand Masters of both the Moderns and the Antients Grand Lodges lobbied Prime Minister William Pitt. In this meeting, they assured Pitt, who was not a Freemason himself, that freemasonry was fundamentally aligned with the principles of law and authority and was heavily engaged in charitable work. Following this intervention, Freemasonry was specifically exempted from the terms of the Act, but only on the provision that each private lodge's Secretary submitted a list of his lodge's members to the local \\"Clerk of the Peace\\" annually. This obligation remained until it was rescinded by Parliament in 1967, marking the end of this critical period of risk for English freemasonry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"That would mean letting go of a dream.\\"?","completion":"Yes, in a nuanced sense, the expression \\"That would be relinquishing a dream\\" does correspond to \\"That would mean letting go of a dream.\\" Both phrases convey a similar sentiment about ceasing to pursue something that somebody was deeply invested in or passionate about. However, each phrase carries slightly different connotations due to the use of \\"relinquishing\\" versus \\"letting go.\\" \\"Relinquishing,\\" is a formal term, often used in legal language, and implies making a conscious decision to surrender or give up rights, possessions, a position, or in this case, a dream. The use of \\"relinquish\\" can also suggest a sense of sacrifice. Maybe because the dream is impossible to achieve, or perhaps because other, more urgent needs or goals have emerged. However, the element of choice is essential. One usually relinquishes something as an act of will. On the other hand, \\"letting go\\" is a more emotionally charged phrase. To \\"let go\\" of a dream can encompass a range of experiences, from accepting that a goal is unattainable to making peace with changing circumstances or priorities to simply losing interest. \\"Letting go\\" implies a process, often emotional, and carries a sense of acceptance and releasing psychological or emotional attachment to the dream. So, while these phrases imply similar actions, they hint at slightly different perspectives on the act of giving up a dream. \\"Relinquishing\\" emphasizes the deliberately chosen act of giving up, while \\"letting go\\" stresses the emotional process and acceptance involved in moving on from a previous dream."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - You breathe in - Air goes through all the little branches in your lungs to fill up the air sacs, or alveoli - Oxygen goes through the walls of the alveoli and into the capillaries - The oxygen goes into the bloodstream - Oxygen is left and carbon dioxide is picked up - You breathe it out through your lungs - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose properly working lungs happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. In the context of properly functioning lungs, a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream would indicate that there is an increase in the efficiency of oxygen exchange taking place at the alveolar-capillary interface. This perturbation could be a result of several factors, both direct and indirect, which affect the overall process of respiration and oxygen uptake in the human body. Here, we will explore how this perturbation might influence the process and the factors contributing to it. 1. Direct effects on the alveolar-capillary interface: The primary site of oxygen exchange in the lungs is the alveolar-capillary membrane. This is where oxygen diffuses from the alveoli into the surrounding capillaries, while carbon dioxide exits the bloodstream and is exhaled. Any direct alteration in this interface can influence the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. One example of a direct effect might be an increase in the surface area of the alveoli, allowing for more efficient oxygen exchange. 2. Indirect effects on lung function: There are many factors that can indirectly impact the efficiency of oxygen exchange in our respiratory system. Some of these factors include: a. Breathing rate and depth: An increase in the breathing rate (the number of breaths per minute) or the depth of our breaths can increase the amount of oxygen available for exchange in the alveoli. This is because deeper breaths allow for a larger volume of air to enter the lung, thus increasing the amount of oxygen in the alveoli. b. Physical fitness and adaptation: In physically fit individuals or those who have undergone adaptation (such as high-altitude training), the lungs and cardiovascular system function more efficiently, allowing for better oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. This can happen through various physiological changes, such as increased lung capacity, a higher density of capillaries, and increased numbers of red blood cells available to carry oxygen. c. Environmental factors: External factors, such as high altitudes or low-oxygen environments, can also impact oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. In these situations, the body undergoes adaptive responses to compensate for the lower oxygen levels, such as increasing breathing rate and depth, producing more red blood cells, or increasing the number of capillaries in the lungs. d. Health and disease: Certain health conditions and diseases can also indirectly impact the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. For example, the presence of lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), can restrict airflow, making it more difficult for oxygen to reach the alveoli and the bloodstream. On the other hand, treating or managing such conditions can improve respiratory function and increase oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream in the context of properly functioning lungs. Both direct and indirect factors can influence the efficiency of oxygen exchange at the alveolar-capillary interface, resulting in a greater amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Understanding these factors and how they interact is essential for maintaining optimal respiratory health and overall well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Thank you for the a2a! I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

Research, staying informed on current events, and engaging with the works of other authors and activists would likely involve reading various materials. Additionally, being listed in Who's Who in America further establishes the significance of her contributions, which may give some indication that she values knowledge and intellectual pursuits. This could potentially encompass an appreciation for reading as well.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose The owl is hungry happens, how will it affect HELPING owls to hunt at night. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that introducing \\"The owl is hungry\\" as a new factor into the process will have some effect on the owls' ability to hunt at night. In the given process, the owl goes through several steps ranging from leaving its nest to ultimately catching a mouse in its talons. Now, let's analyze the effect of the perturbation on the process. If \\"The owl is hungry\\" is added to the process, it can potentially influence the owl's behavior and hunting abilities. A hungry owl is more motivated to find prey quickly and efficiently. This increased motivation might lead the owl to be more active and focused in its hunting strategy. The hunger could improve the owl's determination to locate hidden prey more effectively, using its keen eyesight and sensitive hearing to their full potential. As a result, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. While hunger does not directly enhance the owl's physical capabilities, such as eyesight or hearing, it does influence the owl's motivation and determination to use those abilities more effectively to find prey. In this case, a hungry owl would be more persistent and focused while hunting during the night, increasing its chances of successfully catching prey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A living person lays on their death bed, what awaits them soon? A. expiration B. massage C. interaction D. perspiration E. respiration The best answer is A:","completion":"A. Expiration When a living person is on their death bed, it is implied that they are approaching the end of their life. The term \\"death bed\\" is often used to describe the situation where an individual is nearing the end of their battle with a terminal illness or simply reaching the inevitable conclusion of their natural lifespan. In this context, \\"expiration\\" becomes the best and most accurate answer among the available options. A. Expiration refers to the termination of life, also known as death. As the human body's vital functions cease, the individual's pulse, respiration, and consciousness all come to an end. The cells in the body start to break down, leading to the process of decomposition post-mortem. B. Massage is the act of manipulating the muscles and soft tissues of the body to alleviate pain, discomfort, or stress. While it may provide temporary relief or relaxation, it doesn't address the imminent situation that the person on their death bed is facing. C. Interaction could mean social or physical engagement with another person, environment, or object. However, it is not an appropriate response to the question, as it doesn't directly relate to the concept of someone facing imminent death. D. Perspiration is the process by which the body produces sweat to cool itself. While a person on their death bed may experience perspiration due to fever or external factors, it is not a primary concern in the context of the individual's impending death. E. Respiration is the process through which the body exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide, maintaining the functioning of cells and organs. However, when a person is on their death bed, respiratory functions will gradually decline until they cease entirely, making this answer incorrect. In conclusion, the best answer for what awaits a living person on their death bed is A: expiration. This term signifies the end of life, during which all of the body's vital processes cease, and the individual ultimately passes away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence from a movie review: humor to cover up the yawning chasm where the plot should be Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"To determine if the movie was seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review, let's analyze the sentence step by step: 1. The sentence has the phrase \\"humor to cover up.\\" This suggests that the humor is being used to either distract or compensate for something lacking in the movie. 2. The thing that the humor is covering up is described as \\"the yawning chasm where the plot should be.\\" A yawning chasm generally refers to a significant or noticeable gap. In this case, it's referring to the absence or inadequacy of the plot. 3. The use of the word \\"should\\" implies that the plot is an essential aspect that is expected to be present in a movie. The fact that the humor is being used to cover up this crucial element points to a negative aspect of the movie.

Given the below context: During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

The title, \\"Lousy iron,\\" immediately sets the tone of dissatisfaction and implies that the iron did not meet the expectations of the reviewer. The review then goes on to describe specific issues with the iron, such as its lack of efficiency as a steamer. The reviewer points out that, like another customer, they experienced the same problem of the iron not functioning adequately as a steamer, but rather just spitting water on their clothes. This displays a pattern of poor product performance, further proving the negative outlook on the iron. Additionally, the reviewer highlights the time they spent attempting to iron their pants - 20 minutes, yet the item remained full of wrinkles. This shows that the iron not only has issues with its steaming function, but also cannot perform its primary function of ironing clothes effectively. The reviewer's claim that it is a waste of money solidifies their dissatisfaction with the product. The reviewer also states their intention to return the iron, which signifies a total lack of trust in the product's ability to perform its intended functions properly.

Produced by Tom Dowd, the album was released in July 1971 in the United States by Capricorn Records. As the title indicates, the recording took place at the New York City music venue Fillmore East, which was run by concert promoter Bill Graham. It was recorded over the course of three nights in March 1971 and features the band performing extended jam versions of songs such as \\"Whipping Post\\", \\" At Fillmore East was recorded over two nights -- March 12 and 13, 1971 -- for which the band was paid 1250 each show. The shows were typical performances for the band, and regarded as slightly above average by drummer Jai Johanny Johanson. Ads for the shows read: \\"Bill Graham Presents in New York -- Johnny Winter And, Elvin Bishop Group, Extra Added Attraction: Allman Brothers.\\" While Winter was billed as headliner, by the third night the Allman Brothers were closing the show. Tom Dowd produced At Fillmore East; he had previously worked on their second studio album, Idlewild South. He had recently returned from Africa from working on the film Soul to Soul, and stayed in New York several days to oversee the live recording. \\"It was a good truck, with a 16-track machine and a great, tough-as-nails staff who took care of business,\\" recalled Dowd. He gave the staff suggestions and noted the band had two lead guitarists and two drummers, \\"which was unusual, and it took some foresight to properly capture the dynamics.\\" Things went smoothly until the band unexpectedly brought out saxophonist Rudolph \\"Juicy\\" Carter, an unknown horn player, and longstanding \\"unofficial\\" band member Thom Doucette on harmonica. \\"I was just hoping we could isolate them, so we could wipe them and use the songs, but they started playing and the horns were leaking all over everything, rendering the songs unusable,\\" said Dowd. He rushed to Duane during the break to tell him to cut the horn players; while Duane loved the players, he put up no fight with Dowd. The final show was delayed because of a bomb scare, and did not end until 6 am. Each night following the shows, the musicians and Dowd would \\"grab some beers and sandwiches\\" and head to Manhattan's Atlantic Studios to go over the performances. Set lists for following shows were crafted by listening to the recordings and going over what they could keep and what they would need to capture once more. \\"We wanted to give ourselves plenty of times to do it because we didn't want to go back and overdub anything, because then it wouldn't have been a real live album,\\" said Gregg Allman, and in the end, the band only edited out Doucette's harmonica when it didn't fit. \\"That was our pinnacle,\\" said Dickey Betts later. \\"The Fillmore days are definitely the most cherished memories that I have. If you asked everybody in the band, they would probably say that.\\" On June 27, the Fillmore East closed, and the band were invited to play a final, invitation-only concert, along with Edgar Winter, the Beach Boys and Country Joe McDonald. The Beach Boys initially refused to perform unless they headlined the event, but Graham refused, telling them that the Allman Brothers would be closing the show, and they were free to leave if they disagreed.

Article: To live forever was the dream of many emperors in ancient China.People were ordered to call them Wansui,which means 10,000 years,but no human could live that long.How long can humans really live? According to the latest scientific discovery,humans are able to live up to the age of 120 or perhaps even longer. Several recent studies showed that our life span can be extended far beyond normal limits.Cynthia Kenyon,a professor at the University of California in San Francisco doubled the life of a worm from two weeks to a month.By changing the function of a single gene,known as daf-2,the scientist not only added extra days to the worm's life but also kept it a healthy as worms which were half its age. There are two similar genes in the bodies of mammals.By changing the function of on gene,scientists extended the life of a mouse by 1 8 per cent(or 4.5 months).Another gene is called IGF-1.Researchers still don't know how it affects our body.But by reducing its functions the life of a mouse increases by 33 per cent for 8.6 months).The average life span of a mouse is 26 months. In the experiment of extending life,an ancient saying,\\"you are what you eat.\\" also seems to be true.Vegetables contain fewer calories than meat,and help to prolong life,scientists say. Research has found that taking in fewer calories affects our lives in a similar way to reducing IGF-1. US biologist John Phelan suggests low calorie diets could increase human life span,but there is no proof yet. Researchers are still waiting for the results of a study started in 1987.Monkeys are fed with low calorie food to see what happens.A monkey's typical life span is 40 years,so there is a little while to wait. In China,average,life expectancy has now reached 70,double that of 1949.

Before you launch your first video, you should have the basic building blocks of your channel established. This includes having a good profile image, unique banner art, and a basic description. All of this put together is the starting point for your personal brand, which is how viewers will relate to and remember you. Look at all of your favorite channels and see how they brand themselves. You'll find that virtually every popular channel has a custom look that helps identify themselves. Your profile image will appear next to the name of your channel in searches and comments on YouTube. It will be the first thing viewers see when your content appears in their search results, so make sure that it is representative of you and your brand. Your profile image can be a picture of you if you are the focus, or your logo if you are not the focus. This is the image that appears at the top of your Channel, and acts as the title. Channel Art is what makes viewers feel like they're on your \\"personal\\" YouTube, and helps cement your name in their mind. If you are creating your own art, YouTube recommends that the image be 2560 X 1440 px. This is the size of the image that will appear on the TV. All text and logos should appear in the center of the image in a 1546 X 43 px rectangle. Channel art can be commissioned from a variety of sources including oDesk and Elance. If you can, create a basic banner to get by for a while, and then use your first ad earnings to invest in commissioned art. Use this space to give a brief overview of your channel and to link viewers to your other webpages and social networking sites. The description of your channel appears in searches, but doesn't have to be incredibly in-depth. Make sure to link to your company website, blog, Facebook page, Twitter account, and any other place on the web where you have a presence.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Arthur Irwin was born in 1858 in Toronto, Ontario, to an Irish blacksmith and a Canadian mother. As a child, he moved with his family to Boston and attended school there. He played local amateur baseball from 1873 until he was recruited by the Worcester Ruby Legs of the National Association in 1879. In late 1879, manager Frank Bancroft took Irwin and most of the other Worcester players on a baseball tour which included visits to New Orleans and Cuba. Irwin's major league career began when the Ruby Legs moved into the National League (NL) in 1880. He led the league in assists in his rookie season, and remained with the team through 1882, when it folded due to poor attendance. Irwin next spent three seasons with the Providence Grays, and was captain and starting shortstop of the 1884 Providence team that became world champions. The 1884 Grays featured star pitchers Charles Radbourn and Charlie Sweeney; the two hurlers did not get along well, and Sweeney left the team in the middle of the season. The club folded after a fourth-place finish in 1885. Irwin moved on to the newly formed Philadelphia Quakers in 1886. Tragedy struck the Philadelphia squad in 1888 when pitcher Charlie Ferguson developed typhoid fever, dying at Irwin's home. During the 1889 season, Irwin went to the Washington Nationals for his first opportunity as player-manager, although the team folded at the end of the season. He next played for the Boston Reds in the Players' League in 1890. That same year, Irwin coached the baseball team at Dartmouth College. While Irwin served as a player-manager for Boston in 1890, he was able to focus on the managerial role for the team in 1891. That year the team signed his brother, John Irwin, on May 21. Newspapers brought accusations of nepotism and criticized John's mediocre play. John Irwin was released by Boston on July 16, and his major league playing career was over by the next month. Although Irwin's regular playing career ended after the 1890 season, he appeared in six games while managing the Boston team after it moved to the American Association in 1891. He also played in one game while managing the 1894 Philadelphia Phillies. A left-handed hitter, Irwin finished his playing career with 1,015 games played and batted .241 in 4,190 plate appearances. He tallied 396 runs batted in and 552 runs scored. Stolen bases were not awarded until 1886, but Irwin tallied 93 stolen bases in his last 532 games. He recorded an .878 career fielding percentage, committing 647 errors in 5,317 fielding chances. Irwin played 947 games at shortstop and 56 games at third base. He also appeared at second base, pitcher and catcher.

Given the context: How would Casey feel afterwards? Possible answers: uninterested, bored, happy The answer is:","completion":"It's difficult to determine Casey's exact emotional state after the store visit, as individual experiences and reactions can vary widely. However, given the limited information provided, we can make an educated guess between the possible answers given: uninterested, bored, and happy. Casey initially felt bored, which prompted a visit to the store with Cameron's father. While we cannot be certain as to what transpired during the store visit and whether it specifically contributed to Casey's mood change, it seems reasonable to rule out 'bored' as the answer since Casey attempted to alleviate boredom by going to the store. The options of uninterested or happy remain. Considering that the store visit was a direct response to Casey's boredom, it is plausible that the new activity provided some level of interest or stimulation. So, it can be deduced that Casey might feel 'happy' after the trip because of the change in routine, company, and a likely increased level of interest or stimulation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria's youngest son, Leopold, was affected by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia B and two of her five daughters, Alice and Beatrice, were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons, Tsarevich Alexei of Russia, Alfonso, Prince of Asturias, and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria's descendants, but not in her ancestors, led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but a haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of a haemophiliac in connection with Victoria's mother, and as male carriers always suffer the disease, even if such a man had existed he would have been seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about a third of cases.

Options: - tropical forest - walmart - north america - feild - pet shops Answer:","completion":"A person looking to buy a snake would find the most suitable option to be pet shops. Pet shops specialize in selling a variety of domestic and exotic animals, including snakes. These establishments not only offer a diverse selection of snake species, but also provide necessary information and guidance regarding their care, housing, and feeding requirements. Pet shops generally obtain their snakes from reputable breeders, ensuring that these animals are healthy and without any legal or ethical concerns that may arise from obtaining them directly from the wild, such as from tropical forests. Moreover, pet shops' staff members usually have extensive knowledge of the available snake species, their temperaments, and specific care requirements. In contrast, the other options have significant drawbacks. Tropical forests, for instance, are unsuitable sources due to the risks associated with capturing snakes in the wild, such as endangering species and potential health issues for both the animal and the captor. Additionally, removing snakes from their natural habitat contributes to the degradation of ecosystems and decline of their populations. Walmart, on the other hand, does not carry live animals, particularly snakes, and is not considered a viable option to acquire these exotic pets. North America as a whole is too vague an option to pinpoint a specific location where one could purchase a snake. Likewise, a field is not a location where snakes are commonly sold; additionally, capturing wild snakes in this environment would raise the same issues as capturing them in tropical forests. Therefore, pet shops stand out as the most suitable option for purchasing a snake. A potential snake owner will find a wide variety of species at pet shops, as well as access to knowledgeable staff who can provide helpful information on the proper care and housing for their newfound exotic pet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

John could not hear the sound of the revolver when listening to the radio because the","completion":"radio was closer to him. In this particular situation, John was engrossed in listening to the radio, which was emitting various sounds at various intensities, thereby effectively masking the sound of the revolver. The radio had a more significant presence in his auditory space, creating a dominant source of noise that overpowered any subtle sounds in his surroundings. There are several factors that contributed to John's inability to perceive the sound of the revolver as he was listening to the radio. Let's explore these factors in depth to understand the dynamics of this auditory scenario. 1. Proximity of the radio: The radio was physically closer to John than the revolver, making its sounds louder and more prominent. The further a sound source is from the listener, the quieter and less noticeable it becomes. In contrast, the closer a sound source is, the louder and more attention-grabbing it becomes. In this case, the radio's proximity to John caused its sounds to overshadow the distant sounds of the revolver. 2. Sound intensity and frequency range of the radio: The radio was producing a broad spectrum of sound frequencies, including those that overlap with the frequency range of the revolver. Because the sound intensity of the radio was greater than that of the revolver, the radio's frequencies drowned out the relatively quieter sounds of the firearm. 3. Masking effect: The radio's continuous and dynamic audio content created a masking effect, making it challenging for John to discern other competing sounds in the environment. The human brain can only process and attend to a limited number of auditory streams at once. In this case, the radio presented a dominant and engaging audio stream, rendering John unable to hear less prominent sounds like the revolver. 4. Attention and concentration: John's focused concentration on the radio content also played a role in his inability to hear the revolver's sound. His attention was directed entirely towards the audio coming from the radio, preventing him from registering other sounds in his environment. This phenomenon is commonly referred to as inattentional deafness, whereby listeners can \\"tune out\\" external noises by redirecting their attention towards a specific auditory stimulus. 5. Reverberation and room acoustics: The acoustics of the room in which John was situated also influenced his perception of the revolver's sound. If the room was highly reverberant with reflective surfaces, the sound of the revolver might have become diffused and dispersed, making it difficult for John to localize and identify the sound source. In contrast, the radio's direct and closer positioning to John helped him clearly perceive its sounds. In conclusion, a combination of factors, including the radio's proximity, sound intensity and frequency range, masking effect, John's attention and concentration, and the room's acoustics, all contributed to his inability to hear the sound of the revolver while listening to the radio. Such auditory phenomena highlight the complexity of human perception and the intriguing ways in which our brains prioritize certain sounds over others."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. An authoritative style is high in acceptance and freedom, while still having clearly defined rules and expectations. This type of parenting is correlated with high academic achievement. An authoritative style involves being warm, caring, and flexible with the child. Focus on setting boundaries and rules, but be willing to negotiate or be flexible if necessary. Accept the teen for who he is, and let him know that you accept him. Encourage him to work toward his dreams, whatever they may be. Authoritative parents are involved. Teens experience involvement when their parents are available to help them with homework and other challenges, as well as when their parents spend quality time with the family. Avoid authoritarian parenting. Authoritarian parenting is associated with strict and inflexible rules and an, \\"I'm right and you're wrong\\" mentality. An example of authoritarian style parenting would be if the teen said, \\"My father tells me that he is right and I should just obey him and never question his authority.\\" Instead of being authoritarian, allow your teen to be involved in the boundary-setting process. Explain the reason for the rules that are made, and give the teen a chance to voice his opinion. Negotiate and compromise in order to come to a decision. For example, if you think your teen should have straight A's, while the teen believes this is too high an expectation, be willing to adjust this standard to meet the teens needs. Perhaps you could come to an agreement for him to get at least a B in each class. This type of communication is associated with conveying your message in a respectful and appropriate manner. Assertiveness comes from an, \\"I'm okay. You're okay\\" thought process. Use an appropriate tone that is calm and comforting. Say, “no” when necessary. Explain your reasoning for rules and why they are in place. Be honest and open about your thoughts and feelings (while also being respectful and tactful). Use I statements such as, \\"I feel angry when you stay out past curfew.\\" Avoid aggressive communication. Aggressive communication comes from an, \\"I'm okay, you're not okay,\\" mentality. Do not threaten or yell at your child, this models inappropriate behaviors for the teen and can make him feel fearful. Limit passive communication. Passivity in communication is not expressing your needs and feelings. Passiveness comes from a, \\"You're okay. I'm not okay\\" perspective. A passive parent might be afraid of his teenager and instead of communicating with him, he would avoid him. Teens need structure in order to feel safe and secure and to reduce the likelihood of engagement in risky behaviors. Set limits that are realistic and fair. Make house rules. Tell your teen what behaviors are acceptable and which ones are not. For example, give your adolescent a curfew, and explain the specific consequences of staying out past the curfew. Assign chores. Having chores can give the youth a sense of responsibility. Explain that everyone in the home needs to contribute. You can make a chore chart and provide rewards when your children complete their chores without being asked. Set specific consequences for undesirable behaviors. Be very specific about what your teenager is not allowed to do (i.e. stay out past curfew, cut school, use drugs, etc.), as well as what will happen if the youth breaks the rule (i.e. grounding, taking away car or other privileges). Make sure your teen knows that he has a choice of whether or not to follow the rules. Rewarding desired behaviors can result in an increase in those behaviors and a reduction in associated negative behaviors. One study showed that youth who were rewarded for wearing their seat belts increased their overall seat belt use. Reward good behavior. When your child does something positive such as getting a good grade on a test, offer a reward such as a new piece of clothing that he wants. Draw attention to positive qualities. High self-esteem in teenagers is a factor that helps guard against the development of negative feelings and behaviors. Tell your child that you are proud of him. Give specific examples of his accomplishments such as getting a good grade on a test or paper, being honest, or doing his chores. Allow the youth to earn freedom. A youth that believes he is in control is associated with lower levels of aggressive behavior. Summary:","completion":"An authoritative style is when a parent is kind, caring, and sets clear rules for their child, but is also willing to be flexible sometimes. They care about their child's feelings and dreams and spend quality time with them. These parents don't just tell kids what to do, they discuss and explain the rules and let the child have a say too. They talk in a nice and comforting way, and give rewards for good behavior. This style helps kids feel good about themselves and do well in school."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are presented with the quiz \\"Why do the flightless have feathers?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"feathers help birds fly and provide insulation\\" and \\"some birds are flightless birds\\". So, what's the best answer to the question?","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, one can determine that the purpose of feathers in flightless birds is not for flying but rather for other essential functions. The best answer to the question \\"Why do flightless birds have feathers?\\" would be that they serve various crucial roles for these birds, such as providing insulation, protection, and aiding them in other non-flying activities. Let us explore this in further detail. 1. Insulation: Feathers, in general, are excellent at trapping air. This characteristic serves a significant purpose for both flying and flightless birds. In the case of flightless birds, such as penguins and ostriches, they live in extreme environments where insulation is critical for their survival. Flightless birds' feathers trap air and provide insulation, helping to keep the birds warm in cold environments or cool in hot climates. 2. Protection: Feathers can act as a shield for the bird's skin against environmental elements, such as rain, wind, and sun. For instance, penguins' outer feathers are waterproof due to an oily coating, and beneath this layer, they have thick, insulating feathers. This combination ensures that their skin remains protected from the cold water and icy environments. Similarly, feathers in other flightless birds provide a layer of protection against harsh sunlight and other external threats. 3. Camouflage: In some cases, the flightless birds' feathers can be essential for blending into their natural surroundings, helping to avoid predation or, in some cases, to sneak up on prey. The distinctive color patterns on some flightless bird species, such as the kiwi, enable them to blend seamlessly into their environment and avoid predators. 4. Courtship and Mating: Feathers of flightless birds often play a role in attracting mates, as is the case with the peacock. These birds exhibit bright and colorful feathers, which serve as an essential tool for attracting potential mates, showing off their health and fitness. The extravagant plumage and displays seen in some flightless bird species are crucial to their reproductive success. 5. Assisting with Locomotion and Balance: Although flightless, some species of birds like the ostrich and kiwi use their wings and feathers for locomotion and balance. For example, ostriches spread their wings when they run, which helps maintain balance and steer through turns. Likewise, kiwis use their vestigial wings to help lift their plumage while moving through vegetation, thereby facilitating movement. To sum up, flightless birds have feathers because they serve various essential functions apart from flying. These functions include insulation, protection, camouflage, courtship and mating displays, and aiding in locomotion and balance. Understanding these factors gives us a more comprehensive insight into the importance of feathers in the survival and adaptation of flightless bird species in their specific environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question that has the following answer: medicine for the following movie plot: In 1944, American forces were closing in on the Japanese-occupied Philippines. The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan. Throughout the film, the viewpoint switches between the POWs at Cabanatuan, the Rangers, the Filipino resistance and the Japanese. In particular, the film covers the resistance work undertaken by nurse Margaret Utinsky, who smuggled medicine into the POW camps. The Kempeitai arrested her and sent her to Fort Santiago prison.

Single/multi-choice problem: Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: paint Options are: (A). can't be clean up by wash cloth easily. (B). can't be clean up by toilet tissue easily.","completion":"Option A and option B seem to be focusing on the clean-up aspect of the paint, in particular how easily the paint can be cleaned up by either a washcloth (option A) or toilet tissue (option B). However, in understanding which option could be better for the ultimate goal of painting, neither A nor B specifically indicates a solution beneficial for that goal. It would be more relevant to look at features of the paint itself such as its color, consistency, ease of application, drying time, coverage ability, and durability. However, this doesn't mean that ease of cleanup is not an important factor to consider. When painting, especially for non-professional painters or for large projects, some amount of spilling and smudging usually occurs, hence cleanup is a relevant aspect. From a practical standpoint, considering that both options involve cleaning with commonly found household items, one might argue there's limited difference between them. Toilet tissue might absorb the paint a bit, but it will easily break apart when wet and might not be sturdy enough. A washcloth, on the other hand, is likely more resilient and better at scrubbing away spills and paint blots, but it may be harder to fully get the paint out of it afterwards. That being said, if the goal is simply \\"paint\\", it seems neither option A nor B really addresses this goal directly. Paint quality and applicability should be the priority features. If the options were specifically about the ease, efficiency or cost of cleanup after painting, then perhaps there could be a clearer choice between the options. A good solution for the goal of painting should ideally include factors such as ease of application, good coverage, quick and even drying, and durability of the paint. Cleanup is usually addressed separately, with proper preparations such as drop cloths, masking tape and protective clothing to prevent as much spills and messes as possible. So in conclusion, without additional context or a more specific goal, it's hard to determine which solution is ‘better’. The best paint would really depend on the specific requirements and context, such as the type of surface being painted, the desired finish, the budget, and indeed, the cleanup facilities and materials available."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

Answer based on context: Pilgrims circumambulate the monastery on the lingkhor outside the walls. Fortunately, although two-thirds of the buildings were destroyed during the excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, they were mainly the residences for the 4,000 monks and the monastery itself was not as extensively damaged as most other religious structures in Tibet, for it was the seat of the Panchen Lama who remained in Chinese-controlled territory.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns. The official colors of Notre Dame are Navy Blue and Gold Rush which are worn in competition by its athletic teams. In addition, the color green is often worn because of the Fighting Irish nickname. The Notre Dame Leprechaun is the mascot of the athletic teams. Created by Theodore W.

Write an article based on this summary: European bond prices have dropped in a widespread sell off, sending investor returns higher, as markets brace for the return of inflation. Article:","completion":"Title: European Bond Prices Fall as Markets Prepare for Inflation Hello little buddies! Today, we're going to talk about something called European bond prices, why they have dropped recently, and what it has to do with inflation. But first, let's understand a few things. A bond is like a special promise. Imagine your friend wants to buy a toy, but he or she doesn't have enough money right now. You give your friend some money, and your friend promises to pay you back later with a little extra as a thank you. That's kind of like a bond. Now, let's talk about European bond prices. These are just like the bonds we just talked about, but they are from countries in Europe. These bond prices have recently dropped. That means, if you were to \\"buy\\" or help out these countries, it would cost you less than before. You might wonder why the bond prices dropped. Well, it's because many people are selling their bonds because they are worried about something called \\"inflation.\\" Inflation is when the prices of things we buy, like toys, ice cream, and clothes, go up over time. So, we need more money to buy the same things. Now back to our story about European bond prices. When lots of people sell their bonds, the prices go down. When the prices go down, the people that still have these bonds get a bit more in return. This is because the price of the bond is now lower, so the extra thank you (called \\"interest\\") is worth more. In conclusion, many people are selling their European bonds because they are afraid of inflation or things getting more expensive. These bond prices have fallen because of this. And for the people who are still holding onto these bonds, their returns or thank you gifts are now worth a little more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: Anime Speed is a megamix compilation album of \\"Dancemania\\"'s \\"Speed\\" series, released by EMI Music Japan in 2005. The album features uptempo cover remixes of popular theme songs for various anime works such as \\"Dragon Ball Z\\", \\"Slam Dunk\\" and \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion\\". The successor, \\"Anime Speed Newtype Edition\\", was released in 2006. Hypothesis: Mostly japanese people preferred the album","completion":"Although the given context does not provide explicit information on the target audience's nationality, we can make an informed hypothesis based on the nature of the album and the involved elements. The context states that \\"Anime Speed\\" is a megamix compilation album consisting of uptempo cover remixes of theme songs from various well-known anime works like \\"Dragon Ball Z,\\" \\"Slam Dunk,\\" and \\"Neon Genesis Evangelion.\\" It is worth noting that these anime series originated in Japan and have gained significant popularity among Japanese audiences. Based on this information, it can be hypothesized that a substantial portion of the album's fanbase consists of Japanese people, particularly those who are fans of the mentioned anime series. Moreover, the album was released by EMI Music Japan, which is a Japanese music label. This further strengthens the hypothesis, as domestic releases often cater to the preferences and tastes of a country's audience. Additionally, the successor album, \\"Anime Speed Newtype Edition,\\" was released in 2006, indicating that there was enough demand for a follow-up album, which may have included a significant portion of Japanese listeners. The country's affinity for anime culture and its origin in Japan bolster the assumption that the album might have been targeted to fans of these series. However, it is also important to consider that anime as a form of entertainment has become increasingly popular worldwide, especially in countries like the United States, Canada, and several European countries. This international reach has led to a growing global audience for anime-related products, including music, which means that \\"Anime Speed\\" and its successor might have also appealed to anime fans from different countries. In summary, while it can be hypothesized that \\"Anime Speed\\" might have been primarily intended for and preferred by Japanese people due to the content, the connection to popular anime series, and the release under a Japanese music label, it is also plausible to assume that the album found fans among international anime enthusiasts. Although the majority of preference might come from Japanese people, there could be an equally appealing global audience to take into account."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on manolita piña 's: - death place - birth name - death date - spouse - children - birth date - name - nationality - birth place Bio: manolita piña torres-garcia -lrb- \`\` née rubies \`\` 24 february 1883 -- 11 june 1994 -rrb- was a uruguayan painter and wife of joaquín torres garcía . she was well-known as \`\` doña manolita '' in uruguay .

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis is suggesting a situation where pressure builds up under the Earth's crust, but there is no crust in the area. We are asked to determine if this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the earthquake process. Step 2: Analyze the process We know that the process of an earthquake involves the movement of plates past each other, the exertion of force, the breaking of the crust, release of energy, energy waves, and the feeling of the quake. Step 3: Evaluate the effect of perturbation on each step Now, we need to evaluate if the perturbation hypothesis affects any of these steps in the earthquake process. 1. Plates moving past each other: The hypothesis mentions pressure building up under the crust, but it does not affect the plate movement directly. 2. Exertion of force: The pressure building up under the crust could exert a force on the surrounding areas that do have a crust. The force might not be the same as the one created by the plate movement, but it could still exist indirectly. 3. Breaking of the crust: If there is no crust in the area where the pressure is building up, the crust cannot break. However, the pressure could affect adjacent crust areas, potentially causing them to break from the increased force. 4. Release of energy: If the crust in the adjacent areas breaks due to the increased force from the built-up pressure, the energy will be released, but it may not be as high as when the plates move in the traditional process. 5. Energy waves: Energy waves may still pass through the Earth as the energy is released from the adjacent areas affected. 6. Feeling the earthquake: It is possible that the perturbation could cause a weaker earthquake felt in the surrounding areas, as it influences the crust breaking and energy release steps indirectly. Step 4: Conclusion Based on our evaluation, the perturbation hypothesis does not have a direct effect on the earthquake process because it does not directly affect plate movement or exert the same force. However, it has an indirect effect on the process since it may affect adjacent crust areas and lead to a weaker earthquake."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Scuba diving is a mode of underwater diving in which the scuba diver uses a self-contained underwater breathing apparatus (scuba) which is completely independent of surface supply, to breathe underwater. Scuba provides the diver with the advantages of mobility and horizontal range far beyond the reach of an umbilical hose attached to surface-supplied diving equipment (SSDE). Scuba divers engaged in armed forces covert operations may be referred to as frogmen, combat divers or attack swimmers. - Technical diving (also referred to as tec diving or tech diving) is scuba diving that exceeds the agency-specified limits of recreational diving for non-professional purposes. Technical diving may expose the diver to hazards beyond those normally associated with recreational diving, and to greater risk of serious injury or death. The risk may be reduced by appropriate skills, knowledge and experience, and by using suitable equipment and procedures. The skills may be developed through appropriate specialised training and experience. The equipment often involves breathing gases other than air or standard nitrox mixtures, and multiple gas sources. - Nitrox is used to a lesser extent in surface-supplied diving, as these advantages are reduced by the more complex logistical requirements for nitrox compared to the use of simple low-pressure compressors for breathing gas supply. Nitrox can also be used in hyperbaric treatment of decompression illness, usually at pressures where pure oxygen would be hazardous. Nitrox is not a safer gas than compressed air in all respects; although its use can reduce the risk of decompression sickness, it increases the risk of oxygen toxicity and fire. - Recreational diving or sport diving is a type of diving that uses SCUBA equipment for the purpose of leisure and enjoyment . In some diving circles , the term \`\` recreational diving '' is used in contradistinction to \`\` technical diving '' , a riskier and more demanding application of the sport which requires greater levels of training , experience and equipment . - A breathing gas is a mixture of gaseous chemical elements and compounds used for respiration. Air is the most common, and only natural, breathing gas - but a range of pure gases or mixtures of gases are used in breathing equipment and enclosed habitats such as scuba equipment, surface supplied diving equipment, recompression chambers, submarines, space suits, spacecraft, medical life support and first aid equipment, high-altitude mountaineering and anaesthetic machines.

Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier.

Information: - Hypothyroidism, also called underactive thyroid or low thyroid, is a common disorder of the endocrine system in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone. It can cause a number of symptoms, such as poor ability to tolerate cold, a feeling of tiredness, constipation, depression, and weight gain. Occasionally there may be swelling of the front part of the neck due to goitre. Untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy can lead to delays in growth and intellectual development in the baby, which is called cretinism. Worldwide, too little iodine in the diet is the most common cause of hypothyroidism. In countries with enough iodine in the diet, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is the autoimmune condition Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Less common causes include: previous treatment with radioactive iodine, injury to the hypothalamus or the anterior pituitary gland, certain medications, a lack of a functioning thyroid at birth, or previous thyroid surgery. The diagnosis of hypothyroidism, when suspected, can be confirmed with blood tests measuring thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and thyroxine levels. Prevention at the population level has been with the universal salt iodization. Hypothyroidism can be treated with levothyroxine. The dose is adjusted according to symptoms and normalization of the thyroxine and TSH levels. Thyroid medication is safe in pregnancy. While a certain amount of dietary iodine is important, excessive amounts can worsen certain types of hypothyroidism. Worldwide about one billion people are estimated to be iodine deficient; however, it is unknown how often this results in hypothyroidism. In the United States, hypothyroidism occurs in 0.30.4% of people. Subclinical hypothyroidism, a milder form of hypothyroidism characterized by normal thyroxine levels and an elevated TSH level, is thought to occur in 4.38.5% of people in the United States. Hypothyroidism is more common in women than men. People over the age of 60 are more commonly affected.

Some of the conditions included in newborn screening programs are only detectable after irreversible damage has been done, in some cases sudden death is the first manifestation of a disease. Screening programs are often run by state or national governing bodies with the goal of screening all infants born in the jurisdiction. The number of diseases screened for is set by each jurisdiction, and can vary greatly. Most newborn screening tests are done by measuring metabolites and enzyme activity in whole blood samples collected on specialized filter paper, however many areas are starting to screen infants for hearing loss using automated auditory brainstem response and congenital heart defects using pulse oximetry. Infants who screen positive undergo further testing to determine if they are truly affected with a disease or if the test result was a false positive. Follow-up testing is typically coordinated between geneticists and the infant's pediatrician or primary care physician. - Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) is a condition of thyroid hormone deficiency present at birth. Approximately 1 in 4000 newborn infants has a severe deficiency of thyroid function, while even more have mild or partial degrees. If untreated for several months after birth, severe congenital hypothyroidism can lead to growth failure and permanent intellectual disability. Treatment consists of a daily dose of thyroid hormone (thyroxine) by mouth. Because the treatment is simple, effective, and inexpensive, nearly all of the developed world practices newborn screening to detect and treat congenital hypothyroidism in the first weeks of life. - Intellectual disability (ID), also known as general learning disability, and mental retardation (MR), is a generalized neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by significantly impaired intellectual and adaptive functioning. It is defined by an IQ score under 70 in addition to deficits in two or more adaptive behaviors that affect everyday, general living. Once focused almost entirely on cognition, the definition now includes both a component relating to mental functioning and one relating to individuals' functional skills in their environments. As a result of this focus on the person's abilities in practice, a person with an unusually low IQ may not be considered to have intellectually disability. Intellectual disability is subdivided into syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits associated with other medical and behavioral signs and symptoms are present, and non-syndromic intellectual disability, in which intellectual deficits appear without other abnormalities. Down syndrome and fragile X syndrome are examples of syndromic intellectual disabilities. Intellectual disability affects about 23% of the general population. Seventy-five to ninety percent of the affected people have mild intellectual disability. Non-syndromic or idiopathic cases account for 3050% of cases. About a quarter of cases are caused by a genetic disorder, and about 5% of cases are inherited from a person's parents. Cases of unknown cause affect about 95 million people as of 2013. - Jean H.

Which country traditionally leads the opening parade of the Olympic Games????","completion":"Greece is the country that traditionally leads the opening parade of the Olympic Games. This is a longstanding tradition that holds significant historical and cultural value because of the games' ancient roots that trace back to ancient Greece. The Olympic Games were originally held in Olympia, Greece, around 776 BC as a religious and athletic festival. The modern Olympic Games, founded by Pierre de Coubertin, were inspired by these ancient games. The first modern Olympic Games took place in Athens, Greece, in 1896, as a way to revive the spirit and significance of the ancient competition and promote worldwide unity through sports. As the birthplace of the original Olympic Games and the host of the first modern Olympic Games, Greece holds a unique and cherished position in the Olympic movement. To honor their historical legacy, the Greek team is given the privilege of leading the parade of athletes during the opening ceremony. This is an opportunity to pay tribute to the origins of the Olympic Games and remind everyone involved of the event's deeper cultural and historical importance. During the opening ceremony, the Greek national team enters the Olympic stadium first, carrying their national flag and wearing their traditional uniforms. This visually underscores Greece's role in the ancient and modern history of the games. Following the Greek team, the parade of athletes continues in alphabetical order of the nations according to the host country's official language. The host nation's team always enters last, with a unique celebration of the host country's culture typically accompanying their arrival. In this way, the Olympic Games' opening parade serves as both a celebration of the unity and diversity of participating countries and a tribute to the ancient traditions that laid the foundation for this global sporting event. By maintaining the tradition of Greece leading the opening parade, the Olympic Games perpetuate an important connection to their historical roots, uniting athletes and spectators from around the world in appreciation of the event's storied past and its potential to inspire a brighter future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ramzi tested positive for CERA an advanced version of blood-booster EPO. Four other athletes who tested positive for CERA also sanctioned. Moroccan-born Ramzi also faces two-year ban from track and field. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Bahrain's Rashid Ramzi Stripped of Olympic 1500m Gold Due to Doping Scandal Bahrain's middle-distance runner, Rashid Ramzi, has been officially stripped of his Olympic 1500m gold medal from the 2008 Beijing Summer Games after being found guilty of doping. The Moroccan-born athlete tested positive for Continuous Erythropoietin Receptor Activator (CERA), an advanced form of the blood-booster erythropoietin (EPO), which is commonly used to enhance athletic performance. The International Olympic Committee (IOC) invalidated Ramzi's medal-winning performance while also imposing further sanctions on four additional athletes who tested positive for the same substance. Rashid Ramzi now faces a potential two-year ban from track and field events in addition to losing his hard-earned Olympic title. This marks a significant setback for the 39-year-old athlete who, prior to this scandal, had an impressive professional career which includes a gold medal win at the 2005 World Athletics Championships in Helsinki. CERA, the substance for which Ramzi tested positive, is a third-generation EPO that stimulates red blood cell production, thereby increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood and improving an athlete's endurance. It offers users the unethical and illegal advantage of a much longer-lasting effect than previous generations of EPO, making it an attractive choice for athletes seeking a competitive edge. The four other athletes found guilty of using CERA span various track and field disciplines. These sanctions serve as a warning sign to aspiring and professional athletes alike that the dedicated anti-doping authorities are continuously improving their methods of detection, making it increasingly difficult to cheat the system. The IOC's decision to strip Rashid Ramzi of his medal and sanction the other athletes who tested positive for CERA emphasizes their determination to create a level playing field in international sports competitions. The organization maintains a strict anti-doping policy to ensure that only clean athletes are recognized for their hard work and talent, thus preserving the integrity of competitive sports and upholding the spirit of fair play. Doping scandals such as this one not only tarnish the reputation of the athletes involved but also cast a shadow over the commitment and achievements of the thousands of other competitors who train diligently and adhere to the rules. The loss of Ramzi's gold medal sends a clear message that the pursuit of glory and success through illicit means will have severe consequences for those who choose to disregard these regulations. Going forward, it is expected that further resources will be invested in the enhancement of anti-doping technologies and education programs to combat the issue of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. The hope is to instill a culture of fair competition, where athletes and fans alike can have confidence in the legitimacy of the results on the track, field, or any other sporting arena. The Rashid Ramzi case stands as a testament to the ongoing battle against doping in sports and the importance of strict enforcement of the anti-doping rules to preserve the integrity of international competition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: When did Hill deliver a tirade? Movie title: The North Avenue Irregulars Movie plot: Reverend Michael Hill (Edward Herrmann) and his two children arrive in a fictional California town. He is there to serve as the new minister at the North Avenue Presbyterian Church. The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly, in her final movie role) to handle the church's sinking fund. On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed. That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area. His only success is with a rock band called Strawberry Shortcake, who he recruits to \\"jazz up\\" the music at church; Anne resigns as music director. Then, two treasury agents for the US government arrive: Marvin Fogleman (Michael Constantine) and Tom Voohries (Steve Franken).

Answer the above question based on the context below: Petrified Forest National Park straddles the border between Apache County and Navajo County in northeastern Arizona. The park is about 30 miles (48 km) long from north to south, and its width varies from a maximum of about 12 miles (19 km) in the north to a minimum of about 1 mile (1.6 km) along a narrow corridor between the north and south, where the park widens again to about 4 to 5 miles (6 to 8 km).I-40, former U.S. Route 66, the BNSF Railway, and the Puerco River bisect the park generally east–west along a similar route. Adamana, a ghost town, is about 1 mile (1.6 km) west of the park along the BNSF tracks. Holbrook, about 26 miles (42 km) west of park headquarters along I-40, is the nearest city. Bisecting the park north–south is Park Road, which runs between I-40 near park headquarters on the north and U.S. Route 180 on the south. Historic Highway 180, an earlier alignment of the modern route, crosses the southern edge of the park. Like Route 66, it has deteriorated and is closed. Many unpaved maintenance roads, closed to the public, intersect Park Road at various points.The fee area of the park covers about 230 square miles (600 km2). The Navajo Nation borders the park on the north and northeast. State-owned land, federal land controlled by the Bureau of Land Management, and private land, much of it used for cattle ranching, adjoin the other borders. The park’s elevation above sea level varies from a low of 5,340 feet (1,630 m) along the Puerco River to a high of 6,230 feet (1,900 m) at Pilot Rock; the average elevation is about 5,400 feet (1,600 m). The terrain varies from gentle hills and major petrified wood deposits in the south to eroded badlands in the north. Most of the park's intermittent streams—including Lithodendron Wash, Dead Wash, Ninemile Wash, and Dry Wash—empty into the Puerco River. In the southern part of the park, Cottonwood Wash and Jim Camp Wash flow into the Little Colorado River.

Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.","completion":"Based on the given information, Finland caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean compared to Russia. Finland is described as being very aware of environmental pollution, which implies that the country has implemented policies and practices to minimize pollution. This consciousness towards the environment suggests that Finland has taken steps to reduce agricultural pollution by promoting sustainable agricultural practices, such as using fewer chemical fertilizers, and instead relying on organic farming methods, which help to reduce the number of harmful particles that enter water systems. On the other hand, Russia practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers. Conventional agriculture often involves the extensive use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides, which can eventually find their way into rivers and other water bodies. Once in the rivers, these chemicals are transported downstream and ultimately discharged into the ocean. As the paragraph indicates, the entry of hazardous chemicals and particles into the ocean leads to marine pollution. In relation to the agricultural practices of the two countries, Finland's sustainable approach creates less pollution in comparison to Russia's conventional farming methods, meaning that Finland causes fewer harmful particles to reach the ocean. The hint further emphasizes the significance of marine pollution, which is caused by the entry of chemicals, particles, and other waste into the ocean. Factors such as agricultural runoff, which contains excess fertilizer chemicals and waste, cause oxygen depletion in water bodies, leading to hypoxia and the formation of dead zones. Moreover, marine debris or litter generated by human activities also poses a threat to marine ecosystems. Overall, due to Finland's awareness and action against environmental pollution, in addition to adopting sustainable agricultural practices, it can be concluded that Finland causes fewer hazardous particles to reach the ocean in comparison to Russia."},{"prompt":"Question: What key details about alban curteis can be extracted from the following bio?

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process involves the inhalation of air, which facilitates the movement of oxygen from the environment into the lungs. This process can be further broken down into the following detailed steps: 1. Initiation of inhalation: The process begins with the contraction of the diaphragm and the external intercostal muscles (muscles between the ribs), which expand the chest cavities both vertically and horizontally. This expansion results in a decrease in air pressure within the lungs compared to the external environment. 2. Air intake: Due to the pressure difference, air from the surrounding environment is drawn into the nasal cavity or the mouth. The nasal cavity is preferred as it filters, humidifies, and warms the air, preparing it for entry into the respiratory system. 3. Passage through the respiratory tract: The inhaled air travels through the nasal cavity or mouth, then moves down the pharynx and larynx, and finally reaches the trachea, which is the main airway connecting the larynx to the bronchi. 4. Air distribution in the lungs: The trachea branches into the left and right bronchi, which further divide into smaller bronchi and then into bronchioles. The bronchioles continue to divide and ultimately terminate in tiny sacs called alveoli, which are surrounded by an extensive network of capillaries. 5. Oxygen uptake: In the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin alveolar walls and the capillary walls, entering the bloodstream. Here, it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells and is transported throughout the body to serve various functions such as cellular respiration and metabolism. Once the initial process of inhalation and oxygen uptake is completed, the subsequent events involving speech production and exhalation can occur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

OPTIONS: (A). yes; (B). it is not possible to tell; (C). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"(C). No; The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Here's why: Entailment in linguistics and discourse analysis refers to a relationship between two sentences where if the first sentence is true, the second one necessarily has to be true as well. To determine whether one sentence entails another, we have to examine the information provided by each sentence and assess whether the truth of one guarantees the truth of the other. Looking at both sentences: Sentence 1: \\"Punches and needles carry a lethal threat\\" This sentence states that punches and needles have the potential to be lethal, meaning they could possibly cause death. However, it doesn't necessarily mean they will always cause death. The term \\"lethal threat\\" implies potential danger but does not guarantee the outcome. This refers to a potential harm or danger which might not always lead to lethal result. Sentence 2: \\"Needles can kill anyone easily.\\" This sentence is an absolute statement that needles can easily cause death. The term \\"kill anyone easily\\" implies an ease and certainty that isn't necessarily implied in the first sentence. This statement is much broader and implies that all needles have this ability and that it happens easily. Therefore, the truth of Sentence 1 does not guarantee the truth of Sentence 2. While Sentence 1 indicates that needles carry a potential for lethality, Sentence 2 assumes a level of lethality and ease that is not contained or guaranteed in Sentence 1.

The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.

By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car.

Premise: \\"And yet, it fits in.\\" I shrugged my shoulders. \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"I didn't move.\\"?","completion":"Premise: \\"And yet, it fits in.\\" Response: \\"I didn't move.\\" To determine whether the given premise entails the hypothesis, we must first analyze the logical structure of both statements and examine the relationship between them. This will help us understand if the hypothesis can be correctly deduced from the premise or not. First, let us break down the premise. The statement \\"And yet, it fits in.\\" suggests that despite some unexpected or seemingly contradictory aspect, the subject (it) manages to fit or align with something. The subject (it) could denote any number of possibilities. It could reference a physical object, an idea, a belief, or an action taken in a given situation. Overall, the premise indicates that the subject, despite potential inconsistencies, finds a way to align with a given context. Now we will analyze the hypothesis, \\"I didn't move.\\" This statement is about the speaker's inaction, implying that the speaker has remained stationary. The subject here is the speaker, and there is no evidence of any unexpected behavior or inconsistencies. It could be interpreted as the speaker claiming that their positioning has not changed. With both statements analyzed, we can now explore the potential relationship between them. Given that the premise is rather vague and does not directly reference any specific context, determining the connection between the two statements can be tricky. However, since our goal is to investigate whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must find a possible context where the two statements can be logically linked. Suppose the speaker is referring to their place within a group or an organization. In this context, \\"it\\" could signify the speaker's status or rank. Initially, it seemed unlikely for the speaker to maintain their position due to certain inconsistencies. These inconsistencies could be related to the speaker's opinions, beliefs, or actions that appeared to be contradictory to the group's views or principles. However, the premise's statement \\"And yet, it fits in\\" tells us that despite those inconsistencies, the speaker's status within the group still fits or aligns with the overall structure of the group or organization. With this established, let's assess whether the premise entails the hypothesis \\"I didn't move.\\" Here, \\"I didn't move\\" could mean that the speaker hasn't experienced a change in position within the group or organization, despite the inconsistencies in beliefs, opinions, or actions. In this case, the hypothesis suggests that the speaker's place remains unaltered, which aligns with the premise's indication that the speaker's status still fits with the group. Based on this specific context, it can be inferred that the premise \\"And yet, it fits in\\" does entail the hypothesis \\"I didn't move.\\" Essentially, the premise suggests that despite potential inconsistencies, the subject (the speaker's status) fits within a given context (the group or organization), and the hypothesis indicates that the speaker has not experienced any change in their position. However, it is crucial to remember that there are many possible interpretations of the given premise, and choosing a different context might lead to different outcomes or conclusions. Additionally, the premise's vagueness could also contribute to alternative explanations, which may not support the hypothesis. Consequently, while the premise does indeed entail the hypothesis under this specific scenario, analyzing the statements from different perspectives could yield different results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does he experience more pressure diving at 10 meters or at 100 meters 10 meters or 100 meters? Text: A fluid exerts pressure in all directions, but the pressure is greater at greater depth. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the text that \\"a fluid exerts pressure in all directions, but the pressure is greater at greater depth,\\" we can conclude that Milo experiences more pressure while diving at 100 meters compared to when he is diving at 10 meters. The pressure acting on an object submerged in a fluid (in this case, Milo diving in the ocean) increases as the depth of the object increases. As Milo goes deeper into the ocean, the weight of the water column above him increases, leading to an increase in the pressure exerted on him. At 10 meters deep, the pressure experienced by Milo is already greater than the surface pressure due to the added water column above him. However, when he dives to a depth of 100 meters, the pressure he experiences is significantly higher because the water column has increased tenfold compared to the depth of 10 meters. In addition to the increasing water column, the density of the water itself can also contribute to the changes in pressure. When diving at ever-increasing depths, the pressure from the water column compresses the water molecules, increasing the water's density. This further contributes to the pressure acting on Milo. In summary, the pressure experienced by Milo is directly proportional to the depth of his dive in the ocean.

If \\"two men between 2 classic cars playing accordions.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Two brothers are playing a musical instrument.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"two men between 2 classic cars playing accordions\\" provides certain information about the scenario, but it doesn't give enough information to come to the conclusion that \\"two brothers are playing a musical instrument\\" with absolute certainty. Let's break down the initial statement to analyze its key elements and ascertain whether the logical conclusion is valid. 1. Two men: The statement tells us that there are two individuals involved in the scenario, and both of them are men. However, it does not specify whether these men are related to each other in any way. Thus, we cannot assume they are brothers based solely on this information. 2. Between 2 classic cars: This part of the statement describes the men's location, positioned between two classic cars. This information does not provide any additional insight into the relationship between the two men or the activity they're engaged in. It simply establishes the setting. 3. Playing accordions: This final part of the statement reveals that both men are playing accordions, which are musical instruments. This suggests that the men are engaging in a harmonious or creative activity, but it still does not provide any information about their relationship to one another. Based on the information provided in the initial statement, we can only conclude that \\"two men are playing musical instruments (accordions) between 2 classic cars.\\" The initial statement does not clarify whether these two men are brothers or not. To come to the conclusion that \\"two brothers are playing a musical instrument,\\" additional information about their relationship would be required. Suppose we had a supplementary statement, such as \\"the two men are siblings\\" or \\"they are known to be brothers.\\" In that case, we could combine this information with the original statement to reach the conclusion that \\"two brothers are playing a musical instrument.\\" In summary, based on the information provided in the initial statement alone, it does not logically follow that \\"two brothers are playing a musical instrument.\\" We can only deduce that \\"two men are playing musical instruments (accordions) between 2 classic cars.\\" Additional information about the men's relationship would be necessary to establish whether they are indeed brothers or not."},{"prompt":"Q: Small crustaceans exchange gases across thin areas of the cuticle; larger species have what to accomplish this?

Write a question about the following article: This game was a must-win for the Redskins in order to maintain their playoff hopes. During the first quarter, the Redskins appeared to be in the position to score after Fred Smoot intercepted Tarvaris Jackson and returned the interception deep into Viking territory. However, the Redskins' offense was unable to score a touchdown. Mike Sellers appeared to score a touchdown on 4th and goal, but a replay challenge by Brad Childress nullified the touchdown and gave the Vikings the ball. However, the Redskins immediately tackled Tony Richardson in the end zone for a safety. Following the subsequent free kick, the Redskins marched down the field and took a 9-0 lead on a 33-yard pass from Todd Collins to Chris Cooley. In the 2nd quarter, the Redskins expanded their lead to 16-0 on a 32-yard pass from Todd Collins to Santana Moss. Later in the quarter, the Redskins took a 22-0 lead when Clinton Portis took a handoff from Todd Collins and threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to Antwaan Randle-El in the end zone. Although the Redskins were not successful on the 2-point conversion attempt, they had a commanding lead at this point in the game, and the previously rowdy Metrodome crowd was very disheartened and silent at this point. The Redskins stretched their lead to 25-0 on a 26-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham. Later in the quarter, the Vikings got the crowd back in the game when Tarvaris Jackson threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to Jim Kleinsasser, cutting the Redskins' lead to 25-7. The Vikings further cut into the Redskins' lead around the 10-minute mark of the fourth quarter when Tarvaris Jackson scored on a 6-yard run, making the lead 25-14. The Metrodome crowd began sensing a comeback as momentum appeared to turn in the Vikings' favor. This came to a head midway through the fourth quarter when the Redskins appeared to complete a long pass to Santana Moss. Though initially ruled a catch by a referee on the sideline, the call was considered questionable by the game's announcers since Moss had to drag his toes to stay in-bounds as he caught the pass. Sensing an impending challenge by Childress, the Redskins raced down the field to snap the ball&#8212;since a play cannot be challenged after the ball has been snapped for the next play. However, the snap was fumbled and it appeared to be Vikings' ball after it was recovered by Vikings' defensive tackle Kevin Williams. As the Vikings rushed onto the field to take over on offense, coach Joe Gibbs challenged that Minnesota had twelve defensive players on the field at the time the Redskins snapped the ball and fumbled it. After review, Gibbs' challenge was upheld and the call on the field was reversed&#8212;a five-yard penalty was assessed to the Vikings for having too many men on the field and the Redskins maintained possession. After the Redskins had retain possession of the football they had eventually scored on a 13-yard touchdown run by Clinton Portis, making the score 32-14 capping off a 75-yard drive. Although Tarvaris Jackson later scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to make the score 32-21, the Vikings were unable to score again, and the Redskins emerged with a victory.

Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The parent in Hanover, Virginia, who challenged the use of the book \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" in 1966 believed that using rape as a plot device in the story was immoral. This incident sparked debates and reactions within the community, as evidenced by the letters sent to local newspapers, which expressed a range of emotions from amusement to anger. It is important to note that the most outraged letters focused on the character Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson, not the actual depiction of rape. Upon learning about the school administrators holding hearings to decide the appropriateness of the book for the classroom, author Harper Lee responded by sending 10 to The Richmond News Leader, suggesting it be used to enroll \\"the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice.\\" This shows the author's defense of her work and her belief in its valuable lessons, despite the controversy surrounding its content. In 1968, the National Education Association listed \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" as the second most complained about book by private organizations, just after \\"Little Black Sambo.\\" This illustrates the ongoing debate about the book's content and its suitability for educational purposes.

Sean Penn and Gus Van Sant have a proposition for us: a biopic dedicated to the memory of San Francisco activist and City Supervisor Harvey Milk, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California, who was murdered by a fellow supervisor in 1978. Sean Penn plays San Francisco City Supervisor Harvey Milk in \\"Milk,\\" directed by Gus Van Sant. The subject may be a tricky sell, but the timing feels right -- a few weeks late to save Californians' same-sex marriage rights, admittedly, but the need to keep on fighting through adversity may be Milk's most important legacy. And \\"Milk\\" is a powerful movie that will stir more than a few hearts and minds. An audiotape Milk records \\"just in case\\" is screenwriter Dustin Lance Black's convenient structuring device, foregrounding the story's tragic outcome and allowing Milk to narrate his own life story. In this telling, it's a life that begins at 40 -- when he picks up Scott (James Franco), falls in love, comes out and drops out. The year is 1970, and San Francisco beckons. Their Castro Street camera store soon becomes a focal point for the booming gay community, and it's not long before Milk makes the first of several unsuccessful runs for district supervisor. Civic elections might seem like small beer, but the persecution that compelled Milk to run for office is no trivial matter. The gay rights movement's most critical accomplishment, the film suggests, is how it liberated gays to be themselves. As Milk tries to explain to his heterosexual colleague Dan White (Josh Brolin), this isn't about principles, it's about people's lives -- three of his lovers had threatened suicide. One of them, Jack Lira (Diego Luna), goes through with it. The political can't get more personal than that. Ironically, the devoutly \\"normal\\" White is the one who is truly messed up. Here's another irony: To earn the recognition and validation of the voters, Milk has to shed his reborn hippie uniform and ponytail, put on a suit and get a haircut. Making the same calculation, director Gus Van Sant has axed the long takes and experimentalism that made \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Paranoid Park\\" arresting but decidedly marginal experiences and turned in his most conventional movie since \\"Finding Forrester.\\" In other words, he's playing it straight this time. The strategy is sound; the execution, nearly flawless. Van Sant captures the time and the place with unobtrusive precision, seamlessly mixing in reams of archival news reports. (She may not know it, but Anita Bryant has a co-starring role in this movie.) iReport.com: Share your reviews of 'Milk' Penn is studied and thoughtful, impassioned and immediately sympathetic as Milk. It's easy to see how he attracts so much support -- and how his drive and commitment don't leave enough time for a \\"real\\" life. When Penn smiles, there's always pain there -- it's almost a wince -- and he smiles a lot here. \\"Milk\\" may be a little too homogenized for some tastes. Like \\"Philadelphia\\" and \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" it's careful how it advances its agenda (and it does have one). But it's not just a single-issue movie. In its conviction that \\"change\\" isn't effected through rhetoric alone, but through the hard slog of campaign work, persuasion, inspiration, inclusion and good old, bad old politicking, \\"Milk\\" says something about how progress is achieved in America. In that respect, it evokes the best aspirations of the country -- and, for that matter, of filmmaking. What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"1. \\"Milk\\" is a biopic dedicated to the memory of Harvey Milk, played by Sean Penn, the first openly gay man to be elected to public office in California before being murdered in 1978. 2.

Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients.

She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \\"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events.

Knowing they cannot vandalize the sets with Pfeifer there, the group tries to leave, but finds that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception. Disturbed, Cassidy admits the trio's real reason for being in the school, which angers Pfeifer. As the group tries to look for a way out of the school, they find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis. They also discover that Charlie was not supposed to have performed that day, and was only on stage because he was the understudy for the main actor, Reese's father Rick. The group becomes separated when Reese runs off with the camera, with Ryan being left alone. As he searches for Reese, he sees various things, such as a half finished plate of food, a cup of coffee, a hidden room with a mattress and bed frame, and what looks like a body hanging from above. When the group is reunited, they hear footsteps above them that stop above Cassidy. She is then yanked into the air by seemingly nothing, leaving her with burns on her neck that look like rope burns.

Created as a memorial to the Hare Krishna movement's founder, this ornate temple's beautiful landscape and lavish adornments astonish all who visit. In the heart of San Francisco, Grace Cathedral stands as a testament to the country's early religious history. Being an Episcopal church, it also features French and Italian Gothic-inspired architecture and world-famous labyrinths that encourage quiet contemplation and meditation. Vibrant, colorful murals depicting religious scenes and an impressive organ installed in the Cathedral further contribute to its splendor. No list of U.S. religious landmarks would be complete without mentioning St. Patrick's Cathedral, located in the bustling streets of New York City. This historic, neo-Gothic Roman Catholic cathedral draws millions of tourists and worshipers each year, captivated by its intricate stonework, grand spires, and resplendent stained glass windows. Another striking religious site is Temple Emanu-El, also in New York City. As one of the largest synagogues in the world, it features remarkable Moorish Revival architecture and beautiful stained glass windows that tell stories of the Hebrew Bible. Though the United States may be a relatively young nation, it is rich in religious diversity, and its religious landmarks convey a sense of wonder, serenity, and creative inspiration. Each site unique in its origins and architectural style offers not only insight into the country's spiritual history but also showcases the artistic achievements and beauty found in America's spiritual landscape.

Rivers of My Fathers\\" is a song by a soul and jazz poet whose own term for himself was what? The answer is:","completion":"The answer to this complex question is that \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\" is a song by the influential soul and jazz poet, artist, and musician Gil Scott-Heron. Gil Scott-Heron often referred to himself as a \\"bluesologist,\\" a term he coined to denote a scientist who is focused on studying the blues, an African American musical genre that traces its roots back to the early 20th century. Born on April 1, 1949, in Chicago, Illinois, Gil Scott-Heron grew up immersed in the rich musical heritage of African American culture. He developed a deep appreciation for the blues, jazz, and soul music that permeated his surroundings. Scott-Heron's unique fusion of socially conscious poetry and music made him an influential figure in the development of hip-hop and other contemporary African American musical styles. His 1971 song \\"Rivers of My Fathers\\" serves as an homage to his African heritage and connects the struggles of his past and present through the metaphor of a river. In the song, Scott-Heron uses the image of a river to represent the pain, resilience, and strength of the African American experience, highlighting the complex emotions and historical context that have shaped the lives of Black individuals in the United States. Throughout his career, Gil Scott-Heron produced numerous albums and singles, exploring various themes related to race, social conditions, politics, and personal experiences. His work often exemplified the role of the bluesologist, both in his music and his self-designation as a scientist of the blues. His unique term for himself demonstrated his profound love and understanding of African American music and hinted at the powerful role it played in shaping and expressing the Black experience in America. Some of Gil Scott-Heron's most notable works include \\"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\\", \\"Johannesburg\\", and \\"Angel Dust\\", which further showcase his prowess as an innovative lyricist, musician, and bluesologist. His approach to creating and interpreting music left a lasting impact on several musical genres and inspired generations of musicians and poets who followed in his footsteps. In conclusion, the term Gil Scott-Heron used for himself as a soul and jazz poet was \\"bluesologist,\\" reflecting his deep appreciation and understanding of the blues, as well as his identity as an influential figure in the development and progression of African American music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Sam's Club taps e-commerce in search of edge over Costco Sam’s Club, the warehouse club operated by Walmart Stores WMT , has overhauled its in-store pick-up service for online orders as it looks to gain an edge in e-commerce over archival Costco Wholesale COST . The company, the eight largest U.S. retailer with sales of 58 billion last year, already gives customers the option to order products online and pick them up in stores. But Sam’s Club said Thursday that it has improved the service, renamed “Club Pickup” from “Click ‘n Pull,” to let customers build and save shopping lists online so they can reorder the same items later or do so automatically. They can also get suggestions for substitutions if an item is out of stock. The service, which has an expanded assortment of items available, will be open for business seven days a week rather than just five. Sam’s Club said that could be particularly handy for its convenience store customers. That part of its business that has struggled as that area of retail has consolidated and tobacco sales softened. The initiative is just the latest by Sam’s Club to shore up its revenue from business customers, which account for as much as one-third of Sam’s Club’s membership, according to Kantar Retail estimates. But lately, they have been a softer part of its business compared to non-business members, impeding its performance compared to Costco. We “believe the busiest members will benefit the most, like parents and small business owners who have limited time and the most recurring needs,” said Sam’s Club CEO Rosalind Brewer. This follows other initiatives Brewer described last year in an interview with Fortune, including a big expansion of what it sells online for small businesses. This service could give Sam’s Club a welcome edge over Costco, which quarter in and quarter out reports better sales numbers. Costco does not yet let customers place orders online that they can retrieve at a warehouse. Sam’s Club can use the new service to place orders online or through an app, select the location and time they want to pick up the order, and get an email or text alert when the order is ready. For more about Walmart, watch this Fortune video: What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about Sam's Club, a big store owned by Walmart, trying to do better than its competitor, Costco, by improving its online shopping and pick-up service. They changed the service's name to \\"Club Pickup\\" and made it better by letting customers save lists of items they like to buy and giving suggestions if something is not available. The pick-up service will now be open every day of the week. This could be very helpful for busy people like parents and small business owners. Costco doesn't have a similar service, so this might give Sam's Club an advantage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A:","completion":"M/Y stands for Motor Yacht, which is a type of watercraft primarily designed for leisure and recreational purposes. Motor yachts are commonly powered by internal combustion engines, usually diesel or gasoline, that drive propellers or water jets to propel the vessel. They can vary greatly in size, design, and features, from luxurious mega yachts to smaller weekend cruisers. Understanding the term M/Y and the characteristics of motor yachts will provide insight into their purpose, popularity, and functionality. Characteristics of motor yachts include: 1. Size: Motor yachts can range significantly in size, from compact day-cruisers of around 30 feet in length to imposing mega yachts that exceed 300 feet. The larger the yacht, the more features and amenities it typically has, such as additional guest cabins, expansive living spaces, and advanced technological systems. 2. Design: These vessels are designed to offer their owners and guests comfort, luxury, and entertainment while they are onboard. M/Ys often feature spacious cabins, well-appointed galleys, elegant saloons, multiple entertainment zones, sunbathing areas, and modern equipment for navigation and communication. Some luxury motor yachts even have on-board amenities like swimming pools, cinemas, gyms, and helicopter landing pads. 3. Speed and performance: Motor yachts are generally faster than their sailing counterparts, thanks to their powerful engines and streamlined hull designs. A faster cruising speed enables them to cover greater distances in a shorter time, making them suitable for longer trips, island hopping, and time-sensitive itineraries. 4. Crew: Depending on its size, a motor yacht may require a crew consisting of a captain, engineers, deckhands, and hospitality staff to manage its operation, maintenance, and guest services. Larger motor yachts will most likely have a larger crew, while smaller vessels may only require one or two crew members. 5. Activities: Motor yachts support a wide range of on-water activities. Many M/Ys are equipped with water toys such as jet skis, inflatable kayaks, Stand Up Paddleboards (SUPs), and snorkeling or scuba diving gear. In addition, motor yachts also have sizable swim platforms or fold-down transom doors, which provide guests with easy access to the water for swimming or boarding watercraft. 6. Cost: The price of a motor yacht can vary greatly depending on factors such as its size, design, features, and construction. Smaller motor yachts tend to be more affordable, but as their size and amenities increase, so does their price tag. Motor yachts offer a unique and opulent way to experience the ocean and coastal environments. With their luxurious accommodations, advanced technology, and vast array of on-board attractions, M/Ys provide a comfortable and enjoyable environment for their owners and guests to explore the world's seas and waterways."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Houdini was one of seven children: Herman M. (1863-1885) who was Houdini's half-brother, by Rabbi Weisz's first marriage; Nathan J. (1870-1927); Gottfried William (1872-1925); Theodore (1876-1945); Leopold D. (1879-1962); and Carrie Gladys (1882-1959), who was left almost blind after a childhood accident. Weisz arrived in the United States on July 3, 1878, on the SS Fresia with his mother (who was pregnant) and his four brothers. In 1904, the London Daily Mirror newspaper challenged Houdini to escape from special handcuffs that it claimed had taken Nathaniel Hart, a locksmith from Birmingham, five years to make. Houdini accepted the challenge for March 17 during a matinee performance at London's Hippodrome theater. It was reported that 4000 people and more than 100 journalists turned out for the much-hyped event. The escape attempt dragged on for over an hour, during which Houdini emerged from his \\"ghost house\\" (a small screen used to conceal the method of his escape) several times. On one occasion he asked if the cuffs could be removed so he could take off his coat. The Mirror representative, Frank Parker, refused, saying Houdini could gain an advantage if he saw how the cuffs were unlocked. Houdini promptly took out a pen-knife and, holding the knife in his teeth, used it to cut his coat from his body. Some 56 minutes later, Houdini's wife appeared on stage and gave him a kiss. Many thought that in her mouth was the key to unlock the special handcuffs. However, it has since been suggested that Bess did not in fact enter the stage at all, and that this theory is unlikely due to the size of the 6-inch key Houdini then went back behind the curtain. After an hour and ten minutes, Houdini emerged free. As he was paraded on the shoulders of the cheering crowd, he broke down and wept. Houdini later said it was the most difficult escape of his career. After Houdini's death, his friend Martin Beck was quoted in Will Goldston's book, Sensational Tales of Mystery Men, as admitting that Houdini was bested that day and had appealed to his wife, Bess, for help. Goldston goes on to claim that Bess begged the key from the Mirror representative, then slipped it to Houdini in a glass of water. It was stated in the book The Secret Life of Houdini that the key required to open the specially designed Mirror handcuffs was 6 inches long, and could not have been smuggled to Houdini in a glass of water. Goldston offered no proof of his account, and many modern biographers have found evidence (notably in the custom design of the handcuffs) that the Mirror challenge may have been arranged by Houdini and that his long struggle to escape was pure showmanship. This escape was discussed in depth on the Travel Channel's Mysteries at the Museum in an interview with Houdini expert, magician and escape artist Dorothy Dietrich of Scranton's Houdini Museum. A full-sized design of the same Mirror Handcuffs, as well as a replica of the Bramah style key for it, is on display to the public at The Houdini Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania. This set of cuffs is believed to be one of only six in the world, some of which are not on display.

Please answer this question: What is the geometric figure or design which represents the universe in Hindu or Buddhist symbolism?","completion":"The geometric figure or design that represents the universe in Hindu and Buddhist symbolism is known as the \\"Mandala.\\" A mandala (Sanskrit: मण्डल, circle) is a spiritual and ritual symbol characterized by its intricacy, balance, and radial symmetry. It is used in various forms of Hinduism and Buddhism, as it embodies their cosmic and metaphysical beliefs. The word 'mandala' is derived from the ancient Sanskrit language, where 'manda' means essence and 'la' means container, thus representing a container of essence or cosmic energy. Mandalas have a rich and diverse history, and they can be found across different cultures and religions, but their significance in Hinduism and Buddhism is particularly profound. They serve multiple purposes, including meditation, contemplation, and spiritual guidance. The design of a mandala typically consists of a central focal point surrounded by symmetrically arranged geometric shapes, patterns or figures, often enclosed within a larger circle or square, which is meant to represent the microcosm and macrocosm of the universe. In Hinduism, mandalas often depict various gods and goddesses, as well as symbols such as the lotus flower, the wheel of life, and the tree of life, which all have significant meanings in Hindu cosmology. In Buddhism, they are primarily associated with Tibetan Vajrayana Buddhism (also known as Tantric Buddhism). Here, mandalas are often used as visual aids to help practitioners focus during meditation and visualization exercises, aiding them on their path to enlightenment. The creation of mandalas is considered a sacred and meditative practice in itself. In traditional settings, the process of drawing, painting or constructing a mandala can take several days, weeks, or even months, as the artist meditates and reflects on the meaning and symbolism behind each element while meticulously crafting the design. Once completed, the mandala acts as a sacred space and a symbol of personal transformation or spiritual awakening. There are several types of mandalas in Hindu and Buddhist symbolism, including: 1. Teaching Mandalas: These are used to impart knowledge and philosophical concepts of the religion to practitioners. They represent the doctrines, principles, and wisdom of the religion. 2. Healing Mandalas: These are used for healing and purification purposes, both physically and spiritually. They are believed to emit vibrations and energies that can cleanse the body, mind and soul. 3. Sand Mandalas: Tibetan Buddhist monks often create intricate mandalas using colored sand. Once completed, the mandala is ceremoniously dismantled, symbolizing the impermanence of life and the cyclical nature of the universe. 4. Yantras: In Hinduism, yantras are geometrical diagrams used as meditation aids to invoke or manifest specific deities. They serve as powerful tools for focusing the mind and channeling divine energies. Overall, the mandala is an essential aspect of Hindu and Buddhist symbolism, representing the universe, spiritual growth, and the interconnectedness of all life forms. The practice of creating or contemplating mandalas serves as a gateway to higher states of consciousness and understanding of the divine. Ultimately, mandalas remind us of the cyclical nature of existence, the interconnectedness of all life, and our profound relationship with the universe. They serve as both contemplative tools and sacred art, symbolizing the cosmic order and the spiritual journey toward enlightenment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rumors about Lillian begin to connect with their investigation into the missing persons case. The common thread? All the victims had suspiciously started reaching out to Lillian, hoping to be rid of the ghosts that haunted them. Carl and Dave decide to visit the local library, unearthing long-forgotten newspaper clippings and manuscripts that chronicle Lillian's life as a medium. These documents reveal that she had been wrongly accused and ostracized by the community eventually, driving her into tragic seclusion and loneliness. Finally, one night, Dave discovers an old diary of Lillian's in the library that reveals how her gift had caused her immense pain and how she had lost control over her abilities, allowing malevolent spirits to overtake her life. As the truth unravels, the duo discovers that the sinister ghosts that once tormented Lillian have been playing a deadly game with the townspeople for years, feeding off their fear and misery. Dave manages to locate a descendent of Lillian's, a reclusive woman named Evelyn, rumored to possess the same sixth sense as her ancestor. With her help and unique abilities, they attempt to confront and destroy the malevolent spirits that have haunted their town for generations. Just as they succeed in purging the house of its ghostly inhabitants, Dave confides in Carl a secret he's been holding about his personal motivations for investigating this mystery -- he, too, has inherited the same psychic gift from his family. The story ends with Dave accepting his new destiny and deciding to stay in the town, not only to hone his abilities and honor Lillian's legacy but to become a resource for others tormented by the supernatural. Together, Carl and Dave renew their friendship and collaborate on a novel inspired by their adventure, ensuring the story of Lillian and the haunted house lives on."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

What year was the river that flows between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range established as a National Natural Landmark? Answer the above question based on the context below: The Willamette River ( (listen) wil-AM-it) is a major tributary of the Columbia River, accounting for 12 to 15 percent of the Columbia's flow. The Willamette's main stem is 187 miles (301 km) long, lying entirely in northwestern Oregon in the United States. Flowing northward between the Oregon Coast Range and the Cascade Range, the river and its tributaries form the Willamette Valley, a basin that contains two-thirds of Oregon's population, including the state capital, Salem, and the state's largest city, Portland, which surrounds the Willamette's mouth at the Columbia. Originally created by plate tectonics about 35 million years ago and subsequently altered by volcanism and erosion, the river's drainage basin was significantly modified by the Missoula Floods at the end of the most recent ice age. Humans began living in the watershed over 10,000 years ago. There were once many tribal villages along the lower river and in the area around its mouth on the Columbia. Indigenous peoples lived throughout the upper reaches of the basin as well. Rich with sediments deposited by flooding and fed by prolific rainfall on the western side of the Cascades, the Willamette Valley is one of the most fertile agricultural regions in North America, and was thus the destination of many 19th-century pioneers traveling west along the Oregon Trail. The river was an important transportation route in the 19th century, although Willamette Falls, just upstream from Portland, was a major barrier to boat traffic. In the 21st century, major highways follow the river, and roads cross it on more than 50 bridges. Since 1900, more than 15 large dams and many smaller ones have been built in the Willamette's drainage basin, 13 of which are operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The dams are used primarily to produce hydroelectricity, to maintain reservoirs for recreation, and to prevent flooding. The river and its tributaries support 60 fish species, including many species of salmon and trout; this is despite the dams, other...

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to calculate an interest payment on a bond Learn what a bond is. Purchasing a bond can be thought of as purchasing debt, or, alternatively stated, loaning money to a company. The bond itself simply represents this debt.","completion":"When an investor acquires a bond, they essentially agree to lend money to the issuer, which can be a corporation, government, or other entity, for a predetermined period of time and interest rate. The issuer promises to pay the investor periodic interest payments, also known as coupon payments, throughout the bond's life, typically semi-annually, and to return the principal, known as the face value or par value, upon the bond's maturity date. These periodic interest payments function as an income stream for the bondholder and incentivize them to hold onto the bond until its maturity. In order to calculate the interest payment on a bond, one must first gather the necessary information, including the bond's face value, the coupon rate, and the payment frequency. The face value refers to the initial investment or principal, which is usually 1,000 or a multiple thereof. The coupon rate, expressed as a percentage, indicates the annual interest payments the bondholder will receive. The payment frequency denotes the number of times per year the bondholder will receive interest payments, with the majority of bonds making semi-annual payments. Once this information has been obtained, the computation of an interest payment can proceed by following these steps: 1. Convert the coupon rate to a decimal by dividing it by 100. For instance, if the coupon rate is 5%, it should be represented as 0.05. 2. Calculate the annual interest payment by multiplying the face value by the converted coupon rate. For instance, if the face value of the bond is 1,000 and the annual coupon rate is 0.05, the annual interest payment would equal 1,000 x 0.05, or 50. 3. Factor in the payment frequency by dividing the annual interest payment by the number of payments made per year. For a bond with semi-annual payments, the aforementioned interest payment of 50 would be divided by two, resulting in an interest payment of 25 per period. Understanding how to calculate interest payments on bonds is a crucial skill for investors seeking to diversify their portfolio and generate a steady income stream. It not only enables them to make informed decisions about which bonds to invest in but also empowers them to assess the performance of their investment and anticipate future cash flows. With this knowledge in hand, investors can confidently approach the world of fixed income securities and harness the potential of bonds to achieve their financial goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The first step to making an apology is to realize that you are not always right. People are often defensive and struggle to accept their faults. This mechanism is meant to protect your mind and emotions from being hurt, but it can often lead to difficulties when dealing with other people. For example, if a person tells you that your bumper sticker is offensive, you might feel the need to accuse them of being “overly sensitive” before stopping to think about why they were offended. By assuming that the other person’s opinion is as valid as your own, you open yourself up to understanding their point of view, even if you still disagree. Sometimes people do things that are just not cool. That includes you. When you do something that has a negative effect on someone else, be willing to admit fault in the situation. Constantly deferring fault to the other person can put a strain on the relationship and make it hard to move past the conflict. For example, say you were supposed to pick your friend up from work. When you left your job, you were so focused on getting home that you forgot to pick up your friend. If you say something to your friend like “You should have reminded me,” you are not accepting fault. Instead, you should acknowledge your role in the situation by saying something like “It was my fault, I completely forgot that you needed a ride.” The longer you wait to apologize, the less sincere it will seem. The person that you are apologizing to will be expecting the apology immediately. If you withhold it, it can put a strain on the relationship. Your eventual apology is likely to be mistaken for a way to alleviate that strain rather than a genuine apology. If you are out with friends and say something that embarrasses one of them, apologize immediately. Do not wait until the next time you see them to bring up the apology. If you are apologizing, you have likely hurt another person in some way. The first step to a full apology is to acknowledge this. Next, express your regret for having hurt them, and finally make an effort to amend the situation (and relationship) and ask to be forgiven. For example, if you missed several phone calls from your spouse while you were out with friends, saying “I’m sorry,” isn’t a full apology. Instead, say something like “I know that you were worried about me last night. I am sorry that I didn’t have my phone charged. From now on, I’ll take a phone charger in my car so you can reach me. Do you forgive me?” Summary:","completion":"To make an apology, first understand that you can make mistakes too and it's important to admit them. When you do something wrong, accept your fault and apologize as soon as possible to show sincerity. Say sorry, acknowledge that you hurt someone, express your regret, and try to fix the problem. Finally, ask for forgiveness and learn from your mistakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Question: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony. In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's examine the information given: 1. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers create more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up (temperature regulation). 2. Workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases (to reduce water loss). Now, let's analyze the conditions of each battle day for group A: - Battle day one: 5 °C temperature (outside of the 20-30 °C range for creating more openings) - Battle day two: 22 °C temperature (within the 20-30 °C range for creating more openings) - Battle day three: Low air humidity (workers close openings to reduce water loss) - Battle day four: High air humidity (not explicitly mentioned, but it can be inferred that openings would be more likely on this day) Given this information, in battle day three, with low air humidity, group A would close openings to reduce water loss. This means there would be fewer openings on that day. In battle day four, with high air humidity, it would be reasonable to expect that workers would be less concerned about water loss, so the nest thatch would have more openings. Thus, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch on battle day four than on battle day three."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Anton Friedrich Wilhelm (von) Webern (German: ['anton 've:ban] ( listen); 3 December 1883 - 15 September 1945) was an Austrian composer and conductor. Along with his mentor Arnold Schoenberg and his colleague Alban Berg, Webern was in the core of those in the circle of the Second Viennese School, including Ernst Krenek and Theodor W. Adorno. As an exponent of atonality and twelve-tone technique, Webern exerted influence on contemporaries Luigi Dallapiccola, Krenek, and even Schoenberg himself. Context: Webern published little of his early work in particular; like Brahms, though perhaps for not entirely the same reasons, Webern was characteristically meticulous and revised extensively. Many juvenilia remained unknown until the work and findings of the Moldenhauers in the 1960s, effectively obscuring and undermining formative facets of Webern's musical identity, highly significant even more so in the case of an innovator whose music was crucially marked by rapid stylistic shifts. Thus when Boulez first oversaw a project to record \\"all\\" of Webern's music, not including the juvenilia, the results fit on three rather than six CDs. Webern's earliest works consist primarily of lieder, the genre that most belies his roots in Romanticism, specifically German Romanticism; one in which the music yields brief but explicit, potent, and spoken meaning manifested only latently or programmatically in purely instrumental genres; one marked by significant intimacy and lyricism; and one which often associates nature, especially landscapes, with themes of homesickness, solace, wistful yearning, distance, utopia, and belonging. Robert Schumann's \\"Mondnacht\\" is an iconic example; Eichendorff, whose lyric poetry inspired it, is not far removed from the poets (e.g., Richard Dehmel, Gustav Falke, Theodor Storm) whose work inspired Webern and his contemporaries Alban Berg, Max Reger, Arnold Schoenberg, Richard Strauss, Hugo Wolf, and Alexander Zemlinsky. Wolf's Morike-Lieder were especially influential on Webern's efforts from this period. But well beyond these lieder alone, all of Webern's music may be said to possess such concerns and qualities, as is evident from his sketches, albeit in an increasingly symbolic, abstract, spare, introverted, and idealized manner. Other works include the orchestral tone poem Im Sommerwind (1904) and the Langsamer Satz (1905) for string quartet. Webern's first piece after completing his studies with Schoenberg was the Passacaglia for orchestra (1908). Harmonically, it is a step forward into a more advanced language, and the orchestration is somewhat more distinctive than his earlier orchestral work. However, it bears little relation to the fully mature works he is best known for today. One element that is typical is the form itself: the passacaglia is a form which dates back to the 17th century, and a distinguishing feature of Webern's later work was to be the use of traditional compositional techniques (especially canons) and forms (the Symphony, the Concerto, the String Trio, and String Quartet, and the piano and orchestral Variations) in a modern harmonic and melodic language.

Title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: The film covers the life of Moses from his discovery in a basket floating on the Nile as a baby by Bithiah, a childless young widow and daughter of the then-Pharaoh, Rameses I, to his prohibition from entering the land of Israel in the wake of God's judgment on him at the waters of Meribah. In between, the film depicts the early adulthood of Moses as a beloved foster son of Pharaoh Seti I (brother of Bithiah) and general of his armies, his romance with Throne Princess Nefertari (or Nefretiri, as she is called in the film) and rivalry with the Pharaoh's own son, Prince Rameses II.Shortly after Moses' birth, Rameses I had ordered the slaying of all firstborn male Hebrews to prevent the prophecy of the Deliverer from coming true. Moses' mother (called \\"Yoshebel\\" in the film) had set him adrift on the Nile to escape, with his sister Miriam watching from a hidden spot. Bithiah discovers the Ark while playing with other young women in the banks of the Nile. She orders them to leave, then shows her servant Memnet the baby. Memnet warned Bithiah that the swaddling cloth was Levite, so the baby was placed there to escape Bithiah's father's edict. But Bithiah declared that this baby would be her son, and remembered when the pyramids were dust, and named \\"Moses\\" because she had drawn him from the Nile (the Hebrew name \\"Moshe\\" derived from the Hebrew word \\"Mashu\\", meaning \\"to draw\\"). Despite Memnet's protests about serving a son of Hebrew slaves, Bithiah ordered her to serve him and to swear to secrecy on pain of death. But Memnet hides the cloth under her clothes.As a young general, Moses is victorious in a war with the Nubian people of ancient Ethiopia, loosing captured ibises to combat the serpents (as recorded by Josephus) and further impresses Seti I by being wily enough to enter into an alliance with the conquered Ethiopians rather than subjugate them.

Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought.

Firstly, the situations and capabilities of different countries are often interconnected in various ways through trade, investments, treaties, and strategic partnerships. By taking a proactive approach, Japan might be able to strengthen its position in the international community and foster cooperation with other nations to address common challenges. Ignoring the issues that China faces, particularly if they have implications for regional or global stability, could potentially exacerbate those problems and ultimately harm Japan's interests. Secondly, Japan has its own unique strengths and resources that can contribute to resolving complex problems. Even if China's difficulties are greater in magnitude, Japan's expertise in various areas, such as technology, energy, and disaster relief, might still be critical in addressing specific aspects of these challenges. Thirdly, taking an active role in addressing regional and global problems can enhance Japan's reputation and soft power. By engaging constructively with other nations, Japan can demonstrate its commitment to global peace, development, and sustainability. This, in turn, can strengthen its diplomatic ties and positively influence its relations with other nations, including China. In conclusion, even if Japan's difficulties appear small compared to China's, that does not provide a sufficient basis to argue that Japan should simply stand to the side and do nothing.

Yesterday’s shift at the top of the government should give at least a little kick to the dismal U.S. housing market. In the Obamas’ former home, Chicago, prices are down 14% over the past year. And home prices in the Washington, D.C. area? Down 14.3%, according to Move Inc., which runs Realtor.com, the official site of the National Association of Realtors. It’s remarkable, actually that D.C.’s 2008 median home price – 343,196, 80,000 higher than Chicago’s – has held up as well as it has. Consider that D.C. had the biggest surge in year-over-year home listings: up 70% last year. Granted, the government’s coming expansion – our new president’s federal programs to lift America out of its crises – should fuel home-buying in D.C. But still, the outlook isn’t bright. Last month, Fortune predicted that the median home price there will tumble 20% in 2009. Among 100 regional markets listed on Fortune‘s 2009 Housing Outlook, D.C. ranks near the bottom, 91st. (Click here for a gallery of the predicted 10 worst real-estate markets in the U.S. for 2009.) Meanwhile, the Bushes, off to Crawford, Texas for a break, have bought a home in the tony Dallas neighborhood of Preston Hollow. They had nearly 4,000 homes to choose from. In fact, Dallas ranked eighth out of 146 metros in the number of new listings in December, according to Move. But this number was actually down 30% from a year earlier – so the Dallas market is not in such sorry shape. Prices fell only 1.2% in Dallas last year. Moody’s Economy.com, as reported in Fortune, expects the Dallas-Irving market to drop a mere 1.2% in 2009. As for the Bushes’ new residence, 10141 Daria Place, it is a brick, one-story, 8,500-square-foot house on one acre at the end of a cul-de-sac. The home is worth 2.2 million, according to Zillow.com’s estimate. Quite a comedown from 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. Zillow says that residence is worth some 300 million.

There was a huge corporation in which I had a contract with. I was called in, to help them uncover what they considered “a very serious series of incidents”. Their own “in house” attempts were fruitless. It turned out, they had an over-sized engineering department, and that it had been announced that this would be scaled back due to completion of contracts. Someone though, within the engineering department, was sabotaging the continued work, slowing the completion. I was to go undercover, posing as a visiting engineer from a distant plant, and find out who the perpetrator/s were, as they wished to file legal action. So, this is at the corporate headquarters, in the late 1980’s. These people were making 6 figure incomes easily. That being said, you kind of expect a bit more of a dignified behavior here than you would with a construction laborer or dishwasher. I completed my job in four days, giving them the evidence and name of the lone individual respsonsible for the sabotage. What exactly was he doing? He carried rubber gloves in his back pocket, and he would periodically use the restroom, and remove his feces from the toilet and smear it all over the walls, covering as much surface as he could. He would also visit restrooms in different departments and do the same. This would cause the unionized individuals, who only had that restroom to use in their area, to walk off their work stations. Seriously, a butt-hurt guy fearing a layoff, so he decided to smear his shit all over the place before it even happened.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. A thermometer is a device used to measure temperature. It is placed in contact with an object and allowed to reach thermal equilibrium with the object (they will have the same temperature). The operation of a thermometer is based on some property, such as volume, that varies with temperature. The most common thermometers contain liquid mercury, or some other liquid, inside a sealed glass tube. The liquid expands and contracts faster than the glass tube. Therefore, when the temperature of the thermometer increases, the liquid volume expands faster than the glass volume, allowing the liquid to rise in the tube. The positions of the liquid in the tube can then be calibrated for accurate temperature readings. Other properties that change with temperature can also be used to make thermometers; liquid crystal colors and electrical conductivity change with temperature, and are also relatively common thermometers. A group of middle school students is measuring the temperature of various liquids for a chemistry lab using a mercury thermometer. They have a beaker of boiling water, a beaker of ice water, and a beaker of water at room temperature. If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, is the temperature higher or lower? The answer to this question is:","completion":"If the students move the thermometer from one beaker to another and the mercury levels rise, the temperature is higher. This is because the liquid (mercury) inside the thermometer expands when it is exposed to a higher temperature, causing it to rise in the glass tube."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This doesn't allow them to keep an eye on their children. On the other hand, the modern society gives more freedom to the children than they could \\"handle\\". As a child, you don't know how to grow up by yourself until you reach a certain age. That is why you need school and parents to be by your side all the time. If you don't have either of them you may make a lot of mistakes. The social system of the modern society is very _ especially with the children. Most of the children today are rebels . They are rude. They are given too much freedom by their families. This is their parent's mistake. They ought to know that the freedom they give to their children is misunderstood. For example it is a bad thing for a 17 - year - old child to go out in the evening on weekends. Parents are also guilty of the way their children show up in the street or at school. The same guilt belongs to the teaching system as well. Pupils shouldn't be allowed to dress like they were on a fashion presentation at school. Another important fact we can think of regarding the freedom of children is their free will of spending money. Parents shouldn't allow their children to spend money on whatever they want. I think children are given too much freedom not only by their parents, but also by the society. The latter is more to be blamed! The writer implies that parents' busy lifestyle _ .

When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house. In the basement, Sarah discovers the family's dismembered dog. Miles apologizes, and explains that someone is invading his dreams every night, and that he has to \\"make room.\\" A:","completion":"Miles attacks a classmate with a wrench."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval. If you tip badly, people think less of you. Tipping well is a chance to show off.\\" Question: Among the following situations, in your opinion, who is likely to tip most?

Eldridge not only praises Delevingne's beauty but also expresses her appreciation for the model's pleasant demeanor and quick intelligence, making the partnership an absolute pleasure for both parties. As a bonus for fans, Eldridge has gone ahead and created a video tutorial outlining step-by-step instructions on how to get Cara's stunning look for the evening. Step 1: Research and Design Before diving into the makeup application process, it is essential for a makeup artist like Lisa Eldridge to research and design a look that would accentuate and complement Cara's natural features. Communicating with the model and understanding her preferences is a key aspect of Lisa's job, and in this case, Cara's courteous and intelligent manner proved to be a major advantage for both. Step 2: Prepping Cara's Skin To achieve Cara's radiant complexion, Lisa begins by thoroughly cleansing her face and applying a suitable moisturizer. This step ensures the skin is well-hydrated, creating a flawless canvas for makeup application. Step 3: Foundation and Concealer When creating a flawless base, Lisa carefully selects the right shade of foundation and concealer to match Cara's skin tone perfectly. This helps to even out her complexion and hide any blemishes for a seamless finish. Step 4: Eye Makeup Evidently, the main focus of the makeup look for the W Magazine party is Cara's striking eye makeup. Lisa skillfully applies a blend of sultry shades to the lid, gradually building up to a stunning, smoky eye effect. Next, she lines Cara's upper and lower lash lines with a dark grey eyeliner for added intensity. Step 5: Brows and Lashes Capitalizing on Cara's iconic bold brows, Lisa enhances them by filling in any gaps with a precise brow pencil. This adds definition and shape to the overall makeup look. Moving on, Lisa curls Cara's lashes, giving them a lift and making her eyes appear more open. For gorgeous, fluttery lashes, Lisa completed this step by applying two coats of mascara to Cara's upper and lower lashes. Step 6: Blush and Highlighter To add warmth and dimension to Cara's face, Lisa opts for a soft pink blush and applies it on the apples of her cheeks. She then swipes a subtle highlighter on the high points of her cheekbones for a subtle glow. Step 7: Lips Lastly, to complete the entire makeup look, Lisa defines Cara's lips with a matching lip liner, followed by applying a gorgeous nude lipstick for a soft yet sophisticated finish. By capturing this process in a video tutorial, Lisa Eldridge graciously shares her makeup prowess with Cara Delevingne's fans who can now recreate the stunning look at home. This collaboration between two remarkable and talented women showcases the importance of mutual respect, strong communication, and expertise within the beauty industry, inspiring countless followers to pursue their own creative endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this instance: THE film at the centre of anti-US protests in the Middle East was made by an Israeli-American who describes Islam as a \\"cancer\\", the Wall Street Journal says. The movie, Innocence of Muslims, was directed and produced by Sam Bacile, a 52-year-old real-estate developer from southern California who says Islam is a hateful religion. \\"Islam is a cancer,\\" Bacile told the newspaper. He was speaking after protesters tore down the American flag at the US embassy in Cairo in protest at the film, which earlier was said to have been produced by expatriate members of Egypt's Christian minority resident in the United States. An armed mob also attacked the US consulate in the Libyan city of Benghazi and set fire to the building, killing one American. Bacile told the paper on Tuesday he was responsible for the film, saying he had raised US5 million (A4.81 million) to make it from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he had worked with some 60 actors and 45 crew to make the two-hour movie in a three-month period last year in California. \\"The movie is a political movie. It's not a religious movie,\\" he said. It is being promoted by controversial Florida pastor Terry Jones, who has drawn protests in the past for burning the Koran and vehemently opposing the construction of a mosque near Ground Zero in New York. Jones said he planned to show a 13-minute clip of the film on Tuesday evening at his church in Gainesville, Florida. \\"It is an American production, not designed to attack Muslims but to show the destructive ideology of Islam,\\" he said in a statement cited by the paper. \\"The movie further reveals in a satirical fashion the life of Mohammed.\\" ||||| KABUL Afghanistan banned the YouTube website on Wednesday to stop Afghans watching a U.S.-made film insulting the Prophet Mohammad that sparked protests in North Africa and the killing of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. \\"We have been told to shut down YouTube to the Afghan public until the video is taken down,\\" Aimal Marjan, general director of Information Technology at the Ministry of Communications, told Reuters. Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the film, in which Mohammad is portrayed as a philanderer and a religious fake, saying its makers had done a \\"devilish act\\" and that insulting Islam was not allowed by freedom of speech. U.S. pastor Terry Jones, whose plans to burn the Koran triggered deadly riots in Afghanistan in 2010, said he had promoted the film, called \\"Innocence of Muslims\\". The U.S. ambassador to Libya and three embassy staff were killed as they rushed away from a consulate building in Benghazi, stormed by al Qaeda-linked gunmen. Another assault was mounted on the U.S. embassy in Cairo. Marjan declined to say if the order to close YouTube in Afghanistan was to prevent violence or to protect his countrymen from being offended. The accidental burning of Korans at a U.S. base near Kabul in February drew thousands of protesters to the streets across Afghanistan for weeks and dozens of people were killed.

Some protesters carried swords, axes and black flags. They also used knives to cut posters of Morris Sadek, the Egyptian-born Christian who has promoted the film. They chanted, \\"Shame on everyone who insults the prophet.\\" Hamas, the larger militant group that governs Gaza, also condemned the film. Its religious affairs minister, Ismail Radwan, called it an \\"insult to the millions of Muslims all over the world.\\" THIS IS A BREAKING NEWS UPDATE. Check back soon for further information. AP's earlier story is below. The U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi by protesters angry over a film that ridiculed Islam's Prophet Muhammad. Ambassador Chris Stevens, 52, died as he and a group of embassy employees went to the consulate to try to evacuate staff as the building came under attack by a mob firing machine-guns and rocket-propelled grenades. He was the first U.S. ambassador to be killed in the line of duty since 1979. President Barack Obama ordered increased security to protect American diplomatic personnel around world. \\"I strongly condemn the outrageous attack on our diplomatic facility in Benghazi,\\" Obama said, adding the four Americans \\"exemplified America's commitment to freedom, justice, and partnership with nations and people around the globe.\\" Libya's interim president, Mohammed el-Megarif, apologized to the United States for the attack, which he described as \\"cowardly.\\" Speaking to reporters, he offered his condolences on the death of the four Americans and vowed to bring the culprits to justice and maintain his country's close relations with the United States. The three Americans killed with Stevens were security guards, he said. \\"We extend our apology to America, the American people and the whole world,\\" el-Megarif said. The attack in Libya came hours after Egyptian protesters climbed the walls of the U.S. Embassy in Cairo, pulling down the American flag and temporarily replacing it with a black Islamic banner. The brazen assaults _ the first on U.S. diplomatic facilities in either country _ underscored the lawlessness that has taken hold in both Egypt and Libya after revolutions ousted their autocratic secular regimes and upended the tightly controlled police state in both countries. Islamists, who were long repressed under the previous regimes, have emerged as a powerful force but new governments in both nations are struggling to achieve stability. Egypt's police, a onetime hated force blamed for massive human rights abuses, have yet to fully take back the streets after Hosni Mubarak's ouster in February 2011. On Tuesday, riot police stood by the embassy's walls but continued to allow protesters to climb them for several hours. The protesters, however, appeared to intentionally stick to certain limits: A few entered the embassy grounds to remove the flags and come back, but otherwise the chanting youth stayed on top of the walls without storming the compound or damaging property. The uproar over the film also poses a new test for Egypt's new Islamist president, Mohammed Morsi, who has yet to condemn the riot outside the U.S. Embassy in Cairo or say anything about the offending film. The protest was by mostly ultraconservative Islamists. The film was produced by a California filmmaker who identifies himself as both American and Israeli, though Israeli officials said Wednesday they had no record of him as a citizen. The film was being promoted by an extreme anti-Muslim Egyptian Christian campaigner in the United States. Excerpts from the film dubbed into Arabic were posted on YouTube. The video depicts Muhammad as a fraud, a womanizer and a madman in an overtly ridiculing way, showing him having sex and calling for massacres. Ultraconservative Islamists also were suspected of being behind the Benghazi attack. Advocating a strict interpretation of Islam, they have bulldozed Sufi shrines and mosques that house tombs in the Libyan capital, Tripoli, and other cities, including ancient sites dating back to 5,000 years ago. Heavily armed, ultraconservative groups like Ansar al-Shariah, or Supporters of Shariah, have claimed responsibility for the attacks on the shrines, declaring Sufi practices as \\"heretical.\\" Libya has been also hit by a series of recent attacks that served as evidence of the deep and persistent security vacuum in the country after the fall of Moammar Gadhafi's regime, which was ousted by rebels backed by a NATO air campaign. Many Libyans believe that unrest in their country is in part the work of Gadhafi's loyalists who want to undermine efforts to rebuild the country after last year's ruinous civil war. Stevens was a career diplomat who spoke Arabic and French and had already served two tours in Libya, including running the office in Benghazi during the revolt against Gadhafi. He was confirmed as ambassador to Libya by the Senate earlier this year. Before Tuesday, five U.S. ambassadors had been killed in the line of duty, the last being Adolph Dubs in Afghanistan in 1979, according to the State Department historian's office. The protests were sparked by an obscure, two-hour movie titled \\"Innocence of Muslims,\\" which came to attention in Egypt after its trailer was dubbed into Arabic and posted on YouTube. Sam Bacile, a 56-year-old California real estate developer, said he wrote, produced and directed the movie. Bacile told The Associated Press he was an Israeli Jew and an American citizen. Israeli officials said Wednesday they had not heard of Bacile and there was no record of him being a citizen. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they are not permitted to share personal information with the media. Bacile said he had not anticipated such a furious reaction. Speaking by phone from an undisclosed location, Bacile, who went into hiding Tuesday, remained defiant, saying Islam is a cancer and that he intended his film to be a provocative political statement condemning the religion. Bacile said he believes the movie will help his native land by exposing Islam's flaws to the world. \\"Islam is a cancer, period,\\" he repeatedly said in a solemn, accented tone. Israel, however, sought to distance itself from Bacile. \\"It's obvious we'll have to be vigilant. Anything he did or said has nothing to do whatsoever with Israel. He may claim what he wants. This was not done with or for or through Israel.\\" Foreign Ministry spokesman Yigal Palmor said on Wednesday. __ Michael reported from Cairo. Associated Press writers Matthew Lee in Washington and Joseph Federman in Jerusalem contributed to this report. ||||| Student:","completion":"The film \\"Innocence of Muslims,\\" made by Israeli-American Sam Bacile, caused outrage and protests across the Middle East due to its insulting portrayal of Islam. Bacile, who called Islam a \\"cancer,\\" claimed that ~100 Jewish donors funded the film's 5 million budget. The film stimulated violent responses, with an armed mob attacking a US consulate in Benghazi, leading to the death of a US citizen, and US flags being burned in Afghanistan and Palestine. In response to the film, YouTube was banned in Afghanistan to prevent locals from viewing it. In Libya, the US Ambassador and three other Americans were killed in an attack on the US Consulate in Benghazi by protesters angered by the film. Protests also occurred in Egypt against the film.

Freeze the rhubarb for up to 1 year if you aren’t using it right away. Article:","completion":"Title: How to Store Rhubarb: A Super Easy Guide for Little Helpers Hey kids! Today, we are going to learn about rhubarb and how to store it. Rhubarb is a plant with long, red or green, sour-tasting stalks that we can eat. We can use it to make yummy things like pies, crumbles and jams! But first, we need to know how to keep rhubarb fresh and delicious. Let's learn how together! Step 1: Wrap the Rhubarb First, we need to wrap our rhubarb stalks with something called aluminum foil. Aluminum foil is a shiny, silvery material that we can use to keep our food fresh. Ask your mommy or daddy to help with this part if you need to. Just take a piece of foil and wrap it around the rhubarb stalks, like you're giving them a little blanket. Make sure the foil isn't too tight, so that the rhubarb stalks can breathe a little. Step 2: Put the Wrapped Rhubarb in the Fridge Now that our rhubarb is all wrapped up, it's time to put it away for a little while. We are going to put it in the fridge! The fridge is a big, cold box that helps keep our food from going bad. Just ask your mommy or daddy to help put the wrapped rhubarb in the fridge. Step 3: Wait for 2 to 4 Weeks This is the important part: we have to let our rhubarb rest in the fridge for a little while. Let it stay there for about 2 to 4 weeks to keep it fresh and yummy! Try to be patient, and you can ask your mommy or daddy to help you mark the days on a calendar. But what if we don't want to use our rhubarb right away and want to save it for later? No problem! We can freeze it. Bonus Step: Freeze the Rhubarb If you want to keep your rhubarb for a really long time, like up to a whole year, you can freeze it! To do this, ask your mommy or daddy to help you put the wrapped rhubarb in the freezer. The freezer is also a part of the big, cold box we call the fridge. It's even colder than the fridge part and can keep food safe for a long time. And that's it, little helpers! Now you know how to store rhubarb so it stays fresh and ready for all the tasty treats we can make with it. Good job!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - shed - garage - cutting grass - lawn - neighbor's house Explain why a human would choose \\"neighbor's house\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"neighbor's house\\" to answer the question above for several reasons. The query specifically mentions that the sound of the lawnmower is coming from \\"across the street,\\" which implies that the source of the noise is at a different location than where the individual asking the question is currently positioned. By deducing from this information and analyzing the options given, one can arrive at the conclusion that the lawnmower is indeed at the neighbor's house. Below is a detailed breakdown of why a human would eliminate the other options and ultimately choose \\"neighbor's house\\" as the correct answer: 1. Shed: While a shed is indeed a plausible storage location for a lawnmower, the question states that the individual can hear the lawnmower, implying that it is currently in use. If the lawnmower were in the shed, it would likely not be running, and hence would not make noise. 2. Garage: Similar to the reasoning given for the shed option, a garage is also considered a storage space for a lawnmower. However, once again, since the lawnmower is being heard in action, it would not be reasonable to assume that it is stored in a garage at the time of the question. 3. Cutting grass: This option attempts to describe the action that the lawnmower is performing rather than specifying its location. While it suggests that the lawnmower is actively being used to cut grass, it does not provide a concrete answer to the question’s focus, which is the whereabouts of the lawnmower. 4. Lawn: The word \\"lawn\\" typically refers to the area of grass surrounding a house. Although it is likely that the lawnmower would be located on a lawn while in use, the question emphasizes that it is \\"across the street.\\" This piece of information suggests that it is not on the questioner's own lawn but on someone else's property. When evaluating all of the options given, the most logical answer for a human to choose would be \\"neighbor's house.\\" This is because it takes into account the specific details mentioned in the question, such as the sound of the lawnmower and its origin from across the street. Additionally, it eliminates the options that primarily serve as storage options or do not sufficiently address the query's concern about the location. Thus, by a process of elimination and contextual analysis, a human would conclude that the lawnmower is at the neighbor's house."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sylvia Plath (; October 27, 1932 - February 11, 1963) was an American poet, novelist, and short-story writer. Born in Boston, she studied at Smith College and Newnham College at the University of Cambridge before receiving acclaim as a poet and writer. She married fellow poet Ted Hughes in 1956, and they lived together in the United States and then in England. They had two children, Frieda and Nicholas, before separating in 1962. As Hughes and Plath were legally married at the time of her death, Hughes inherited the Plath estate, including all her written work. Hughes has been condemned repeatedly for burning Plath's last journal, saying he \\"did not want her children to have to read it.\\" He lost another journal and an unfinished novel and instructed that a collection of Plath's papers and journals should not be released until 2013. Hughes has been accused of attempting to control the estate for his own ends, although royalties from Plath's poetry were placed into a trust account for their two children, Frieda and Nicholas. Still the subject of speculation and opprobrium in 1998, Hughes published Birthday Letters that year, his own collection of 88 poems about his relationship with Plath. Hughes had published very little about his experience of the marriage and Plath's subsequent suicide, and the book caused a sensation, being taken as his first explicit disclosure, and it topped best seller charts. It was not known at the volume's release that Hughes was suffering from terminal cancer and would die later that year. The book went on to win the Forward Poetry Prize, the T. S. Eliot Prize for Poetry, and the Whitbread Poetry Prize. The poems, written after Plath's death, in some cases long after, try to find a reason why Plath took her own life. In October 2015 the BBC Two documentary Ted Hughes: Stronger Than Death examined Hughes' life and work and included audio recordings of Plath reciting her own poetry. Their daughter Frieda spoke for the first time about her mother and father. In 2017 it was revealed that letters written by Plath between February 18, 1960 and February 4, 1963 claim that Hughes beat Plath two days before she had a miscarriage in 1961, and that Hughes told Plath he wished that she was dead. The letters were sent to Dr. Ruth Barnhouse (then Dr. Ruth Beuscher).

Well, more often than not, you'd be wrong. A few years ago, an experiment was done on an evening news show on WNBC in prefix = st1 /New York. Viewers were shown a film of what seemed to be a mugging. In this simulation, a man snatched a woman's purse. He then knocked her down and ran face forward at the camera so that the viewers got a good look at him. Viewers were then shown a lineup of six men. They were asked to decide if the mugger was in the lineup and, if so, to tell which one he was. In effect, then, they had seven choices. The suspect was either one of the six or he wasn't even in the lineup. Of the 2,145 people who called up to respond, 1,843 were wrong. That means about one in seven was right.

Write an article based on this summary: – Cambodia thought it had a handle on its scarcity of iodine, an element critical for humans (and one not made naturally by the body) to make thyroid hormone. The country had long struggled with the lack of iodine in its soil, which at one point in the late 1990s resulted in goiters in 17% of its population, per UNICEF. The solution: iodizing table salt, a cheap way to boost citizens' iodine intake. But as the New York Times reports, national efforts to iodize table salt started disintegrating in 2010, and in 2011 a major event happened more than 2,600 miles away that had unexpected consequences for the country's iodine deficiency dilemma: the Japanese earthquake and tsunami, which caused once-affordable iodine to spike in price globally and decimate specifically Cambodia's salt industry. The iodizing initiative had already started to erode before 2011, as the government and salt producers let things fall through the cracks. After the tsunami, things worsened: There was already a dearth of iodine due to the 2008 recession, and the natural disaster in Japan, which produces about a third of the world's iodine, exacerbated it. Add cheaper, non-iodized Vietnamese salt in, as well as the fact that iodine was being scooped up by higher-paying parties such as pharmaceutical firms, and iodized salt in Cambodia fell by the wayside. Now suffering the effects: the country's kids, 2,300 of whom, when tested in 2014, showed a 30% drop of iodine levels in urine compared to 2011. Iodine Global Network Director Jonathan Gorstein tells the Times efforts must be taken anew to halt the deficiency and the \\"pattern in which success leads to backsliding.\\" (Iodine deficiency in pregnancy can lower a baby's IQ.) Article:","completion":"Title: The Unintended Consequences of the Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami on Cambodia's Iodine Crisis Introduction: Iodine is essential for humans to make thyroid hormones, yet it cannot be produced naturally by the body. In Cambodia, a lack of iodine in the soil has long led to various health issues, including widespread goiters affecting up to 17% of the population in the late 1990s. While a solution emerged in the form of iodized table salt, events in 2011 more than 2,600 miles away disrupted its success, as the iodizing initiative disintegrated and iodine prices soared globally. The Iodizing Initiative: UNICEF spearheaded efforts for the introduction of iodizing table salt in Cambodia as a cheap means to increase citizens' iodine intake. Initially, the program enjoyed success, with wide distribution and significant improvements in population health. However, starting in 2010, the government and salt producers began to lose focus on the iodizing initiative, allowing issues to go unaddressed. The Japanese Earthquake and Tsunami: Japan, being responsible for producing one-third of the world's iodine, experienced a major disaster in 2011 – the earthquake and tsunami. This natural catastrophe led to a global spike in iodine prices, crippling Cambodia's salt industry. Additionally, the 2008 recession had already caused the world to experience a scarcity of iodine, and this crisis only escalated after the Japanese tragedy. Exacerbating Factors: As iodine prices surged, competing interests, including pharmaceutical companies, began to secure the resources, further squeezing Cambodia's access to iodine for their iodized salt project. To compound the problem, non-iodized, cheaper Vietnamese salt flooded the market, making it difficult for iodized salt to maintain its presence in Cambodia. Impact on Children: The effects of iodine deficiency are now visible among Cambodia's children. According to tests conducted in 2014 on 2,300 children, there has been a 30% drop in iodine levels in their urine compared to 2011. The Iodine Global Network Director, Jonathan Gorstein, warns that urgent measures must be taken to halt iodine deficiency and avoid \\"success leading to backsliding.\\" Iodine deficiency during pregnancy can lead to lowered IQ in babies. Conclusion: The iodine crisis in Cambodia is a complex issue with numerous contributing factors, including global events that have had unexpected consequences on the country's progress in tackling iodine deficiency. As the struggle to maintain iodized salt in the market continues, it is crucial for the government and international organizations to refocus their efforts and find a sustainable solution for the well-being of Cambodia's children and future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Joseph had to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes, because Available choices: a. Joseph was playing in the mud.. b. Benjamin was playing in the mud..","completion":"Benjamin was playing in the mud. Children often enjoy the simple pleasures of life that adults often overlook or simply disregard due to the complications they often bring. One of these simple pleasures is running amok in the great outdoors after a rain shower, when the ground is ripe and wet, and little puddles of water form on every depression on the terrain. Benjamin, just like any other child his age, had recently discovered this muddy haven and the adventures it had to offer. Every other day, when the sky was pouring, and most parents would keep their children indoors out of fear they'd catch a cold, Benjamin's house was different. His parents, who believed in the joy and learning that nature exploration could bring, allowed him to go out and experience the world, even in its messiest forms. Therefore, on a Saturday morning, when it had been raining cats and dogs the night before, Benjamin woke up eager and enthusiastic, looking forward to splashing through the accumulated showers and playing in the mud puddles. Donned in his favorite pair of boots, Benjamin made his way outside. The fresh smell of rain and earth filling his lungs, he started to run and jump around, splashing in puddles and rolling in the mud. His laughter echoing through the quiet Saturday morning, as he sculpted the mud into whatever his creative mind could conjure up. By the afternoon, however, his clothes were soiled with mud stains. His shirt, once a vibrant red, was now a dull brown, his shorts had patterns that made him look like a miniature soldier in camouflage, and his boots painted with splatters of mud. And as much as he enjoyed being in the mud, the cleanup afterwards was a task his mother staunchly refused to do stating the muddy clothes were a result of his adventure and he should take responsibility for them. This is where Benjamin relied on his older brother, Joseph, to help him out. Seeing his younger brother, wide-eyed and hoping he'd help, Joseph couldn't resist but assist him with his muddy dilemma. Joseph needed to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes because detergent and cold water just wouldn't do the trick. Boiling hot water was needed to break down the grime and muddy streaks that had encrusted his younger brother's clothes. Joseph filled up a large pot with water and set it to boil on the stove. While they waited for the water to heat up, they separated Benjamin's clothes into small piles based on color. Once the water began bubbling, he carefully submerged Benjamin’s clothes into the pot, taking care not to scorch himself with the hot water. He added a generous amount of soap to ensure a deep clean and stirred the clothes gently with a wooden stick. As Joseph cleaned the clothes, Benjamin sat by his side. Seeing his older brother doing his part made Benjamin realize that play and fun were enjoyable, but they also came with responsibilities all their own. This muddy adventure, thus, was not just a day of fun for Benjamin but was also a day of learning about responsibility and consequences of actions. His brother had managed to make the chore fun, teaching and guiding him, strengthening their bond, through something as simple as cleaning his soiled clothes. The day ended not with the setting sun or clean clothes hanging to dry, but two brothers smiling and laughing together, a bond strengthened, and a lesson well-learnt. So, Joseph had to boil some water to clean Benjamin's soiled clothes, not only because Benjamin was playing in the mud, but also because this simple act had greater lessons to teach about responsibility, consequences, and the bond of brotherhood."},{"prompt":"Information: - Manchester is a major city and metropolitan borough in Greater Manchester, England, with a population of 514,414 .

De Ruyter was born on 24 March 1607 in Vlissingen, Netherlands, as the son of beer porter Adriaen Michielszoon and Aagje Jansdochter. Little is known about De Ruyter's early life, but he probably became a sailor at the age of 11. It is said that once, when he was a child, he climbed up ladders to get to the roof of his home town's church. Not knowing that De Ruyter was there, some workers then removed the ladders. In July 1655, De Ruyter took command of a squadron of eight (of which the Tijdverdrijf [Pastime] was his flagship) and set out for the Mediterranean with 55 merchantmen in convoy. His orders were to protect Dutch trade. Meeting an English fleet under Robert Blake along the way, he managed to avoid an incident. Operating off the Barbary Coast, he captured several infamous corsairs. After negotiating a peace agreement with Sale, De Ruyter returned home May 1656. The same month, the States General, becoming ever more wary of Swedish King Charles X and his expansion plans, decided to intervene in the Northern Wars by sending a fleet to the Baltic Sea. The Swedes controlled this area after Charles had invaded Poland and made himself king there. De Ruyter once again embarked aboard the Tijdverdrijf, arriving at the Oresund 8 June; there he waited for Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam to arrive. After Obdam had assumed command, De Ruyter and the Dutch fleet sailed to relieve the besieged city of Danzig/Gdansk on 27 July, without any bloodshed. Peace was signed a month later. Before leaving the Baltic, De Ruyter and other flag officers were granted an audience by Frederick III of Denmark. De Ruyter took a liking to the Danish king, who later became a friend. In 1658, the States General, on the advice of a leading member (Cornelis de Graeff, one of the mayors of Amsterdam), decided to once again send a fleet to the Baltic Sea to protect the important Baltic trade and to aid the Danes against Swedish aggression, which continued despite a peace settlement. In accordance with the States' balance-of-power political approach, a fleet under Lieutenant-Admiral Jacob van Wassenaer Obdam was sent, without De Ruyter, who at the time was blockading Lisbon. On 8 November, a bloody melee took place, the Battle of the Sound, which resulted in a Dutch victory, relieving Copenhagen. Still the Swedes were far from defeated and the States decided to continue their support. De Ruyter took command of a new expeditionary fleet and managed to liberate Nyborg in 1659. For this, he was knighted by King Frederick III of Denmark From 1661 until 1663, de Ruyter did convoy duty in the Mediterranean.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension","completion":"The phrase \\"maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension\\" would generally be considered negative due to several factors in the phrasing and the sentiment conveyed. To dissect this phrase, let's break it down into its primary components and analyze their meanings: 1. Maintaining consciousness - The process of holding onto awareness, staying conscious, or staying awake. On its own, this might be viewed neutrally, but it suggests some effort or struggle. 2. Just long enough - This implies that the consciousness is being held onto for the bare minimum amount of time required to perform a particular act. It suggests that the individual is not interested or motivated to be engaged any longer than necessary. This can impart a negative tone. 3. Achieve - While this word can have a positive connotation, as it often refers to accomplishment or the attainment of a goal, it depends on the context and the object of achievement. In this case, the goal itself may not be desirable (as described below). 4. Callow - An adjective referring to someone being inexperienced, immature, or lacking sophistication. This is generally a negative term, as it underscores a lack of growth or maturity and may imply naivety or superficiality in the individual. 5. Pretension - A noun that represents the act of pretending to have a greater importance, intellect, or skill than one actually possesses, often accompanied by a desire to appear more impressive to others. Pretension is generally viewed negatively, as it denotes a falsity or a lack of authenticity and can be seen as an attempt to manipulate perceptions. By combining these elements, the phrase \\"maintaining consciousness just long enough to achieve callow pretension\\" suggests that the individual, possibly reluctantly or unenthusiastically, puts forth just enough effort to appear superficially knowledgeable or sophisticated. This deceptive action further emphasizes their immaturity or lack of experience, making the overall sentiment of the phrase negative. In conclusion, the given phrase would likely be considered negative by most as it portrays the individual in a less-than-admirable light while highlighting their effort to project a facade of sophistication that they may not have yet earned or developed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A glacier slide inside a cavernous ice mountain sends its three characters whoosh down a never-ending wet-slide tube that has enough kick to dazzle kids the same way mature audience may be dazzled by the star gate sequence that closes 2001: A Space Odyssey. Miles apart in vision, but it is a scene of great rush and excitement nonetheless. A magnificent opening sequence also takes place where a furry squirrel-like critter attempts to hide his precious acorn. You've probably seen this scene in the trailer, but as it takes place he starts a domino effect when the mountain starts cracking and, results, an avalanche. The horror just keeps going as the critter tries to outrun the impossible. The movie traces two characters, a mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano) and a buck-toothed sloth (John Leguizamo) as they try to migrate south. They find a human baby they adopt and then decide to track the parent figures down to return to them. They are joined by a saber tiger named Diego (Denis Leary) whose predatory intentions is to bring the baby to his tiger clan, by leading the mammoth and the sloth into a trap. Diego's meat-eating family wants the mammoth most of all, but Diego's learned values of friendship make easy what choice to ultimately make at the end. There are fatalistic natural dangers of the world along the trip, including an erupted volcano and a glacier bridge that threatens to melt momentarily that is reminiscent of the castle escape in Shrek.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought. and a hint : One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. Please answer this question : Which region had fewer plants with an ability to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss? Answer:","completion":"The region with fewer plants having an ability to come up with a strategy to minimize water loss would be the eastern region of Austria, which is exposed to a wet climate and has thriving vegetation. This is because the plants in this region have not experienced the same selective pressures for drought adaptation as those in the western region, which has been exposed to drought. The study by Tombesi et al. revealed that plants that have been consistently exposed to drought are able to develop a \\"memory\\" that allows them to adapt their strategies to minimize water loss and improve their overall survival in water-scarce environments. These adaptations include changes in the regulation of their stomata and the hydraulic safety margin. Stomata are tiny pores on a plant's leaves that are responsible for gas exchange necessary for photosynthesis and respiration. The opening and closing of these pores can regulate transpiration, the process of water evaporating from the plant's leaves, and thus manage the plant's overall water usage. In the western region of Austria, where plants experience a drier climate and drought conditions, they would have undergone selective pressures in order to develop and maintain these water-saving adaptations, including changes in stomatal regulation and transpiration rate. This allows them to be more efficient in water usage and better survive in less-than-ideal environmental conditions. On the contrary, plants in the eastern region, where a wetter climate prevails, would not have encountered the same selective pressures for drought survival. As a result, they are less likely to have developed such adaptive strategies for minimizing water loss and using water efficiently. Consequently, the eastern region of Austria has fewer plants with the ability to come up with strategies to minimize water loss as compared to the western region, which is more prone to drought."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate. - The Folketing (; lit. \\"the people's thing\\"), also known as the Danish Parliament in English, is the unicameral national parliament (legislature) of the Kingdom of Denmark. Established in 1849, until 1953 the Folketing was the lower house of a bicameral parliament, called the Rigsdag; the upper house was the Landsting. It meets in Christiansborg Palace, on the islet of Slotsholmen in central Copenhagen. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - General elections were held in Denmark on 10 January 1984 , after the opposition voted against the government 's state budget bill . Although the Social Democratic Party remained the largest in the Folketing with 56 of the 179 seats , the Conservative People 's Party achieved its best - ever result , gaining 16 seats . The coalition partners Venstre and the Christian People 's Party also increased their representation , although the fourth government party , the Centre Democrats , lost seven of their 15 seats . Overall the coalition won three more seats , and Poul Schlüter continued as Prime Minister Voter turnout was 88.4 % in Denmark proper , 61.0 % in the Faroe Islands and 63.9 % in Greenland . - Poul Holmskov Schlüter (3 April 1929) is a Danish politician, who served as Prime Minister of Denmark from 1982 to 1993. He was the first member of the Conservative People's Party to become Prime Minister, as well as the first conservative to hold the office since 1901. - The Prime Minister of Denmark (literally \\"Minister of State\\") is the head of government in the Kingdom of Denmark. Before the creation of the modern office, Denmark did not initially have a head of government separate from its head of state, namely the Monarch, in whom the executive authority was vested. The Constitution of 1849 established a constitutional monarchy by limiting the powers of the Monarch and creating the office of . The inaugural holder of the office was Adam Wilhelm Moltke. What is the relationship between 'danish general election' and 'prime minister of denmark'? Answer:","completion":"The relationship between the 'Danish general election' and the 'Prime Minister of Denmark' is that the general election is a democratic process in which the citizens of Denmark vote to elect members of the Danish Parliament (Folketing). Based on the outcome of the general election, a Prime Minister is then appointed as the head of the government in the Kingdom of Denmark. In the context provided, the 1984 Danish general election resulted in the Social Democratic Party remaining the largest party in the Folketing, but the Conservative People's Party, led by Poul Schlüter, gained significant seats. The coalition, including Schlüter's party, won additional seats, allowing Poul Schlüter to continue as the Prime Minister of Denmark.

September 25, 2011 at Paul Brown Stadium, Cincinnati, Ohio (Blacked Out) Playing versus the San Francisco 49ers for the first time since 2003, the Bengals lost 13-8 with the smallest crowd for a Bengals home opener since 1981. Before the game, the team activated Simpson, who was previously injured. The only score in the first half was when Nugent kicked a 22-yard field goal in the first quarter. It took until 3 minutes left in the third quarter for another score, when 49ers' kicker David Akers tied the game with a field goal. The Bengals' final possession ended when 49ers' Reggie Smith intercepted Dalton's pass with 1:45 left in the game. It was Dalton's first performance where his passer rating was below 100; this game he completed 17 of 32 passes for 157 yards and a rating of 40.8.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who left his skeleton in his will for the Grainger Museum?, using the article: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days.

Input: Abstract: Heart Failure (HF) is a common disorder associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. beta adrenergic receptors (betaAR) are the primary pathway through which cardiac function is influenced. Chronic beta(1)AR activation is implicated in the pathogenesis of HF and betaAR blockade improves survival in left ventricular systolic dysfunction. Common functional polymorphisms in beta adrenergic receptor genes (ADRB) have been associated with HF phenotypes, and with pharmacogenetic interaction with beta adrenergic receptor blockers (beta blockers). However, these associations have not been consistently replicated. The evidence for ADRB variant involvement in pathogenesis, progression and response to beta blockers in HF is reviewed. In addition, a meta-analysis of three studies analysing the effect of ADRB1 Arg389Gly polymorphism on left ventricular remodelling with the use of beta blockers, demonstrating a 5% improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction in Arg389 homozygotes, is presented. There is now accumulating molecular evidence for a different functional response to beta blockers associated with this polymorphism. In the future, confirmed genotypic associations may enable patients to be identified who are either at greater risk of developing HF, whose HF may rapidly progress, or who are unlikely to benefit from beta blockers, and such patients may benefit from targeted aggressive therapy..

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided consists of specific information about Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport. This airport, which is located in the municipality of Paracuellos de Jarama, has an elevation of 610.0 meters above sea level. In order to better understand this data, let's break down each component: 1. Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport: This is the primary international airport serving Madrid, Spain. Its four passenger terminals cover a total area of approximately 3,050 hectares (12 square miles), making it the largest airport in Europe in terms of physical size. 2. Location (Paracuellos de Jarama): Paracuellos de Jarama is a municipality situated in the region of Madrid. Specifically, it is located northeast of the metropolitan area. The proximity of Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport to the city makes it easily accessible for travelers seeking to visit or depart from Madrid. The airport also serves as a major hub for both Spanish and international airlines, connecting passengers worldwide. 3. ElevationAboveTheSeaLevel (610.0 meters): The elevation of Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport is 610 meters (2,001 feet) above sea level. This value is an important consideration for pilots and air traffic controllers, as higher altitudes can have an impact on aircraft performance and weather conditions. However, considering that the global average elevation of airports is approximately 1,334 feet, Madrid-Barajas's elevation is relatively moderate and should not lead to significant operational challenges. In summary, the data provided describes Adolfo Suárez Madrid–Barajas Airport, a prominent international airport in Spain. Situated within the municipality of Paracuellos de Jarama and easily accessible from the city of Madrid, it serves as a crucial hub for both domestic and international travel.

Paragraph: The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery. Yes, said Richard Brilla, director of the new facility, \\"but the donuts are a lot more costly here.\\" Each wafer, holding hundreds of chips, is worth 6,000 to 10,000 apiece, depending on what insulation, circuitry and materials are used.

As stated above, epoxy is the strongest bonding agent you can use. Also, you want to make sure you have plenty of pasta on-hand to make the necessary reinforcements to your bridge. Consider the benefits and disadvantages of various types of pasta.Rounded spaghetti noodles may be better for some parts of your bridge while flattened noodles, like linguine, may be better for other parts. The purpose of building a spaghetti bridge is to apply the theoretical principles of engineering to a real-life construction project. As such, how you design the bridge deeply impacts the overall strength of the bridge. Some tips for building a stronger bridge include: Use triangular rather than rectangular trusses. Build the roadbed with multiple layers of pasta. You should leave the middle layer of your pasta roadbed unglued. Some flexibility in the pasta helps to redistribute weight across your bridge. The longer the gap a bridge has to span, the harder it will be to redistribute the weight from one area across the entire bridge. So, if it is up to you, making a shorter bridge will help your bridge sustain more weight. There is a relationship between the weight and strength of your bridge. Adding more pasta to your bridge during construction, when properly built, should add strength, but also adds more weight. The heavier your bridge is, the more likely it is that it will collapse when extra weight is applied. So, make sure you account for the weight of your bridge when designing your bridge. Summary:","completion":"To make a strong bridge with pasta, we need to use the best materials like epoxy and different types of pasta. Building a spaghetti bridge helps us learn about real-life construction. To make our bridge stronger, we can use triangle shapes, different layers of pasta, and make it shorter if we can. But we should remember, adding more pasta makes the bridge heavy, which may make it break when we put more weight on it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective.

I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are now classified as\\"investments\\" . A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS350, 000, while the 1960s Rolexes have gone from PS15, 000 to PS30, 000 plus in a year.

Given the question: Information: - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489). - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current. - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack. - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others . - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\".

His characters are well developed, and his plots draw you in and, before you know it, you're hooked. Although I don't play golf (and am abysmal even at miniature golf), I decided to read this book simply because I love Merullo's ability to weave a good tale. While there is unquestionably a lot of golf lingo in the book, I either asked people in the know what the terms meant, or I let the words just fly over my head and focused on the general storyline instead. So, despite golf being the primary focus of the book, I enjoyed the characters and the tale (almost) as much as the other Merullo books I've read.

Newly spotlighted is the reprobate incident wherein hackers targeted Milly Dowler, a murdered girl. The event has been labeled as a \\"cowardly and shocking\\" offense by outraged spokesperson Grant. Milly Dowler, tragically taken before her prime, faced more than just a physical intrusion. In an act disturbingly void of conscience, journalists managed to hack into her phone even before her body was discovered. The digital invasion not only stung her memory but also brings forth a critical perspective on the ethics in media. Reported by Milly Dowler's mother and still trembling with grief, the incident had given her a false glimmer of hope as she narrated. The emotional strain and psychological torment she faced, compounded by the hacking into her daughter's phone, underline the harm inflicted by such acts well beyond the cyber realm. However, the scope of this act extends beyond merely a single isolated incident. Police investigations revealed a chilling reality. It was reported that up to 5,800 people were potential victims of phone hacking.

With a shy and introverted personality, Robert struggled to connect with his peers and make new friends. He also had a difficult time grasping certain subjects, which caused him to feel overwhelmed and discouraged. Step 3: Contrast Robert's experience to Craig's by pointing out his struggles and challenges.

These activities allowed him to build a strong network of friends and develop leadership skills. Step 4: Provide examples of Craig's positive school experience and achievements. Robert, however, often felt lost and invisible in the bustling hallways and classrooms. While he excelled in areas such as art and music, the academic pressure and social demands of the school system made him question his own abilities and value. His self-esteem plummeted as he tried to navigate a world that seemed designed for extroverted learners like Craig.

At a New Hampshire forum last month he conceded \\"it's not perfect,\\" but that it was better than Obama's \\"one-size-fits-all plan.\\"Both plans include a mandate that citizens purchase health insurance, something derided by the conservative activists who will dominate GOP nominating contests.

Romney is planning to outline his plan to repeal President Obama’s health care plan and replace it with something else. The address will be given in Ann Arbor, Mich., at the University of Michigan’s Cardiovascular Center. It will be Romney’s first major policy speech, and comes amid increasing activity in his campaign. Over the next few weeks, he is also planning to travel to Las Vegas to raise money, as well as to two early primary states, Iowa and South Carolina. Health care has been the primary problem for Romney’s early campaign, and even his supporters have said they wanted him to address it in a prominent way. His speech on Thursday will be aimed at both winning over his critics and bolstering his supporters. The health care plan that Romney signed as governor of Massachusetts has provided a template for the national plan signed by President Obama last year. With Republicans focused on attacking Obama’s plan, many have raised questions over whether Romney would be the right advocate for their party. Romney has defended the Bay State plan, while saying he would repeal Obama’s national overhaul, saying it unfairly mandates a one-size-fits-all system on each state. His campaign today provided a brief outline of his health care approach, including: • Restore to the states the responsibility and resources to care for their poor, uninsured, and chronically ill. • Give a tax deduction to those who buy their own health insurance, just like those who buy it through their employers. • Streamline the federal regulation of healthcare. • Reduce the influence of lawsuits on medical practice and costs. • Make healthcare more like a consumer market and less like a government program.

Help as much as you can. Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Owls are some of the world's greatest hunters. From head to feet, owls' bodies are built to hunt. Scientists are studying all the things that make owls such great hunters. Most owls hunt at night. The birds have excellent hearing, which helps them find their next meal in the dark. Owls have one ear that is larger and set higher than the other. When an owl hears a sound, it listens closely. Is the sound lounder in its right ear or left ear? Does the upper or lower ear detect the sound first? The information helps the owl find the location of its prey without ever seeing it. Owls don't depend just on their hearing to hunt. After a sound draws an owl's attention, it zeroes in with sight. Many birds have eyes on either side of their heads. But an owl's eyes face forward, like a person's. Images from each eye combine to form a 3-D picture, similar to how we see. That helps owls better judge a prey's size, distance, and speed. An owl's eyes are so large that they can gather lots of light. That helps the owl see better when hunting at night. An owl's eyes are also fixed in their sockets . It can't roll them like we can. Instead, an owl keeps prey in its sight by turning its head. Owls can move their beads nearly upside down and turn them 270 degrees around. Their necks have 14 vertebrae . That's twice as many neck bones as a person has. The blood vessels thread through holes in an owl's vertebrae. The researchers found that these holes are very large so that the extra space provides an air cushion that protects the vessels. Detecting prey is only the first step for owls. Next they must catch their meals. An owl can fly inches over your head and you can't hear anything. The secret to owls' silent flight is their feathers. Fine \\"hairs\\" cover the surface of an owl's wing feathers. And the feathers' edges have soft barbs . Together, they make the sound of air rushing over the owl's wings quieter and less clear.
