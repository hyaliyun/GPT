Clearance 'will not be before Monday' the council confirmed tonight.","completion":"Title: Travellers' Appeal Facing Eviction, Legal Battle to Top £18m Introduction: In an ongoing legal battle, travellers from the disputed site have vowed to appeal again and cannot be evicted until Monday at the earliest. Despite the recent decision to uphold their eviction, the determined travellers are not ready to give up their fight to stay on the land they have occupied for many years. 1. Three Linked Appeals Against Eviction Fail After Judicial Review The legal battle over the right of the travellers to remain at the site took a negative turn as three linked appeals against eviction failed to sway the court's opinion. A judicial review of the case found that the decision to evict the travellers remains valid, leaving the occupants scrambling for new ways to defend their position. 2. Legal Battle Estimated to Top £18m Including Huge Bill for Basildon Council Though the case may seem relatively straightforward, the entire legal battle is estimated to reach a staggering £18m, which includes a significant financial burden for Basildon Council. As the municipality struggles to keep up with the rising costs of the dispute, there is the danger that citizens will feel the impact in reduced services or increased taxes to cover the costs. 3. Judge: 'The Criminal Law Applies Equally to All - Travellers and Others Alike' In delivering the ruling, Mr Justice Ouseley reminded all parties involved that the rule of law should be applied equally to everyone, regardless of their background or lifestyle. This position underscores the importance of maintaining a fair and unbiased legal system that protects the rights of all its citizens. 4. Ruling by Mr Justice Ouseley Lasts More Than Three Hours It was clear that the judge carefully considered the details of the case, as his ruling spanned over three hours in length. In this time, Mr Justice Ouseley examined the nuances of the situation and emphasized the necessity of following established legal procedures. 5. Clearance 'Will Not Be Before Monday' the Council Confirmed Tonight In a statement released by Basildon Council, it was confirmed that the earliest date for the clearance of the site would be on Monday. This provides a brief respite for the travellers as they prepare to make yet another appeal in their ongoing battle against eviction. Conclusion: With the appeals failing to reverse the decision, and eviction looming on the horizon, the travellers' determination to fight against their removal remains stronger than ever. As the legal battle continues to escalate, not only are the travellers at risk of being displaced, but the mounting costs to taxpayers should not be overlooked."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The ship, named for Archduchess Stephanie, Crown Princess of Austria, was laid down in November 1884, was launched in April 1887 and completed in July 1889. She was armed with a pair of guns in open barbettes and had a top speed of . Her service was limited, in large part due to the rapid pace of naval development in the 1890s, which quickly rendered her obsolescent. As a result, her career was generally limited to routine training and the occasional visit to foreign countries. In 1897, she took part in an international naval demonstration to force a compromise over Greek and Ottoman claims to the island of Crete. Kronprinzessin Erzherzogin Stephanie was decommissioned in 1905, hulked in 1910, and converted into a barracks ship in 1914.

However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \\"Code Red\\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer. Kaffee has a reputation for arranging plea bargains and has never even argued a case in a court room, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball.

Q:Given the below context: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home. Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

The University of Manchester, Manchester Metropolitan University and Royal Northern College of Music. The University of Manchester is the largest full-time non-collegiate university in the United Kingdom and was created in 2004 by the merger of Victoria University of Manchester founded in 1904 and UMIST, founded in 1956, though the university's logo appears to claim it was established in 1824. It includes the Manchester Business School, which offered the first MBA course in the UK in 1965. Manchester Metropolitan University was formed as Manchester Polytechnic on the merger of three colleges in 1970. It gained university status in 1992, and in the same year absorbed Crewe and Alsager College of Higher Education in South Cheshire. The University of Law, the largest provider of vocation legal training in Europe, has a campus in the city.The three Universities are grouped around Oxford Road on the southern side of the city centre, which forms Europe's largest urban higher education precinct. Together they have a combined population of 76,025 students in higher education as of 2015, although almost 6,000 of them were based at Manchester Metropolitan University's campuses at Crewe and Alsager in Cheshire.One of Manchester's most notable secondary schools is the Manchester Grammar School. Established in 1515, as a free grammar school next to what is now the Cathedral, it moved in 1931 to Old Hall Lane in Fallowfield, south Manchester, to accommodate the growing student body. In the post-war period, it was a direct grant grammar school (i.e. partially state funded), but it reverted to independent status in 1976 after abolition of the direct-grant system. Its previous premises are now used by Chetham's School of Music. There are three schools nearby: William Hulme's Grammar School, Withington Girls' School and Manchester High School for Girls.

Evolutionary anthropology is based in natural science and social science, combining the human development with socioeconomic factors. Evolutionary anthropology is concerned with both biological and cultural evolution of humans, past and present. It is based on a scientific approach, and brings together fields such as archaeology, behavioral ecology, psychology, primatology, and genetics. It is a dynamic and interdisciplinary field, drawing on many lines of evidence to understand the human experience, past and present.

This includes the study of our human ancestors, known as hominins, as well as modern humans, Homo sapiens. The field aims to understand the complex interplay between biology, culture, and the environment that has led to the development of human societies throughout history. By examining various aspects of human existence, such as genetics, morphology, behavior, and cultural practices, evolutionary anthropology seeks to unravel the patterns and processes underlying human evolution and diversification. Ultimately, this comprehensive approach allows researchers to gain a more nuanced understanding of what it means to be human and how our species has adapted to different circumstances throughout our evolutionary history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: President Donald Trump suffered a political setback Tuesday when Democrats won easy victories in governor's races in Virginia and New Jersey. In addition, Democrats cheered a turnout that could have major implications for next year's congressional midterm elections, when all 435 House seats and one-third of the Senate will be on the ballot. Democrats are pointing to exit polls in both Virginia and New Jersey that showed that anger at Trump was a major factor in stimulating Democrats to get to the polls. They also note Democratic gains in the battle for state delegate seats in Virginia, another sign of grass-roots enthusiasm that could help Democrats in races for lower-level offices across the country. In New Jersey, Governor-elect Phil Murphy, a Democrat, saw his election as a direct rebuke of the Republican president. \\"New Jersey sent an unmistakable message to the entire nation. We are better than this!\\" Murphy told cheering supporters at his victory rally. In Virginia, Democrat Ralph Northam defeated Republican Ed Gillespie in a campaign that focused, in part, on Trump and his policies, especially on immigration. At a news conference Wednesday, Northam said his victory showed that Virginians had a message for the country and the world. \\"The divisiveness, the hatred, the bigotry, the politics that is tearing this country apart, that is not the United States of America that people love and it certainly not the Commonwealth of Virginia that they love,\\" he said. Political analysts said Democratic enthusiasm and a focus on Trump were clearly on display in both states. \\"We have heard for months and months about all this energy on the left. It had not materialized until tonight,\\" said Steve Peoples of the Associated Press. \\"A big night for Democrats and, really, it was a repudiation of sorts of the Trump nationalist message.\\" Even some Republicans saw the results as a rejection of the Trump political brand.

And in ancient Egyptian fairy tales, the hippo was a goddess that guided the dead to the afterworld. Despite their popular appeal, hippos, as well as other animals, have difficulty when their needs conflict with those of humans. The early Egyptians liked to hunt hippos for their teeth and because they were dangerous animals. Amulets to protect babies from demons were made from hippo bones. About 4,000 years ago, there were so many hippos in Egypt that they caused serious crop damage. Egyptian farmers killed them routinely, and by the beginning of the 19th century, all the hippos in Africa had been killed. People used to see hippos fight in the arenas of ancient Rome. After the fall of the Roman Empire, hippos weren't seen in Europe again until a few zoos began to exhibit them in the mid 1800s. All the various uses and abuses of hippos through the centuries have made their population fall greatly. Where they do occur, mostly in national parks, they live in such high density that they make the grasslands bare. This causes other grass-eating animals to go farther for food, and hippos, which can't live far from water, destroy their own feeding grounds.

Much action recently has focused in and around the key northern city of Konna, which insurgents took on Thursday only to retreat the following day after a combined air and ground assault. \\" OPTIONS: - Bamako, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - CNN, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - France, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - French, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Islamist, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Konna, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Mali, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - Malian, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - West African, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. - al Qaeda, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the passage, the most accurate option to choose is: - France, in this operation, is not pursuing any interest ... other than safeguarding a friendly country, and (France) does not have any goal other than fighting against terrorism,\\" the French president said Saturday. This option is the most suitable because the passage states that France, the former colonial ruler of Mali, has sent troops to join Mali in combating militant Islamist forces linked to al Qaeda. The French president's statement emphasizes that France's goal in assisting Mali is solely to fight terrorism and protect a friendly nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He decides that his mother, who abandoned him at the orphanage as an infant, is the only one who ever truly loved him and works on a machine to scan his memory to locate her. Taking his memory scanner to his school's science fair, Lewis meets 13-year-old Wilbur Robinson, a mysterious boy claiming to be a time cop from the future. Wilbur needs to recover a time machine that a man wearing a bowler hat has stolen. Lewis tries to demonstrate the scanner, but it falls apart, throwing the science fair into chaos. Upset, Lewis leaves while the Bowler Hat Guy, with the help of a robotic bowler hat named Doris, repairs and steals the scanner. Wilbur meets Lewis at the orphanage and asks him to repair the scanner. Lewis agrees to do so only if Wilbur can prove he is telling the truth, which Wilbur does by taking them to the year 2037 in a second time machine. When they arrive, however, Lewis says he can use the time machine instead of the scanner, and he and Wilbur get into an argument and crash. Wilbur then asks Lewis to fix the time machine, but Lewis has another condition: Wilbur has to take him to visit his mother afterwards. Reluctantly, Wilbur agrees and hides Lewis in the garage. Lewis doesn't stay there for long, however, and ends up meeting the rest of the Robinsons except for Cornelius, Wilbur's father, who is away on a business trip. Following Lewis, the Bowler Hat Guy and Doris unsuccessfully try to kidnap him. Meanwhile, the Robinsons offer to adopt Lewis, but change their mind when they learn that he's from the past. Wilbur admits to lying to Lewis about taking him back to see his mom, causing Lewis to run off in disgust.

Context: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: How does the author suggest that one can save money?

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the title of the song that peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100? ? In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Gettin' Hungry\\". The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love. On September 18, 1967, Smiley Smile was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the Billboard charts, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval.\\" Rolling Stone referred to it as a \\"disaster\\" and an \\"abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney.\\" On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's \\"genius\\" label, which he called a \\"promotional shuck\\", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called \\"one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles\\". He wrote that \\"for some reason, [Smiley Smile] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you.

The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, both islands part of the same archipelago. Island 1 had experienced a drought in recent years. Both islands had populations of birds living there. Which island had the average beak size in the finch population increase? Answer:","completion":"To determine which island had an increase in the average beak size in the finch population, we must consider the factors that could lead to such a change. Let's analyze the situation step-by-step: 1. The explorers visited Galapagos 1 and Galapagos 2, which are part of the same archipelago. 2. Island 1 experienced a drought in recent years. Droughts can lead to a scarcity of food and change in the types of food available. 3. Both islands have bird populations, specifically finches. 4. Due to the drought on Island 1, it is likely that the food sources changed, favoring finches with larger beaks. Finches with larger beaks are better suited to crack open hard seeds and access other food sources that require a stronger beak. 5. Through the process of natural selection, it is expected that finches with larger beaks survived and reproduced more successfully in the drought conditions on Island 1, which would have led to an increase in the average beak size in the population. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Island 1 (Galapagos 1) would have seen an increase in the average beak size in the finch population due to the recent drought and the process of natural selection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It controls processes like digestion, heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency. Choices: - endocrine - synaptic - dopaminergic - parasympathetic A: Answer:","completion":"The parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for controlling processes like digestion, heartbeat, and breathing when there is not an emergency. The autonomic nervous system has two primary divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The sympathetic division is responsible for the \\"fight or flight\\" response and is more active during situations of stress or danger, while the parasympathetic division is responsible for the \\"rest and digest\\" response and is more active during periods of rest. The parasympathetic division works to maintain homeostasis and ensure the proper functioning of internal organs and glands. It regulates the heartbeat, helping to lower the heart rate during rest and relaxation. This division also manages the process of digestion, as it stimulates the secretion of digestive enzymes and bile, helps with the absorption of nutrients, and aids in peristalsis – the rhythmic contractions of the digestive tract that propel food along. Breathing is another process controlled by the parasympathetic division. When an individual is relaxed, the parasympathetic nerves work to slow down the respiratory rate, decrease the volume of air inhaled and exhaled with each breath, and maintain a steady and even flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide within the body. Other functions regulated by the parasympathetic division include dilation of blood vessels, stimulation of salivary glands, the production of lacrimal fluid (for tear production), and control of the pupil size in the eye, among others. In conclusion, the parasympathetic division of the autonomic nervous system is responsible for controlling various processes such as digestion, heartbeat, and breathing during non-emergency situations, ensuring the body remains in a state of balance and optimal functioning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The pair have had a contentious relationship throughout the race Defeated Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz has endorsed Donald Trump in the race for the White House. The Texas senator fought Mr Trump in a bitter primary battle, marked by mud-slinging and personal insults. Mr Cruz said he would fulfil his promise to vote for the Republican nominee and that electing Hillary Clinton would be \\"wholly unacceptable\\". He drew ire at the Republican National Convention in July, when he was booed off stage for not endorsing Mr Trump. \\"This election is unlike any other in our nation's history. Like many other voters, I have struggled to determine the right course of action in this general election,\\" Mr Cruz announced in a Facebook post. \\"After months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump.\\" Everything Ted Cruz has said about Trump The comments underscore a dramatic U-turn for Mr Cruz, who has referred to Mr Trump as a \\"trainwreck\\" and a \\"pathological liar\\" who could not be trusted in the White House. Mr Trump responded to the Cruz reversal by saying he was \\"greatly honoured\\" to have the endorsement of \\"a tough and brilliant opponent\\". But some of Cruz supporters decried the senator's announcement, including his former campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler, who told NBC: \\"It's mourning in America for conservatives. We lost our leader today.\\" Meanwhile, Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, who previously worked for a super PAC supporting Mr Cruz, expressed her relief on social media. Image copyright Twitter Analysis - Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington By endorsing Donald Trump now - after all the heat he took for his \\"vote your conscience\\" stand in July - Mr Cruz appears to be acknowledging two realities. The first is that Mr Trump might actually win the presidency even without Mr Cruz's support. At the very least, he will be competitive, diminishing the Texas senator's ability to tell his fellow party mates \\"I told you so\\". The second is that Trump-ism is the future of the Republican Party - and if Mr Cruz wants to be a part of that, he's going to have to play ball. The Texas senator has to run for re-election in 2018, and he faces the threat of a pro-Trump primary challenger. This endorsement could be a way to defuse that political bomb. Although he styles himself as an ideological true believe, Mr Cruz has shown remarkable political flexibility. The Ivy League establishment lawyer turned into anti-Washington firebrand to win a Senate seat. During the presidential campaign, he embraced Mr Trump when he saw it in his interest, then turned on the front-runner when the field narrowed. Now, it seems, the Trump-Cruz bromance has been rekindled. But the Republican nominee would be wise to watch his back. Mr Cruz said he decided to back his former foe due to six key policy differences between Mr Trump and Hillary Clinton, including the fate of the Supreme Court, Obamacare, immigration and energy. Mr Trump and Mr Cruz repeatedly clashed during the primary campaign both on and off the debate stage. Mr Trump came under fire after he tweeted an unflattering photo of Mr Cruz's wife, Heidi. He also suggested that Mr Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, was connected to the assassination of US President John F Kennedy. Media caption The moment the crowd turned on Ted Cruz Just before the Indiana primary election, Mr Cruz called the New York businessman a \\"braggadocios, arrogant buffoon\\" and a \\"serial philanderer\\". At the Republican National Convention in Ohio, Mr Cruz refused to throw his support behind the official Republican nominee while giving a speech during a primetime slot. He instead told Americans to \\"vote your conscience\\" in November and was subsequently booed off the stage. After the event, Mr Cruz said: \\"I am not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father.\\" In announcing his decision on Friday, Mr Cruz emphasised that he was focused on preventing Mrs Clinton from winning the White House. \\"Our country is in crisis. Hillary Clinton is manifestly unfit to be president, and her policies would harm millions of Americans,\\" he said. \\"And Donald Trump is the only thing standing in her way.\\" The news comes as Mr Trump prepares to face Mrs Clinton in the first presidential debate on Monday at Hofstra University in New York. ||||| Washington (CNN) Ted Cruz endorsed Donald Trump for the presidency Friday afternoon, a stunning turn of events after a contentious primary filled with nasty personal attacks and a dramatic snub at the Republican National Convention. \\"After many months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience, I have decided that on Election Day, I will vote for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump,\\" Cruz wrote in a Facebook post \\"A year ago, I pledged to endorse the Republican nominee, and I am honoring that commitment. And if you don't want to see a Hillary Clinton presidency, I encourage you to vote for him.\\" \\"I am greatly honored by the endorsement of Senator Cruz,\\" Trump said in a statement obtained by CNN. \\"We have fought the battle and he was a tough and brilliant opponent. I look forward to working with him for many years to come in order to make America great again.\\" The move -- three days before Trump's critical first debate with Clinton -- comes as the Trump and Cruz camps have moved closer in recent weeks. Trump's vice presidential nominee Mike Pence played a key role in bringing Cruz into the fold. Pence and Cruz traded multiple messages, then spoke at length once on the phone and again in person, when Pence visited Capitol Hill a few weeks ago, a source close to Pence said. Trump has hired key Cruz allies such as Kellyanne Conway as his campaign manager, and Jason Miller as a spokesman. Wednesday, Trump's campaign expressed support for a Cruz-backed, Internet-related proposal in government funding talks in the Senate. Friday, Trump released a new list of conservative judges likely to appeal to the former Supreme Court clerk -- including perhaps Cruz's closest friend in Congress, Utah Sen. Mike Lee. Cruz cited Trump's pledges on the judiciary in his Facebook post. \\"We know, without a doubt, that every Clinton appointee would be a left-wing ideologue. Trump, in contrast, has promised to appoint justices 'in the mold of (the late Antonin) Scalia,' Cruz wrote. \\"For some time, I have been seeking greater specificity on this issue, and today the Trump campaign provided that, releasing a very strong list of potential Supreme Court nominees — including Sen. Mike Lee, who would make an extraordinary justice — and making an explicit commitment to nominate only from that list.\\" A Cruz endorsement could be the last pillar to helping Trump shore up the support of conservatives who have remained reticent about supporting his campaign. Trump has already gotten most Republicans and conservatives on board with his campaign -- largely by reassuring them on the Supreme Court and on issues like the Second Amendment and abortion. But Cruz's principled opposition to offering his support has given some conservatives high-profile cover. Just as Cruz's refusal to endorse Trump at the RNC fueled Democrats' efforts to paint Trump as divisive even within his own party, Cruz's endorsement will help undermine that narrative -- suggesting to conservatives unsure about Trump that perhaps the brash billionaire has changed, and can be trusted to bring conservative change to Washington. 'Lyin' Ted' and 'utterly amoral' The move marks a dramatic turnaround from the personal insults Cruz and Trump traded during the previous year. The two men clashed repeatedly during the primaries, as Trump taunted the senator with the nickname \\"Lyin' Ted,\\" suggested Cruz wasn't eligible to be president due to his Canadian birthplace, and even speculated that Cruz's father was involved in the JFK assassination. Trump also said Cruz should \\"be careful\\" or he would \\" spill the beans on your wife ,\\" and retweeted an unflattering picture of Heidi Cruz. Those tweets have not been deleted from Trump's account. Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016 On his last day of the GOP campaign -- the Indiana primary in early May -- Cruz let loose against Trump , calling the businessman a \\"serial philanderer,\\" \\"utterly amoral,\\" and \\"a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen. At the RNC in Cleveland, Cruz gave a memorable speech espousing conservative values but ended without endorsing Trump, as Trump allies booed from the convention floor. \\"Don't stay home in November,\\" Cruz said. \\"Stand and speak and vote your conscience.\\" The next day, he defended the move by citing Trump's attacks against his family. \\"I'm not in the habit of supporting people who attack my wife and attack my father,\\" Cruz told members of the Texas delegation . \\"That pledge was not a blanket commitment that if you go and slander and attack Heidi that I'm going to nonetheless come as a servile puppy dog and say, 'Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father.'\\" After the convention, Trump said that he would not accept Cruz's endorsement if he offered it. \\"I don't want his endorsement. If he gives it, I will not accept it, just so you understand. If he gives it I will -- I will not accept. It won't matter. Honestly he should've done it because nobody cares and he would've been in better shape for four years from now,\\" Trump said. Facing Senate primary in 2018? Cruz's move may also be politically expedient. He faces a possible 2018 Senate primary challenge from Texas Rep. Michael McCaul, the chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, who has increasingly made an issue of Cruz's failure to endorse Trump. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus has said Republicans who don't back Trump could pay a price down the road. And Trump also floated the idea of setting up a super PAC to oppose Cruz if he decided to run for office again. Clinton's campaign, after Cruz's message posted on Facebook, was happy to note a number of shots Cruz took at Trump during the primary, including when he called on the businessman to release his tax returns. Clinton's official twitter account retweeted a tweet Cruz sent during the primary that said, \\"I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his!\\" I've released 9 years of tax returns. RT if you agree it's time for Donald Trump to release his! https://t.co/08whtFVC0r — Ted Cruz (@tedcruz) April 19, 2016 Clinton's campaign has been hounding Trump to release his taxes, arguing that he isn't doing so because they show shady business deals and ties to Russia. Trump has said he would release his taxes after an IRS audit. Clinton's vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, campaigning in Austin, Texas, Friday, said he couldn't support someone who used the same language Trump did about Cruz's father. \\"I just can't help but say this,\\" Kaine said. \\"Donald Trump suggested that Ted Cruz's dad was involved in the JFK assassination. Now we know that that is false, but false isn't, there's not the right word to describe what that is. It is so outrageously false. And as far as I know Donald Trump has not retracted it. As far as I know he has not apologized for it. And so if somebody said that about my dad they would never have me as a supporter for anything.\\" Radio host Steve Deace tweeted his disappointment, calling the move a mistake and speculating that Cruz backers may not all follow the senator. \\"I think it's the worst political miscalculation of my lifetime. I hope I am wrong. The people will decide that,\\" Deace tweeted. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Ted Cruz has endorsed Donald Trump in the US presidential race, despite having been a bitter rival during the Republican primary race. Cruz had previously referred to Trump as a “trainwreck” and a “pathological liar.” However, the Texas senator now claims that he has decided to vote for Trump after “months of careful consideration, of prayer and searching my own conscience.” Cruz also stated that electing Hillary Clinton would be “wholly unacceptable.” At this year’s Republican National Convention, Cruz was booed for not endorsing the candidate.

British Empire: In September 1982, Prime minister Margaret Thatcher travelled to Beijing to negotiate with the Chinese government on the future of Britain's last major and most populous overseas territory, Hong Kong. Under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking, Hong Kong Island itself had been ceded to Britain in perpetuity, but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the New Territories, which had been acquired under a 99-year lease in 1898, due to expire in 1997. Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China. A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years. The handover ceremony in 1997 marked for many, including Charles, Prince of Wales, who was in attendance, \\"the end of Empire\\". Please answer a question about this article.

Question: what is the sign for degrees Answer:","completion":"The degree symbol, denoted as °, is a widely recognized symbol utilized to represent degrees in various fields, such as temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit), geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude), and angular measurements. The presence of the degree symbol indicates that the value expressed is in terms of degrees, which helps to differentiate it from other possible units of measurement. In Unicode, the degree symbol is encoded at U+00B0 (decimal 176) under the name \\"DEGREE SIGN.\\" This makes it possible for computers and related systems to process, display, and exchange this symbol consistently. Additionally, the degree symbol can also be accessed using various keyboard shortcuts or input methods, depending on your device, operating system, or software application. For instance, common keyboard shortcuts to type the degree symbol include: - On Windows: Alt+0176 (using the numeric keypad) - On Mac: Option/Alt+0 (that is a zero) - On MS Word: Ctrl+Shift+2, followed by the spacebar In HTML, you can insert the degree symbol by using the following character entities: - Numeric: &#176; or &#x00B0; - Named: &deg; In the context of your original question, the degree symbol is the sign used for representing degrees in various fields, and in Unicode, it is encoded at U+00B0.

Q: Review: The first of the official Ghibli films, Laputa is most similar to its predecessor Nausicaa, but whereas Nausicaa was a SF epic, this is more of an action comedy-adventure with a fairly weak SF premise.For the first half hour of the movie I thought I was going to love it. Once again you find yourself in awe of Miyazaki's attention to detail, and his ability to conjure up an imaginary world in meticulous, beautiful perfection. The animation, though still not in the league of the later Ghibli films, is a little better than in Nausicaa.I mentioned in my review of Nausicaa that one character is drawn in a more 'Lupinesque' anime style. Here there are a whole bunch of them: the pirates. They provide the comic element in the film, though quite why it needs a comic element I'm not sure. There was nothing funny about Nausicaa, and I think it was better off for it. Still. having said that, Dola, the pirate leader, is easily the most memorable character in the film (even if she's basically a female Long John Silver. Don't be surprised if you're reminded of 'Treasure Planet' at times) and is well voiced by Cloris Leachman in the American dub.The English voice cast acquit themselves well for the most part, actually. However something started going pear-shaped for me about this movie by about the halfway mark. I think the best way that I could describe it is that the characters get swallowed up by the vast scope of the story. I'll come back to that later.There is so much to admire about Laputa, and so many people obviously love it, that I almost feel mean for only giving it 8 out of 10, but for me the operative word here is 'admire'. It was more impressive than personally affecting, and at over two hours it just started to drag.The crucial thing for me was this: I really found that I didn't care much about any of the characters. Disney would have taken the care to develop the characters, make you really fall for them, rather than leave them as relatively two-dimensional pieces to be moved around while you gawked at the amazing vistas in the movie. Even that would have been tolerable if there was some hard SF in the story to make up for it, but it was basically a lot of gobledegook about Princesses and magic crystals. That's where Laputa falls down as far as I'm concerned, and that's what holds it back from being a potential 10 out of 10 movie. Having said that, it must be admitted that Miyazaki was leagues ahead of Disney in general in 1986, when you consider that their movie of the same year was the pretty dire 'Great Mouse Detective'.Laputa is a good film in some ways an amazing film, and you should definitely see it, but I do feel it's over-rated. I definitely prefer the earlier 'Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind'.BTW, if you manage to watch them in chronological order, watch for the fox-squirrel from Nausicaa popping up briefly in Laputa.

Question: Give me the correct facts to answer this: what did julian fellowes write? Answer:","completion":"Julian Fellowes is a multi-talented British actor, screenwriter, director, and novelist, who has contributed both to theater and film through an extensive and diverse body of work. His writing career, spanning over two decades, is predominantly known for his period dramas and insightful portrayals of British social hierarchy. 1. Gosford Park (2001): Julian Fellowes made a breakthrough in his screenwriting career when he penned the script for Gosford Park, a satirical period murder-mystery directed by Robert Altman. The film, set in 1932, revolves around the lives and secrets of a group of elite British families and their servants during a weekend gathering. Fellowes' witty and incisive portrayal of the characters and complex social relationships earned him the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay in 2002. 2. Downton Abbey (2010-2015): Fellowes is best known for his creation and writing of the highly acclaimed television period drama series, Downton Abbey. Set in the fictional Yorkshire country estate of the same name, the series spans from 1912 to 1926 and follows the lives of the aristocratic Crawley family and their servants. The show, which won multiple Emmy Awards, BAFTAs, and a Golden Globe, received praise for its combination of soap opera intrigue, realistic historical events, and intricate portrayal of British life during that time. 3. Snobs (2004): Apart from screenwriting, Fellowes has ventured into the world of literature with several novels.

Woolworth was born in Rodman, New York, in 1852. His family was very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be a farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for displaying goods to arouse people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said: FIVE CENTS EACH. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store, selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1,000 stores in the USA and Canada, and opened his first store in London. He made many millions and his name became famous throughout the world. He always ran his business according to strict rules, of which the most important was: \\"THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT.\\" Question: The belief that \\"The customer is always right\\" suggests that _ . Options: A: Whenever there is a quarrel between the customer and shop assistant, the customer is always right B: shop assistants should always show respect for and be polite to their customers during business hours C: stores must always follow the customer's wishes if they want to make more money D: stores should do their best to meet the customer's needs if they want to be successful Answer:","completion":"D: stores should do their best to meet the customer's needs if they want to be successful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, he was a two-time All-American selection as a punter. \\"There's many strengths he brings to the program,\\" Mars said. \\"He's a member of our community, so he's familiar with that.

However, Cunningham wants to make it clear -- he will not recruit. \\"When I first started coaching, there were a lot of people who said, 'He recruits,' \\" he said. \\"I don't recruit, but if there are parents who know me, and we've gone to dinner in the past, or they've been on my track team that I coach, and they enjoy me as a father figure, that's normally the kind of kids who end up and come and follow me wherever I go, and so that's not recruiting.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If possible, meet where you won't be recognized. You don't want your parents, your relatives, community leaders, or your parents' friends to see you while you're out with your boyfriend. Meet when your parents think you're somewhere else, you could pretend to have a club meeting, or to be hanging out with a friend. You might even sneak out of the house at night. If you live in a city, you could meet almost anywhere: a big city park, a free museum, a scenic hill, or a little cafe in your favorite neighborhood. The same goes for the suburbs, although it might be harder to get around if you and your boyfriend don't have your own cars. If you live in a rural area, you might need to meet up outdoors. Don't hang out with your boyfriend in the park across the street from your house, or the local supermarket, or anywhere that your parents or their friends might run into you. When you go out with your boyfriend, your parents will probably want to know where you are. It may be best to bring a friend or two with you when you go out. That way, when they call you, you can just say \\"Oh, I'm with Amy,\\" and then put Amy on the phone with them to verify that indeed, you are with her and not your boyfriend! This is a classic move, but you'll need to be very careful about your story to pull off. The basic idea: if you want to meet up with your boyfriend after hours or even stay over at his house, tell your parents that you are sleeping over at a friend's house. If your parents insist on meeting your friends, then you should use a good friend (who your parents have met) to corroborate your story. Tell your friend about your plan. If possible if you are completely certain that you can trust your friend's parents have your friend's parents agree to pretend that you're sleeping over. It helps if you name a friend whose house you've slept over at many times before. If your parents are suspicious, they might call your friend's parents to check out your story. Consider whether this is likely to happen. If so, then you may not want to risk it. Understand the risks: if you bring your boyfriend into your parents' space, then you are giving them a huge opportunity to find out about him. Wait for a time when they aren't home, a whole weekend is even better. If you sneak your boyfriend into your house while your parents are home, make sure that he has a secret way to enter and escape. Try to bring him in once your parents are asleep, and be extremely quiet so that they don't suspect anything. Keep the noise level down so you can listen for your parents voices or footsteps in case they're walking toward your room. Be prepared to hide him under the bed or in a closet at a moment's notice, or have him leave through the window if possible! Don't leave any evidence that your boyfriend was there. Your parents will get suspicious if they see a men's comb or a men's jacket. If he gives you a gift (a note, a photo, a bouquet of flowers) don't leave it out in the open!

Article: Traveling should be easy and enjoyable, and one of the ways to make sure your trip remains fun is to know exactly how to keep your valuables safe. If you are traveling alone, distribute your money through your luggage. Place most of it in your main suitcase or bag. Make a rough estimate of how much money you will spend on the journey, till you reach your destination. Place this money in a different wallet and carry this in your pocket. Spend from this pocket till you get to your destination. If you are travelling with someone, distribute the money among yourselves. Instead of wearing your jewels, you can put your jewels at the bottom of your suitcase or bag. DO NOT carry in your purse, just in case it is stolen; or in case you misplace your purse. In addition, if you are going to be frequently opening your purse for things like tickets and phone numbers, what if you accidently just drop them. Have you ever seen a mini backpack purse? It looks really fashionable and is very smart. Plus, It's really convenient to use. The best thing to do is to hang the mini backpack purse in the front, like a baby carrier. There are two big advantages to do this; one, your hands remain free to carry your luggage and other things; and two, your purse is always monitored, and is just under your nose! Credit cards are very useful in many ways. But if you misplace your credit card, it is quite easy for someone else to find it and use it to his/ her maximum benefit before you even realize you have lost it! If you lose cash, you lose only that much cash as you are carrying. But a lost credit card means the money in your bank account is lost. So always try to use cash instead of credit card while traveling Question: Carrying a mini backpack can help you because - it is convenient to carry and monitor. - it is easier to carry your baby. - it reduce the burden on your back. - it can use to carry more things.

Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the terms containing v on the right side of the equation: -429 = (33 - 34)*v - 463 Since 33 - 34 = -1, the equation becomes: -429 = -1*v - 463 Step 2: Isolate the variable, v Now, to solve for v, isolate it by performing the inverse operation on the constants. First, add 463 to both sides of the equation: -429 + 463 = -1*v - 463 + 463 34 = -1*v Next, divide both sides of the equation by -1 (the coefficient of v): 34 / (-1) = (-1) * v / (-1) -34 = v So, the solution to the given equation is v = -34."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question. What does the narrator probably think of dried foods? Pick from: --That you can eat dried food as much as fresh food --not enough information --That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food --That dried food is awful","completion":"--That you shouldn't buy dried food as much as fresh food"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Consequently, the tax revenue generated from tourism in Tennessee amounted to 1.5 billion. This remarkable growth in tourism tax revenue can be attributed to numerous factors. Tennessee has a rich offering for tourists, including various famous tourist attractions, a vibrant music scene, and captivating historical sites. Cities such as Nashville, Memphis, and Knoxville contribute significantly to these figures, drawing tourists from all over the world. Moreover, Tennessee's picturesque landscapes and outdoor recreational opportunities, such as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, have also been major attractions for visitors. Furthermore, the tourism sector's widespread impact on the state's economy is unmatched by many other industries. This sector creates jobs, boosts local businesses, and encourages cultural exchange – all essential components for a thriving community.

Critics lashed out Wednesday against the Federal Aviation Administration, which extended its ban on U.S. airlines' flights to and from Tel Aviv, Israel. Calling the decision a \\"mistake,\\" Michael Bloomberg -- who arrived in Israel on El Al, Israel's national airline -- praised Tel Aviv Ben Gurion International Airport as most secure airport on Earth. \\"The real world is that there are things going on near airports all over the world. Ben Gurion airport, because Israel has been threatened since it was formed in 1948, is the most secure airport,\\" the former New York mayor told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"You have to take reasonable precautions but you cannot shut down everything just because one terrorist someplace on the other side of the world says I'm going to be a threat,\\" he said. The ban now runs through 12:15 p.m. ET Thursday. The FAA said it is \\"working closely with the government of Israel to review the significant new information they have provided and determine whether potential risks to U.S. civil aviation are mitigated so the agency can resolve concerns as quickly as possible.\\" The agency did not detail what the \\"significant new information\\" is. But the Israeli government told CNN that Ben Gurion is safe from any rocket attack by militants in Gaza. \\"The security in Ben Gurion and in Israel is as good as it gets,\\" said Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat. \\"The reality is that the risk coming to Israel is minimal, and if it would be larger we would take the initiative and tell everyone not to come here.\\" Hamas: 'Great victory for the resistance' The ban was enacted Tuesday after a rocket struck about a mile from the airport. Israeli government spokesman Mark Regev told CNN the military had tracked the rocket, as it does in general with those fired by militants from Gaza. Israel chose not to shoot the rocket down, knowing the airport would not be hit. \\"Any incoming rocket that would hit the airport ... would immediately be taken out by our system,\\" Regev said. Ben Gurion was still expecting 206 flights Wednesday despite cancellations from U.S. and some European airlines, Israel's Transport Ministry said. American Airlines, which owns US Airways, said it will consider resuming service to the Israeli airport once the FAA approves. Delta Air Lines said Tuesday it was suspending flights until further notice. German airline Lufthansa said that \\"based on an analysis of presently available information,\\" it will continue to suspend flights Thursday. The European Aviation Safety Agency recommended avoiding Ben Gurion on Tuesday. Air Canada canceled Wednesday night's flight to Tel Aviv, as well as its return on Thursday. The airline typically flies one flight a day from Toronto to Tel Aviv. But British Airways continued flying into Israel even after other airlines canceled. Hamas hailed the slowdown as a clear victory. \\"The resistance success in stopping the air traffic and isolating Israel from the world is a great victory for the resistance,\\" said spokesman Fawzi Barhoum. Bloomberg: Banning flights rewards Hamas. Bloomberg landed safely Wednesday and tweeted a photograph of himself sitting down with Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyhu. \\"I just wanted to do something personally to show my support for standing up for what's right. I think Israel is doing that. Hamas is trying to kill the Palestinians and kill the Israelis and somebody's got to say that they've got to stop this,\\" he told CNN's Blitzer. The exchange grew heated when Blitzer asked about the State Department's travel advisory for Israel and the West Bank. \\"I think the State Department is just overreacting in typical bureaucratic fashion,\\" Bloomberg said. When asked whether he thought there were political reasons behind the advisory, Bloomberg replied: \\"By asking the question you're implying that our government does things for political reasons. ... Just the allegation against our government I personally take as an offense.\\" He praised Ben Gurion Airport as the best-protected such facility in the world. \\"The flight restrictions are a mistake that hand Hamas an undeserved victory and should be lifted immediately,\\" Bloomberg said late Tuesday. In an opinion column for Bloomberg View, part of the media company he owns, the former New York mayor compared his trip to Israel to the way he responded to terror threats in the city. Sometimes it's prudent to act out an abundance of caution during a crisis, he wrote. \\"But closing down access to major infrastructure networks in the face of terrorist threats can be self-defeating,\\" he said. The FAA said its decision was necessary due to the \\"potentially hazardous situation.\\" And after the shooting down last week of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over Ukraine, some jittery travelers understand the FAA decision. \\"You have a rocket and you bring down 300 people at one shot,\\" one said. But it didn't stop her from boarding her El Al flight. The airport is a key economic artery for Israel. While more than 2,000 rockets have been fired into Israel from Gaza, 6,000 flights have landed and departed at Ben Gurion, the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel said. \\"It is not a miracle and not a trick,\\" the authority's director, Giora Romm, told CNN's Wolf Blitzer. \\"We know how to defend Ben Gurion, period.\\" CNN analyst: Incident could bring diplomatic consequences. It's unusual for the FAA to prohibit U.S. carriers from flying to a particular airport, said Mary Schiavo, a former U.S. Department of Transportation inspector general. \\"In the past when the FAA has done it, there have been diplomatic consequences,\\" she said. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry landed Wednesday at Ben Gurion on a mission to try to stop all hostilities. The airline suspensions didn't affect his flight because he traveled on a military plane. The flight suspensions have stranded some travelers in Tel Aviv. And others, who flew out on Israeli carriers, had to run for cover before takeoff when sirens went off at the airport. \\"You had to run for about a minute to get to shelter and just wait there for about 10 minutes,\\" a passenger arriving in New York from Tel Aviv told CNN affiliate NY1, describing what happened before the all-clear sounded. \\"It was nerve-racking, actually.\\" Rabbi Shalom Lewis, whose synagogue is in an Atlanta suburb, was stuck at Ben Gurion with a group of American travelers all looking for a way to get home to the United States. But none was running scared over missiles. \\"Every one of them was just aggravated by the inability to get home easily, but nobody was afraid,\\" Lewis told NY1. On Wednesday, the Transport Ministry ordered the opening of the small Uvda airport in the far southeast of Israel. Canceling flights to Israel is a serious blow to the country's economy, said Romm of the Civil Aviation Authority of Israel. Tourism is a major source of income. Last year, Israel received a record 3.5 million visitors, according to its Central Bureau of Statistics. Before the recent violence, the bureau reported a record 1.4 million visitors for the first half of 2014. The violence will likely put a damper on tourism.

Wanted for amassing a collection of photos and images numbering in the hundreds and suspected in a sex attack last year, authorities had Stanley Simms in their grasp, even questioning him while searching his home.But Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL, simply walked away after cops searched his home, according to reports. Not seen since June 7, the day police seized his pornography-rich computer, he is also considered a suspect in a sexual assault investigation dating back to last year, officials said.“We want to get him off the streets,” Jim Marshall, spokesman at the FBI’s Miami division, told local media. On the run: The FBI is asking for the public's help in finding accused pedophile Stanley Simms, 47, of Sunrise, FL. The computer found by law enforcement during a June 7 search of Simms’ home held over 200 child pornography files, according to the Sun-Sentinal. It was originally found sharing both movies and pictures on a file-sharing network in September, the paper reported.Simms told investigators the files were downloaded by accident during a June 7 search of his home, according to the paper, which also reported the officials declined to comment this week on why Simms was allowed to leave his home later that afternoon without being arrested – despite a federal warrant being issued for his arrest that day. Federal officials also have questions for the accused pedophile about an incident in which a south Florida woman was allegedly drugged and sexually assaulted in December, the Miami Herald reported.Known to frequent ‘adult entertainment clubs’ in south Florida, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Simms is said to drive a green/gray BMW and/or a purple pickup truck. Pervert: Simms, seen here with a relative's young baby, was found by the FBI to be in possession of hundreds of child pornography files. ‘If there’s someone out there who has information on where [Simms] is, please call the FBI, call the local police. Don’t approach him yourself,’ Marshall’s statement continued. Attempts by Mail Online to reach the FBI’s Miami office were unsuccessful. This is not the first time the feds have asked for help tracking down a suspected pedophile. On the lam: Simms left his home June 7, the same day investigators discovered his trove of kiddie porn and issued a warrant for his arrest, he hasn't been seen since. In May, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials asked for help finding a man seen committing graphic sexual assaults against a young girl estimated to be between seven and nine-years-old in four separate videos filmed the prior month.The videos were so graphic the images had to be ‘sanitized’ before they were able to be released to the public. John Doe: This man is wanted by officials for filming graphic sexual attacks on a young girl and sharing them online. Identified as ‘John Doe,’ the only leads investigators have to go on are a Frito-Lay Rold Gold thin pretzels bag seen in the videos and music equipment strewn all over the room where the depraved acts were filmed. Rold Gold pretzels are available only in the U.S. and Canada, and the packaging – in English – is seen only in the States, according to officials.Anyone with information regarding the whereabouts of Stanley Simms is urged to call the FBI’s Miami field office at (305) 944-9101. ICE also urges anyone with information about the identity or whereabouts of the the man to the right to call 1-866-347-2423 from the U.S. and Canada, or 1-802-872- 6199 from anywhere else in the world.","completion":"A man named Stanley Simms from Florida had lots of bad pictures of kids on his computer.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Sequencing the human genome has increased our knowledge of genetic disorders. These are diseases caused by mutations. They may be caused by single gene mutations or the failure of chromosomes to separate correctly during meiosis. Q: What causes genetic disorders? A: Answer:","completion":"Genetic disorders are caused by abnormalities or variations in an individual's DNA sequences, which result in the disruption of the normal functioning of specific genes or multiple genes. These abnormalities typically originate from mutations or errors that occur within the genetic material of the organism. The paragraph provided mentions two primary causes of genetic disorders: single gene mutations and chromosome segregation errors during meiosis. 1. Single gene mutations: Mutations are changes in the DNA sequence, which can either result from errors that occur naturally during the process of DNA replication or from external factors such as radiation or harmful chemicals. Single gene mutations occur when alterations take place in a specific gene. These mutations can be classified into three main types: a. Point mutations: A point mutation arises when there is a change in a single nucleotide base within the DNA sequence. This can result in an amino-acid substitution in the protein, which may alter the protein's function or impair its ability to carry out its role in the body. b. Insertions: This type of mutation involves the addition of extra nucleotide bases into the DNA sequence. Depending on where the insertion occurs, it can lead to a frameshift mutation, which affects the reading frame during the translation of the protein-coding region. Consequentially, this might result in the synthesis of a non-functional protein. c. Deletions: Deletion mutations occur when one or more nucleotide bases are removed from the DNA sequence. Similar to insertions, the deletion of bases can lead to a frameshift mutation, causing an abnormal or non-functional protein. 2. Failure of chromosomes to separate correctly during meiosis: Meiosis is a form of cell division that produces sex cells, or gametes, such as sperm and eggs. During this process, the chromosome pairs normally segregate, ensuring that each gamete receives a complete set of chromosomes. Occasionally, errors might occur in this separation process, which can lead to the following: a. Aneuploidy: This refers to an abnormal number of chromosomes in an individual's cells, in which the individual either has more or fewer chromosomes than the typical 46 (23 pairs) found in human cells. Aneuploidy can arise if chromosomes fail to separate appropriately during meiosis, leading to either the presence of an extra chromosome or the absence of a chromosome in the child. Examples of aneuploidy include Down syndrome (an extra copy of chromosome 21) and Turner syndrome (a missing or partially missing X chromosome in females). b. Translocations: Chromosome translocation is a condition in which a segment from one chromosome becomes abnormally attached to another chromosome. Translocations can either be balanced (no genetic material is gained or lost) or unbalanced (genetic material is added or removed). Unbalanced translocations can lead to genetic disorders due to the disruption or loss of important genes. In summary, genetic disorders are primarily caused by single gene mutations (including point mutations, insertions, and deletions) and chromosomal abnormalities that emerge during meiosis (such as aneuploidy and chromosome translocations). These alterations and errors disrupt the genes' functions, affecting the individual's physical and/or cognitive development and leading to various health issues associated with genetic disorders."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade.\\" true if \\"A couple walk home\\"?","completion":"It is not possible to definitively confirm if the premise \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade\\" is true when given the statement \\"A couple walk home.\\" To understand why this uncertainty exists, let's dive deeper into the context and possibilities in each scenario. Premise: \\"A man and a woman walk through the street during a parade.\\" In this situation, the focus is on a man and a woman walking together during a parade. There are multiple scenarios to consider when analyzing this premise: 1. The man and woman are together, as a couple, participating in or observing the parade. 2. The man and woman are not together but just happen to be going in the same direction during the parade. 3. The man and woman are friends, coworkers, or acquaintances attending the parade together but not romantically involved. 4. The man and woman are strangers who randomly and temporarily walk side-by-side during the parade, purely coincidental. The provided statement: \\"A couple walk home.\\" In this statement, a couple is walking home together. There are a few possible scenarios to consider: 1. The couple attended an event (e.g. a party, dinner, parade, etc.) together and are now walking home. 2. The couple met up somewhere and decided to walk home together. 3. The two people in the couple live nearby or share a home, and they are heading to that common destination. When comparing the premise and the provided statement, the element of uncertainty arises from the lack of specificity in the statement as well as the premise. The statement of \\"A couple walk home\\" does not clarify if the couple came from a specific event, like the parade, or if they were walking through the street together at the time. They could have been anywhere prior to walking home, and there's no context provided regarding their previous location or activity.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Every autumn, as families across the United States get ready to send their kids to college, the economics of higher education receive renewed attention. College is expensive and becoming more so in the U. S. The situation raises two questions: Why does it cost so much, and how can students and their families afford it? Several studies published in the past few weeks reflect on these questions. The findings provide comfort to poor families. First, it appears that only the minority actually pay the \\"high price\\". A study by the US Education Department's National Center for Education Statistics found that 55 percent of college students last year received some forms of help--scholarships, loans or jobs. Other factors are also at work. The government has increased the size of its grants to lower-income students. Grants, unlike loans, don't have to he repaid and are awarded only to college students who have not earned a bachelor's or professional degree. At the same time, most colleges are spending more on undergraduate education than they are collecting in tuition fees. A study, which is part of the Williams College Project on the Economics of Higher Education, reaches the conclusion that on average colleges \\"subsidize \\" their students. The results of these studies, however, leave unanswered the questions of whether educational costs are higher than they need to be. Some experts argue that much of the college cost results from educational competition for fame, students and facilities. This puts upward pressure on tuition, hut many colleges feel that good fame will enable them to attract students even if they charge them more. Therefore, until something important changes in the marketplace, costs seem likely to continue rising. And American families will continue to beat down the doors of the high price \\"college in the end. Question: The writer of this passage seems to hold the opinion that _ .

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the person who applied to the High Court? The sessions were interrupted by the escalating disagreement between Waters and Pink Floyd over who had the rights to the Pink Floyd name. O'Rourke, believing that his contract with Waters had been terminated illegally, sued Waters for £25,000 of back-commission. In a late-1986 board meeting of Pink Floyd Music Ltd (Pink Floyd's clearing house for all financial transactions since 1973), Waters learnt that a bank account had been opened to deal exclusively with all monies related to \\"the new Pink Floyd project\\". He immediately applied to the High Court to prevent the Pink Floyd name from being used again, but his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed. Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to gain a veto over further use of the band's name. Gilmour's team responded by issuing a press release affirming that Pink Floyd would continue to exist; however, Gilmour told a Sunday Times reporter: \\"Roger is a dog in the manger and I'm going to fight him, no one else has claimed Pink Floyd was entirely them. Anybody who does is extremely arrogant.\\"Waters twice visited Astoria, and with his wife had a meeting in August 1986 with Ezrin; Ezrin later suggested that he was being \\"checked out\\". As Waters was still a shareholder and director of Pink Floyd Music, he was able to block any decisions made by his former bandmates. Recording moved to Mayfair Studios in February 1987, and from February to March – under the terms of an agreement with Ezrin to record close to his home – to A&M Studios in Los Angeles: \\"It was fantastic because ... the lawyers couldn't call in the middle of recording unless they were calling in the middle of the night.\\" The bitterness of the row between Waters and Pink Floyd was covered in a November 1987 issue of Rolling Stone, which became the magazine's best-selling issue of that year. The legal disputes were resolved out-of-court by the end of 1987.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? cheeky","completion":"The phrase \\"cheeky\\" can be perceived as either positive or negative depending on the context in which it is used, the tone of the speaker, and the cultural background of the individuals involved in the conversation. When evaluating whether this phrase would be considered positive or negative, it is essential to consider these factors. 1. Context: When used to describe someone's actions, words, or behavior, \\"cheeky\\" could be intended as a compliment if it is highlighting the person's wit, playfulness, or charm. In such cases, it would be considered positive. On the other hand, if \\"cheeky\\" is used to criticize someone's rudeness, disrespect, or inappropriateness, it would have a negative connotation. For example: Positive: \\"Her cheeky sense of humor always makes me laugh.\\" Negative: \\"His cheeky remarks during the meeting were out of line.\\" 2. Tone of the speaker: The tone with which the phrase \\"cheeky\\" is said also greatly influences how it is perceived. If it is said in a lighthearted, playful, or affectionate tone, it is more likely to be considered positive. However, if it is said in a dismissive, angry, or disapproving tone, it could be seen as negative. 3. Cultural background: Different cultures may interpret \\"cheeky\\" differently based on cultural norms and values. In some cultures, being cheeky is seen as a sign of quick wit, intelligence, and creativity; thus, the phrase would be taken positively. In contrast, other cultures may view cheekiness as impolite, impudent, or lacking in respect, and so it would be regarded as negative. In summary, the phrase \\"cheeky\\" can be seen as both positive and negative, depending on various factors such as context, tone, and cultural background. To better understand whether the phrase is meant to be positive or negative, it's essential to consider the entire conversation and individual backgrounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary scoffed at Jane's new hat, but was jealous of Jane's new watch, because Mary yearned for the Options: (1). hat .; (2). watch .;","completion":"(2). watch .; Mary tried to suppress her envy as she stared at the beautiful silver watch that adorned Jane's wrist. The delicate hands of the watch seemed to be elegantly capturing each passing second, only increasing Mary's desire for it. The hat, on the other hand, seemed like a flimsy, gaudy piece of headwear; its unremarkable design and plainness did not trigger any envy. A few days later, the two friends were at the local coffee shop, deep in conversation. Mary couldn't help but keep glancing at Jane's watch, wondering how her friend had been able to afford such an exquisite timepiece. Perceiving her friend's infatuation with the watch, Jane confided in Mary about a recent windfall, explaining that she had received a substantial inheritance from a distant relative she barely knew. This sudden wealth had enabled her to buy the stunning timekeeping accessory that gleamed so brightly on her wrist. Mary tried her best to offer her congratulations and admiration; however, a seed of jealousy had started growing inside her, threatening to strangle their friendship. Not only did Mary still crave the watch, but she also felt a burning desire for a windfall of her own. In the days that followed, she became increasingly distant, engrossed in thoughts of how she could get her hands on a similar watch and what she would do with newfound fortune like Jane's. As the weeks passed by, Mary noticed that Jane was sporting additional luxurious items, such as designer clothes, shoes, and even a new car. These material possessions only heightened her covetousness and widened the rift between them. She started spending time researching online for that perfect watch but couldn't find one that wouldn't break the bank. In a desperate attempt to satisfy her own hunger for material possessions, Mary became obsessed—she started visiting pawnshops and online sites, hoping to find a valuable item like Jane's watch or a piece of jewelry she could acquire at a fraction of the cost. Unfortunately, this relentless quest led her further away from her friend and deeper into her obsession. One day, while scouring a quaint pawnshop on the outskirts of town, Mary finally discovered a stunning gold watch that appeared to be just within her budget. Without giving it a second thought, she immediately purchased it, feeling a sense of accomplishment and personal satisfaction. She couldn't wait to show off her own beautiful watch to Jane and let her see that she too could enjoy the finer things in life. However, the next time Mary and Jane met, their friendship had visibly soured. Their conversations were laden with jealousy and a taste of superficiality. Jane's once-genuine smile was replaced with a forced, reluctant grin, and Mary's warm laughter now contained a subtle hint of scorn. But when Jane caught a glimpse of Mary's new watch, she surprised her by complimenting it, confessing that it was even more attractive than her own. But before they could rekindle their friendship, Mary learned that her watch, though beautiful, was counterfeit and virtually worthless. In her pursuit to outshine Jane, she'd unknowingly sacrificed her hard-earned savings, and worse, her dear friendship. Over time, Mary came to realize that her obsession with Jane's watch and newfound wealth only served to corrupt her values and poison their friendship. In chasing after the shimmer of material objects, she had lost sight of the genuine, simple joy of honest camaraderie and the pleasures of shared experiences. And so, with remorse and a heavy heart, she decided to shed her futile longing for material possessions and renew her appreciation for the more profound treasures in life: love, friendship, and the passage of time – beautifully and sadly – symbolized by the very watch that had once captured her imagination and started this tale."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Additionally, Gator was aware that by choosing to adopt, they would receive expert guidance from dedicated shelter staff, who would work tirelessly to find an ideal match, taking into account both the puppy's temperament and Gator's personal needs and lifestyle. This invaluable assistance would ensure that Gator and their new companion could enjoy a rewarding and fulfilling relationship, built on trust, mutual understanding, and compassion. Finally, Gator appreciated that the adoption process includes crucial veterinary support, such as initial vaccinations, spaying or neutering, and microchipping, allowing for a smooth transition into their new life together and minimizing any potential health issues or concerns. Ultimately, by opting to adopt a puppy from a shelter, Gator not only transformed the life of their furry friend, but also took a meaningful stand against the cruel and unjust practices that pervade the pet trade industry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Former South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete sentenced after shooting dead his girlfriend at his home Oscar Pistorius, the South African Olympic and Paralympic athlete who killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, by firing four bullets through a closed toilet door, has been sentenced to a lower than expected six years in prison. Oscar Pistorius is sentenced for murder of Reeva Steenkamp – live Read more The sentence, given by Judge Thokozile Masipa in the high court in Pretoria, may be the final chapter in a story that attracted intense worldwide attention. Pistorius, who gained global fame when he reached the semi-finals of the 200m sprint at the 2012 Olympics in London, was taken down to cells immediately after the sentencing at 10.30am on Wednesday. The former athlete showed little emotion, but looked relieved. His family made no immediate statement. The sentence was much lower than many had expected and public prosectors had demanded the mandatory minimum for murder of 15 years. Andrew Fawcett, a defence lawyer, said: “We respect the decision of Judge Masipa and from a defence perspective we will not be making any application [to appeal].” Public prosecutors may decide to challenge the sentence but supporters of the Steenkamps said “the law has run its course”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Journalists crowd around a van believed to be carrying Pistorius after his sentencing. Photograph: Mike Hutchings/Reuters “There is nothing [the family] can do about the sentence. Nothing will bring Reeva back. The best thing to do is to maintain a dignified silence,” said Doup De Bruyn, a lawyer who has represented the family. Anneliese Burgess, a spokesperson for the Pistorius family, said the trial had been a “long, drawn out process” and considered the case over. “To a certain extent there is relief that this is the last chapter, that they won’t be coming back,” she told reporters outside the courthouse. Carl Pistorius, brother of the former athlete, said on Twitter that the family had “the utmost respect” for Masipa. Carl Pistorius (@carlpistorius) The record has been set straight and justice done. The truth will always prevail. #justice Campaigners for women’s rights in South Africa expressed disappointment. “The judgment is an insult to women. It sends the wrong message,” said Jacqui Mofokeng of the African National Congress women’s league, who has attended much of the trial and was in court on Wednesday. Pistorius, 29, was initially convicted of culpable homicide and sentenced to five years in prison for shooting Reeva Steenkamp, a law graduate and model, at his home on Valentine’s Day 2013. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reeva Steenkamp. Photograph: Gallo Images/Rex Shutterstock After an appeal by state prosecutors he was convicted of murder last year, a crime which carries a mandatory sentence of 15 years. Pistorius arrived for court looking anxious but healthier than during the hearings last month. He hugged members of his legal team and his family. Relatives of Pistorius and those of his victim filled a bench along the front of the courtroom. Prosecutors had called for the mandatory minimum, saying that a message needed to be sent in a country with extremely high levels of violent crime, often involving firearms. Defence lawyers had argued that a non-custodial sentence – such as community service – would be most appropriate. In an hour-long judgment, Masipa said the evidence she had heard convinced her Pistorius was “not a violent person”, was unlikely to reoffend and had shown remorse. The judge said she had to balance the interests of society, the accused and relatives of the victim. Pistorius, she said, was “a fallen hero, who has lost his career, and been ruined financially. He cannot be at peace.” She also stressed that a court should not be swayed by public opinion but that punishment must also reflect the seriousness of the offence. It should be “unpleasant, uncomfortable and painful”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Judge Thokozile Masipa said she had to balance the interests of society, the accused and relatives of the victim. Photograph: Rex Under South African law, Pistorius, who has been living in his uncle’s large home in a suburb of Pretoria, would be eligible for parole long before the end of the sentence. Pistorius, who became the first double-leg amputee to participate in the Olympics in 2012, was a hero to many in South Africa and across the world. He landed a series of lucrative sponsorship deals with leading brands, and was labelled the “blade runner”, a reference to the carbon fibre prosthetics he used to compete. But the fairytale story of tenacity and talent overcoming disability ended abruptly in the early hours of 14 February 2013, when Pistorius, whose lower legs were amputated when he was 11 months old, shot Steenkamp dead with a 9mm handgun. In court on Wednesday, Masipa described Steenkamp as “young, vivacious, full of life and hopes for the future”. “It is clear from the evidence the Steenkamps have a very close bond,” she said. Pistorius has always denied deliberately shooting Steenkamp, claiming that he believed a burglar was hiding in the toilet in his home. Prosecutors said he killed Steenkamp in a jealous rage. Masipa said she accepted the defence version of events but stressed that “murder is always a very serious crime … the fact that the accused thought it was an intruder does not make it any less serious”. The trial revealed a different and much darker side to Pistorius: a taste for fast cars and guns – and a short temper. His defence lawyers argued that, though a hero to many, the truth was that the athlete was a deeply anxious man. On the third and final day of the sentencing hearing last month, Pistorius removed his prosthetics to hobble on his stumps across the courtroom to demonstrate his physical vulnerability. Barry Roux, who led the team representing the former athlete, argued he should not return to jail on account of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression and called a clinical psychologist as a witness who told the court Pistorius was a “broken man” who has “left his fate up to God”. “[In 2014 I saw two Oscars … one was this super-Olympian, very successful, who seemed totally in control and even physically tall with his prostheses. Then there was the other [Oscar] without his prostheses who was a vulnerable, anxious man. More recently, I saw a third Oscar that really has almost given up. His spirit seems broken. I believe he is quite ill. If he was my patient, I would admit him to hospital,” Prof Jonathan Scholtz told the court. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Reeva Steenkamp’s parents June and Barry Steenkamp react after the sentencing. Photograph: Masi Losi/AFP/Getty Images But, in emotional testimony, Barry Steenkamp, the 73-year-old father of the victim, called for Pistorius to “pay for his crime”. With his hands shaking and voice trembling, Steenkamp described the moment he learned of his daughter’s death and the intense pain of bereavement. “Ever since Reeva’s death I have spent my time on my veranda, at two or three in the morning. I smoke my cigarettes. I think of Reeva every day, every day of my life, morning, noon and night … I talk to her every day in my head … my daughter,” he said. During the sentencing hearing Gerrie Nel, leading the prosecution team, told Masipa any sentence needed to consider the needs of the broader community and send a strong message to deter violent crime. “I cannot think of a more excessive use of a firearm than … firing four shots through that doorway,” said Nel, whose belligerent style has attracted both praise and criticism. “Murder remains the most reprehensible crime … Society demands that appropriate sentences be imposed.” The killing and the trial also held a mirror to South Africa more than 20 years after the end of apartheid and the coming of democracy amid widespread disillusionment at a perceived failure to achieve the lofty goals of that time. “In the same way that [Nelson] Mandela was the symbol of the country in the glorious years of generosity and pragmatism and all those good things, Pistorius … was a national icon of whom everyone was proud. His cataclysmic fall was a metaphor for broader disappointed dreams,” John Carlin, who attended the trial and is the author of a book on the former athlete, told the Guardian last month. ||||| Oscar Pistorius, left, arrives inside the High Court in Pretoria, South Africa, Wednesday, July 6, 2016. A South African judge is expected to announce Pistorius' sentence for murdering girlfriend Reeva... (Associated Press) PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) — Oscar Pistorius was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday for the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, with the judge who decided the punishment calling the double-amputee Olympian a \\"fallen hero.\\" South Africa's minimum sentence for murder is 15 years but the judge said \\"substantial and compelling circumstances\\" existed to give Pistorius a lesser sentence for shooting Steenkamp at his home in 2013. Judge Thokozile Masipa described Pistorius as a \\"good candidate for rehabilitation.\\" Pistorius was asked to stand and face Judge Masipa as she announced his sentence in a courtroom in the South African capital, Pretoria. He was calm after the sentence was announced, embracing his aunt and tearful sister before being led down a courtroom staircase to a holding cell. Steenkamp's parents, Barry and June, were also present in the courtroom, which was packed with relatives of both Pistorius and Steenkamp, journalists and other observers. After announcing Pistorius' sentence, the judge ordered a recess to give prosecutors and Pistorius' defense lawyers time to decide they want to appeal the sentence. It was not immediately clear if either would. Prosecutors had sought at least 15 years in prison for the 29-year-old Pistorius. His defense lawyers had asked for no jail time at all for the athlete, and asked that he be allowed to do charity work with children. The sentencing is the latest act of a three-and-a-half year legal drama that has often played out on live television and shown the fall from grace of a runner once viewed as an inspiration to many for overcoming his disability. Pistorius had both legs amputated below the knees when he was 11 months old because of a congenital defect. He made history by running at the 2012 Olympics on his carbon-fiber running blades, and was one of the world's most recognizable athletes. Pistorius killed Steenkamp, a 29-year-old model and reality TV star, in the pre-dawn hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by shooting her multiple times through a toilet cubicle door in his home. Pistorius maintained he killed Steenkamp by mistake thinking she was an intruder hiding in the bathroom. Prosecutors charged that he killed her intentionally after the couple argued. In 2014, Pistorius was acquitted of murder by Masipa following a dramatic seven-month trial. He was instead convicted of manslaughter and served one year in prison. His conviction was upgraded to murder last year when prosecutors appealed to South Africa's Supreme Court of Appeal. ___ Imray reported from Somerset West, South Africa. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Oscar Pistorius, the South African Paralympian who killed his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, in 2013, has been sentenced to six years in prison for murder.

Question: Given the below context: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore.

He became prime minister in 2006 but resigned three years later when police recommended charges against him. The 71-year-old is currently being investigated by the state attorney's office over suspicions he smuggled a chapter of a book he is writing out of prison, raising fears that it might compromise national security. The parole board said Olmert had been \\"punished for his deeds and paid a heavy price\\", according to AFP news agency. \\"The inmate underwent a significant rehabilitation process in prison and displays motivation to continue it,\\" the board added. The board said Olmert's behaviour had been largely \\"impeccable\\". Last week, Olmert was taken to hospital after complaining of chest pains.

Output:","completion":"1, 2, 4, 5 Explanation: <1> If the temperature is increased at constant pressure, the reaction will shift to where more moles will be produced. This is because the increase in temperature provides more energy, allowing the reaction to produce more moles to reduce the pressure. <2> If the pressure is increased at constant temperature, the reaction will shift to where the volume is higher, or where fewer moles are produced, to counteract the increase in pressure according to Le Chatelier's principle. <3> If an inert gas is added, it will not affect the equilibrium, as the inert gas does not participate in the reaction. This option is incorrect. <4> If a gas that participates in the reaction is added, the reaction will shift to where more gas is produced to counteract the increase in pressure. <5> If the temperature is decreased, the reaction will shift to where the reaction is exothermic, as the system will want to generate more heat to counteract the loss of temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

With its many international releases, the film had additional English titles of \\"Pray to Kill and Return Alive\\", \\"To Kill a Jackal\\", and \\"Renegade Gun\\". The script by Adriano Bolzoni is inspired by American noir-crime films of the 1930s and 1940s, and Kinski's entry into the scene reprises Edward G. Robinson's presence in \\"Key Largo\\" (1948). - Klaus Kinski (born Klaus Günter Karl Nakszynski; 18 October 1926 23 November 1991) was a German actor. He appeared in more than 130 films, and was a leading role actor in the films of Werner Herzog, including \\"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\\" (1972), \\"Nosferatu the Vampyre\\" (1979), \\"Woyzeck\\" (1979), \\"Fitzcarraldo\\" (1982), and \\"Cobra Verde\\" (1987). He also appeared in many Spaghetti Westerns, such as \\"For a Few Dollars More\\" (1965), \\"A Bullet for the General\\" (1966), \\"The Great Silence\\" (1968), \\"And God Said to Cain\\" (1970), \\"Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead\\" (1971) and \\"A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe\\" (1975). A controversial figure in Germany, some of Kinski's violent outbursts on set were filmed in Herzog's documentary \\"My Best Fiend\\". - For a Few Dollars More is a 1965 Italian Spaghetti Western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volontè. German actor Klaus Kinski also plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the \\"Dollars Trilogy\\", following \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\" and preceding \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\". - Aguirre, the Wrath of God, known in the UK as Aguirre, Wrath of God, is a 1972 West German epic film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Klaus Kinski stars in the title role. The soundtrack was composed and performed by West German progressive/Krautrock band Popol Vuh. The story follows the travels of Spanish soldier Lope de Aguirre, who leads a group of conquistadores down the Orinoco and Amazon River in South America in search of the legendary city of gold, El Dorado. Using a minimalist story and dialogue, the film creates a vision of madness and folly, counterpointed by the lush but unforgiving Amazonian jungle. Although based loosely on what is known of the historical figure of Aguirre, the film's storyline is, as Herzog acknowledged years after the film's release, a work of imagination. Some of the people and situations may have been inspired by Gaspar de Carvajal's account of an earlier Amazonian expedition, although Carvajal was not on the historical voyage represented in the film. Other accounts state that the expedition went into the jungles but never returned to civilization. - And God Said to Cain is a 1970 Italian Western film directed by Antonio Margheriti and starring Klaus Kinski. - Nosferatu the Vampyre is a 1979 West German art house vampire horror film written and directed by Werner Herzog. Its original German title is Nosferatu: Phantom der Nacht (\\"Nosferatu: Phantom of the Night\\"). The film is set primarily in 19th-century Wismar, Germany and Transylvania, and was conceived as a stylistic remake of the 1922 German \\"Dracula\\" adaptation \\"Nosferatu\\". It stars Klaus Kinski as Count Dracula, Isabelle Adjani as Lucy Harker, Bruno Ganz as Jonathan Harker, and French artist-writer Roland Topor as Renfield. There are two different versions of the film, one in which the actors speak English, and one in which they speak German. - Fitzcarraldo is a 1982 West German surreal adventure-drama film written and directed by Werner Herzog and starring Klaus Kinski as the title character. It portrays would-be rubber baron Brian Sweeney Fitzgerald, an Irishman known in Peru as Fitzcarraldo, who is determined to transport a steamship over a steep hill in order to access a rich rubber territory in the Amazon Basin. The film is derived from the historic events of Peruvian rubber baron Carlos Fitzcarrald. - Spaghetti Western, also known as Italian Western or Macaroni Western (primarily in Japan), is a broad subgenre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's film-making style and international box-office success. The term was used by American critics and other countries because most of these Westerns were produced and directed by Italians. - Werner Herzog (born 5 September 1942) is a German screenwriter, film director, author, actor, and opera director. - My Best Fiend (literally \\"My Dearest Enemy - Klaus Kinski\\") is a 1999 German documentary film written and directed by Werner Herzog, about his tumultuous yet productive relationship with German actor Klaus Kinski.

The film tells the story of El Chuncho, a bandit, and Bill Tate (or El Nio), who is a counter-revolutionary in Mexico. Chuncho soon learns that social revolution is more important than mere money. This is one of the more famous Zapata Westerns, a subgenre of the spaghetti western which deals with the radicalizing of bad men and bandits into revolutionaries when they are confronted with injustice.

To be well disciplined is to have learned to live in accordance with the sensible rules and regulations that society has set up for the behavior of its members. Unless the child learns from each disciplinary situation how better to govern his conduct, effective discipline has not been developed. Parents must accept for themselves the idea that successful discipline results in learning. When they approach situations in which a child must adapt themselves to demands made upon them as learning situations, many problems usually thought of in connection with discipline disappear. Unfortunately, the word discipline has come to have other less constructive meanings. Far too often discipline is thought of as punishment. To many people, to discipline a child means to spank him or use some other method of punishment. Such people consider discipline a way of either keeping a child from doing something or of forcing him to do something. It is the task of parents to build within themselves and within the children with whom they live this capacity for self-direction, based upon an understanding of what is required of individuals in a democratic society. This means learning to act in those ways known to be necessary for the \\"good life\\", not for one's self alone but also for others. Developing the capacity for self-discipline in a child is a long, slow process. Much patience is required on the part of the parents. During this development, it is important that the child's self- confidence and comfortable acceptance of himself should never be sacrificed in a disciplinary battle; instead it should be increased through the ways in which his parents meet disciplinary situations. Many parents show a good deal of impatience if the little child does not rapidly learn how to keep clean, eat well, be orderly, and do what he is told. They are so eager for him to achieve these things that they seem to try to push him rapidly through his baby period. They seem also to think that learning to do these things...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do I get unhooked from somebody? How do I get over somebody? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"While the two questions seem similar in the sense that they both deal with the process of moving on from a person or relationship, they do possess different nuances and implications. Let's break down each question and provide detailed answers to better understand the differences. 1. How do I get unhooked from somebody? The term \\"unhooked\\" implies a sense of detachment from someone with whom you might be emotionally, mentally, or physically connected. This could be a romantic partner, a friend, or even a harmful influence in your life. The objective is to remove their presence or influence in your day-to-day life. Here are some ways you can work through this process: a. Self-awareness: Recognize the negative impact this person or relationship has on your life. Be honest with yourself about why you are seeking to distance yourself from them. b. Establish boundaries: Set clear and firm limits regarding communication or interaction with this person, which could include reducing or eliminating in-person meetings, phone calls, or digital interactions. c. Seek support: Reach out to trusted friends, family members, or a professional therapist to help you work through and manage your emotions related to this relationship. d. Focus on personal growth: Engage in activities that contribute to your self-improvement, such as taking up a new hobby, learning a new skill, or seeking out new friendships. e. Time and patience: Allow yourself time to adjust to the new boundaries and keep reminding yourself of the reasons for creating distance. It's natural for the process to take time and involve some emotional fluctuations. 2. How do I get over somebody? The phrase \\"get over\\" typically refers to recovering emotionally from a romantic or platonic relationship's ending or termination. In this case, the focus is on healing from the loss and moving forward with your life. Here are some steps to help you in this process: a. Acceptance: Acknowledge that the relationship has ended and allow yourself to feel the emotions that come with it. It's crucial to let yourself grieve and process this loss. b. Cut contact: While every situation is different, it is often helpful to reduce or eliminate contact with this person initially. This distance will enable you to focus on healing without the constant reminder of what once was. c. Surround yourself with support: Reach out to friends, family members, or professional therapists, as they can offer comfort, perspective, and advice during the healing process. d. Redirect your focus: Engage in new activities to help shift your attention away from the past relationship. This could include joining clubs or groups, learning new skills, or dedicating time to self-improvement. e. Forgive and learn: Understand that every relationship teaches us valuable lessons. Reflect on your experiences, learn from them, and apply these insights to future relationships. In summary, while the two questions might seem like paraphrases of one another, they address different aspects of moving on from a relationship. The first question explores ways to detach from someone to create a healthier life, while the second question emphasizes the healing process and emotional recovery after the end of a relationship. Nonetheless, both questions involve establishing boundaries, seeking support, and focusing on personal growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the premise, we are given the following information: \\"A man in a uniform playing with a black dog.\\" The key components of this statement include a man, a uniform, a black dog, and the action of playing. The man is specifically described as being in a uniform, and the dog is described as being black. Now, let us examine the hypothesis: \\"Man playing with dog.\\" The hypothesis consists of a man and a dog interacting with each other, specifically through the action of playing. No description about the man or the dog is mentioned in the hypothesis. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we notice that both involve a man and a dog engaging in play. The premise elaborates on the context by providing more specific details such as the man's uniform and the dog's color, but these are not necessary for the broader hypothesis to hold true. As long as there is a man and a dog interacting playfully, the hypothesis is valid. Based on the given information, the premise confirms the hypothesis to be true. Both statements focus on the same main idea (a man playing with a dog), with the premise simply adding more specificity. Overall, the central idea of a man playing with a dog aligns in both the premise and the hypothesis, supporting the idea that the hypothesis is true according to the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Weird: Lee might feel weird because it could be unusual for a child (Ash) to suddenly start sounding like their parent (Lee). This option takes into account the initial strangeness of the situation. 2. Very amused: If Lee has a good sense of humor, she might find it amusing that her child is starting to sound like her. This option assumes that Lee can find humor in the situation and is not bothered by it. 3. They are like Lee: This is an observation, and not a direct answer to how Lee would feel. If Lee is proud of her own personality and characteristics, she may feel happy that Ash is displaying similar traits. This option focuses on the similarities between the two and considers a positive reaction from Lee. Based on the context and analyzing each option, I would say a possible answer to how Lee would feel as a result of Ash starting to sound like her is: Answer: Very amused.

What is the lightest solid element????","completion":"The lightest solid element is Lithium (Li), which holds the third position on the periodic table of elements. It has an atomic number of 3 and an atomic weight of 6.939 amu (atomic mass units). Lithium belongs to the alkali metal group, and is the lightest member of this group. Discovered in 1817 by Johan August Arfwedson, the name \\"lithium\\" is derived from the Greek word \\"lithos,\\" meaning \\"stone.\\" Lithium is a soft, silver-white metal with a low density, making it the lightest solid element. In its pure form, it has a density of 0.534 grams per cubic centimeter, which is less than half of the density of water. Due to its high reactivity, lithium is not found freely in nature. Instead, it exists in compounds such as spodumene and lepidolite in the Earth's crust or as lithium salts in various water sources. Lithium has several attractive qualities, such as its high specific heat capacity, which allows it to absorb a significant amount of thermal energy with minimal temperature increase. This property is useful for various applications, such as thermal energy storage and temperature regulation. In addition, lithium is highly conductive, making it an excellent choice for use in the electronics industry—particularly for lithium-ion batteries, which power devices like smartphones, laptops, and electric vehicles. In recent years, the demand for lithium has grown rapidly due to its use in modern technology. The element also has several other applications, such as in alloys for aircraft manufacturing and as a medication (lithium carbonate) to stabilize mood swings in individuals with bipolar disorder. In summary, lithium is the lightest solid element on the periodic table. It is characterized by its low density, high reactivity, and various useful properties across a range of industries, including energy, technology, and medicine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The village is a northern suburb of Chicago. The population of Lincolnshire was 7,275 at the 2010 census. Lincolnshire was incorporated on August 5, 1957, from the unincorporated Half Day area when land was purchased to build a residential subdivision. The community underwent an aggressive era of expansion from 1983 to the 1990s. The Des Plaines River bisects the village, passing from north to south; Illinois Route 22 also divides the village into two parts, crossing the village from east to west. - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. - New Jersey is a state in the Northeastern United States and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. It is bordered on the north and east by New York, on the southeast and south by the Atlantic Ocean, on the west by Pennsylvania, and on the southwest by Delaware. New Jersey is the fourth-smallest state but the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated of the 50 United States. New Jersey lies entirely within the combined statistical areas of New York City and Philadelphia and is the third-wealthiest U.S. state by per capita income as of 2014. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - Long Island is an island located just off the northeast coast of the United States and a region within the U.S. state of New York. Stretching east-northeast from New York Harbor into the Atlantic Ocean, the island comprises four counties: Kings and Queens (which comprise the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens, respectively) to the west; then Nassau and Suffolk to the east. However, many people in the New York metropolitan area (even those living in Brooklyn and Queens) colloquially use the term \\"Long Island\\" (or \\"The Island\\") exclusively to refer to the NassauSuffolk county area collectively, which is mainly suburban in character. More generally, \\"Long Island\\" may also refer collectively both to the main Island as well as its nearby, surrounding outer barrier islands. North of the island is the Long Island Sound, across from which lie the states of Connecticut and a small part of Rhode Island across the Block Island Sound. Across the Sound, to the northwest, lies Westchester County on mainland New York. To the west, Long Island is separated from the Bronx and the island of Manhattan by the East River. To the extreme southwest, it is separated from the New York City borough of Staten Island and the U.S. state of New Jersey by Upper New York Bay, the Narrows, and Lower New York Bay. To the east lie Block Island and numerous smaller islands. - Queens is the easternmost and largest in area of the five boroughs of New York City. It is geographically adjacent to the borough of Brooklyn at the southwestern end of Long Island, and to Nassau County further east on Long Island; in addition, Queens shares water borders with the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx. Coterminous with Queens County since 1899, the borough of Queens is the second-largest in population (after Brooklyn), with a census-estimated 2,339,150 residents in 2015, approximately 48% of them foreign-born. Queens County also is the second-most populous county in the U.S. state of New York, behind the neighboring borough of Brooklyn, which is coterminous with Kings County. Queens is the fourth-most densely populated county among New York City's boroughs, as well as in the United States. If each of New York City's boroughs were an independent city, Queens also would be the nation's fourth most populous city, after Los Angeles, Chicago, and Brooklyn. Queens is the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world. - Holtsville is a hamlet and census-designated place (CDP) in Suffolk County, New York, United States.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

The Moon thus tends to \\"stretch\\" the Earth slightly along the line connecting the two bodies. The solid Earth deforms a bit, but ocean water, being fluid, is free to move much more in response to the tidal force, particularly horizontally. As the Earth rotates, the magnitude and direction of the tidal force at any particular point on the Earth's surface change constantly; although the ocean never reaches equilibrium—there is never time for the fluid to \\"catch up\\" to the state it would eventually reach if the tidal force were constant—the changing tidal force nonetheless causes rhythmic changes in sea surface height. Paragraph: Mike was reading about an instrument that could measure gravity, gravimeter. He then found how gravimeter was used to measure the gravitational field of the Moon. He read about two distinct cases where the Moon's gravitational field was measured on earth, side A and side B. In side A the Moon's gravity was measured from the side where the Earth was facing the Moon. And in side B the Moon's gravitational field was measured from the opposite side of the Earth. He found these two locations showed very different consequences of Moon's gravitational field.

Q: WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war. Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Answer: \\"Malaya's rubber production\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Answer: No, the answer to the question is not correct. The correct answer is that the Malay ruling class took a back seat because the British firmly held the reins of government and control of the rubber and tin industries.

Through a series of serendipitous events, the two realize that true love sometimes unfolds in the most unconventional ways. Plot: Act 1: The movie opens at a bustling coffee shop, where Travis, an aspiring writer, is a regular customer. Travis often writes at the coffee shop, accompanied by his best friend Sammy, a confident, extroverted guy who continuously tries to push Travis out of his comfort zone. Travis is captivated by Miley, a barista at the coffee shop, who fills the space with her vibrant and charming personality. As a connoisseur of stories, Travis loves how Miley always has an anecdote for every customer and enjoys eavesdropping on her conversations. In reality, he would give anything to get closer to her. However, due to his introverted nature, he has never worked up the courage to even have a proper conversation with her, let alone ask her out. One day, Travis accidentally leaves his notebook at the coffee shop, which is filled with personal stories and thoughts about Miley. After closing up, Miley discovers the notebook and, out of curiosity, reads it. Miley is touched by Travis's words and is intrigued by the shy young man who has been admiring her from afar. Act 2: The next day, Travis realizes that he has lost his notebook and gets anxious. When Travis returns to the coffee shop, Miley approaches him and hands it back with a smile.

Question: The answer to the question: Which character allowed the chickens to eat from the garden? is inside the article: An agricultural farm is giving prizes for the person who makes the largest homegrown project. Porky and a rival neighbor both plan to win the agricultural farm prize, Porky with his garden and the neighbor with his chickens. Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere. Porky grabs his bottle of quick grow, a hair tonic he hopes would work on his garden. To his amazement, it does. But he says nothing of it and heads inside his house. The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead. The chick then comes back and punches the mean chicken before finishing the watermelon. (The chick eating spinach and then changing is a thinly-veiled Popeye reference). When his garden has almost entirely been eaten, Porky finally notices the chickens and tries to get rid of them. But alas no luck, so he yells at the neighbor to get them back into his yard but the neighbor claims he doesn't know how they got on Porky's property, then attempts to \\"try\\" and make them return. He then leaves while a sad Porky heads to his door, only to find a long vine and follow it to a giant pumpkin., can you guess it ?

Title: A Single Man Movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George.

[+] no [+] yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: To get rid of best friends on Snapchat, you cannot remove them directly from the \\"Best Friends\\" list, but you can manipulate the list by changing your interactions with them. Here are a few steps to help you get rid of best friends on Snapchat: 1. Adjust the settings: Open Snapchat and navigate to your profile by tapping on your Bitmoji icon or the user icon in the top left corner. Then, tap on the settings gear icon in the top right corner. Scroll down to the \\"Who Can...\\" section and tap on \\"Contact Me.\\" Change it from \\"Everyone\\" to \\"My Friends,\\" and this will prevent any new friend from immediately becoming a best friend. 2. Increase interactions with other friends: Snapchat's best friends list is based on the frequency of interactions with your friends. If you want to remove someone from your best friends list, start interacting more with other friends so that they can replace the ones you want to remove from the list. 3. Decrease interactions with the best friend: To remove a best friend from the list, stop sending snaps to them, avoid opening their snaps, and do not interact with their stories. This will lower their score on your best friends list, eventually moving them off the list. 4. Unfriend or block the user: If you absolutely need to remove someone from your best friends list, you can unfriend or block them. To do this, go to your chat list, long-press on the user's name, tap on \\"More,\\" and choose \\"Remove Friend\\" or \\"Block.\\" Keep in mind that by doing this, you will cut all connections with the user, and they will not be able to send or receive snaps from you. Answer to Question 2: Yes or no - whether or not you should have Snapchat depends on your personal preferences and what you look for in a social media platform. Here are some points to consider before deciding to have Snapchat: Pros: 1. Unique features: Snapchat offers a range of interactive and entertaining features such as lenses, filters, and Bitmoji. It is constantly updating and introducing new features to keep users engaged. 2. Ephemeral content: Disappearing photos and videos that are only available for a short time encourage users to share authentic, unfiltered moments from their daily lives. 3. Option for privacy: Snapchat allows you to control who can view your story, who can send you snaps, and who can view your location using Snap Map. Cons: 1. Time-sensitive messages: The disappearing nature of snaps can be frustrating for users who miss important information or would prefer to save and view messages at their leisure. 2. Limited discoverability: Unlike other social media platforms like Instagram or Facebook, it is harder to discover new users and build a large following on Snapchat unless the account is being promoted through other channels. 3. Privacy concerns: Sharing your location or taking screenshots of snaps can pose privacy risks for users. It's essential to know the app's privacy settings and how to use them. The answer to these two questions is not necessarily the same. The first question asks about a specific feature on Snapchat and how to manage it, while the second question focuses on whether or not you should use the platform. Choosing to use Snapchat is a personal decision based on the above pros and cons, and once you start using it, you can manage the features of the app, such as the best friends list, according to your preferences."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Let's break the sentence down for better understanding. The sentence is: \\"The man who I gave John this picture of was bald.\\" Firstly, the sentence contains a relative clause (\\"who I gave John this picture of\\"), which provides additional information about the subject \\"the man.\\" Relative clauses are dependent clauses that are introduced by relative pronouns like \\"who,\\" \\"whom,\\" \\"which,\\" \\"that,\\" and \\"whose.\\" In this case, we can divide the sentence into two statements: 1. \\"I gave John this picture.\\" 2. \\"The man (from the picture) was bald.\\" Now, combining these two statements using the relative pronoun \\"who\\" to form a single sentence: \\"I gave John this picture of the man who was bald.\\" By using the relative clause, we obtain the original sentence: \\"The man who I gave John this picture of was bald.\\" Although the sentence structure might sound unusual and a bit confusing, it is grammatically correct. It could be rephrased to make it easier to understand, as demonstrated in the earlier rearranged version.

In this scenario, Fenner has clearly taken action to stop the wagons. In the second sentence, it is stated that Fenner neglected to signal the wagons to stop. This would mean that, contrary to the actions described in the first sentence, Fenner did not make any attempt to stop the wagons. Therefore, if we assume the first sentence is true, then the second sentence cannot be true, as they contradict each other.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Breaking Up Big Banks Is a Severely Conservative Project The columnist George F. Will recently shocked his fellow conservatives by endorsing Richard Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, to be Treasury secretary in a Mitt Romney administration. Fisher’s appeal, in Will’s eyes, is that he wants to break up the largest U.S. banks, arguing that this is essential to re- establish a free market for financial services. Big banks get big implicit government subsidies and this should stop. Will’s endorsement was on target: The true conservative agenda should be to take government out of banking by making all financial institutions small enough and simple enough to fail. As Will asks, “Should the government be complicit in protecting -- and by doing so, enlarging -- huge economic interests?” But Will could have gone further -- much of what Fisher recommends also is appealing to people on the left of the political spectrum. Fisher should be considered for a top administration post regardless of who wins the presidency on Nov. 6. He also should be a strong candidate to become chairman of the Federal Reserve Board when Ben Bernanke’s second term ends Jan. 31, 2014. Unfortunately, Fisher’s views on “too big to fail” banks draw the ire of powerful people on Wall Street, and he almost certainly will remain in Dallas. That is, until the next crisis. Fisher and Harvey Rosenblum, executive vice president and director of research at the Dallas Fed, have laid the groundwork for a comprehensive reassessment of finance and banking -- and the effects on monetary policy. The closest parallel is the rethink that happened during the 1930s, as the gold standard broke down and the world descended into depression followed by chaos. But their approach is also reminiscent of the way that monetary policy was reoriented in the early 1980s, as Fed Chairman Paul Volcker and others brought down inflation. The world and the U.S. economy have changed profoundly. We need to alter the way we think about the financial system and monetary policy. Fisher and Rosenblum have expressed, separately and together, three deep ideas since the financial crisis erupted in 2008. First, very large banks are too complex to manage. “Not just for top bank executives, but too complex as well for creditors and shareholders to exert market discipline,” they wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in April. “And too big and complex for bank supervisors to exert regulatory discipline when internal management discipline and market discipline are lacking.” Complexity, they say, magnifies “the opportunities for opacity, obfuscation and mismanaged risk.” This is a problem in other industries, too, though market forces compel U.S. businesses to reconfigure their organizational structures all the time, including through divestitures and by becoming smaller in other ways. Banking is different. There are large implicit government subsidies available if your financial institution is perceived as too big to fail. These subsidies -- in the form of implicit downside protection or guarantees for creditors -- drive up size and exacerbate complexity. Second, too-big-to-fail banks do actually fail, in the sense that they require bailouts and other forms of government support. This is exactly what happened in the U.S. in 2007 through 2009, and it is what is occurring in Europe today. For anyone who finds the phrase “break up” hard to swallow -- for example because you believe the government shouldn’t take on this role -- Fisher and Rosenblum argue: “Though it sounds radical, restructuring is a far less drastic solution than quasi-nationalization, as happened in 2008-09.” Third, monetary policy cannot function properly when a country’s biggest banks are allowed to become too complex to manage and prone to failure. In “The Blob That Ate Monetary Policy,” a Wall Street Journal op-ed published in September 2009, Fisher and Rosenblum pointed out that cutting interest rates doesn’t work when systemically important banks are close to insolvency. The funding costs for banks go up, not down, as a crisis develops. So pulling the classic policy lever, the federal funds rate, becomes less than effective in such an environment. (For more, see this essay and this article.) As banks come under pressure, the Fed may cut its policy rate but the interest rates charged by banks to customers may actually go up, and it becomes harder to get a loan. This is what happened in 2008 and 2009. Or think about what happens during any attempted economic recovery -- such as the one we are in now. “Well-capitalized banks can expand credit to the private sector in concert with monetary policy easing,” Rosenblum wrote with his colleagues Jessica J. Renier and Richard Alm in the Dallas Fed’s “Economic Letter” of April 2010. “Undercapitalized banks are in no position to lend money to the private sector, sapping the effectiveness of monetary policy.” If you want monetary policy to become effective again, you need the largest banks to be broken up. Equity capital also must increase, relative to debt, throughout the financial system.

His new football coach, Coach McDevitt, drives him onto the campus. His coach, awkwardly asks about any special \\"dietary\\" needs David might have, presumably because of his Jewish background and stresses to not to tell the other boys any more about himself than he has to. When he meets the \\"other big men on campus\\" --Dillon, Connors, Van Kelt, Reece-- he becomes aware of their feelings towards Jews in a conversation about team follower McGivern's new hi-fi he \\"Jewed down\\" from forty to thirty dollars.Greene finds his faith tested when he attends Protestant chapel and when he must choose between going to temple for Rosh Hashanah as his father wishes and playing football. He copes with this second challenge by playing the game where he establishes himself as the team's leader and throws a long touchdown pass late in the 4th quarter to give St. Matt's a 13-7 win in the game, and later that night reciting Jewish prayers in the chapel in honor of Rosh Hashanah.Beyond dealing with religious prejudice this film deals with social prejudices, abuse of power, and the concept of honor. Fairly early on in the film, it becomes clear that although they are gifted by the circumstances of birth, not all of Greene's classmates are gifted academically.

At first glance, the movie described here is about a Jewish boy named David Greene who faces prejudice at his new school while shouldering responsibilities as a football quarterback. It's also about the internal conflict he experiences due to his heritage and his dreams. 1. Filtered main and unique elements: I started by filtering out the main elements of the plot. The main elements consist of 'Jewish boy', 'prejudice', 'football', and 'fight against prejudice'. The elements are combined in a unique way in the movie. 2. Generated connotations: I thought about words or phrases that can represent these main elements. For instance, 'Gridiron' is connotative to football, and 'Yarmulkes' to Jewish heritage. 3. Combined connotations: Combining these two words, we obtain \\"Gridiron & Yarmulkes\\", which gives a hint about the movie's sport-related and religious aspects. 4. Added theme: The second part of the title, \\"Breaking Prejudice\\", signifies another core theme in the movie - fighting against prejudice. 5. Created intrigue: A bit of intrigue is useful to pique the viewers' interest.

Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car.

After considering various options, in 2000 Arsenal proposed building a new 60,361-capacity stadium at Ashburton Grove, since named the Emirates Stadium, about 500 metres south-west of Highbury. The project was initially delayed by red tape and rising costs, and construction was completed in July 2006, in time for the start of the 2006–07 season. The stadium was named after its sponsors, the airline company Emirates, with whom the club signed the largest sponsorship deal in English football history, worth around £100 million; some fans referred to the ground as Ashburton Grove, or the Grove, as they did not agree with corporate sponsorship of stadium names.

You can increase your chances of remembering your dream by taking a few extra minutes both to go to sleep and to wake up. If you allow yourself to wake up gradually, you're less likely to startle the dream out of your head. Dream memories are fleeting, and almost always dissipate unless you catch them early on. As soon as you awake, take a pen and jot down whatever you can remember, whether it's a colour, shape, or feeling. Every little detail will help you to make better sense of your dream. When you wake up, you won't have long to catch your dream memories before they fade away. Having a pen and paper at your bedside will give you the fastest way possible to get your thoughts onto paper. When you wake up, try to get the main symbols in your dream down on paper so they don't disappear from your mind. You can write them or draw them, whatever is easiest for you. Obviously, you dreamed about a doll, but think about what else you saw. What other symbols showed up? Were other people there? Just try to get down the main ideas right now. The emotional impact of the dream is often more important than the visual symbols in your dream. As you write down the details of your dream, think about the emotions that accompanied it. Did you feel upset when you woke up? Did the dream make you happy or anxious? Try to identify what you're feeling upon waking, and write those thoughts down, too. Now that you've got the main ideas down, fill in the details. The details are any extra things you can think of that happened in the dream but weren't necessarily the main focus of the dream. The details can help put the symbols you see into context. For example, think about the setting. Was it night or day? Did you notice anything else in the dream that you may have left out? Maybe a particular color stood out to you, or maybe you saw a recurring flower. Just try to fill in as much as you can. Summary:","completion":"To increase your chances of remembering and analyzing your dreams, take a few extra minutes to go to sleep and wake up gradually.

Pushkin was born into Russian nobility in Moscow. His matrilineal great grandfather was Abram Gannibal, who was brought over as a slave from what is now Cameroon. Pushkin published his first poem at the age of fifteen, and was widely recognized by the literary establishment by the time of his graduation from the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. While under the strict surveillance of the Tsar's political police and unable to publish, Pushkin wrote his most famous play, the drama Boris Godunov. His novel in verse, Eugene Onegin, was serialized between 1825 and 1832. Notoriously touchy about his honour, Pushkin fought as many as twenty-nine duels, and was fatally wounded in such an encounter with Georges-Charles de Heeckeren d'Anthes. Pushkin had accused D'Anthes, a French officer serving with the Chevalier Guard Regiment of attempting to seduce the poet's wife, Natalya Pushkina.

Q:Given the following passage \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Here is an article: The authorities identified the slain trooper as David C. Brinkerhoff, 29, a member of the agency’s mobile response team. Trooper Brinkerhoff and another member of the assault team, Richard G. Mattson, went into the farmhouse, about 110 miles northwest of New York City, to help other troopers who were responding to a burglar alarm about 8 a.m. Wednesday. They were looking for Mr. Trim, who was suspected of shooting another trooper, Matthew Gombosi, the previous day. The authorities said Mr. Trim then shot Trooper Brinkerhoff in the head, and Trooper Mattson in the left arm. They were both taken by helicopter to Albany Medical Center. On learning of the slaying of the trooper, the second member of the mobile response team to be killed in a manhunt since September, Gov. Eliot Spitzer canceled a planned lunchtime speech in Manhattan, asking his wife, Silda Wall Spitzer, to fill in for him. He returned to Albany and in a brief statement issued by his office, he said, “One of our best has fallen and another has been seriously wounded in the line of duty.” In the Capitol, Republicans and Democrats were moving swiftly, but in different directions, in response both to the trooper shootings as well as the shootings at Virginia Tech last week. The Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called on the governor to pressure the Democratic-led Assembly to pass legislation that would bring back the death penalty for those who kill law enforcement officers, as well as terrorists. The governor has supported both ideas in the past, but a similar bill was voted down in the Assembly on Tuesday, 96 to 47. “I’m asking the governor to use his considerable influence with the Assembly,” Mr. Bruno said. Senator John J. Bonacic, a Republican whose district includes Margaretville, said of the governor: “I know you’re a law and order guy, I know you are, I know you care about the safety of our families. Get the Assembly to do what they must do.” But Charles Carrier, a spokesman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, reiterated that Assembly Democrats oppose the death penalty. Instead, the Assembly passed a number of antigun measures on Wednesday, including bills banning assault weapons and armor-piercing ammunition. The events that led to the shooting of the three officers began last Friday, when Mr. Trim, of North Lawrence, near the Canadian border, was said to have stolen a van. On Tuesday afternoon in Margaretville, 270 miles south of where the van was taken, Trooper Gombosi pulled Mr. Trim over because the van was missing a license plate, Mr. Felton, the acting superintendent, said. When Mr. Trim failed to provide identification, Trooper Gombosi told him he was under arrest. At that point, Mr. Trim pulled a handgun from his waistband and fired once at the trooper, Mr. Felton said. The trooper was hit in the lower ribs, but the police said his body armor saved him from serious injury. “He was disoriented and he could not produce any identification,” Mr. Felton said of Mr. Trim. One investigator said that Mr. Trim was looking at a map when he was pulled over, as if he were lost. The police later found the abandoned van a few miles from where the confrontation with Trooper Gombosi took place. By Tuesday night, the authorities said troopers had converged on the rural area — stopping cars and trucks and using police dogs — in search of Mr. Trim. On Wednesday morning, the burglar alarm drew them to the farmhouse, where they found a backpack, clothing and identification. A short time later, the authorities said, the troopers exchanged gunfire with Mr. Trim, and Troopers Brinkerhoff and Matson were shot. Before long, scores of heavily armed troopers surrounded the farmhouse where Mr. Trim was believed to be hiding. Armored vehicles moved in, snipers took position behind stone walls, and other officers spread across the roads and hilltops overlooking the house. At one point, troopers shot tear-gas canisters inside the home, eliciting no response. Then, a robot with a camera rolled in, and scanned the house for the suspect. Late in the afternoon, troopers began moving in and once again fired tear gas canisters. The house erupted in flames, driving back the officers. “It’s unbelievable,” said Anna Carli, a retired nurse who has lived in Margaretville for 40 years. “This is a little town. This kind of thing doesn’t happen here.” In the section of Coxsackie, just outside Albany, where Trooper Brinkerhoff — an eight-year veteran of the State Police — lived with his wife, Barbara, and their 7-month-old daughter, the police kept the press and the curious away. The events on Wednesday reminded many of the five-month manhunt last year for Ralph J. Phillips, during which three troopers were shot, one fatally. The hunt began after Mr. Phillips escaped from the Erie County jail on April 2, 2006. On Wednesday, outside Albany Medical Center, where he had met with relatives of Trooper Mattson’s, the Rev. James LeFebvre, chaplain of the Albany Police Department, described his reaction when he heard the news of Trooper Brinkerhoff’s death: “You say, ‘Give me the good news.’ And they say, ‘There isn’t any good news,’ and you say, ‘No, not again.’ ” Lisa W. Foderaro reported from Margaretville and Fernanda Santos from White Plains.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Sentence 1: See it and you still won't believe it. Sentence 2: You will not want to believe what you see. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze both sentences to understand their meaning. Sentence 1: \\"See it and you still won't believe it.\\" This sentence implies that even if the user sees something, they still won't believe its authenticity or existence. Something is so unbelievable that experiencing it visually doesn't make its existence believable. Sentence 2: \\"You will not want to believe what you see.\\" This sentence implies that the user sees something and doesn't want to believe it. It could mean the visual experience might be shocking, overwhelming, or surreal. Step 2: Determine if Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. Entailment means that if Sentence 1 is true, Sentence 2 must also be true. To determine this, we will analyze if the truth of Sentence 1 requires the truth of Sentence 2. In both sentences, the theme is about believing or not believing something seen. However, they differ in their focus: - Sentence 1 focuses on the inability to believe something even when the user sees it. - Sentence 2 focuses on the user's desire to not believe what they see. Thus, while both sentences convey disbelief to some extent, they are not necessarily causally linked or dependent on each other. It's possible for someone to see something unbelievable yet still want to believe it (in which case, Sentence 2 would not be true). Conclusion: The second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. While both sentences share the theme of disbelief, they address different aspects (inability vs. desire not to believe), and the truth of one sentence does not guarantee the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen.

I read this background article the other day: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is most likely the author's occupation? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The author is most likely a healthcare professional, possibly a doctor or a medical expert, specializing in blood pressure management for older adults. This is evident from their knowledge of blood pressure guidelines, familiarity with medical studies, and their statement about not changing their clinical practice based on new guidelines."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes. What Celenda grabbed from the bowl? - not enough information - four petals - five petals - ten petals A:","completion":"Celenda grabbed ten petals of the captivating red lotus from the bronze bowl, one more than she usually indulged in. Her worries about the crumbling villa, torn furniture, and diminishing coffers disappeared as soon as she inhaled the rich, intoxicating scent of the leaves. The vibrant warmth radiating from the braziers crept into her veins, and the sounds and sights of her guests and the decadent feast enhanced the intense euphoria flooding her senses. As she placed the petals to her lips, the slave boy watched her every move, knowing how valuable those petals were and how scarce they were becoming. Hints of unease lingered in the air; the uninterrupted days of boundless merriment were a fading memory. However, in that moment, the reality of her predicament was as elusive as the waning wisps of the red lotus petals' fragrance. With each petal, the intoxicating influence surged through her body, triggering intense sensations. Her thoughts soon dissolved into blissful oblivion, if only for a short while. The guests, indulging in the sensory whirlwind of their mistress, became intoxicated by the thinning resources, each thoroughly intent on their own sensual fixations. Conversations roar louder as the addictive haze propels the guests deeper into their fervent state. Laughter abounds, secrets are shared, and indiscreet sighs emerge from behind crimson-draped hovels. But as the night wears on, the feast begins to wane, and the dwindling supply of red lotus petals becomes strikingly apparent. The sound of boisterous laughter and the clinking of goblets fade, making way for the ominous reality that the days of never-ending opulence are well and truly numbered. Whispers regarding the past seamstress are replaced with speculations involving the fading glory and diminishing fortune of their once-magnificent host. While the guests' urgency to revel in the fleeting moments of grandeur subsists, concern over the scarcity of the red lotus blooms like a malignant growth that cannot be excised. In the deepest and most vulnerable parts of their minds, they anxiously wonder how long they can cling to the increasingly tattered vestiges of the lavish warmth they had grown accustomed to, as their world crumbles around them. Celenda, a vision of hedonistic vulnerability, slowly regains her senses. The sheer weight of her predicament creeps back into her consciousness. As she reclines on her now worn-out silk divan, fingertips tracing the frays and flaws in the fabric, she grudgingly faces the most harrowing truth: in her quest for endless bliss and momentary abandonment, she had inadvertently set the stage for the inevitable downfall of her once-great empire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 - September 3, 1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments. He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments. In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation. In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953. After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California.","completion":"This text is about Harry Partch, an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments.

(CNN) -- North Korea twice came back from behind to hold Greece 2-2 in a friendly between two sides heading to the World Cup next month, while fellow finalists Paraguay lost 2-1 to the Republic of Ireland. In a match played at a neutral venue in Altach, Austria, Costas Katsouranis gave Greece the lead in the second minute with a close-range finish. The Koreans leveled when Jong Tae-se beat two players and fired a shot past goalkeeper Michalis Sifakis. Angelos Charisteas came off the bench to put the Greeks 2-1 in front shortly after half-time but, three minutes later, Jong raced down the right flank, cut inside and slammed home his second. Greece substitute goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas had to be at his sharpest to keep out a powerful shot from Cha Jong-hyok that could have won the game for the Asian side. In Dublin, first-half goals from Kevin Doyle and Liam Lawrence helped Ireland to victory over the South Americans.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel. The following is an edited transcript. CNN: Tell me more about your new character, Spero Lucas.

OPTIONS: A). no; B). yes;","completion":"B). yes; One reason for why George Pelecanos might be \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer\\" is his attention to detail. As mentioned in the text, his stories are set in his hometown of Washington, D.C., and he explores racial tensions, the challenges faced by working families, and the gritty side of the city in his writing. Pelecanos is known as the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. This attention to detail helps to create a rich and authentic portrayal of urban America, which is one of the reasons why Stephen King called Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" In his writing, Pelecanos brings his stories to life with pitch-perfect dialogue, drawing from the sights, sounds, and tastes of Washington in exceptional detail. His diverse cast of ethnically and socially diverse characters also adds depth and realism to his storytelling. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos has also brought this attention to detail as a producer and writer in several successful TV series, further cementing his position as a notable crime writer with a keen eye for authenticity. In Pelecanos' latest work, \\"The Cut,\\" we also see this attention to detail through the introduction of Spero Lucas, an Iraq war veteran and private investigator. The novel immerses readers in the morally gray and often violent world Lucas inhabits. Pelecanos demonstrates this skill in capturing the authentic urban experience and detailing the struggles faced by his characters, such as working-class families and tense racial and ethnic relations, which is why he is considered one of the greatest living American crime writers."},{"prompt":"Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Mr. Black was the manager of a hotel in Atlanta. One weekend all of the hotels were full because of a large business meeting being held in the city. On Sunday night, three men came into Mr. Black's hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Black told them that there were no more rooms available. The men didn't know what to do because they had no place to stay in. Mr. Black wanted to help them. He remembered that there was an empty room at the far end of the first floor -- Room 112. It was a very small room, and had rarely been used as a guest room before. So, he asked the three men if they would mind sharing that small room. They replied that they would be very satisfied so long as there was a room for them to stay in for the night. Mr. Black then told them that the room would cost them 30 in total. On hearing this, each of the three men gave Mr. Black 10 before they left for their room. However, Mr. Black soon began to think that 30 was really too much for that small room. He called his assistant over and said, \\"Here is 5. Give it back to the three men in Room 112. Each of them paid me 10. That's too much.\\" The assistant took the money.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - earth - multivitamin - mineral - ore - dietary concerns The answer is:","completion":"ore Before getting the refined mineral, you begin with collecting and mining the ore. To provide a detailed understanding of the process, let's break down the steps involved in obtaining refined minerals from ores. 1. Exploration: The first step is to locate and discover mineral deposits. This process involves numerous techniques such as geological mapping, remote sensing, and geophysical surveys to identify areas with high concentrations of valuable minerals. 2. Extraction: Once a mineral deposit is identified, mining companies establish mines to extract the ore. There are different methods of extraction, including surface mining (open-pit or strip mining) and underground mining (shaft or tunnel mining). The choice of method depends on what type of deposit is being targeted and various other factors such as depth, location, and environmental impact. 3. Crushing and grinding: After extraction, the ore is transported to a processing facility, where it undergoes crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the rock. This enables the separation of valuable minerals from the waste rock (also called gangue) and prepares the material for further processing. 4. Beneficiation: Following the size reduction process, beneficiation techniques are employed to separate the valuable minerals from the waste rock. Common methods include flotation, magnetic separation, and gravity concentration. These processes increase the concentration of valuable minerals in the ore and result in an enriched material called concentrate. 5. Smelting and refining: The concentrate is subjected to various smelting and refining processes to extract the desired mineral. In the case of metals, these processes generally involve heating the concentrate in furnaces to separate the metal from the impurities. This results in the production of a molten metal, which can then be cast into various shapes or forms, such as ingots or bars. 6. Environmental management and rehabilitation: Throughout the mining and refining process, environmental considerations must be addressed to minimize negative impacts on the surrounding areas. This involves proper waste management, air and water pollution control, and site rehabilitation. In conclusion, the most suitable option to answer the question is \\"ore\\" because it is the starting material required to obtain refined minerals. The process of extracting and refining minerals from ores is crucial for the production of various metals and minerals that play a significant role in modern society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: order, tiredness, neatness, pass out, invigorating Why is \\"tiredness\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"The answer \\"tiredness\\" aligns with human common sense because cleaning a house typically involves a variety of physical activities that can lead to exhaustion. It might involve sweeping, mopping, dusting, scrubbing, lifting heavy objects, bending over repeatedly, and moving around a lot, among other strenuous activities. All of these tasks require energy and can be quite tiring especially if the cleaning is comprehensive and involves a large area or multiple rooms. Moreover, cleaning is not just physically tiring, it can also be mentally exhausting. Determining what needs to be cleaned, strategizing the quickest and most efficient ways to do so, figuring out stubborn stains or problems, and deciding what should be thrown away or kept can all engage and tire the mind. It's a decision-making process that requires planning and execution. In addition to the physical exertion and mental strain, the duration of the cleaning process plays into the feeling of tiredness as well. Cleaning a house thoroughly is not usually a quick task; it could take hours depending on the size of the house and the extent of cleaning required. The longer an individual engages in such an energy-demanding task like this, the more likely they are to feel tired afterward. Therefore, based on an understanding of what house cleaning entails, \\"tiredness\\" is indeed an outcome that is heavily linked with the aftermath of house-cleaning activities as per human common sense. It fully aligns with the realities of the physical, psychological, and time demands that come with cleaning a house. Hence, when people refer to the aftereffects of cleaning, feeling tired or fatigued is a logical conclusion that is in line with typical human experience and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Since 1970, the responsibility of manufacturing and supplying the official match balls for the FIFA World Cup has been with Adidas, a German multinational corporation. Adidas holds a long-standing relationship with FIFA, and this collaboration has not only produced iconic footballs over the years but also played a significant role in advancing the technology involved in the manufacturing process. Let's take a look at the World Cup footballs created by Adidas since 1970: 1. 1970 Mexico - Adidas Telstar: The Adidas Telstar was introduced during the 1970 World Cup in Mexico. It was the first football to have a 32-panel design featuring 12 black pentagonal and 20 white hexagonal panels. This ball was named after the Telstar communications satellite as its pattern resembled the satellite's appearance. The black and white pattern was specifically chosen to enhance visibility on television. 2. 1974 Germany - Adidas Telstar Durlast: This ball was an updated version of the original Telstar with a more durable external layer, making it more resistant to water absorption. The design retained the iconic black and white colors. 3. 1978 Argentina - Adidas Tango España: This ball was introduced in the 1978 World Cup held in Argentina. The Adidas Tango España retained the 32-panel design, but introduced a new and visually appealing triangular graphic pattern. This iconic design made a significant impact and set the trend for future football designs. 4. 1982 Spain - Adidas Tango España: Though it shared its name with the 1978 version, this ball included improvements in its waterproofing capabilities. It featured a rubberized, sealed-seam, and polyurethane coating, making it more durable and water-resistant. 5. 1986 Mexico - Adidas Azteca: The 1986 World Cup saw the introduction of the Adidas Azteca, which was the first synthetic leather ball used in a World Cup. The ball consisted of a unique Aztec-inspired design to represent the host nation, Mexico. The use of synthetic leather increased the ball's durability and water resistance. 6. 1990 Italy - Adidas Etrusco Unico: The Etrusco Unico celebrated the rich history of Italy with its Etruscan lion design. It was built with an internal layer of black polyurethane foam which improved the ball's resilience and made it softer and more responsive to touch. 7. 1994 United States - Adidas Questra: The name 'Questra' was derived from a combination of the words \\"quest\\" and \\"star.\\" The Adidas Questra featured a space-inspired design, referring to America's advancements in space technology. A layer of polystyrene foam was incorporated, which increased the ball's velocity and control upon striking. 8. 1998 France - Adidas Tricolore: This ball was a tribute to the French flag, featuring blue and red colors on a white background. The Adidas Tricolore was constructed with a foam layer and a more advanced synthetic material, improving its performance and making it even more water-resistant. 9. 2002 South Korea & Japan - Adidas Fevernova: The Fevernova was introduced with a completely new design, featuring a gold, red, and black color scheme. The ball incorporated a refined syntactic foam layer which offered enhanced accuracy, control, and a more predictable flight trajectory. 10. 2006 Germany - Adidas Teamgeist: This ball featured a 14-panel design, a significant reduction from the traditional 32 panels. This change resulted in a smoother surface with fewer seams, enhancing the ball's precision and control. The ball had a patriotic black, red, and gold color scheme to represent the host nation. 11. 2010 South Africa - Adidas Jabulani: The Jabulani, meaning 'to celebrate' in Zulu, incorporated an 8-panel design with grip-enhancing micro-texture and a unique 3D structure. This ball was known for its unpredictable flight, prompting criticism from some players and goalkeepers. 12. 2014 Brazil - Adidas Brazuca: The Brazuca featured a vibrant color scheme and a 6-panel design. It underwent extensive tests and proved to perform more consistently in terms of flight pattern and control. Its name was chosen by the Brazilian public through an online poll. 13. 2018 Russia - Adidas Telstar 18: The Telstar 18 was a modern reinvention of the original Telstar design. It featured a 6-panel structure and a textured surface for better grip and control.

Process: - They expand to take the air in - The cells of the lung hold the air - They take in the air and remove the Oxygen - They inflate and all the bad air leaves through the mouth - They do it all over again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the liver is not able to filter happens, how will it affect lung continuously expands to make more oxygen. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The process described outlines the key steps involved in the human respiratory system's functioning, which are primarily centered around the lungs. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining an adequate supply of oxygen, critical for the body's functioning, and disposing of carbon dioxide, a metabolic waste product. To better understand the process, let's break it down into several stages: 1. Inhalation: During this phase, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, resulting in increased space for the lungs to expand. This expansion draws air into the lungs through the nose and mouth. 2. Gas exchange: The bronchi, bronchioles, and alveoli within the lungs facilitate the passing of inhaled oxygen into the bloodstream and the movement of waste carbon dioxide from the bloodstream back into the lungs. 3. Transportation: Once the oxygen has entered the bloodstream, it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, which deliver it to cells throughout the body. Simultaneously, cells release carbon dioxide as a byproduct of metabolism, which is transported back to the lungs. 4. Exhalation: The diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, reducing the available space within the chest cavity and causing the lungs to contract, pushing the carbon dioxide-laden air out of the body. The perturbation hypothesis in question proposes that the liver's inability to filter properly might impact the lungs' ability to expand and generate more oxygen. While it is true that the liver plays a crucial role in detoxifying the blood, synthesizing proteins, and metabolizing nutrients, it does not have a direct impact on lung functioning and expansion. However, there may be indirect effects. If the liver is unable to filter toxins effectively, this may lead to the buildup of harmful substances in the blood. As the blood transports oxygen and nutrients throughout the body, poor liver function could result in less efficient systemic oxygen delivery as dangerous substances accumulate. This systemic dysfunction could stress the body as a whole, possibly even increasing the body's demand for oxygen and causing the lungs to work harder. Furthermore, if the liver fails to efficiently metabolize nutrients, it may affect the body's energy production, which could ultimately result in decreased muscular efficiency, including the muscles used during respiration (e.g., the diaphragm and intercostal muscles). This weakening could affect the ability to expand the lungs fully or maintain steady breathing patterns. Thus, although the liver's impaired filtration capacity does not directly alter the lungs' ability to continuously expand and generate oxygen, it may indirectly influence the efficiency of the respiratory process through systemic dysfunction and compromised energy production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Von Ryan's Express Movie plot: August 1943- Nazi-occupied Italy. An American P-38 Lightning fighter plane with smoke trailing from one of its engines sputters and loses altitude above an Italian coastal town. A pair of German officers abruptly interrupt their lunch to catch up with the rapidly descending plane. When the Germans arrive at the crash site, they encounter a burning fuselage surrounded by Italian soldiers. The soldiers explain that the pilot was killed in the crash. Satisfied, the Germans leave. As soon as they are gone, the Italians mock their imperious occupiers and part ranks to reveal a hidden and slightly injured American flyer, Colonel Joseph Ryan (Frank Sinatra).Ryan is taken to an Italian POW camp filled with British and American prisoners. Italian discipline over the camp is lax and the prisoners are filthy and ragged. Constant escape attempts have enraged the Italian commandant and resulted in the withholding of clean clothes, hot water, razors, and food parcels. The ranking British officer has just died while imprisoned in the camp sweat box. Command has fallen to the irascible British Major Fincham (Trevor Howard) of the Ninth Fusiliers. The pragmatic Ryan and the inflexible Major Fincham immediately clash, with Ryan outranking Fincham and able to coutermand his orders.With the Americans only weeks from liberating the camp, Ryan wants all futile escape attempts stopped. He betrays the active escape tunnels to the Italian commandant, Major Battaglia (Adolfo Celi), earning both the enmity of the British prisoners and the scornful nickname \\"Von Ryan.\\" As a reward for Ryan's cooperation, Battaglia turns the showers back on and issues razors and Red Cross parcels. But he balks at issuing clean clothing, since he is selling the donated clothes on the black market. Ryan orders the men to strip and burn their filthy clothes. As punishment, Ryan is placed in the sweat box while the men receive their clean clothing.Some time later, Ryan's fellow inmates release him from the box with the welcome news that the Allies have...

Plot title: More American Graffiti Movie plot: The film, set over the course of four consecutive New Year's Eves from 1964 to 1967, depicts scenes from each of these years, intertwined with one another as though events happen simultaneously. The audience is protected from confusion by the use of a distinct cinematic style for each section. For example, the 1966 sequences echo the movie of Woodstock using split screens and multiple angles of the same event simultaneously on screen, the 1965 sequences (set in Vietnam) shot hand-held on grainy super 16 mm film designed to resemble war reporters' footage. The film attempts to memorialize the 1960s with sequences that recreate the sense and style of those days with references to Haight-Ashbury, the campus peace movement, the beginnings of the modern woman's liberation movement and the accompanying social revolt. One character burned his draft card, showing a younger audience what so many Americans had done on the television news ten years before the movie's release. Other characters are shown frantically disposing of their marijuana before a traffic stop as a police officer pulls them over, and another scene shows the police brutality with billy clubs during an anti-Vietnam protest. The listed fates of the main characters at the ending sequence of American Graffiti were updated again at the end of this sequel. In More American Graffiti, John Milner was revealed to have been killed by a drunk driver in December 1964, with the ending scene of the movie driving his trademark yellow Deuce at night on a lonely, hilly highway toward another vehicle's headlights. After disappearing over a small hill, neither his taillights nor the approaching car's headlights are seen again, hinting that the fatal crash occurred there. Set on New Year's Eve 1964, it is never actually shown that his tragic end comes after his racing win on the last day of the year, very probably instead into the first few moments of 1965, given that the 1967 segment was just barely into 1968.

Q:Information: - A proton is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with a positive electric charge of +1\\"e\\" elementary charge and mass slightly less than that of a neutron. Protons and neutrons, each with masses of approximately one atomic mass unit, are collectively referred to as \\"nucleons\\". One or more protons are present in the nucleus of every atom. They are a necessary part of the nucleus. The number of protons in the nucleus is the defining property of an element, and is referred to as the atomic number (represented by the symbol Z). Since each element has a unique number of protons, each element has its own unique atomic number. The word \\"proton\\" is Greek for \\"first\\", and this name was given to the hydrogen nucleus by Ernest Rutherford in 1920. In previous years, Rutherford had discovered that the hydrogen nucleus (known to be the lightest nucleus) could be extracted from the nuclei of nitrogen by atomic collisions. Protons were therefore a candidate to be a fundamental particle, and hence a building block of nitrogen and all other heavier atomic nuclei. - The neutron is a subatomic particle, symbol or , with no net electric charge and a mass slightly larger than that of a proton. Protons and neutrons, each with mass approximately one atomic mass unit, constitute the nucleus of an atom, and they are collectively referred to as nucleons. Their properties and interactions are described by nuclear physics. - Angina pectoris, commonly known as angina, is the sensation of chest pain, pressure, or squeezing, often due to not enough blood flow to the heart muscle as a result of obstruction or spasm of the coronary arteries. While angina pectoris can occur due to anemia, abnormal heart rhythms and heart failure, its main cause is coronary artery disease, an atherosclerotic process affecting the arteries feeding the heart. The term derives from the Latin \\"angere\\" (\\"to strangle\\") and \\"pectus\\" (\\"chest\\"), and can therefore be translated as \\"a strangling feeling in the chest\\". - Tritium (or ; symbol ' or ', also known as hydrogen-3) is a radioactive isotope of hydrogen. The nucleus of tritium (sometimes called a triton) contains one proton and two neutrons, whereas the nucleus of protium (by far the most abundant hydrogen isotope) contains one proton and no neutrons. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare on Earth, where trace amounts are formed by the interaction of the atmosphere with cosmic rays. It is produced by irradiating lithium metal in a nuclear reactor. Tritium is used as a radioactive tracer, in radioluminescent light sources for watches and instruments, and in nuclear weapons. The name of this isotope is formed from the Greek word (\\"trítos\\") meaning \\"third\\". - A radioactive tracer, or radioactive label, is a chemical compound in which one or more atoms have been replaced by a radioisotope so by virtue of its radioactive decay it can be used to explore the mechanism of chemical reactions by tracing the path that the radioisotope follows from reactants to products. Radiolabeling is thus the radioactive form of isotopic labeling. - Lithium (from , \\"stone\\") is a chemical element with the symbol Li and atomic number 3. It is a soft, silver-white metal belonging to the alkali metal group of chemical elements. Under standard conditions, it is the lightest metal and the least dense solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly reactive and flammable. For this reason, it is typically stored in mineral oil. When cut open, it exhibits a metallic luster, but contact with moist air corrodes the surface quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. Because of its high reactivity, lithium never occurs freely in nature, and instead, appears only in compounds, which are usually ionic. Lithium occurs in a number of pegmatitic minerals, but due to its solubility as an ion, is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from brines and clays. On a commercial scale, lithium is isolated electrolytically from a mixture of lithium chloride and potassium chloride. - AstraZeneca plc is a BritishSwedish multinational pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical company. In 2013 it moved its headquarters to Cambridge, England, and concentrated its R&D in three sites: Cambridge, Gaithersburg, Maryland (location of MedImmune) for work on biopharmaceuticals, and Mölndal (near Gothenburg) in Sweden, for research on traditional chemical drugs. In 2015 it was the eighth largest drug company in the world based on sales revenue. - Alprenolol, or alfeprol, alpheprol, and alprenololum (Gubernal, Regletin, Yobir, Apllobal, Aptine, Aptol Duriles), is a non-selective beta blocker as well as 5-HT receptor antagonist, used in the treatment of angina pectoris. It is no longer marketed by AstraZeneca, but may still be available from other pharmaceutical companies or generically. - A nuclear reactor, formerly known as an atomic pile, is a device used to initiate and control a sustained nuclear chain reaction. Nuclear reactors are used at nuclear power plants for electricity generation and in propulsion of ships. Heat from nuclear fission is passed to a working fluid (water or gas), which runs through steam turbines. These either drive a ship's propellers or turn electrical generators. Nuclear generated steam in principle can be used for industrial process heat or for district heating. Some reactors are used to produce isotopes for medical and industrial use, or for production of weapons-grade plutonium. Some are run only for research.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: magnolia and a tree with white flowers","completion":"In the sentence, \\"magnolia and a tree with white flowers\\", the most important words are \\"magnolia\\", \\"tree\\", and \\"white flowers\\". Here's a breakdown of why these words hold significance in this context: 1. Magnolia - This word serves as the central focus of the sentence. A magnolia is a type of tree known for its beautiful, fragrant flowers that come in various colors, including white. By mentioning the magnolia, the author is most likely referring to the tree's appearance, its flowers, or the specific environment where it typically grows. Magnolias provide visual appeal and can greatly improve the aesthetic of a garden or landscape, making them an important choice for gardeners and homeowners. 2. Tree - The word \\"tree\\" is crucial in this sentence as it helps to establish what kind of magnolia is being referred to; in this case, the magnolia tree. The tree also indicates that the subject of the sentence is plant-related and that the author might be talking about plant or tree species, landscapes, or gardening. Trees are vital to the earth's ecosystem and provide a myriad of benefits such as purifying the air, providing habitats for wildlife, preventing soil erosion, and offering shade to humans. 3. White flowers - The term \\"white flowers\\" contributes significantly to the visual descriptor of the subject in question. By specifying that the tree has white flowers, a reader can better visualize the tree being discussed. The mention of white flowers could also imply that the author is talking about a specific type of magnolia or tree – one with white blossoms. White flowers are symbolically associated with purity, innocence, and elegance, which might contribute to their significance in this context. In summary, \\"magnolia\\", \\"tree\\", and \\"white flowers\\" are the most important words in the sentence, as they give the reader a better understanding of the subject and help paint a vivid picture of the tree being described. These words provide insight into plant characteristics and set the stage for possible further discussions about botany, gardening, or landscape design."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What nurtures frogs, lizards and various insects? Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the...

If \\"The young boy pedals quickly at a BMX race.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The boy is about to win the race.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"The boy is about to win the race\\" just because \\"The young boy pedals quickly at a BMX race.\\" While pedaling quickly does show that the boy is putting in effort and displaying speed, there still exists a multitude of factors that contribute to the outcome of a race and whether or not he is about to win. Here are some reasons why the initial statement doesn't guarantee that the boy is about to win the race: 1. Competition: We don't have information about the skills, speed, and performance of other racers participating in the BMX race. It's possible that other racers are pedaling just as fast or even faster than the young boy. Therefore, the boy's quick pedaling does not guarantee a victory in the race. 2. Race progress: We don't know how far along the race is or how many laps are left to complete. Even if the boy is leading in a particular lap or moment of the race, we cannot determine if he will maintain his lead or if he can endure the entire race. 3. Race conditions: The statement does not provide information on the race course, including terrain, obstacles, and weather conditions that could affect the boy's performance and, in turn, his chances of winning the race. BMX races occur on various courses with differing levels of difficulty, and these factors will contribute to the outcome of the race. 4. Strategy and tactics: In many athletic competitions, strategy and tactics play significant roles in overall performance and winning. We don't know if the young boy has a good strategy or if he can adapt to the unfolding race situation. 5. Fatigue and endurance: Pedaling quickly may or may not be sustainable for the entire race, depending on the boy's physical condition, fitness, and experience. He could potentially experience fatigue or exhaustion, which could negatively impact his chances of winning. 6. Unforeseen events: Accidents, mechanical issues, or other unexpected occurrences could happen during the race, potentially impacting the young boy's performance and chances of winning. For example, he could fall or his bike might malfunction, which could affect his position in the race. In conclusion, despite the fact that \\"The young boy pedals quickly at a BMX race,\\" it does not logically follow that \\"The boy is about to win the race.\\" There are many influencing factors, such as competition, race progress, race conditions, strategy, fatigue, endurance, and unforeseen events that could determine the outcome of the race.

Article: Vaginitis and vulvovaginitis are the medical terms which describe an inflammation of the vagina and/or vulva from bacteria, viruses, or chemical irritants contained in creams, soaps and lotions. Bacterial vaginosis is often the result of normal bacteria in the vagina growing at abnormal rates. There are some steps you can take to reduce your chances of developing vaginitis. Do not douche. Douching changes the pH of the environment in the vagina and increases the risk of a bacterial infection. Limit yourself to one sexual partner. Those with multiple sexual partners are at a higher risk of developing bacterial vaginosis. Do not smoke. Smoking is associated with increased risk of developing a bacterial infection in the vagina. Bacterial infections in the throat are called pharyngitis. This refers to the inflammation and infection of the pharynx, or the back of the throat. There are specific strategies you can take to reduce the potential that you will get a throat infection. Wash your hands after you’ve been in public or have been around anyone who has an upper respiratory condition. Wash your hands after blowing your own nose or caring for a child with a runny nose and/or sore throat. Do not share eating or drinking utensils with children or with an adult who appears to have a throat infection or a sore throat. Keep a sick person’s utensils separate from the rest and wash them thoroughly with hot, soapy water. Wash any toys that a toddler with pharyngitis has been playing with. Use hot soapy water, rinse well, and then dry thoroughly. Dispose of any used tissues right away. Avoid kissing or sharing eating utensils with someone who has the flu, a cold, mononucleosis, or a known bacterial infection. Do not smoke and avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Use a humidifier if the air in your home is dry. Keeping your neck warm with a scarf during colder months can also protect you by keeping a body temperature that is less hospitable to bacterial and viral growth. Pneumonia is an infection in the lungs which can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. This infection is very serious and can cause death. Some groups of people are at higher risk of developing pneumonia and should practice preventative measures carefully. Take extra precautions if you: Smoke cigarettes or use other tobacco products Have recently had a respiratory infection such as the flu, a cold, or laryngitis Have a medical condition which impairs your ability to swallow, such as a stroke, dementia, or Parkinson’s disease Suffer from chronic lung conditions such as cystic fibrosis, COPD, or bronchiectasis Have other serious medical conditions such as heart disease, liver cirrhosis, or diabetes Have recently had surgery or a physical trauma Have a weakened immune system from an underlying medical condition or certain medications Children are more likely to suffer from internal ear infections, which are painful and can lead to other health problems. You may be able to reduce your child’s chances of getting a middle ear infection by following some simple suggestions. Do not smoke in your home or around children. Ear infections are more common in children who are exposed to secondhand smoke. If possible, breastfeed your children when they are infants. Breast feeding helps develop a stronger immune system, which reduces the risk of ear infections. Never let your baby drink from a bottle while he or she is lying down. Because of the structure of the ears and tube which drains the middle ear, lying down while drinking significantly increases the risk of an ear infection. Reduce your child’s exposure to other children who are sick. Keep your child’s hands clean and washed, as children often enjoy putting their hands in their mouths. Swimmer’s ear is an infection in the outer ear canal triggered by water remaining in the outer ear which creates a warm, moist environment for bacterial growth. This is also known as acute external otitis or otitis externa. To reduce your chances of developing swimmer’s ear: Keep your ears dry after swimming and bathing. Dry your outer ear with a soft towel or cloth. Tip your head to one side and then the other to assist water to drain out. Dry the ear canal with a hair dryer on the lowest setting and holding it at least one foot from your head. Do not put foreign objects in the ear such as cotton swabs, paper clips, or hairpins. Put cotton balls in your ears when you apply irritating products such as hair sprays and hair dyes. Bacterial infections can also affect your brain. Between 2003-2007, there were 4,100 cases of bacterial meningitis each year, including 500 deaths. Antibiotic treatments improve survival rates, lowering the risk of dying from meningitis to below 15%, but prevention with vaccination works best. Take the following steps to help reduce your risk of contracting bacterial meningitis: Wash your hands often. Do not share drinks, eating utensils, lip balms, or toothbrushes with anyone. Maintain a good immune system by getting at least seven to eight hours of sleep each night, drinking at least 64 ounces of water each day, getting 30 minutes of exercise each day, taking a multivitamin and eating a well-balanced diet. Consider getting vaccinated against bacterial meningitis. Some forms of bacterial meningitis are preventable with vaccinations. Ask your doctor about getting vaccinated to help protect yourself. Bacterial meningitis can be spread through airborne droplets, so if you know anyone who has bacterial meningitis, it is best to avoid close contact, and to wear a face mask. Septicemia or sepsis is uncontrolled bacterial infection blood. When bacteria is growing in the blood it can also infect other organ systems in the body, such as the kidneys, pancreas, liver, and spleen. Different types of infections can lead to sepsis, such as those on the skin, lungs, urinary tract, and abdomen, or it can be a primary infection in the blood. Some people are at higher risk of developing sepsis, including people who have a weakened immune system, infants and children, elderly people, those with a chronic illness such as diabetes, cancer, liver disease or HIV/AIDS, and people who have suffered from a severe physical trauma or severe burn. Take extra precautions if you are at risk. You can help to prevent sepsis through preventing other primary bacterial infections, helping to boost your immune system, and taking care of any chronic health conditions.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.

Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

Q: Article: In modem society there is a great deal of argument about competition.Some value it highly,believing that it is responsible for social progress and prosperity.Others say that competition is bad, that it sets one person against another and that it leads to unfriendly relationship between people. I have taught many children who held the belief that their self-worth relied on how well they performed at tennis and other skills.For them,playing well and winning are often life-and-death affair. In their single-minded pursuit of success,the development of many other human qualities is sadly forgotten. However,while some seem to be lost in the desire to succeed,others take an opposite attitude.In a culture which values only the winner and pays no attention to the ordinary players,they strongly blame competition.Among _ are youngsters who have suffered under competitive pressures from their parents or society.Teaching these young people,I often observe in them a desire to fail.They seem to seek failure by not trying to win or achieve success .By not trying,they always have an excuse:\\"I may have lost,but it doesn't matter because I really didn't try.'' What is not usually admitted by themselves is the belief that if they had really tried and lost,that would mean a lot.Such a loss would be a measure of their worth. Clearly,this belief is the same as that of the true competitors who try to prove themselves.Both are based on the mistaken belief that one's self-respect relies on how well one performs in comparison with others.Both are afraid of not being valued.Only as this basic and often troublesome fear begins to dissolve can we discover a new meaning in competition.

Based on the premise \\"Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence's head.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands. \\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence's head,\\" we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands\\" is true. In fact, the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis. Here we have a detailed analysis: 1. Understanding the premise: The statement given is explicit in mentioning that \\"Her outstretched hand pointed over Tuppence's head.\\" This clearly conveys that the person in question has at least one hand, which she outstretched and pointed over Tuppence's head. At this point, we can infer that she possesses the physical ability to move her hand and point towards something, as demonstrated by her action in the premise. 2. Analyzing the hypothesis: The hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands\\" negates the presence of any hands for the person in question. According to this hypothesis, she would not be capable of any hand-related actions or movement since she supposedly doesn't have any hands. 3. Contradiction between premise and hypothesis: The premise mentioned earlier explicitly contradicts the hypothesis. The premise clearly describes a scene where the person performed a hand-related action, which indicates the existence of at least one hand. On the other hand, the hypothesis negates the presence of any hands altogether. 4. Conclusion: Considering the analysis above, we can infer that the hypothesis \\"She didn't have any hands\\" is not true based on the given premise. The premise itself provides evidence that contradicts the hypothesis, thereby disproving it.

Several kilometers deep, they obscure the underlying topography. Only nunataks protrude from their surfaces. The only extant ice sheets are the two that cover most of Antarctica and Greenland. They contain vast quantities of fresh water, enough that if both melted, global sea levels would rise by over 70 m (230 ft). Portions of an ice sheet or cap that extend into water are called ice shelves; they tend to be thin with limited slopes and reduced velocities. Narrow, fast-moving sections of an ice sheet are called ice streams. In Antarctica, many ice streams drain into large ice shelves. Some drain directly into the sea, often with an ice tongue, like Mertz Glacier.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What town could you take a tour of the Chalcedony Forest from?, using the article: After the Southwest became part of the U.S., explorers continued to look for good east–west routes along the 35th parallel. In 1853, a crew led by U.S. Army Lieutenant Amiel Whipple surveyed along a sandy wash in the northern part of the Petrified Forest. So impressed was Whipple by the petrified wood along the banks of the arroyo that he named it Lithodendron Creek (Stone Tree Creek). Geologist Jules Marcou, a member of the Whipple expedition, observed that the petrified trees were from the Triassic.A slightly later route along the parallel was a wagon road, built between 1857 and 1860, that involved experimental use of camels as transport. In the late 19th century, settlers and private stagecoach companies followed similar east–west routes. Homesteaders who stayed in the area developed cattle ranches on the grasslands, and cattle grazed in the Petrified Forest until the mid-20th century.Also close to the 35th parallel was the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad. Its opening in the early 1880s led to the founding of towns like Holbrook and Adamana. Visitors could stop at the Adamana train station, book a hotel room, and take a tour of what was then called the Chalcedony Forest. Over the years, the line changed hands, becoming the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, and then the BNSF. More than 60 BNSF trains, mostly carrying freight, pass through the park every day. U.S. Route 66, a former transcontinental auto highway developed in 1926 from part of the National Old Trails Road, ran parallel to the railroad tracks until it was decommissioned in 1985. The park has preserved within its boundaries a small grassy section of the road. Interstate 40, which crosses the park, replaced the older highway., what would be the answer ? The answer is:","completion":"The answer is: Visitors could take a tour of the Chalcedony Forest from the town of Adamana. Step 1: Identify the key information in the given article.

Given the question: Given the background: The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court! and the situation: Robert and John both went to the doctor because they had been having stomach problems. The doctor decided to take images of the men's jejunum to try and diagnose the issues. He discovered that Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John. Answer the following question: Who has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients? The answer is:","completion":"Robert has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients. Step 1: Understand the background information From the given background, we know that the jejunum is the part of the small intestine responsible for nutrient absorption. The villi, which are tiny fingerlike projections, increase the surface area for absorption in the jejunum. Step 2: Analyze the situation In the situation, both Robert and John went to the doctor with stomach problems. Images of their jejunum were taken to diagnose the issues. Step 3: Compare the number of villi According to the discovered information, Robert has more villi covering his jejunum than John. Step 4: Relate the number of villi to the surface area As mentioned in the background information, the presence of a greater number of villi increases the surface area for absorption. Step 5: Determine who has more surface area for absorption Since Robert has more villi in his jejunum compared to John, it means Robert has a larger surface area available for the absorption of nutrients."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them. Now, I have a new situation: Bob and Andy were two nature enthusiasts. They went camping together once a month. Bob was into bird watching, while Andy was fascinated with frogs and salamanders. They went on a trip last week-end and they were very happy with what they had observed. Answer this question please: Which friend heard more males producing a mating call? The answer is:","completion":"Andy. Step-by-step justification: 1. The background information provided is about frog mating calls. Specifically, it discusses that males produce these calls to attract females and that each frog species has a different call. 2. The new situation introduces two friends, Bob and Andy. Bob is interested in bird watching, while Andy is fascinated with frogs and salamanders. 3. Since Andy has a fascination with frogs and salamanders, he is more likely to be paying attention to and recognizing the mating calls of male frogs. On the other hand, Bob's interest in bird watching would lead him to focus more on the birds and their calls. 4. Therefore, Andy would be the friend who heard more males producing a mating call, as his focus and interest lie in observing and understanding frogs and their behavior, including their mating calls."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable. Write the sentence in natural language. Teacher: Now, understand the problem?

Movie title: The Kids Are All Right Movie plot: Nic (Annette Bening) and Jules (Julianne Moore) are a married lesbian couple living in the Los Angeles area. Nic is an obstetrician, and Jules is a housewife who is starting up a landscape design business. Each has given birth to a child using the same sperm donor. The younger child Laser (Josh Hutcherson) wants to find his sperm donor father but has to be 18 to do so. He implores his 18-year-old sister, Joni (Mia Wasikowska), to contact the sperm bank which identifies Paul (Mark Ruffalo) as the donor. The three meet. Joni is impressed by his bohemian lifestyle, and Paul becomes enthusiastic about being in their lives. Joni swears her brother to secrecy as she does not want to upset their mothers. However, Jules and Nic find out and invite Paul over to dinner. When Jules reveals she has a landscape business, Paul asks her to transform his back garden. Jules agrees, although Nic does not like the idea. While working for Paul, Jules likes that he appreciates her work in contrast to Nic who, Jules feels, never supported her career. Jules impulsively kisses Paul one afternoon, and they end up in bed together, beginning an affair. Jules and the kids start spending more time with Paul. Nic believes Paul undermines her authority over the children by, for example, giving Joni a ride on his motorcycleâwhich Nic has forbiddenâand by suggesting she give Joni more freedom.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. Question: \\"Who were on opposite sides of the idea to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center?\\" Answer: \\"FBI\\" Is this answer correct?","completion":"No, the answer is not correct. The opposite sides of the idea to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center were Richard Clarke, who pushed for the funding of such a center at the Treasury, and both the Treasury Department and the CIA, who were unwilling to commit the resources for it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hippocampus Translate to Russian","completion":"Гиппокамп Гиппокамп (или \\"морская лошадка\\") - это часть мозга, которая находится внутри его долей (височные доли) и является компонентом лимбической системы. Название гиппокамп происходит от греческих слов \\"hippos\\", означающего \\"лошадь\\", и \\"kampos\\", означающего \\"морской монстр\\". Это связано с формой этой структуры мозга, поскольку она напоминает морскую лошадку. Гиппокамп играет важную роль в процессе образования и сохранения долгосрочной памяти, особенно в явных или декларативных видах памяти, таких как факты или события. Когда поступающая информация доходит до гиппокампа, он помогает определить, следует ли хранить ее, как важную и значимую информацию, или же можно отбросить как что-то незначительное или неважное. Существует две симметричные части гиппокампа - правая и левая, каждая из которых выполняет разные функции. Правый гиппокамп отвечает за кодирование пространственной информации, а также связан с обработкой визуальных образов и эмоций. Левый гиппокамп, с другой стороны, отвечает за вербальную и языковую информацию. При некоторых заболеваниях, таких как альцгеймера, гиппокамп может страдать от дегенерации и потери нейронов, что приводит к снижению когнитивных функций и проблемам с памятью. В некоторых случаях, например, при постоянном стрессе, гиппокамп также может быть поврежден, вызывая затруднения в обучении и возникновении новых воспоминаний. Важно отметить, что гиппокамп не является единственной структурой мозга, отвечающей за факты, события и платоническую память. Факты обрабатываются неолимбическим кортом, события связываются с местами лобной коры, а эмоциональные аспекты памяти обрабатывает амигдала.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: For nearly 30 years, one man has dominated Egypt. Hosni Mubarak, 82, has survived would-be assassins and ill health, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed. His government's continued observance of the Camp David accords with Israel is the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. Following the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman, demonstrators in the streets of Cairo are standing up to riot police and chanting, \\"Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you.\\" Experienced observers say it's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet. It's far from clear, however, that the demonstrators have the support or the coordination to bring down the man critics have called Egypt's last pharaoh. \\"He's been in power a very long time, and he is very wily,\\" said Juan Cole, a Middle East historian at the University of Michigan. \\"He's developed all kinds of techiniques for dealing with opponents that have proven relatively successful.\\" But longtime observers of the region say the stability Mubarak has purchased has come at the cost of entrenched poverty and repression in the Arab world's most populous nation. \\"Egypt is a broken country,\\" Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern relations at the London School of Economics, told CNN. \\"It used to be the jewel of the Middle East. It's the capital of its cultural production.\\" But now, Gerges said, \\"Egyptians have no outlets. They don't feel that they have a sense of hope for the future.\\" Mubarak was a Soviet-trained pilot who was chief of staff of Egypt's air force during the 1973 Mideast war. The early success of Egyptian pilots against Israel made him a national hero, and then-President Anwar Sadat made him vice president in 1975. Six years later, Sadat died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade, killed by Islamic militants from within the army's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with Israel. Upon assuming office, one of Mubarak's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that allowed barred unauthorized assembly, restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely. He has made extensive use of those powers in the ensuing decades. The Egyptian army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986, and he threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists. \\"He pretty much wiped them out,\\" Cole said. \\"It's not an accident that they were in Afghanistan instead of Egypt.\\" And the government has also penetrated opposition movements so thoroughly that \\"If five people sit down to plot something, the fifth person writes a report to Hosni Mubarak about it,\\" he said. The result is \\"a regime that has very little legitimacy, but presents itself as something there's no point in trying to change,\\" said Nathan Brown, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at George Washington University in Washington. But Brown said the January 14 overthrow of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, who fled to Saudi Arabia after 23 years in power, has changed the thinking of many in the region. \\"I think what the events in Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. Mubarak has headed off a similar movement before, in 2005, when Egyptians mounted large-scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform. He intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated Muslim Brotherhood, harassed middle-class demonstrators and managed to pick off the leadership of those protests, Brown said. But the current movement \\"has no real leadership, so it can't be decapitated the same way,\\" he said. \\"If Mubarak decided tomorrow, 'I'll sit down and engage with you,' it's not clear who that 'you' is.\\" Mubarak won four terms as president in elections that were considered formalities. His fifth, in 2005, was Egypt's first multi-party presidential vote, but it was widely criticized as a \\"sham,\\" Cole said. Meanwhile, the country's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule. Development has picked up in the past decade, fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars, but its gains have been \\"very unevenly distributed.\\" About 40 percent of Egyptians currently live in poverty, Gerges said. The aging autocrat has escaped at least two assassination attempts, including a close call in 1995 when Islamic militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-African conference in Ethiopia. And in recent years, he has had several bouts of illness but has never picked a vice president. He is widely believed to have anointed his son Gamal as his successor, but no formal announcement has been made. In 2003, he collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the Egyptian parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu. He had back surgery in Germany in 2004, returning in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed. He has largely withdrawn from public view in recent years and has not addressed his country during the current crisis, Brown said. His situation is being closely watched overseas, particularly in the United States. In the past decade, Egypt has been major player in Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and it contributed troops to the U.S.-led coalition that drove Iraq out of Kuwait in 1991. It gets about 1.3 billion in military aid from Washington every year, second only to Israel, and has received nearly 30 billion in economic aid since 1975, according to State Department figures. But it opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 -- and while sticking with Camp David, Egypt's ties with Israel amount to a \\"cold peace,\\" Cole said. President Barack Obama noted Thursday that Mubarak has been \\"very helpful on a range of tough issues,\\" but he said he has pushed the Egyptian leader to take steps toward reform. \\"You can see these pent-up frustrations that are being displayed on the streets,\\" Obama said. He urged the Egyptian government to avoid resorting to violence to put down the demonstrations, adding, \\"I think it's very important that people have mechanisms in order to express legitimate grievances.\\" Brown said Mubarak probably has to endorse some political form to survive. But he will have to do it \\"extremely carefully, so it's not seen as a desperate measure of last resort.\\" Cole said Mubarak could bow to one of the protesters' demands and lift the state of emergency. \\"Egypt does have a fairly liberal constitution and it does enshrine a lot of rights in it,\\" he said. \\"But it's just a piece of paper. It's sidestepped by the emergency.\\" If lifted, \\"The judges and the courts in Egypt are very feisty, and they will take on the government.\\" He could also hold a free and fair presidential election this year, \\"but it's asking a lot,\\" Cole said. But Gerges said the Middle East has seen \\"the barrier of fear\\" removed since the events in Tunisia. \\"Arabs really no longer feel terrified of the security apparatus, regardless of whether Mubarak remains or goes,\\" he said. \\"We're going to have a new era of politics.\\"","completion":"Hosni Mubarak has been a powerful leader in Egypt for around 30 years. He has been able to stay in power and keep peace with a neighboring country called Israel, which is very important. People in Egypt have started to protest because they want a new leader and change in their country. They are inspired by the people in Tunisia who removed their leader as well. So far, Mubarak has been able to stay in power, but people think that he might have to make some changes to keep the people happy. Egypt is an important country, so everyone is watching closely to see what will happen."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Miss International (\\"Miss International Beauty\\" or \\"The International Beauty Pageant\\") is a Tokyo-based international beauty pageant organized by The International Culture Association.

Figures suggest millions were swept up by the frenzy into making purchases they did not want simply because goods were cheaper. More than £800million was spent online on Friday and £720 million on so-called Cyber Monday this week during the growing trend for websites and stores to offer pre-Christmas sales. But CollectPlus, a parcel rival to the Post Office, has seen a seen a 30 per cent rise in parcel returns this week compared to an average week. Scroll down for video. There were ugly scenes at shops last Friday as bargain-hungry shoppers fought over discount TVs. The fights came as £810million was spent online - with a similar amount taken by shops and supermarkets. Most appear to be hastily bought items from Black Friday and Cyber Monday, returned quickly by those hoping to get their money back in time to spend on Christmas. The post-Black Friday surge will result in an estimated 31 per cent of online purchases being returned, according to a survey of more than 2,000 adult customers. And it could cost British business up to £505 million in lost productivity and employee absence as the average customer will each spend 52 minutes returning parcels this Christmas, said the research. Almost one in five Britons have taken time off work to return a purchase, said CollectPlus CEO Neil Ashworth. The rush to buy online bargains caused a number of retailers' websites to crash under the strain. This Amazon warehouse in Peterborough, Cambridgeshire had to process millions of orders. Mr Ashworth said: 'With the increased enthusiasm for 'Black Friday' and 'Cyber Monday', we expect to see a sharp returns peak this week. 'Our research tells us that the average shopper is taking valuable time and losing money each year due to complicated or costly returns. 'As such, it is imperative that retailers have a robust model in place to ensure that customers can conveniently return any unwanted items and are quickly reimbursed.' The boom in online shopping has led to a sharp rise in the number of British shoppers returning purchases by post, as opposed to just going into a store for a refund or exchange. Natalie Berg, of research analysts Planet Retail, added: 'The frenzied nature of this year's Black Friday and, to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday events will have resulted in some panic buying. 'Having had time to reflect on whether such purchases are actually worth keeping, or indeed if it they were genuine bargains at all, many shoppers will be looking to return items this week.' But research suggests more than a third of items bought on the day of sales has now been returned. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This article is about how many items bought during Black Friday sales were returned by people who realized they didn't really want them. It says that around a third of the things bought on Black Friday were returned because people got too excited about the sales and bought things they didn't need. This has caused a big increase in the number of packages being returned and might cost businesses a lot of money. The article reminds us it is important for stores to have a good system for handling returns and helping customers get their money back."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are poorly scanned and blurry. The glossary is difficult to read and the maps are actually impossible. Some of the transliterations from futuristic cockney to written word were just wrong. For example \\"ol'\\", a dialect pronunciation for \\"whole\\" appeared on Kindle as the numeral \\"61.\\" This particular error happened with several words. I only discovered it because in my frustration to understand what Self was writing I got ahold of a hard copy text and tracked down the words.It is frustrating to read such a remarkable book and be unable to access the tools and even some of the language.

While the reviewer acknowledges that the book itself is great and amazing, they strongly discourage purchasing the book on Kindle due to the poor quality of the maps and glossary.

Write a title for this article: A few years ago a client, Peter, came to me and said, “I’m doing all the work, but my boss is making all the money. I could do this on my own, my way, and make a whole lot more.” Peter was an instructor at an acting studio. He was working long hours for someone else, knew the business inside and out, and felt stuck. He wanted a change. We talked through his dilemma. Peter wanted to know what he needed to do to venture out on his own and start his own acting academy. Many of us find ourselves daydreaming about making such a bold life change, but few of us do it. So what is stopping us from taking the leap? Why don’t we have the courage to invest in ourselves? Peter and his wife, Jeannie, sat down with me to chart out a plan. We determined that they needed four major boxes to be checked for Peter’s dream business to have a real shot at success: Let me break these down: 1. Support from the spouse: Peter and Jeannie had to be in full agreement that they were both ready to take on this new adventure together. In the beginning, they would have significant upfront investments in staffing, infrastructure, and signing a lease for the business. Money would be tight. 2. Cash reserves: Peter was concerned. “How much money can we free up for the startup costs?” he asked. We discussed the couple’s financial concerns, reviewed financial goals for their family, and acknowledged the trade-offs and sacrifices they would need to make. We determined a figure they were comfortable investing in their new business. Then we built a business plan around that number. 3. Business plan: It has been said that a goal without a plan is just a wish. Peter and Jeannie needed a written plan in place so that their wish could become a reality. Their business plan would serve as a step-by-step guide to building and growing the acting academy. It included projections for revenues, expenses, marketing strategies, and one-time costs. Once we wrote the business plan, we had one final step remaining: the step that so many of us don’t have the courage to take. Peter and Jeannie had to trust in themselves, believe in their plan, and… 4. Take the Leap: Regardless of how confident we are, how prepared we feel, and how much support we have, this is a scary step. We have to walk away from our reliable paycheck, go down an unfamiliar road, and head out into the unknown. I’m happy to share that Peter and Jeannie’s story is one of great success. They faced obstacles and bumps along the way, but Peter persevered and succeeded in accomplishing his goal. He is now running a thriving acting academy with multiple instructors and a growing staff. If you decide to invest in yourself, you will need to take the four steps too. Joe O’Boyle is a financial adviser with Voya Financial Advisors.

My grandmother knew just how I felt--And she knew the _ .Every week,she would send me a card with a 20 bill,a recipe and a list of what to buy at the market.It kept us bonded,and her recipes filled my body and soul. Over the years,I have grown to better understand my father's struggles with weight and the toll it took on him and those who love him.I have come to realize he was driven not by vanity or selfishness as much as by a deep pain.And in spite of growing up in such an unhealthy eating environment (or perhaps because of it),as an adult I found a passion and a career as a nutrition consultant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What act removed the inscription that included accusations against Catholics? Radical rebuilding schemes poured in for the gutted City and were encouraged by Charles. If it had been rebuilt under some of these plans, London would have rivalled Paris in Baroque magnificence (see Evelyn's plan on the right). The Crown and the City authorities attempted to establish \\"to whom all the houses and ground did in truth belong\\" to negotiate with their owners about compensation for the large-scale remodelling that these plans entailed, but that unrealistic idea had to be abandoned. Exhortations to bring workmen and measure the plots on which the houses had stood were mostly ignored by people worried about day-to-day survival, as well as by those who had left the capital; for one thing, with the shortage of labour following the fire, it was impossible to secure workmen for the purpose. Apart from Wren and Evelyn, it is known that Robert Hooke, Valentine Knight, and Richard Newcourt proposed rebuilding plans. With the complexities of ownership unresolved, none of the grand Baroque schemes could be realised for a City of piazzas and avenues; there was nobody to negotiate with, and no means of calculating how much compensation should be paid. Instead, much of the old street plan was recreated in the new City, with improvements in hygiene and fire safety: wider streets, open and accessible wharves along the length of the Thames, with no houses obstructing access to the river, and, most importantly, buildings constructed of brick and stone, not wood. New public buildings were created on their predecessors' sites; perhaps the most famous is St Paul's Cathedral and its smaller cousins, Christopher Wren's 50 new churches. On Charles' initiative, a Monument to the Great Fire of London was erected near Pudding Lane, designed by Christopher Wren and Robert Hooke, standing 61 metres (200 ft) tall and known simply as \\"The Monument\\". It is a familiar London landmark which has since given its name to a tube station. In 1668, accusations against the Catholics were added to the inscription on the Monument which... Answer:","completion":"The act that removed the inscription that included accusations against Catholics was the Roman Catholic Relief Act of 1829.

Question: This article: The Sitwells looked after their protégé both materially and culturally, giving him not only a home but a stimulating cultural education. He took music lessons with Ernest Ansermet, Ferruccio Busoni and Edward J. Dent. He attended the Russian ballet, met Stravinsky and Gershwin, heard the Savoy Orpheans at the Savoy Hotel and wrote an experimental string quartet heavily influenced by the Second Viennese School that was performed at a festival of new music at Salzburg in 1923. Alban Berg heard the performance and was impressed enough to take Walton to meet Arnold Schoenberg, Berg's teacher and the founder of the Second Viennese School.In 1923, in collaboration with Edith Sitwell, Walton had his first great success, though at first it was a succès de scandale. Façade was first performed in public at the Aeolian Hall, London, on 12 June. The work consisted of Edith's verses, which she recited through a megaphone from behind a screen, while Walton conducted an ensemble of six players in his accompanying music. The press was generally condemnatory. Walton's biographer Michael Kennedy cites as typical a contemporary headline: \\"Drivel That They Paid to Hear\\". The Daily Express loathed the work, but admitted that it was naggingly memorable. The Manchester Guardian wrote of \\"relentless cacophony\\". The Observer condemned the verses and dismissed Walton's music as \\"harmless\\". In The Illustrated London News, Dent was much more appreciative: \\"The audience was at first inclined to treat the whole thing as an absurd joke, but there is always a surprisingly serious element in Miss Sitwell's poetry and Mr Walton's music ... which soon induced the audience to listen with breathless attention.\\" In The Sunday Times, Ernest Newman said of Walton, \\"as a musical joker he is a jewel of the first water\\".Among the audience were Evelyn Waugh, Virginia Woolf and Noël Coward. The last was so outraged by the avant-garde nature of Sitwell's verses and the staging, that he marched out ostentatiously during the performance.

Movie plot: Dean is a 22 year old waiter at \\"Shenaniganz,\\" a restaurant with a colorful crew and an irreverent disdain for the customer. He is stuck in the point of his life which makes him crave more than a crappy job at a restaurant and a couple classes per semester. When he is offered the job of assistant manager, he is forced to consider the potential benefits/disadvantages of accepting, beating himself up over the fact that his high school classmate recently graduated as an electrical engineer -- a fact his mother reminded him of at their lunch meeting at the start of the movie.Along with his roommate, Dean lives in a house that is the constant host of parties for everyone working at the restaurant, which only makes him wonder even more about his place in life.Dean's roommate Monty is an individual extremely concerned with his getting of the poontang, and throughout the course of the movie his comments are lewd, in-your-face reminders of his sexual perversion and infinite coolness. Monty's current objective is the underage hostess at the restaurant, Natasha, who provokes incessantly an occurrence of statuatory rape between the two [however, when the chance does finally arrive for Monty, he wusses out because she is too young].The movie takes place during Mitch's first day and the nature of things in the restaurant is displayed as Monty tours him around, yet never lets him speak.

The game involves creating different shapes and forms with their genitals and, if the other player looks, they get one or more kicks in the ass. Apart from the \\"penis-showing game,\\" the waiters engage in humorous and sarcastic banter with each other, often making fun of their customers behind their backs. They deal with their boredom and dissatisfaction by building relationships with their co-workers and creating drama in the workplace. Some also engage in flirtatious and sexual behavior, like Monty, whose goal is to seduce the underage hostess, Natasha. Other characters, like the busboys Nick and T-dawg, spend their time near the dumpsters, eating discarded vegetables while getting high. The bartenders, a sultry lesbian and a sexy woman dating the cook Raddimus, provide drinks for the crew and contribute to the overall raunchy atmosphere. The Bishop, a resident philosopher/therapist, offers wisdom and advice to whoever needs it. As the movie progresses, the protagonist Dean wrestles with the decision to accept a promotion to assistant manager or seek out better opportunities, as he feels that he's stuck in a dead-end job. The story revolves around the chaotic shenanigans at the restaurant and the characters' attempts to make their work life more bearable and amusing while dealing with their own personal dilemmas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers.

Rhyme plays a significant role throughout the Quran, particularly in the earlier Meccan suras, where shorter verses emphasize the rhyming words. This effective form can be observed in examples such as Sura 81. The Quran's rhythmic language, with its changes in rhyme and emphasis on particular words, undoubtedly had a powerful impact on the conscience of its listeners.

It implies that while there might be other transportation options in Sultanpur, there isn't a railway station directly located in or serving Kadipur airport. It suggests that there is some form of bus service between Sultanpur and Kadipur airport, but the railway station is not a part of it.

Q:I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall.

Additionally, the liver continues to perform various other functions essential for the body to maintain overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can I stop some of my tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists? Is it possible to tweet on Twitter lists? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"1. Can I stop some of my tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists? Twitter lists are a feature that allows users to curate and organize accounts they find interesting or relevant into specific categories. As a user, you can create your own lists or follow others' lists. However, once your account is added to a list by someone else, you have no control over which of your tweets will appear in that list's timeline. The whole purpose of the Twitter lists is to allow users to view tweets from the selected group of accounts without any filtering based on content or individual tweets. Unfortunately, as the account owner, you cannot stop some of your tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists because it is not a functionality provided by Twitter. If you want to prevent your tweets from being visible to specific users, you can set your account to private. This makes your tweets visible only to your approved followers. Nevertheless, keep in mind that this method would also limit your overall visibility on the platform. 2. Is it possible to tweet on Twitter lists? You cannot directly tweet on a Twitter list; lists are simply a tool for organizing and curating Twitter accounts into a specific category. When you tweet as usual from your account, your tweets would be visible to everyone following you or the list(s) you are a part of. To engage with users on a specific list, you can do the following: - Visit the list's timeline and interact with the tweets there (like, retweet, and/or reply to the tweets). - Mention the users from the list in your tweets so that the conversation involves them. - Create a hashtag relevant to the list's topic and use that hashtag in your tweets. Encourage others to use the same hashtag, inspiring conversations around the list's theme. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? No, the two questions you posed do not have the same meaning. The first question asks if you can prevent certain tweets from appearing in specific Twitter lists, whereas the second question inquires if it is possible to tweet directly within a Twitter list. In summary, you cannot selectively prevent some of your tweets from appearing in certain Twitter lists, nor can you directly tweet on a Twitter list. Twitter lists serve as a means of organizing and curating content by grouping specific accounts under a theme or category. Posting and managing tweets still occurs through your main account without any direct connection to the list itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He was also known as the Gray Man , the Werewolf of Wysteria , the Brooklyn Vampire , the Moon Maniac , and The Boogey Man . A child rapist and cannibal , he boasted that he \`\` had children in every state '' , and at one time stated the number was about 100 . However , it is not known whether he was referring to rapes or cannibalization , nor is it known if the statement was truthful . He was a suspect in at least five murders during his lifetime . Fish confessed to three murders that police were able to trace to a known homicide , and he confessed to stabbing at least two other people . He was put on trial for the kidnapping and murder of Grace Budd , and was convicted and executed by electric chair . - Capital punishment, also known as the death penalty, is a government sanctioned practice whereby a person is put to death by the state as a punishment for a crime. The sentence that someone be punished in such a manner is referred to as a death sentence, whereas the act of carrying out the sentence is known as an execution. Crimes that are punishable by death are known as capital crimes or capital offences, and commonly include offences such as murder, treason, espionage, war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide. The term \\"capital\\" is derived from the Latin \\"capitalis\\" (\\"of the head\\", referring to execution by beheading). - Manslaughter is a legal term for homicide considered by law as less culpable than murder. The distinction between murder and manslaughter is sometimes said to have first been made by the Ancient Athenian lawmaker Draco in the 7th century BCE. - Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness. - Hanging is the suspension of a person by a noose or ligature around the neck. The \\"Oxford English Dictionary\\" states that hanging in this sense is \\"specifically to put to death by suspension by the neck\\", though it formerly also referred to crucifixion and death by impalement in which the body would remain \\"hanging\\". Hanging has been a common method of capital punishment since medieval times, and is the official execution method in numerous countries and regions. The first account of execution by hanging was in Homer's \\"Odyssey\\". In this specialised meaning of the common word \\"hang\\", the past and past participle is \\"hanged\\" instead of \\"hung\\". - Execution by electrocution, performed using an electric chair, is an execution method originating in the United States in which the condemned person is strapped to a specially built wooden chair and electrocuted through electrodes fastened on the head and leg. This execution method, conceived in 1881 by a Buffalo, New York dentist named Alfred P. Southwick, was developed throughout the 1880s as a humane alternative to hanging and first used in 1890. This execution method has been used in the United States and, for a period of several decades, in the Philippines (its first use there in 1924, last in 1976). - </div> War is a state of armed conflict between societies. It is generally characterized by extreme aggression, destruction, and mortality, using regular or irregular military forces. An absence of war is usually called \\"peace\\". Warfare refers to the common activities and characteristics of types of war, or of wars in general. Total war is warfare that is not restricted to purely legitimate military targets, and can result in massive civilian or other non-combatant casualties. - Homicide refers to one human being killing another. Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system. - The concept of justifiable homicide in criminal law stands on the dividing line between an excuse, a justification, and an exculpation. In certain circumstances, homicide is justified when it prevents greater harm to innocents. A homicide can only be justified if there is sufficient evidence to prove that it was reasonable to believe that the offending party posed an imminent threat to the life or well-being of another, in self-defense. To rule a justifiable homicide, one must objectively prove to a trier of fact, beyond all reasonable doubt, that the victim intended to commit violence. A homicide in this instance is blameless and distinct from the less stringent criteria authorizing deadly force in stand your ground rulings. - A serial killer is a person who typically murders three or more people, usually in service of abnormal psychological gratification, with the murders taking place over more than a month and including a significant break (a \\"cooling off period\\") between them. Different authorities apply different criteria when designating serial killers; while most set a threshold of three murders, others extend it to four or lessen it to two. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), for example, defines serial killing as \\"a series of two or more murders, committed as separate events, usually, but not always, by one offender acting alone\\". Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'manner of death' with the subject 'albert fish'.

A:","completion":"A: The individual who received a patent for the manufacture of chewing gum was Thomas Adams, an American inventor and businessman. The patent was granted on February 14, 1871, with the United States Patent Number US110,626. Thomas Adams was born on May 4, 1818, in Staten Island, New York. He initially started his career as a photographer and also worked as an importer of natural products. In the 1860s, Adams was introduced to chicle, a natural rubber-like substance extracted from the sapodilla tree, which is native to Central and South America. Chicle was being used as a substitute for rubber at the time, and the former Mexican general and politician Antonio López de Santa Anna brought it to Adams in the hopes of founding a rubber company. Adams tried and failed to find a profitable use for chicle as a rubber substitute. However, during his experiments, he discovered that it could be used as a base for a new kind of chewing gum. Realizing the potential of this discovery, Adams shifted his focus and began working on the commercialization of chicle-based chewing gum. Adams received the patent for the manufacture of chewing gum on February 14, 1871. His patent outlined a method for producing chewing gum by boiling and purifying chicle, mixing it with flavorings and other ingredients, and then rolling it into sheets and cutting it into individual pieces. The patent also covered the machinery he designed specifically to streamline the production process. For example, he invented a cutting machine that allowed for a uniform and efficient production of chewing gum. Soon after receiving the patent, Adams founded the first chewing gum factory in the United States and launched his flagship product – Adams New York Chewing Gum. This product became the first mass-produced chewing gum in the country and laid the foundation for the modern chewing gum industry. The success of Adams' company eventually led to the establishment of the American Chicle Company in 1899, which later became a part of the pharmaceutical and consumer goods company Warner-Lambert. In 2000, Warner-Lambert was acquired by Pfizer. Thomas Adams' invention and the patent for the manufacture of chewing gum revolutionized the confectionery industry. Chewing gum soon became a popular and affordable treat in the United States and around the world. It has since evolved into a multi-billion-dollar global industry, with various types of gum available, including sugar-free gum, gum that cleans and whitens teeth, and gum with added vitamins and minerals for health benefits. Adams' innovative creation and entrepreneurship continue to have a lasting impact on the chewing gum market to this very day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

UPDATED:. 00:52 EST, 10 May 2012. A pair of amateur hot air balloonists died when their craft burst into flames as they attempted a high altitude four-mile ascent. Pilot Lee Pibworth, 42, and his passenger Allan Burnett, 55, were killed after their £20,000 balloon plunged towards earth at more than 60mph before crashing into a field at Midsomer Norton in Somerset. An inquest at Flax Bourton was today told that the balloon caught fire before two oxygen cylinders on board exploded after it hit the ground at Prattens Bowls Club on New Year’s Day 2011. Tragic: Lee Pibworth, left, and scout leader Allan Burnett were tragically killed on New Year's Day 2011 when their hot air balloon crashed into a field in North Somerset. Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries. The inquest heard that father-of-three Mr Burnett survived the impact but suffered extensive fractures and was unable to escape the blaze alive. The pair from Bristol had decided to undertake the challenge in September 2010 in order for Mr Pibworth to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal. After spending months meticulously planning the flight they took off from a field in Chelworth just after 9am in front of proud family and friends. A crew with radios - including Mr Burnett’s son Alex - followed the men on the ground in a trailer but lost contact as they ascended into the clouds. Tragic: An aerial GV of the balloon crash site in at a Bowls club in Midsomer Norton, Somerset, where balloonists Allan Burnett and Lee Pibworth died. Alex Burnett, a trainee pilot at the time of the crash, told the inquest he received two calls from his dad during their flight. In the first, BT engineer Mr Burnett said they had reached 4,600 metres but were turning back after using 60 litres of gas. He called a final time to state that they had reached 6,600 metres - higher than required - and were heading to the ground. Alex told the inquest: 'I replied ‘roger that, see you at ground level’. We waited for them to land and tried to estimate their landing place. 'We drove past the accident site thinking it was a car crash after New Year’s Eve. He said a call was received from a friend saying there had been a balloon accident at Midsomer Norton and aware that no one else was flying in the area Alex drove back to the site. Shocking scene: Both men sustained horrific injuries in the accident with tree surgeon Mr Pibworth, a father-of-one, dying instantly from chest injuries. Giving evidence witnesses said the balloon resembled an 'upside down umbrella' as it sped to the ground. Tessa Hawtin, who lives just 150 yards from where the balloon landed said: 'There was a horrific noise, we were aware of it for two to three minutes before we actually saw the balloon. 'This balloon appeared out of the sky and instantly I knew it was wrong, it should not look like that. I just stood and watched. I felt so helpless. 'I was aware of somebody on the balloon, he was operating the burners. 'We watched the balloon for several minutes, it felt like a lifetime but it was probably two to three minutes. 'It went quiet and we realised the balloon had come to land.' Brave: Mr Pibworth wanted to gain the 19,700ft ascent standard necessary to earn a British Balloon and Airship Club gold medal. She told the inquest she first heard a 'ripping' noise at around 9.30am on the morning of the accident. Alex said his dad, an experienced mountaineer, was simply a passenger on theflight while experienced Mr Pibworth was pilot. He said both men were well prepared for their challenged and had planned for the -30 degrees Celsius temperatures and low oxygen at such a high altitude. Wing Commander Graham Maidrent, a pathologist, told the inquest both men could not have survived the incident. Mr Burnett suffered fractures to his legs, ribs and bleeding to his brain - but was alive when the blaze began. The pathologist said: 'The presence of soot in the trachea indicates that he was breathing during exposure to the fire.' He said Mr Burnett died from 'the effects of fire' and 'multiple injuries'. Mr Pibworth suffered fractures to his right arm, thigh, lumber spine, pelvis, sternum, a ruptured heart and lacerations to his liver. His death was caused by 'chest injuries'. Both men were identified by dental records. The inquest continues. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Sir Donald George Bradman, AC (27 August 1908 - 25 February 2001), often referred to as \\"The Don\\", was an Australian international cricketer, widely acknowledged as the greatest batsman of all time. Bradman's career Test batting average of 99.94 has been cited as the greatest achievement by any sportsman in any major sport. The story that the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a golf ball is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's meteoric rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. In 1930-31, against the first West Indian side to visit Australia, Bradman's scoring was more sedate than in England--although he did make 223 in 297 minutes in the Third Test at Brisbane and 152 in 154 minutes in the following Test at Melbourne. However, he scored quickly in a very successful sequence of innings against the South Africans in the Australian summer of 1931-32. For NSW against the tourists, he made 30, 135 and 219. In the Test matches, he scored 226 (277 minutes), 112 (155 minutes), 2 and 167 (183 minutes); his 299 not out in the Fourth Test, at Adelaide, set a new record for the highest score in a Test in Australia. Australia won nine of the ten Tests played over the two series. At this point, Bradman had played 15 Test matches since the beginning of 1930, scoring 2,227 runs at an average of 131. He had played 18 innings, scoring 10 centuries, six of which had extended beyond 200. His overall scoring rate was 42 runs per hour, with 856 (or 38.5% of his tally) scored in boundaries. Significantly, he had not hit a six, which typified Bradman's attitude: if he hit the ball along the ground, then it could not be caught. During this phase of his career, his youth and natural fitness allowed him to adopt a \\"machine-like\\" approach to batting. The South African fast bowler Sandy Bell described bowling to him as, \\"heart-breaking ... with his sort of cynical grin, which rather reminds one of the Sphinx ... he never seems to perspire\\". Between these two seasons, Bradman seriously contemplated playing professional cricket in England with the Lancashire League club Accrington, a move that, according to the rules of the day, would have ended his Test career. A consortium of three Sydney businesses offered an alternative. They devised a two-year contract whereby Bradman wrote for Associated Newspapers, broadcast on Radio 2UE and promoted the menswear retailing chain FJ Palmer and Son. However, the contract increased Bradman's dependence on his public profile, making it more difficult to maintain the privacy that he ardently desired. Bradman's chaotic wedding to Jessie Menzies in April 1932 epitomised these new and unwelcome intrusions into his private life. The church \\"was under siege all throughout the day ... uninvited guests stood on chairs and pews to get a better view\\"; police erected barriers that were broken down and many of those invited could not get a seat. Just weeks later, Bradman joined a private team organised by Arthur Mailey to tour the United States and Canada. He travelled with his wife, and the couple treated the trip as a honeymoon. Playing 51 games in 75 days, Bradman scored 3,779 runs at 102.1, with 18 centuries. Although the standard of play was not high, the effects of the amount of cricket Bradman had played in the three previous years, together with the strains of his celebrity status, began to show on his return home. Bradman joined the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) on 28 June 1940 and was passed fit for air crew duty. The RAAF had more recruits than it could equip and train and Bradman spent four months in Adelaide before the Governor-General of Australia, Lord Gowrie, persuaded Bradman to transfer to the army, a move that was criticised as a safer option for him. Given the rank of Lieutenant, he was posted to the Army School of Physical Training at Frankston, Victoria, to act as a divisional supervisor of physical training. The exertion of the job aggravated his chronic muscular problems, diagnosed as fibrositis. Surprisingly, in light of his batting prowess, a routine army test revealed that Bradman had poor eyesight. Invalided out of service in June 1941, Bradman spent months recuperating, unable even to shave himself or comb his hair due to the extent of the muscular pain he suffered. He resumed stockbroking during 1942. In his biography of Bradman, Charles Williams expounded the theory that the physical problems were psychosomatic, induced by stress and possibly depression; Bradman read the book's manuscript and did not disagree. Had any cricket been played at this time, he would not have been available. Although he found some relief in 1945 when referred to the Melbourne masseur Ern Saunders, Bradman permanently lost the feeling in the thumb and index finger of his (dominant) right hand. In June 1945, Bradman faced a financial crisis when the firm of Harry Hodgetts collapsed due to fraud and embezzlement. Bradman moved quickly to set up his own business, utilising Hodgetts' client list and his old office in Grenfell Street, Adelaide. The fallout led to a prison term for Hodgetts, and left a stigma attached to Bradman's name in the city's business community for many years. However, the SA Cricket Association had no hesitation in appointing Bradman as their delegate to the Board of Control in place of Hodgetts. Now working alongside some of the men he had battled in the 1930s, Bradman quickly became a leading light in the administration of the game. With the resumption of international cricket, he was once more appointed a Test selector, and played a major role in planning for post-war cricket. After his return to Australia, Bradman played in his own Testimonial match at Melbourne, scoring his 117th and last century, and receiving PS9,342 in proceeds. In the 1949 New Year Honours, he was appointed Knight Bachelor for his services to the game, becoming the only Australian cricketer ever to be knighted. He commented that he \\"would have preferred to remain just Mister\\". The following year he published a memoir, Farewell to Cricket. Bradman accepted offers from the Daily Mail to travel with, and write about, the 1953 and 1956 Australian teams in England. The Art of Cricket, his final book published in 1958, is an instructional manual. Bradman retired from his stockbroking business in June 1954, depending on the \\"comfortable\\" income earned as a board member of 16 publicly listed companies. His highest profile affiliation was with Argo Investments Limited, where he was chairman for a number of years. Charles Williams commented that, \\"[b]usiness was excluded on medical grounds, [so] the only sensible alternative was a career in the administration of the game which he loved and to which he had given most of his active life\\". Bradman was honoured at a number of cricket grounds, notably when his portrait was hung in the Long Room at Lord's; until Shane Warne's portrait was added in 2005, Bradman was one of just three Australians to be honoured in this way. Bradman inaugurated a \\"Bradman Stand\\" at the Sydney Cricket Ground in January 1974; the Adelaide Oval also opened a Bradman Stand in 1990, which housed new media and corporate facilities. The Oval's Bradman Stand was demolished in 2013 as the stadium underwent an extensive re-development. Later in 1974, he attended a Lord's Taverners function in London where he experienced heart problems, which forced him to limit his public appearances to select occasions only. With his wife, Bradman returned to Bowral in 1976, where the new cricket ground was named in his honour. He gave the keynote speech at the historic Centenary Test at Melbourne in 1977. On 16 June 1979, the Australian government awarded Bradman the nation's second-highest civilian honour at that time, Companion of the Order of Australia (AC), \\"in recognition of service to the sport of cricket and cricket administration\\". In 1980, he resigned from the ACB, to lead a more secluded life.

What is the answer to this question? what kind of bombs were used in boston?","completion":"The bombs that were used during the Boston Marathon bombing on April 15, 2013 were classified as pressure cooker bombs. To elaborate on both the type of bombs used and the incident itself: Boston Marathon Bombing: This horrific incident happened during the Boston Marathon on Patriots' Day, April 15, 2013. Two explosively formed devices were detonated near the finish line, causing three deaths and approximately 264 injuries, making it one of the most significant terrorist attacks on American soil since 9/11. Pressure Cooker Bombs: These types of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) were used in the catastrophic incident. A pressure cooker bomb is made up of a simple but destructive device crafted from everyday kitchen equipment and explosives. It gains its power from the energy trapped in a pressure cooker. When the bomb detonates, it releases this energy in a rapid and violent manner. Construction of the Bombs: The bombs used in the Boston Marathon bombing were fashioned out of 6-liter pressure cookers filled with gunpowder, nails, and ball bearings. Investigators found remnants of these distinct materials at the scene. The purpose of these added components was to ensure the bomb would cause the maximum amount of damage possible, with a specific intent of inflicting harm upon people located within the immediate vicinity of the bomb's blast radius. Detonation Method: The bombs were believed to have been triggered using a remote control device, like those used for toy cars. The bomb maker filled a pressure cooker with explosives and shrapnel, then sealed it. The pressure would build up upon detonation, turning the pressure cooker into a makeshift but incredibly lethal fragmentation bomb. In essence, the bombs used during the Boston Marathon bombings were pressure cooker bombs filled with shrapnel, designed to inflict maximum damage upon detonation. These were amateur but significantly deadly devices that resulted in wide-scale tragedy. This incident marked a notorious application of pressure cooker bombs, an easily constructed yet harmful explosive device."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In selecting his crew, De Long's priority was men with Arctic experience. For his second-in-command he chose lieutenant Charles W. Chipp, who had served with him on the Little Juniata adventure. Another veteran of the Polaris rescue mission, George W. Melville, was appointed as ship's engineer. Other experienced Arctic hands were William F. C. Nindemann, a Polaris survivor, and the ice pilot William Dunbar, who had many years' experience in whalers.The appointment of the expedition's navigating officer was problematic; John W. Danenhower, a young naval officer from a well-connected Washington family, was recommended to Bennett by the former president Ulysses S. Grant. Such sponsorship won Danenhower his place, despite a history of depression that had seen him briefly incarcerated at the Government Hospital for the Insane. On Bennett's request, Danenhower accompanied De Long on the voyage from Le Havre to San Francisco, during which he confided details of his medical history. The navigator's competent performance persuaded De Long that such troubles were in the past.The ship's surgeon, James Ambler, was assigned to the expedition by the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, only because he was next on the list of medical officers available for sea duty. Ambler deduced from Danenhower's medical records that a probable cause of the navigator's medical lapses was syphilis, but Danenhower's influential connections ensured that he kept his place on the expedition.Two others from Jeannette's voyage from Le Havre, carpenter Albert Sweetman and boatswain John Cole, were enlisted, as was the Herald's meteorologist, Jerome Collins.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\", the second of MGM's Tarzan pictures, picks up a year after the events of \\"Tarzan the Ape Man\\". Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle, and Harry Holt (one of the expeditioners in the first film) returns, this time accompanied by the less-than-honorable Martin Arlington, in quest of the ivory from the elephants' graveyard. Naturally, a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way. The first film romanticized everything--the jungle, adventure, romance itself, wild animals, and even death. The second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences, but a more serious tone underlies the action. The characters dare to ask questions like: What if something happened to Tarzan? What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself? While these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation, it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn't always as much fun as the throw-caution-to-the-wind attitude of the original. One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane's relationship. Tarzan still speaks very broken English, but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate. Additionally, their love for each other has really blossomed, and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle. Most people consider \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" superior to the original \\"Tarzan the Ape Man\\". Personally, I liked the first film just a little bit better. The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt & Martin Arlington team isn't nearly as likable as Holt's relationship with James Parker (Jane's father) from the original. The Mr. Arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain, but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie. The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him. (Also, I don't want to give anything away, but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him, Jane never finds out about those events, so the ending isn't quite as satisfying as it could have been.) All of these detractors are relatively minor, however, and it's still a great movie. Like the first film, \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" has amazing action scenes, wonderful wildlife footage, and one of the screen's all-time greatest romances. If you liked the first film in the series, this is definitely a sequel to see. Would you say this review is positive or negative?","completion":"This review seems mostly positive. The reviewer praises the growth in Tarzan and Jane's relationship, the action scenes, and the romantic aspect of the film. They also mention that most people consider \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" superior to the original.

Napoléon Bonaparte (/nəˈpoʊliən, -ˈpoʊljən/; French: [napɔleɔ̃ bɔnapaʁt], born Napoleone di Buonaparte; 15 August 1769 – 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. Often considered one of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. He also remains one of the most celebrated and controversial political figures in Western history. In civil affairs, Napoleon had a major long-term impact by bringing liberal reforms to the territories that he conquered, especially the Low Countries, Switzerland, and large parts of modern Italy and Germany.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: On which planet is the weather more diverse? Context: Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets. Answer:","completion":"The weather is more diverse on the planet Neptune. Step 1: Read the user's query. The user wants to know which planet, Neptune or Uranus, has more diverse weather. Step 2: Go through the given context. I need to find information that will allow me to answer the user's question accurately. Step 3: After reading, I notice that the context starts off by stating that Neptune has more varied weather when compared to Uranus. It further explains the details of Neptune's weather, including temperature ranges and unknown heat sources. Step 4: From this data, it's clear that Neptune's weather conditions are distinguished by their variety. It involves its increased internal heating, which drives the wind speed, and the complexity created from unknown heat sources. Step 5: Thus, combining this information, it can be concluded from the context that Neptune's weather is described as being more diverse when compared to Uranus. This directly answers the user's question. Hence, I write the answer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Summarize this article: On Friday the Court of Appeal ruled Labour was within its rights to stop some new members voting in the contest between Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith. It overturned an earlier High Court ruling that the ban was unlawful. The five members said they would not take their case to the Supreme Court. The National Executive Committee (NEC), the body that governs the Labour Party, ruled that full members could only vote if they had at least six months' continuous membership by 12 July. The party offered a window from 18-20 July when more recent members - and non-members - could pay £25 to become \\"registered supporters\\" and gain the right to vote. The exclusion of the new members is thought to benefit Mr Smith. The five who challenged the NEC's ruling - Christine Evangelou, Rev Edward Leir, Hannah Fordham, Chris Granger and \\"FM\\", a teenage member - have raised £93,572 in donations but said they could not afford to take the case further. In a message posted on their crowdfunding website, Ms Fordham said: \\"But the case wasn't in vain - although we didn't succeed in reclaiming votes for the 130,000 disenfranchised members, we did win in the High Court, exposing facts which have spurred important conversations about the role of the Labour Party membership and the NEC.\\" She added that the money raised would cover their legal fees and the £30,000 in costs they had been ordered to pay to the NEC, which brought the challenge against the High Court ruling. The campaign team of party leader Mr Corbyn praised the efforts of the five members who initially brought the case to court. A Jeremy for Labour spokesman said: \\"The strength of solidarity shown to the five claimants campaigning for the democratic rights of their fellow Labour party members has been truly remarkable. \\"It is clear that there exists a huge amount of support for Jeremy's vision of a democratic Labour Party that is open and inclusive for all, so that we can achieve a Labour Government that can transform and rebuild Britain so that nowhere and no-one is left behind.\\" Speaking before the five members dropped their case, in an interview with the Observer, Mr Corbyn refused to express full confidence in the party's general secretary, Ian McNichol, who was a key figure in the NEC's appeal. Asked twice if he had full confidence in Mr McNicol, Mr Corbyn repeatedly stated: \\"I have been happy to work with Iain McNicol since I became leader.\\" The Supreme Court said it would have cost about £1,000 for the case to be heard. Ms Fordham had said it would cost about £8,000 \\"for getting the case even heard\\", but it was not clear if she was also referring to lawyers' fees.","completion":"The Court of Appeal said it was okay for the Labour Party in the United Kingdom to not let some new members vote in a big contest between two people, Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith.

She's also very into respect, tact, and treating others as they deserve to be treated. So if you aim to manipulate or use, she'll show you the back door, no questions asked. Those horns of hers can be quite pointy! Ow. If you're looking to seduce her and then put her in a cab, just be honest. You'll get a lot further that way than pretending to be something you're not. She has no patience for liars or hypocrites and is pretty good at spotting them, too. Once you've got her, try your hardest to treat her as well as she treats you. She'll be incredibly loyal, patient, and trustworthy. Pay her back by treating her in kind! You'll be the only one in her life, hands down. Now the question is: What in the world did you do to deserve her? Odds are you went in with the intention of seducing her and found yourself being seduced. Funny how that works, huh? Ms. Taurus can be a long-term type of gal if you're a worthy suitor.

The correct translation in Czech would be: \\"Byli jste zaplaceni v posledních 14 dnech?\\" This translation is justified as follows: - \\"Have you been\\" is translated as \\"Byli jste\\". In Czech, the verb typically comes first in interrogative sentences, so this order of words is correct. - \\"paid\\" is translated as \\"zaplaceni\\". This is the past participle of the verb \\"to pay\\", and as such, it's the right form to use in this phrase. - \\"in the last\\" is translated as \\"v posledních\\". This phrase is used to signify something that has happened within a certain period of time up to now. - \\"14 days\\" is translated as \\"14 dnech\\".

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".

Plot title: S1m0ne Movie plot: When Nicola Anders (Winona Ryder), the star of out-of-favor director Viktor Taransky's (Al Pacino) new film, refuses to finish it, Taransky is forced to find a replacement. Contractual requirements totally prevent using her image in the film, so he must re-shoot. Instead, Viktor experiments with a new computer program he inherits from late acquaintance Hank Aleno (Elias Koteas) which allows creation of a computer-generated woman which he can easily animate to play the film's central character. Viktor names his virtual actor \\"Simone\\", a name derived from the computer program's title, Simulation One. Seamlessly incorporated into the film, Simone (Rachel Roberts) gives a fantastic performance, exactly controlled by Viktor. The film is immediately a huge success. The studio, and soon the world, ask \\"who is Simone?\\" Viktor initially claims that Simone is a recluse and requests her privacy be respected, but that only intensifies media demands for her to appear. Viktor intends to reveal the secret of her non-existence after the second picture. To satisfy demand, he executes a number of progressively ambitious stunts relying on misdirection and cinematic special effects technology. Eventually it escalates to simulated remote location video live interviews. In one instance, two determined tabloid reporters discover Viktor used out-of-date stock photography as a background during an interview instead of being on that site as claimed and blackmail him into getting Simone to make a live appearance. He arranges her to perform a song at a stadium event appearing in a cloud of smoke and then using flawless holographic technology. The perception of being in person is reinforced with realtime visualization on the stadium's monitors. Simone becomes even more famous, simultaneously becoming a double winner for the Academy Award for Best Actress, tying with herself in the process.

Öffentliche Programme sind in Situationen, in denen der optimale Weg zur Erreichung eines bestimmten Ziels ungewiss ist, häufig weniger effektiv. Im Zusammenhang mit der Suche nach vielversprechenden Technologien für eine post-karbon Energieversorgung zeigt sich dieser Mangel an Effektivität besonders deutlich. Die Komplexität der Herausforderung, alternative Energiequellen zu entwickeln und einzusetzen, die nicht auf fossilen Brennstoffen basieren, lässt viele Fragen hinsichtlich der besten Vorgehensweise und der richtigen Technologien offen.

Die Identifizierung der erfolgversprechendsten Innovationen und Technologien ist notwendig, um in den Umstieg auf eine post-karbon Energieversorgung effizient und wirksam voranzutreiben. Es gibt verschiedene Gründe, warum öffentliche Programme in solchen Situationen weniger gut funktionieren: 1. Begrenzte Kenntnisse und Informationen: In vielen Fällen haben öffentliche Behörden nicht immer Zugang zu den erforderlichen Informationen und Expertenwissen, um fundierte Entscheidungen über die zukünftige Entwicklung von alternativen Energiequellen zu treffen. 2. Bürokratie und politische Einflüsse: Öffentliche Programme sind oft durch bürokratische Hürden und politische Einflussnahme geprägt, die den Prozess der Implementierung und Förderung von Innovationen verzögern oder sogar verhindern können. 3. Mangelnde Flexibilität: Öffentliche Förderprogramme sind tendenziell weniger flexibel und anpassungsfähig als private oder marktorientierte Ansätze, da sie in der Regel langfristige Pläne und feste Budgets haben. Dies kann dazu führen, dass sie in einer sich schnell verändernden Technologielandschaft hinterherhinken. 4. Fehlende Anreize für Risikokapital: Staatliche Programme sind oft darauf ausgerichtet, etablierte und erprobte Technologien zu fördern, anstatt risikoreiche, aber potenziell bahnbrechende Innovationen zu unterstützen.

Article:","completion":"Title: Rahm Emanuel Leaves Obama Campaign to Help Democrats Raise Money Rahm Emanuel, who was an honorary Obama campaign chairman, has decided to do something different. He is leaving his role to help raise money for the Democratic party, according to the Washington Post. Rahm Emanuel is really good at asking people for money and he knows how important it is for the Democrats to have money to win. Before he started working in politics, he was famous for helping people raise money. When he was a part of the Obama campaign, Emanuel was one of the first people who told the Democrats to form a group called a \\"super PAC.\\" A \\"super PAC\\" is a group that helps politicians and political parties raise lots and lots of money. Emanuel said that he will help, but not run the super PAC called Priorities USA. He thinks that helping President Obama get re-elected is very important, and that the best way he can help is by raising money. The people working for Mitt Romney, who was running against President Obama, told others that they are planning to raise 100 million for the third month in a row. That is a huge amount of money! The Republicans are doing really well at getting money, especially from rich people who work in places like banks. In fact, more people have given 1 million to their party than ever before. Rahm Emanuel wants to make sure the Democrats can also get lots of money so they can do their best in the race."},{"prompt":"Question: Rob likes to visit high mountainous locations. Last year he visited the the Alps mountains in Austria. There he saw an unique type of glacier called valley glacier. This year he went further east to visit the Ural mountains in Russia. There he didn't see any valley glacier. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Rob is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year, which mountain should he visit, Alps or ural? Hint: Plucking, also referred to as quarrying, is a glacial phenomenon that is responsible for the erosion and transportation of individual pieces of bedrock, especially large \\"joint blocks\\". This occurs in a type of glacier called a \\"valley glacier\\". As a glacier moves down a valley, friction causes the basal ice of the glacier to melt and infiltrate joints (cracks) in the bedrock. The freezing and thawing action of the ice enlarges, widens, or causes further cracks in the bedrock as it changes volume across the ice/water phase transition (a form of hydraulic wedging), gradually loosening the rock between the joints. This produces large pieces of rock called joint blocks. Eventually these joint blocks come loose and become trapped in the glacier. Answer:","completion":"Rob should visit the Ural mountains if he is not interested in seeing joint blocks trapped in the glacier next year."},{"prompt":"Question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: How long does a mud mask or facial mask probably have to be applied? Options: A. for a few hours B. for a few minutes C. not enough information D. for a few days Answer:","completion":"C. not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: David Shacklefield was allowed to keep his licence despite ignoring a red light. A white van man has been allowed to keep his driving licence despite racing over a level crossing after the traffic lights had turned red. David Shackleford claims he did not have enough time to stop the vehicle after realising the lights had changed at the crossing in Foxton, Cambridgeshire, so decided it would be safer to speed over the tracks. The 28-year-old trainee truck driver was moments away from colliding with a train, but has been allowed to keep his licence after pleading with magistrates. The driver from Harrow, north west London, was fined £200 and given three points for the incident on January 15. After initially claiming he the lights were on amber, the driver admitted he ignored them after being sent images taken from CCTV footage which clearly show him in plain view of the red light. But Judge Ken Sheraton decided not to disqualify Shackleford, as it would put him out of work. 'I was driving at 40mph and it would have been unsafe for me to slam the breaks on. 'By the time the lights came into view it would have been silly for me to stop.' It is not the first time drivers have had a near miss with oncoming trains at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. In 2010 John McDonald, 38, ignored the flashing warning lights and accelerated his 44-tonne sewage truck over the crossing. The driver was filmed approaching the crossing while the lights are red despite claiming they were amber. Shacklefield accelerated over the train lines just moments before a train thundered by at the crossing in Cambridgeshire. The automatic barriers smashed as they crashed on top of the artic. Two years later Belal Ahmed, 32, was convicted of speeding under the dropping barriers in the BMW, and ten days after that Girish Babu, 31, stopped his Mercedes on the crossing, forcing the signalman to stop the barriers in mid-air. Sgt Andy Cook of British Transport Police said: 'Misusing level crossings is extremely dangerous and will not be tolerated by BTP. 'Drivers who ignore the warning lights and barriers don’t just risk their own lives, but also endanger other road users and rail passengers and staff.'

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that Nifty offers a lead on a manager's job? ? When Johnny Quinlan loses his job in a drug store, he is afraid to tell his wife, Bertha, and therefore keeps up the pretense of leaving each morning for a non-existent job, as he begins the search for a new job. As the days pass and he is unable to find employment, their household, which includes his sister, Lottie, and Bertha's brother, Dan Walsh, goes through what little savings they have. As he gets more desperate, he agrees to do small jobs for \\"Nifty\\" Herman, a small-time gangster. Nifty had loaned Johnny 15, as part of a plan to entice him to work for him. After Johnny gets insulted by a common laborer job offer from a neighbor, Nifty lies to him and says that he has a friend who will get him a managerial position at a liquor store. All Johnny has to do is hold onto a case of high-priced alcohol for a few days. Dubious, Johnny reluctantly agrees and takes the suitcase back to his apartment. However, when Bertha finds out who he got the suitcase from, she demands that he return it, threatening to leave him if he doesn't. Taking the case back to Nifty, he finds the office locked, and so returns home. When he arrives, his sister's suitor, Charles Newton, is visiting. Newton is a government agent. Even though Johnny tries to hide the case, his efforts are futile, and Newton spies it and becomes suspicious, seeing a resemblance to a case he and his men have been attempting to track down. Opening it, he discovers it contains a cache of drugs. When he interrogates Johnny, he gets the whole story, and is about to arrest Johnny, when Nifty arrives to retrieve the suitcase. Johnny tricks Nifty into confessing, and then subdues him, when he is resisting the efforts of Newton and his deputies to arrest him. The film ends with Johnny being rewarded for the way he handled himself by becoming Newton's assistant.

Movie title: Fortress Movie plot: The film starts with an explanation of the B-17s, the MTO campaign and a plan to strike Rome on July 19, 1943. It then follows the story of the B-17F \\"Lucky Lass\\" and her Irish-American crew, Philly (Bombardier), Archie (Navigator), Pops (Pilot), Wally (Co-pilot), Burt (Top Turret gunner/Engineer), Charlie (Radio Operator), Al (Ball turret gunner), Jake and Joe (waist gunners) and Eddie (Tail gunner). During a raid on Gerbini, Italy, Pops, Jake and Joe are killed and the plane is heavily damaged. 5 days later, the rest of the crew meet the replacements, Michael, Tom and Oliver, co-pilot and waist gunners, respectively. They then pressure the crew chief, Caparelli, to clear their plane to fly (which he does) and they throw a party to celebrate, during which they find out Michael doesn't drink, upsetting everybody but Wally, now pilot, who gives him advice on running the crew. During the next mission, Wally gets ptomaine from native food and asks Mike to fly. However, he doesn't fly by the instruments, getting lost and they have to, fight off Me-109s, surviving with the help of friendly P-40 fighters. The Lass is forced to abort and land at the base. There is a sandstorm that night, which leads Burt to leave the alcohol still he put together from bomber parts, to make moonshine from the ethanol laced aviation fuel, open, leaking alcohol. They are forced to abort yet another 'milk run' (an easy mission) because of engine failure and the crew blame Mike, who starts drinking.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Fortress,\\" the character named Abraham is not mentioned in the plot provided. Therefore, it is impossible for me to answer the question, \\"How does Abraham die?\\" since we do not have any information about this character. However, I can provide some guidance on whether you should invest in this film proposal based on the plot outlined. The movie seems to be a historical war film with a focus on the B-17 bomber crew during World War II. It has a somewhat complex plot that involves various challenges faced by the aircrew and the interpersonal relationships among them. The movie appears to be a mix of action, drama, and tragedy, with several characters being killed during the course of the narrative. When considering investment in a film, key factors to consider include the target audience, genre popularity, and potential for critical and commercial success. War films tend to have a relatively niche audience, with an interest in historical events and military themes, which may limit its commercial potential. However, the success of films such as \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" \\"Dunkirk,\\" and \\"1917\\" demonstrates that there can be a significant market for well-made, engaging war films. Moreover, the quality of the script, the strength of the director, and the cast can greatly influence a film's success. High-quality production values, a strong cast, and a solid marketing campaign can help mitigate the risks associated with investing in a niche genre. To make an informed decision about investing in the \\"Fortress,\\" it is crucial to familiarize yourself with other factors, such as the estimated production budget, financing structure, distribution strategy, and the creative team's track record. It would also be helpful to read the full screenplay and meet with the production team and cast, if possible, to assess their commitment to the project. Ultimately, while the provided plot summary may pique your interest, further research and direct involvement in the project will be decisive in deciding whether it is a worthwhile investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a new situation: Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health. But I can use this background: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. What is an answer for this question: Which patient had more red blood cells, Dan or Jim?","completion":"Based on the information provided, Dan, the normal patient, had a normal number of red blood cells. Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, may have a different number of red blood cells due to his condition.

Answer the following question: Pam and Ellie are two entomologists. they are both studying ants at the moment: Ellie is studying leafcutter ants, while Pam is studying ants that farm aphids. Which scientist read more about dairying ants milking the aphids? Hint: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it is clear that Pam is the scientist who read more about dairying ants milking the aphids. This is because Pam is studying ants that farm aphids, which are the type of ants that engage in a mutualistic relationship with the aphids, consuming the honeydew they produce. In this relationship, the dairying ants milk the aphids by stroking them with their antennae, which is the exact behavior described in the question. While Ellie is also studying ants, her focus is specifically on leafcutter ants, which have a distinct behavior and ecological role compared to the dairying ants Pam is studying. Leafcutter ants, rather than engaging in mutualistic relationships with aphids, are known for their unique behavior of cutting and collecting leaf fragments to cultivate a fungus garden within their colonies, which they eventually consume as a food source. Therefore, Pam is the scientist that read more about dairying ants milking the aphids as her research subject is directly related to the ants that farm aphids and engage in the mutualistic relationship with them. On the other hand, Ellie's research on leafcutter ants focuses on a different type of ant species with a unique ecological role and behavior unrelated to milking aphids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Chris Christie is one of the most unpopular governors ever Percentage of a state’s residents or voters who approved of the job the governor was doing, according to the lowest poll during his tenure YEAR GOVERNOR STATE POLLSTER APPROVE/FAVORABLE 2005 Bob Taft Ohio Zogby Interactive 7% 2008 Rod Blagojevich Illinois Glengariff Group 8 2006 Frank Murkowski Alaska SurveyUSA 14 2017 Chris Christie New Jersey Quinnipiac U. 15 1990 Edward DiPrete Rhode Island Brown U. 16 Includes approval and favorability polls. (There isn’t a complete data archive of governors’ approval ratings, as there is for presidential approval. The list I used was based on one put together by political scientists Richard Niemi, Thad Beyle and Lee Sigelman, which was current through 2010. I’ve added to it since then when there have been governors who have been plagued by scandal or faced particularly low ratings for other reasons. If you see someone missing on this list send me an email.) My guess is that Christie probably isn’t going to be the most unpopular governor ever. To do so, he’d need his approval rating to drop my more than half. Single-digit approval ratings are generally reserved for those who were charged or convicted of a crime while in office. In 2005, Ohio’s governor, Bob Taft, was convicted of misdemeanor ethics charges after failing to report gifts including free golf outings. Taft hit a 7 percent favorable rating in a Zogby Interactive poll that year. Taft’s low approval rating helped contribute to a Democratic wave in Ohio during the 2006 midterm elections. You might also remember convicted felon and former Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich. His 8 percent approval rating in a Glengariff Group poll came in the midst of his pay-for-play scandal, in which he tried to sell Barack Obama’s Senate seat after Obama ascended to the presidency. Blagojevich was removed from office by the Illinois state legislature, went on to lose on the Celebrity Apprentice and was sent to prison for trying to sell the Senate seat, among other corruption charges. Christie might have a better shot at becoming the third least-popular governor. He is just one point behind former Alaska Gov. Frank Murkowski. Murkowski was unpopular in large part because he appointed his own daughter Lisa to his seat upon becoming governor in 2003. That move angered Alaskans and led to him coming in third behind former Wasilla mayor Sarah Palin in his own party’s primary for governor in 2006. The bottom line is that Christie is in very undistinguished company. Christie is disliked by Democrats and Republicans alike. And that dislike has made it very likely that New Jersey will have a Democratic governor come next year. ||||| This wasn’t how he figured it would end. A year after being steamrolled by Donald Trump, Chris Christie is hobbling out of office as the most unpopular governor in the history of New Jersey—a casualty of scandal and hubris, and a guy freed up to quietly pursue the toughest job of his life. You'd think that by now, Chris Christie would be impervious to insults—that today, as his eight roller-coaster years as New Jersey's governor come to a humbling close, he might be able to let certain things slide. But before I'd even set one foot into his office on a recent afternoon, there was a bone he wanted to pick. Sitting at a long table, Christie waved his iPhone, on which he'd pulled up a 2015 article from GQ’s website, a profile of sorts that probed his famed peevishness. He read the headline to me: “‘What a Dick: The Chris Christie Story.’” Then, the story's subject fixed me in his gaze. “So you can see why I kind of thought that maybe this”—he gestured toward the empty chair waiting for me—“may not be the best thing for me.” Christie nonetheless motioned for me to sit. It was the end of a long week, at the end of a long summer, which had come on the heels of a long couple of years, and he was in an unusually reflective mood. There were things he wanted to say—about all that he'd been through, all the ways he'd been misunderstood, and all that he hoped still to accomplish—and his wariness soon gave way to candor. Even on the subject of his most recent political wound. No doubt, you remember the viral pictures from July: Christie lounging on the Jersey Shore, plopped shamelessly on a beach otherwise emptied by a government shutdown. The photos—snapped from a rented airplane—prompted a brutal national roasting. Here was Christie, closing New Jersey's beaches to wage political war, yet basking in the surf himself. But what if I told you that his decision to spend the Fourth of July weekend on the sands of Island Beach State Park was made with goodness in his heart? Could you be convinced that the whole kerfuffle came about because Christie was trying to ease the suffering of opioid addicts? “He was a force of nature,” Christie says of Donald Trump. “[He] ran the race in terms of the outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is guy. That was my lane.” Yeah, it's a bit of a stretch. Christie had decided long before the shutdown that he wasn't altering his planned trip to the beach—and he's not about to apologize for it now. “If there was a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, then you got a story,” Christie said. “But my wife of 31 years and all my kids?! I never thought it was that big a deal.” But what people overlooked, he went on, is that his decision to engage in the political brinkmanship that led to the closing of the state government—the thing that made his presence on the beach that day so objectionable—was downright noble. “The shutdown,” as he recounted for me, “was about opioids.” For much of his governorship, Christie had been admirably proactive in (and progressive about) addressing the drug scourge—bucking his fellow Republicans to expand Medicaid, which made drug treatment more available to poor people in New Jersey; pushing for more drug courts, which steer nonviolent offenders toward treatment instead of prison; even signing a “Good Samaritan” law that provides immunity from arrest for people who call 911 if they’re with someone who overdoses. But now, in his final year in office, Christie had made the opioid problem an even greater priority—his top one, in fact. The centerpiece of the effort was to be 300 million in new funding for addiction treatment, the financing of which led to a showdown with state legislators and the resulting mid-summer shutdown. In classic bare-knuckled Christie fashion, he had hoped to use the shutdown to embarrass his rival, Vinnie Prieto, the Democratic Speaker of the General Assembly, by hanging 500 posters on shuttered government offices across the state that featured Prieto’s picture and read: “This facility is closed because of this man.” But whatever leverage Christie thought he had went out the window when his own photos, those of his beach vacation, emerged. Three days into the shutdown, Christie agreed to a budget deal that, crucially, did not include his 300 million for opioids. Nonetheless, that hasn't stopped him from spinning the budget deal as a victory—boasting to me about how he'd brought to heel the state's largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield, from which he'd hoped to extract his cash. “We wound up getting a bunch of reforms,” he said. I reminded him that he didn't get the money for opioids. “I'll get what I want, don't worry,” he told me. “I know I will.” And yet Christie's trademark bluster was belied by his surroundings. It was a Friday afternoon, and Trenton—decades removed from those bustling days when the city, as the famous slogan puts it, did the making and the world did the taking—was even sleepier than usual. The legislature was out of session, and since the historical State House building, which was built when George Washington was president, was undergoing extensive renovations, Christie was working out of a temporary space in a drab, ahistoric state office building, where he'll stay until his term ends in January. He'd decorated it with photos and reminders of his favorite things—Springsteen, Reagan, the Mets—but he couldn't deny that it lacked the grandeur of his old digs. “You know, you sit in the space where Woodrow Wilson sat,” he mused. Unmentioned by the governor, of course, was that he once envisioned himself sitting in another, loftier office held by Wilson. If a man of Christie's size can seem small, he suddenly did. But while Christie may have been diminished, he was not necessarily defeated. In the issue of opioids, he seemed to have found a new, and most likely final, purpose as a public official—his last, best shot to do something big and good, something that could fulfill the outsize ambitions that so many people, not least among them Chris Christie, had placed in him. Not only was he working on fighting opioids in New Jersey; he was also chairing a presidential commission for Donald Trump to develop a national strategy on the issue. “This opioid issue, to me, is the single most important issue that I have left to deal with,” Christie told me. I asked him how he planned to get the 300 million for his New Jersey efforts. “Stay tuned,” Christie said. “I'm not gonna tell you now. Stay tuned.” He sat up straighter in his chair and, summoning his old swagger, went on. “We will spend and invest a significant amount of money, very close to what I was asking for, if not exactly what I was asking for, on this issue, because it is non-negotiable to me,” Christie said. “If I don't get it from Horizon, I'll get it from someplace else, and when you're governor, in this state, you have the ability to get that done.” It wasn't clear if he was trying to convince himself or me. A few weeks later, it didn't matter. He announced that he was going to spend 200 million on opioid treatment—a significant sum, no doubt, but still only two-thirds of what he'd originally wanted. These are the final days of Chris Christie, who has experienced the most vertiginous rise and precipitous fall of any American politician this century. Although he's loath to second-guess past actions and decisions, much less admit to mistakes—“He always used to say that one of the first rules of leadership is to tear off the rearview mirror, because you can't change what happened,” says one Christie confidant—he has a difficult time resisting nostalgia. Showing me around his temporary digs, his tie loosened and his suit jacket draped over the back of a chair, Christie relived his glory days. “That was when Obama came during '13 to the one-year anniversary [of Superstorm Sandy],” Christie said, pointing to a picture of himself and the former president. It was on that occasion—a year after the two rivals made headlines for being chummy—that Christie bested Obama in a boardwalk football toss. “That was really good,” Christie went on. “I've spoken to the former president a few times, and whenever I do, I get a chance to lord it over him.” Though he came to the governor's office eight years ago as a relative nobody—eking out an unimpressive victory against a feeble opponent—Christie was a gust of fresh political air and almost instantly became a star. He filled the position in such an unexpected and exceptional manner—battling public employees' unions one moment and Islamophobes the next—that Republican heavyweights like Henry Kissinger were soon begging him to run for the White House against Barack Obama. Christie demurred, saying that he didn't think he was ready yet to be president, but there was no doubt that, with a little more time, he'd come to a different conclusion. He steered his state through the trauma of Superstorm Sandy in 2012 and a year later was re-elected with an unheard-of 60 percent of the vote. On magazine covers and in smoke-filled back rooms, it was a foregone conclusion that he'd be the Republican presidential nominee in 2016. Then came Bridgegate, the scandal that resulted from his allies' efforts to punish a New Jersey mayor who didn't endorse his re-election campaign by blocking traffic on the George Washington Bridge. Although two of those allies would ultimately be given prison sentences—they're currently appealing their convictions—Christie pleaded ignorance (and innocence) and clawed back enough to run for the White House in 2016. That's when he became roadkill to Donald Trump. “He gets mad at me at times, he yells at me at times, but he respects me,” Christie says of his relationship with Donald Trump. Of course, Christie was hardly alone in getting steamrolled by Trump, who bested 15 other Republicans, not to mention Hillary Clinton, on his way to the White House. But Christie's defeat was particularly humbling, since it involved Trump doing to him what Christie was accustomed to doing to others. Christie's rise, after all, had been fueled by his bullying and belittling of friends and foes alike—telling a protester at a press conference to “sit down and shut up” or his constituents to “get the hell off the beach” during a hurricane. In many ways, Christie seemed perfectly matched to the political moment of 2016: a no-holds-barred truth-teller who wasn't afraid to offend people's delicate sensibilities. It's just that Trump did him one better. Christie might have scored points against Marco Rubio during a debate by ridiculing him for his “memorized 30-second speech,” but it was Trump who indelibly—and offensively—branded the Florida senator as Liddle Marco…and Jeb Bush as Low-Energy Jeb…and Ted Cruz as Lyin' Ted. Christie was like a drive-time deejay trying to compete with Howard Stern. “He was a force of nature at a political time when people wanted to hear the way he was saying things,” Christie now says of Trump. “There's a marked difference between the way we approach these things, no doubt. But I think it made me look less candid.” He adds, almost plaintively: “Donald Trump ran the race in terms of the outspoken, tell-it-like-it-is guy. That was my lane.” Even worse for Christie, once he ended his presidential campaign, his humiliations at Trump's hands continued. Unlike most of the candidates whom Trump had vanquished, Christie, upon exiting the race, almost immediately endorsed him. It seemed an odd move. Not only had Trump once alleged that Christie “totally knew about” Bridgegate—a charge that Christie particularly resents; Christie had attacked Trump as “an entertainer” and unserious. What's more, Christie had fashioned himself as a different kind of Republican, one who could appeal to non-white voters. (In his 2013 re-election, Christie won 51 percent of Latino voters and 21 percent of African-Americans.) It was hard to see how he could support someone who'd accused Mexico of sending “rapists” to the U.S. and only reluctantly disavowed the support of David Duke. It was even stranger to see Christie so slavishly playing second fiddle—appearing behind Trump at rallies while Trump prattled on, wearing what CNN called a “hostage face”—especially when Trump didn't stop needling Christie. In one instance, Trump appeared to make fun of Christie's weight, telling him that he could no longer eat Oreos; in another, Trump held an umbrella above his own head while Christie, standing right next to him, got wet in the rain. And yet Christie continued to stand, mutely, by Trump's side. “I'd never seen him be so deferential,” Tom Kean, a former New Jersey governor and Christie's political mentor, says. “But it's a normal reaction to be deferential to someone you wanted a job from.” But the job never came. First, Trump picked Mike Pence over Christie for his running mate. Then, after Trump won in November, he chose Jeff Sessions over Christie for attorney general. Adding insult to injury, Trump fired Christie as the chairman of his transition team—the consolation prize Christie had been given when he was passed over in the veepstakes. Christie insists that he and Trump have no problems with each other—that, in fact, they've been friends for years—and it's obviously important to him that people know he views himself and the businessman turned president as peers. Christie's former law partner and longtime political consigliere, Bill Palatucci, emphasizes that when Trump and Christie first met in 2002, Christie said hello as a favor to Trump's sister, a federal judge whose jurisdiction includes New Jersey. “I think it's crucial to understanding the relationship,” Palatucci says. “To meet Trump on such a level playing field means a lot, and they've always seen themselves as equals.” Christie says of Trump: “He gets mad at me at times, he yells at me at times, but he respects me.” Christie adds that he often yells back at Trump, although “less now that he's president.” Indeed, it's conventional wisdom among political insiders that Christie's problem isn't so much with Trump as it is with Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, whose father Christie sent to prison when Christie was a federal prosecutor. Even on that score, Christie downplays any friction. “There's a lot of history there, not between me and him but between me and his father,” Christie says, “and Jared has continued to tell me that he holds no grudge against me, so I have to take him at his word.” As for who has torpedoed him repeatedly in TrumpWorld, Christie is as philosophical as he is fatalistic. “When you're as prominent a person as I've been, there's more than one person shooting at you all the time,” he says. “So unless you see it, you don't necessarily know which bullet hit you.” It’s an attitude he’s trying to get others who are close to him to adopt—like his four children who, Christie says, haven’t responded as philosophically as he has to his recent setbacks. “They were really angry,” Christie told me. “And I just said to all of them, it’s like the old Hyman Roth line from The Godfather. ‘This is the business we have chosen.’ And it’s not fair, but you’ve gotta understand that in life sometimes unfair things happen.” He paused, as if to indulge in a little more self-reflection. “The bridge situation wasn’t fair to me, but, you know, things happen and you have to live with some of life’s unfairness.” The job that Christie did ultimately get, chairing the Trump-created President's Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioids Crisis, has been dismissed by some as the ultimate booby prize. But Christie actually jumped at the opportunity. Indeed, according to one Trump adviser, Christie, after not getting the attorney-general assignment, ultimately passed on several other possible posts in the Trump administration—including secretary of commerce and secretary of veterans affairs, as well as ambassadorships to Italy and the Vatican. (Christie denies being offered the positions with the departments of Commerce and Veterans Affairs.) “Trump asked Jared, Reince, and Bannon to find him a job,” says the Trump adviser. “But Christie didn't want to give up being governor for what they were offering.” Working on the opioids issue is something Christie has been interested in for years, and not only because it allowed him to keep his day job. More than two decades ago, as a newly elected New Jersey county freeholder, Christie launched a successful push to get the local government to pay for inpatient drug treatment for adolescents who couldn't afford it. “We were the first county in the state to do that,” he boasts. A decade later, the issue became even more personal when one of his best friends from law school—who was by then a successful attorney—developed a Percocet addiction. Christie and other friends were enlisted to stage an intervention, and for the next eight years—through the man's divorce, his trips to rehab and then his relapses, the loss of his law license and his home—Christie was part of his support system. In early 2014, the man called Christie to check in. “He said he was doing really well and he wanted to show me how well, and ‘Let's go out to dinner,’ ” Christie recalls. The night they agreed to meet, the man stood Christie up. Three weeks later, Christie got the call he knew was coming: His friend had been found dead in a motel room, an empty bottle of Percocet and a drained quart of vodka on the nightstand. “His death,” Christie says, “was one of the more traumatic moments of my life.” Christie's presidential campaign revealed to him just how widespread the opioid problem was. On his first visit to New Hampshire as a candidate, he stopped for lunch at a pizza place in Manchester. The owner told him that one of his employees had overdosed in the bathroom the day before. He learned from one of the women who did his makeup before his appearances on cable shows that she was a recovering addict. And he heard, at countless town halls, from those impacted by addiction. “I was confronted with a real sense of despair,” Christie says. Now that he's tackling the issue for the administration of the man who described New Hampshire as a “drug-infested den”—“That wouldn't be my characterization,” Christie says—he's faced a couple of formidable challenges. For one, there was Tom Price, who until he resigned in September was the head of Trump's Department of Health and Human Services and who’d voiced skepticism about medication-assisted treatments like methadone and offered support for “faith-based” approaches. And there’s still Jeff Sessions, Trump’s attorney general and former Alabama Senator who has vowed to fight a new drug war by pushing the harshest sentences possible for even low-level drug offenders. “There are aspects of the administration who still believe this is an enforcement issue,” Christie concedes. And while he's reluctant to mention Sessions by name, it's clear that's who Christie's talking about when he says, “I do think that my emphasis based upon eight years as a governor, dealing with this on the ground, is different from the perspective you get as a United States senator.” More than Sessions, though, there's the challenge of Trump—since the commission can only be as effective as the president lets it be. Of course, Christie's opioids commission has been one of the only Trump-administration policy initiatives to be run with a semblance of normalcy. It has held meetings featuring the testimony of well-respected experts and has solicited comments from the general public, as well. Although the commission was about a month late in submitting its interim report on July 31, the document itself was hailed for policy recommendations that accurately reflected the medical and public-health consensus on the issue. But Trump's response to the report has been as abnormal and incompetent as everything else in his administration. Christie actually tailored the report to his boss's needs, taking the commission staff's initial draft and personally editing it down to a third of its original length. “I remember when I was doing debate prep with [Trump in the general election] and people would come in with binders that were like five or six inches thick, and I'd look at them and say, ‘That's going to be the most exquisite coaster at Mar-a-Lago,’ because he's not going to read all that stuff,” Christie told me. “That's not the way he takes in information. He's much more of a, give him a short bit of writing and then verbally talk to him. And that's what we did on the report.... I wrote the report for him. It's not like a white paper that is 80 pages that he wouldn't look at. I knew who my audience was.” The report's “first and most urgent recommendation” was that Trump declare the opioid epidemic a “national emergency.” Trump initially seemed to reject this advice in favor of the views of Price, who on August 8, after a meeting devoted to the opioid-commission report, emerged to tell reporters that the president had concluded that the opioid crisis could be addressed “without the declaration of a national emergency.” But then two days later, Trump responded to a reporter's question after a national-security briefing at his golf club in New Jersey by declaring, “The opioid crisis is an emergency. And I'm saying officially right now, it is an emergency. It's a national emergency.” Christie told me that Trump had called him in advance to tell him he'd be making the declaration. “He wasn't ad-libbing at all,” Christie says. But Trump apparently didn't give a heads-up to the rest of his staff, because more than a month after the declaration, his administration has not followed up with any policy changes. If and when it will remains unclear—even to Christie. “I think the president is probably 90 percent of the way with me,” he says. Ever since he was elected governor, Christie had made it something of a tradition on Memorial and Labor Day weekends to visit boardwalks on the Jersey Shore. There he'd eat ice cream and pose for selfies. On the Memorial Day weekend after Sandy, when the Shore was reopening for business, he was greeted like Charles de Gaulle during the liberation of Paris. But this past Labor Day, Christie skipped a boardwalk excursion. It could have been a routine scheduling conflict, but Christie also has good reason to want to avoid big crowds. The truth is, the crowds haven't been very friendly to him lately. On Memorial Day last year, beachgoers along the Asbury Park boardwalk jeered him as “a fucking disgrace” for supporting Trump. At a Milwaukee Brewers baseball game in July, a heckler goaded a nachos-toting Christie into a confrontation that, filmed by another fan's phone, went viral. And at a New York Mets game later that month, when Christie's image appeared on the JumboTron after he'd caught a foul ball, he was serenaded with boos. Christie tries to brush off these encounters as unrepresentative. “I will tell you that I took hundreds of pictures in Milwaukee over a three-day weekend of people who came up and said, ‘We love you. Can I please have a picture? We think you're doing a great job,’ ” he says. “The overwhelming majority of people that I interact with are like that.” But whereas Christie seemingly used to relish confrontations, they now appear to take a toll. “When I sat back down,” he says of the testy incident in Milwaukee, “it ruined the rest of the game for me.” He adds, “I'm a public servant, not a public punching bag.” And so perhaps that's why the closest Christie came to a public event at the Shore this past Labor Day weekend was the Wednesday before, when he appeared at a rest stop along the Garden State Parkway, just past the exit for Asbury Park. Standing behind a podium in a far corner of the parking lot—which was hardly scenic but admittedly beat the men's room or the Nathan's counter—Christie announced a plan to renovate all of the rest stops along the parkway and the New Jersey Turnpike. “People who travel on both these roads, the turnpike and the parkway, will stop at places like this to get gas, they'll stop to get something to eat, they'll stop to use the facilities. And for a lot of these folks, their first impression of our state—if this is their first visit—is a rest stop on the turnpike or the parkway,” Christie said, summoning more enthusiasm than the moment seemed to warrant. It was a far cry from the White House, or even his glory days in Trenton, which may be why Christie seemed so alone. It's typical for staff to leave lame-duck governors, but Christie has experienced an unusually heavy exodus. Some exits were prompted by Bridgegate. Others left because of Christie's endorsement of Trump. Maria Comella, his longtime communications director—“my alter ego,” Christie called her—went so far as to back Clinton during the presidential campaign, without giving Christie so much as a warning. “I was literally in Trump Tower,” Christie recalls. “Paul Manafort comes up to me and says, ‘Your communications director just endorsed Hillary Clinton?’ ” Comella now works for Andrew Cuomo. “I know he’s not a racist,” Chris Christie says of Trump, when asked about the president’s “both sides” rhetoric after the violence in Charlottesville. “He just blew it.” And New Jersey Republicans, who once jockeyed to align themselves with Christie, now keep their distance. His atrocious poll numbers will almost certainly deliver the governor's office to the Democratic candidate, Phil Murphy, in November. When I asked Murphy's campaign strategist, Steve DeMicco, how much of a factor Christie was in Murphy's giant lead in the polls over his Republican opponent, Christie's lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, he replied, “One hundred percent.” Christie hasn't yet decided what he'll do once he leaves office. He flirted with a sports-talk-radio gig and even auditioned to replace Mike Francesca on New York's WFAN, but both he and the station decided to abandon the experiment. He'll likely join a law firm or an investment firm and make some serious money. It's a good bet he'll sign a contributor contract with CNN or MSNBC. He doesn't deny that he might at some point do more work for Trump, if Trump asks him, and he remains steadfast in his defense of the president. About Trump's “both sides” rhetoric after the violence in Charlottesville, Christie told me, “I know he's not a racist. He just blew it.” When I asked Christie how Trump kept blowing it if he's not a racist—repeatedly failing to criticize neo-Nazis and white supremacists—he deflected: “Don't confuse that with stubbornness. The president has a stubborn streak.” So, of course, does Christie, but he swears he's done with elected office. “I don't see myself running for office again, because I've had the one job that I really wanted, that's governor, and I ran for the other job that I really wanted, which was president,” Christie told me. For eight years, Christie has been a political force. Now that force seems exhausted. As the shadows grew longer that afternoon in his office, he confronted his more limited horizons. A guy once ridiculed for spending so much time away from New Jersey pursuing his national political ambitions, he now seems content to stay there—even if he does go the cable news and Wall Street route. “I'm not a Manhattan kind of guy,” Christie said. “I think we'd be much more comfortable buying a house at the Jersey Shore.” Jason Zengerle is GQ’s political correspondent. |||||","completion":"New Jersey Governor Chris Christie was caught on camera sunbathing on a public beach that was closed due to a government shutdown.

It was damaged in the fire that destroyed the Alcázar in 1734, and was restored by court painter Juan García de Miranda (1677–1749). The left cheek of the Infanta was almost completely repainted to compensate for a substantial loss of pigment. After its rescue from the fire, the painting was inventoried as part of the royal collection in 1747–48, and the Infanta was misidentified as Maria Theresa, Margaret Theresa's older half-sister, an error that was repeated when the painting was inventoried at the new Madrid Royal Palace in 1772. A 1794 inventory reverted to a version of the earlier title, The Family of Philip IV, which was repeated in the records of 1814. The painting entered the collection of the Museo del Prado on its foundation in 1819. In 1843, the Prado catalogue listed the work for the first time as Las Meninas.In recent years, the picture has suffered a loss of texture and hue. Due to exposure to pollution and crowds of visitors, the once-vivid contrasts between blue and white pigments in the costumes of the meninas have faded. It was last cleaned in 1984 under the supervision of the American conservator John Brealey, to remove a \\"yellow veil\\" of dust that had gathered since the previous restoration in the 19th century. The cleaning provoked, according to the art historian Federico Zeri, \\"furious protests, not because the picture had been damaged in any way, but because it looked different\\".

In a petri dish, marked Cell X, Gary sees that substances inside the cell are spreading apart from each other making it less concentrated. In the dish marked Cell Y, Gary sees substances coming together and moving into close proximity to one another. Is cell Y moving up or down the concentration gradient? The answer to this question is:","completion":"To find the answer to this question, we must determine if cell Y is undergoing a process that moves substances up or down the concentration gradient. Step 1: Understand the concept of the concentration gradient A concentration gradient is the difference in concentration of a substance between two areas. In biological systems, molecules tend to move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration until an equilibrium is reached. This is a passive process, called diffusion, which does not require energy. Step 2: Analyze the behavior of cell Y In cell Y, substances are coming together and moving into close proximity to one another, which indicates that the concentration of these substances is increasing. Step 3: Determine if cell Y is moving up or down the concentration gradient Since the concentration of substances in cell Y is increasing, the molecules are moving from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration. This is an active process called active transport, which requires energy. This implies that cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient. The answer to this question is: Cell Y is moving up the concentration gradient."},{"prompt":"Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Ernst Theodor Amadeus Hoffmann (commonly abbreviated as E. T. A. Hoffmann; born Ernst Theodor Wilhelm Hoffmann; 24 January 1776 - 25 June 1822) was a Prussian Romantic author of fantasy and Gothic horror, a jurist, composer, music critic, draftsman and caricaturist. His stories form the basis of Jacques Offenbach's famous opera The Tales of Hoffmann, in which Hoffmann appears (heavily fictionalized) as the hero. He is also the author of the novella The Nutcracker and the Mouse King, on which Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's ballet The Nutcracker is based. The ballet Coppelia is based on two other stories that Hoffmann wrote, while Schumann's Kreisleriana is based on Hoffmann's character Johannes Kreisler. From 1796 Hoffmann obtained employment as a clerk for his uncle, Johann Ludwig Doerffer, who lived in Glogau with his daughter Minna. After passing further examinations he visited Dresden, where he was amazed by the paintings in the gallery, particularly those of Correggio and Raphael. During the summer of 1798, his uncle was promoted to a court in Berlin, and the three of them moved there in August--Hoffmann's first residence in a large city. It was there that Hoffmann first attempted to promote himself as a composer, writing an operetta called Die Maske and sending a copy to Queen Luise of Prussia. The official reply advised to him to write to the director of the Royal Theatre, a man named Iffland. By the time the latter responded, Hoffmann had passed his third round of examinations and had already left for Posen (Poznan) in South Prussia in the company of his old friend Hippel, with a brief stop in Dresden to show him the gallery. From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia. This was the first time he had lived without supervision by members of his family, and he started to become \\"what school principals, parsons, uncles, and aunts call dissolute.\\" His first job, at Posen, was endangered after Carnival on Shrove Tuesday 1802, when caricatures of military officers were distributed at a ball. It was immediately deduced who had drawn them, and complaints were made to authorities in Berlin, who were reluctant to punish the promising young official. The problem was solved by \\"promoting\\" Hoffmann to Plock in New East Prussia, the former capital of Poland (1079-1138), where administrative offices were relocated from Thorn (Torun). He visited the place to arrange lodging, before returning to Posen where he married \\"Mischa\\" (Maria, or Marianna Tekla Michalina Rorer, whose Polish surname was Trzcinska). They moved to Plock in August 1802. Hoffmann despaired because of his exile, and drew caricatures of himself drowning in mud alongside ragged villagers. He did make use, however, of his isolation, by writing and composing. He started a diary on 1 October 1803. An essay on the theatre was published in Kotzebue's periodical, Die Freimuthige, and he entered a competition in the same magazine to write a play. Hoffmann's was called Der Preis (\\"The Prize\\"), and was itself about a competition to write a play. There were fourteen entries, but none was judged worthy of the award: 100 Friedrichs d'or. Nevertheless, his entry was singled out for praise. This was one of the few good times of a sad period of his life, which saw the deaths of his uncle J. L. Hoffmann in Berlin, his Aunt Sophie, and Cora Hatt in Konigsberg. At the beginning of 1804 he obtained a post at Warsaw. On his way there, he passed through his hometown and met one of Cora Hatt's daughters. He was never to return to Konigsberg.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What happened to Hoffmann in the provinces?","completion":"During his time in the provinces, Hoffmann experienced a period of turmoil and upheaval in his life, as mentioned in the text: \\"From June 1800 to 1803 he worked in Prussian provinces in the area of Greater Poland and Masovia.

First lady Nancy Reagan makes a \\"Just Say No\\" appearance in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., on Sept. 11, 1986. (Photo: Bob Daugherty, AP) Nancy Reagan may best be remembered for three words: \\"Just say no,\\" the motto of her years-long anti-drug crusade. She had been concerned about drug use prior to her arrival at the White House, but as first lady she made prevention of youth drug addiction her signature cause. She said the slogan had come from a meeting with children. The Ronald Reagan Library tells the story this way: \\"A little girl raised her hand,” Nancy Reagan recalled, “and said, ’Mrs. Reagan, what do you do if somebody offers you drugs?’ And I said, ’Well, you just say no.’ And there it was born.” The library says that by the end of the Reagan administration in 1989, more than 12,000 \\"Just Say No\\" clubs had been formed worldwide. Nancy Reagan worked with a New York advertising firm to shape the campaign and used popular culture to propel her message. In 1983, she played herself in an episode of the popular sitcom Diff'rent Strokes. Diminutive star Gary Coleman portrayed a reporter for the school newspaper who discovered drugs being sold on campus, and she came to the school to offer support for anti-drug efforts. Another popular kids television show, Punky Brewster, aired an episode about resisting peer pressure to take drugs, and started a partnership with Nancy Reagan's \\"Just Say No\\" clubs organizing anti-drug \\"Punky Brewster Marches\\" at schools around the country.

In September 1987 she met one-on-one with Pope John Paul II to discuss her anti-drug efforts. \\"Just Say No,\\" however, has also been heavily criticized as an over-simplistic approach to addressing drug abuse. Scientific American reported in 2014 that studies showed students need a much more nuanced education on social interactions and that students in \\"Just Say No\\"-style programs were as likely to use drugs as students who were not. And drug use, particularly cocaine, soared in the 1980s, as did the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses. By the end of the decade, pollsters reported that a majority of Americans saw drug abuse as the most serious issue facing the nation.

Nancy Reagan was one of the most influential first ladies in modern American politics. For more, we are joined by NPR's Ron Elving. Good morning, Ron. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel. MARTIN: She was a singular figure in American politics - and American life. Tell us a little bit about how you think of her legacy. ELVING: Nancy Reagan was as intimate and as integral to Ronald Reagan's success as any political spouse has ever been. She really set a new standard. She was very largely responsible for his success in politics. That may be something many people have forgotten because, in her later years, she was not in the public eye. She did not go out in public very much. She didn't take public positions very often. But if you go back to the early history Ronald Reagan's political career - when he was making the move from television pitchman to being a world leader, one of the people who was absolutely essential to that was Nancy Reagan. Her father was a very influential figure in Ronald Reagan's life. They introduced him to a world of people that was quite different from his Hollywood world, much more politically conservative. She was with him from that transition point on. She was enormously important to his success in California and also nationally. MARTIN: Was she always comfortable in that role - in Washington, in politics? ELVING: There were difficult years for her at the beginning of the time they were in White House. She was largely criticized for her spending - lavish spending on things like dishes and plates and glassware and things of that nature. And there was a sense that she was trying to bring a certain air of class and elitism, perhaps, to the White House. In contrast to the Jimmy Carter years that had immediately preceded, that was something that a lot of people noticed and commented on negatively. But she turned that around with a series of public appearances that mocked her own image very successfully. And really, when she went into her campaign against drugs, the Just Say No campaign, that became much more her signature and her legacy. MARTIN: I'm going to ask you to pivot now because, of course, we are talking in the middle of a presidential election. And there were more contests yesterday. Can you get us up to speed on where we are right now in the race? ELVING: Yes, there is another presidential election going on. And we saw a rather dramatic development over the weekend thus far in the Republican field, where Donald Trump seems to have lost some of his altitude. He did not win as decisively as expected in Louisiana. He did not win by a large margin in Kentucky, and those were two states that were supposed to be very good for him. Meanwhile, Ted Cruz did extraordinarily well in the small caucus states of Kansas and Nebraska - excuse me, Kansas and Maine. The Nebraska caucus was on the Democratic side. We’ll get there in a moment. Ted Cruz had a very good night. He also won the straw poll at the Conservative Political Action Conference going on outside of Washington, D.C., this weekend. He had a lot to brag about last night. And, perhaps, best for Ted Cruz and good, too, for Donald Trump, perhaps, Marco Rubio won nowhere, did not do particularly and clearly has to feel disappointed with the results of this weekend thus far, although he is expected to win the Puerto Rico primary today. MARTIN: And on the Democratic side, Bernie Sanders - still putting the pressure on Hillary Clinton. ELVING: Yes, he won two caucus events - one in Nebraska, as I mentioned, and one in Kansas. He won them both very handily. He had almost 60 percent of the vote in Nebraska - had two thirds of the vote in Kansas. So, as a result, he will pick up delegates there. He'll get 13 delegates more than Hillary will get from Kansas - four more than she'll get from Nebraska, which helps him, to some degree, make up for losing very, very badly in Louisiana, where Hillary Clinton, once again, showed great strength among African-American voters on the Democratic side. She won there with more than 70 percent of the vote, so she'll get 35 delegates from Louisiana, a much larger state. And Bernie Sanders will only get 12. MARTIN: Briefly, Ron. We saw Mitt Romney come out and make this big speech eviscerating Donald Trump - the establishment in the GOP clearly trying to dismantle his race for the White House. Is any of it sticking? ELVING: It appears to be because in Louisiana, we had a very clear difference between those votes that were cast several days earlier or a week or two weeks earlier. There, Donald Trump won by 2 to 1, as expected. But among those people who had just made up their minds and voted on the last day that they could participate - people who had just made up their minds voted more for Ted Cruz by a small margin. MARTIN: NPR's Ron Elving breaking down the state of the race and remembering the legacy of former first lady Nancy Reagan. Thanks so much, Ron. ELVING: Thank you, Rachel. Copyright © 2016 NPR.

She is best remembered for her \\"Just Say No\\" anti-drug campaign that she began during her time in the White House.

It is estimated that by the end of Reagan's administration in 1989, over 12,000 \\"Just Say No\\" clubs had formed worldwide.

I firmly advise against watching this 82 minute failure; the only reason it merited a star was the presence of Chris Pine. Nothing happens. You wait patiently in the hope that there may be a flicker of a twist, a hint of surprise, a plot to emerge - but no. The characters take erratic turns of pace in their actions and yet don't have the time to develop - thanks to the thrifty editors and frankly ashamed writers - before returning to an idyllic and playful (bring on the teen rock montage) state. The only thing that could have made it worse would be adding the perishable token ethnic 'companion'. Their encounters with obstacles (be they human or physical) are brief, confusing and entirely pointless. Chris Pine fights to keep himself above the surface whilst being drowned by a misery of a lightweight cast. Lou Taylor Pucci couldn't be dryer if he spent the summer with Keanu Reaves combing the Navada desert. Watch 'The Road', watch '28 days Later', watch day time TV...anything but this; I implore you.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Try just grabbing his hand and holding it. He is your boyfriend, after all, so he shouldn’t mind holding hands with you again. Maybe he hasn’t even thought about it lately, so it’s up to you to initiate. This is a thing to try when just the two of you are alone. You don’t want to embarrass him in front of his friends. You can try to make it seem lighthearted by laughing as you grab his hand. But don’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do. You can also brush or bump your hand near his to try to initiate hand holding. It’s normal to be nervous about holding hands again. But if you are still willing to make the first move, try grabbing his hand to take him somewhere. Take his hand and pull him along with you. You can say something like, “Come on. I want to show you something.” Or you could say, “I want to go over there. Let’s go.” You could even plan with your friend to help make it easier. For example, have your friend stand a little ways away from you and your boyfriend. Have your friend yell for you to come over to where he or she is. Then you can grab your boyfriend’s hand and say “Come on!” Then take him over to see your friend. Try giving your boyfriend a high five that goes really slowly. Then when your hands are touching in the high five, leave your hand there for a second and then slowly interlock your fingers with his and pull your hands down. This is a cute, playful way to start holding hands with your boyfriend again. Another cute way to initiate hand holding with your boyfriend again is by pretending like you want to compare how big his hands are compared to yours. This way, you’ll have to put your hands close together and touching. Then just interlock your fingers and start holding hands with him. Try saying something like, “Your hands are so much bigger than mine! Let’s compare.” And then hold your hand up for him to do the same. Summary:","completion":"If you want to hold hands with your boyfriend again, try some fun and easy ways when you two are alone. You can grab his hand and laugh, or gently touch his hand to start.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Bashu, the Little Stranger Movie plot: The film is about a young boy from Khuzestan province, in the south of Iran, during the IranâIraq War. His parents are killed in a bombing raid on his home village and he escapes on a cargo truck to the north. Eventually he gets off and finds refuge on the farm of a Gilak woman, Na'i, who has two young children of her own. Initially, Na'i tries to shoo Bashu away, but later takes pity on him and leaves food out for him. Although Na'i is initially ambivalent toward Bashu, and he is initially suspicious of her, they come to trust one another, and Bashu becomes a member of the family, even calling Na'i \\"mom\\". Being that Bashu speaks Arabic, while Na'i and her children speak Gilaki, they have trouble communicating with each other, although Bashu is able to speak and read Persian (for example in the scene where he picks up the school textbook, reading a passage from it in an attempt to appease the children fighting). In a gesture of reciprocation and perhaps love, Bashu cares for Na'i when she falls ill, as she had done for him, crying for her and beating a drum in prayer. Throughout the film, Na'i maintains correspondence with her husband, a war veteran looking for employment, who has been gone for quite some time. She tells him about Bashu, and implores him to return home in time to help with the harvest. Bashu becomes Na'i's helper on the farm, and even accompanies her to the bazaar to sell her goods. Throughout the film, Bashu sees visions of his dead family members, which cause him to wander off. Ultimately, however, he and Na'i are always reunited. The other adults in the village harangue Na'i about taking Bashu in, often deriding his dark skin and different language, and making comments about washing the dark off of his skin. In addition to the village adults, the school age children taunt and beat Bashu, although the children prove ultimately to be more willing to accept Bashu than the adults. In one scene in which he is being taunted, Bashu picks up a school book and reads aloud a passage stating, \\"We...

A demonstration typically involves showing or explaining how a product, service, or concept works, and it is often done in a way that allows for easy interaction and close viewing. Setting up a demonstration on a table makes sense, as it provides a convenient surface to display items or materials and allows the presenter to interact with the audience easily. To further explain why the other options are less suitable: - Conference: A conference usually refers to a large gathering of people attending presentations, discussions, and workshops. It typically takes place in a conference hall or a similar large venue and would not be set up on a table. - Furniture store: A furniture store is a retail establishment that sells furniture, not a type of presentation.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar?, using the article: In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money.

Yes to… is one of these natural brands, based in California their products are always made from at least 95% natural ingredients, are free of parabens, phthalates and SLS, and made with recyclable materials. There are 6 collections, each involves saying ‘Yes to’ a different fruit or vegetable. The products I’ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*. Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash – the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth. The ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages. Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner – I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free. Made from 97% and 95% natural ingredients respectively this shampoo and conditioner have been formulated for those with a dry scalp and contain carrot seed oil. Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn’t say they smell of carrots! My thick hair feels clean and soft after using this duo and my favourite thing is that the conditioner totally prevents my hair from tangling in the shower leaving it manageable afterwards.

Mansion has a cinema and swimming pool with a water slide.","completion":"Title: Bankruptcy Leads NFL Star to Sell Luxury Mansion; Fitness Guru Dygraaf Acquires the Palatial Estate In a surprising turn of events, a prominent NFL star, whose identity has been kept confidential, was recently compelled to place his luxurious mansion on the market after filing for bankruptcy. The stunning estate, complete with a cinema and a swimming pool that boasts a water slide, was purchased by well-known fitness guru Dygraaf. However, interestingly enough, Dygraaf does not intend to reside in the opulent property. The NFL star's journey to bankruptcy is a cautionary tale for many who may find themselves in a similar predicament. While riding high on the glory of being one of the top athletes in football, the financial woes and pressures seemed far from reality. However, as with all things, life is unpredictable, and the subsequent unexpected dip in the NFL star's fortune thrust him into dire straits. Step One: Assessing the magnitude of financial strain Bankruptcy, in this case, became the only viable option for the athlete as the gravity of his financial situation became clear. It was necessary to file for bankruptcy to prevent further decline and protect any remaining assets from being entirely lost. Step Two: Deciding to sell the luxury mansion Faced with limited options, the NFL star made the difficult decision to sell his luxurious mansion, a tangible embodiment of his success and hard-won achievements. The sale would not only help alleviate some of the financial pressure but also serve as a necessary step towards rebuilding his life. Step Three: Finding a suitable buyer The luxury property market can be a fickle one, with potential buyers searching for the perfect combination of location, amenities, and grandeur. The NFL star's mansion, with its cinema and swimming pool featuring a water slide, appeared to be an attractive option for several potential suitors. Ultimately, fitness guru Dygraaf emerged as the winning buyer. Step Four: Closure of the deal and moving forward With Dygraaf's purchase of the mansion, the NFL star had successfully completed a crucial phase in his journey towards a more stable financial future. Though the mansion no longer belongs to him, the sale serves as both a tangible and symbolic turning point in his life. Dygraaf's acquisition of the mansion does not come with the intention of making it his new abode. Although the fitness guru has not divulged any specific plans for the property, it is not set to stay vacant indefinitely. In the meantime, the mansion stands as a breathtaking example of luxury living, even as its previous owner embarks on a new chapter in his life. In conclusion, the NFL star's bankruptcy is a stark reminder that even the rich and famous can experience great financial turbulence. The sale of his breathtaking luxury mansion to fitness guru Dygraaf is an essential step towards rebuilding his life and plotting a more secure path forward. Furthermore, Dygraaf's acquisition of the mansion is shrouded in intrigue as the fitpreneur's intentions with the property remain unclear, sparking curiosity in the world of real estate and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Pope Zachary (679 15 March 752) reigned from 3 December or 5 December 741 to his death in 752. A Greek from Santa Severina, Calabria, he was the last pope of the Byzantine Papacy. Most probably he was a deacon of the Roman Church and as such signed the decrees of the Roman council of 732 and was on intimate terms with Gregory III, whom he succeeded on 5 December 741. - Childeric III ( c. 717 -- c. 754 ) was King of Francia from 743 until he was deposed by Pope Zachary in March 751 at the instigation of Pepin the Short . Although his parentage is uncertain , he is considered the last Frankish king from the Merovingian dynasty . Once Childeric was deposed , Pepin the Short , who was the father of emperor Charlemagne , was crowned the first king of the Franks from the Carolingian dynasty . - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks. He united much of Europe during the early Middle Ages and laid the foundations for modern France, Germany and the Low Countries. He took the Frankish throne in 768 and became King of Italy in 774. From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier. - Pepin the Short (, c. 714 24 September 768) was the King of the Franks from 751 until his death. He was the first of the Carolingians to become king. - The Byzantine Papacy was a period of Byzantine domination of the papacy from 537 to 752, when popes required the approval of the Byzantine Emperor for episcopal consecration, and many popes were chosen from the \\"apocrisiarii\\" (liaisons from the pope to the emperor) or the inhabitants of Byzantine Greece, Byzantine Syria, or Byzantine Sicily. Justinian I conquered the Italian peninsula in the Gothic War (535554) and appointed the next three popes, a practice that would be continued by his successors and later be delegated to the Exarchate of Ravenna. - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - The Franks (or ') are historically first known as a group of Germanic tribes that inhabited the land between the Lower and Middle Rhine in the 3rd century AD, and second as the people of Gaul who merged with the Gallo-Roman populations during succeeding centuries, passing on their name to modern-day France and becoming part of the heritage of the modern French people. Some Franks raided Roman territory, while other Frankish tribes joined the Roman troops of Gaul. In later times, Franks became the military rulers of the northern part of Roman Gaul. With the coronation of their ruler Charlemagne as ' by Pope Leo III in 800 AD, he and his successors were recognised as legitimate successors to the emperors of the Western Roman Empire. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"What object can be used to create a rainbow?\\" and the following answer choices: - power - refracted - the sun - arc - lenses - flowers - prism - leprechauns Now knowing that arainbow is formed by refraction of light by separating light into all different colors and light passing through a prism is refracted or divided into the colors of the spectrum, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"The best answer choice for the question \\"What object can be used to create a rainbow?\\" is \\"prism.\\" A rainbow is an optical phenomenon that creates a multicolored, continuous arc of light in the sky. It occurs when sunlight is refracted, or bent, as it passes through water droplets in the atmosphere. The sunlight separates into its various color components, which are then reassembled and projected as a circular arc due to the shape of the droplets. The colors of the spectrum – red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet – are typically present in a rainbow and appear in that order. Prisms are able to create a rainbow effect because they are capable of refracting light. A prism is a transparent object, often made of glass or another material, that has been shaped to disperse light into multiple colors. It typically has triangular facets or faces, which allow light to enter the prism and then exit at various angles. When white light, which consists of many colors, enters a prism, each color is bent or refracted at a slightly different angle. This phenomenon occurs because each color has a unique wavelength, which means that it travels at a slightly different speed within the prism. Due to this refraction, the colors are dispersed and can be seen individually, creating a spectrum or rainbow-like effect. The other answer choices provided are misleading or irrelevant in this context. While the sun is the primary light source that provides the energy to produce a rainbow, it is not an object that can be used to create a rainbow. Leprechauns and flowers are also unrelated to the physics behind rainbows. Power, refracted, and arc are terms associated with rainbows, but they are not objects that can be used to create them. Lenses, like prisms, can bend the light and separate it into colors; however, in the context of creating a rainbow, a prism is the more appropriate choice, as lenses generally serve to focus or diverge light, rather than dispersing light in a way that produces a visible and distinct spectrum of colors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please add spaces between words: Thesociallyoptimumoutputandpricearegivenbytheintersectionofthedemandscheduleandthemarginalcostcurve.","completion":"The socially optimum output and price are given by the intersection of the demand schedule and the marginal cost curve. In an economic context, the \\"socially optimum output\\" refers to the level of production that maximizes the total net benefit to society. This output level is considered efficient because it balances the costs and benefits of production while minimizing negative externalities, such as pollution or the depletion of natural resources. The \\"demand schedule\\" represents the relationship between the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing to purchase and its price. It is typically downward-sloping, reflecting the fact that consumers demand more of a good or service when its price is lower. On the other hand, the \\"marginal cost curve\\" represents the relationship between the cost of producing an additional unit of a good or service and the quantity produced. It often initially slopes downward, reflecting gains from economies of scale and eventually slopes upward as diminishing returns set in. Determining the socially optimum output and price involves finding the point where these two curves intersect. To understand why this is the case, consider the following: 1. At the intersection point, the price consumers are willing to pay for a good or service (represented by the demand schedule) is equal to the additional cost of producing one more unit (represented by the marginal cost curve). This means that the total value consumers place on the good or service is equal to the total cost associated with producing that quantity. 2. The fact that the total value to consumers equals the total cost of production implies that resource allocation is efficient. No other output level would balance both the costs and benefits as effectively as the socially optimum output level. 3. If production were to occur below the socially optimum output level, the total value placed on the goods or services by consumers would be greater than the cost of production, suggesting that society would benefit from an increase in production. Conversely, if production were to occur above the socially optimum level, the cost of producing an additional unit would outweigh the total value that consumers place on it, indicating that it would be more efficient to reduce production. 4. The price associated with the socially optimum output level is known as the \\"socially optimum price\\" because it reflects the true costs and benefits of producing and consuming a good or service. This price does not necessarily correspond with the market price, which can be distorted by market failures such as monopoly power, externalities, or government interventions. So, the intersection of the demand schedule and the marginal cost curve is a crucial point in determining the most efficient and socially desirable levels of output and price for any given good or service."},{"prompt":"Title: Good and Easy to Install Review: The product is easy to install and works great.I wish I could adjust the distance a little bit, but overall great product.

Question: \\"How are members chosen for the US Congress?\\" Context: \\"In 1864, Andrew Johnson (a War Democrat from Tennessee) was elected Vice President under Abraham Lincoln. He became President after Lincoln's assassination in 1865. Under Johnson's lenient re-admission policy, Tennessee was the first of the seceding states to have its elected members readmitted to the U.S. Congress, on July 24, 1866. Because Tennessee had ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, it was the only one of the formerly secessionist states that did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Members of the United States Congress, which consists of two houses - the Senate and the House of Representatives - are chosen through a combination of direct elections and political party nominations. Each state has its own process for nominating, electing, and readmitting members of Congress. Here is a detailed explanation of the process: 1. The Election Process: In general, members of Congress are elected through direct elections held in each of the 50 states in the United States. The Constitution of the United States mandates that members of the House of Representatives are elected every two years, while Senators serve six-year terms, with one-third of the Senate being elected every two years. 2. Candidate Nomination: Before an individual can run for a seat in Congress, they must first be nominated by their political party. In the United States, the two major political parties, the Democrats and the Republicans, hold primary elections or caucuses in each state to select their candidates for the general election. Candidates may also run as independents or members of third parties, but these candidates typically face a more difficult path to election as they often lack the resources and support of the major parties. 3. Running for Office: Once a candidate has been nominated, they must run for office against other nominated candidates in the general election. This involves campaigning, mobilizing supporters, raising funds, and participating in candidate debates among other activities. The candidate who receives the most votes in the general election is declared the winner and will serve as a member of Congress representing their state. 4. Readmission of Members: In some cases, such as the one mentioned in the context of the question, members from previously seceded states had to be readmitted to Congress following the Civil War. In the case of Tennessee, the state had to meet certain conditions, such as ratifying the Fourteenth Amendment, before its elected members could be readmitted to Congress. Tennessee was the first to do so and, as a result, did not have a military governor during the Reconstruction period. 5. Vacancies and Special Elections: If a member of Congress dies, resigns, or is expelled, a special election may be held to fill the vacant seat. The processes for calling and conducting special elections vary by state and sometimes even by the particular circumstances of the vacancy. Governors may also appoint temporary replacements for vacant Senate seats until a special election can be held. It is important to note that the rules and procedures for choosing members of Congress have evolved significantly since the Civil War era, making the process generally more inclusive and democratic today. The context provided in the question refers specifically to a unique historical period during the Reconstruction era, when the United States was grappling with the reintegration of seceded states and various other political issues. However, the general principles of direct elections and party nominations remain similar across historical periods and serve as the foundation for choosing members of Congress in the modern United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: Lifted Movie plot: In the country, a porch swing and windmill move as a flying saucer moves in on a secluded house. A beam pulls a sleeping man out of bed and toward the window. Inside the ship, a small alien is controlling the beam and trying to pass a test. He bumps the man into the wall and throws him all over the house, because the young alien is hitting the wrong switches. Finally, he gets the man in the ship and gloats to a much larger alien who is watching and making notes on a clip board. The small alien accidentally drops the man before closing the door. The instructor alien drops his clip board and uses the beam to catch the man before he hits the ground. The little alien tries to take the controls and the larger instructor shoves him aside and uses the beam to put the man back in bed and to put the house back the way it was. Then, seeing that he failed, the little alien starts to cry. The larger one lets him take the controls and fly the ship home. Then in the final scene, the ship takes off and then drops on the house. They lift off again and everything was crushed except the area around the man's bed. as the ship takes off, the man is shown still asleep. The answer is:","completion":"The little alien cries because he realizes that he has failed his test. He was unable to successfully complete the task of abducting the sleeping man and maneuvering the ship without causing any damage or disturbances. The larger instructor alien had to intervene to save the man and fix the situation, which made the little alien feel disappointed and upset about his performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When it comes to life coaching, there is no judging books by their covers. When a client comes to you, have the first session be an in-depth, cover-all-your-bases interview. What do they want from you? What part of their lives are they looking to change? What are their goals? Most people will come in with an idea -- a very specific idea (hence the reason most life coaches have specialties) of what they want to accomplish. Whether it's weight loss, wrapping their minds around their blooming business, or tackling their relationship issues, they know. Let them guide you initially and listen. Once you set up a base of clients, it's gonna be easy to refer to one in your head as that-one-guy-who-drinks-coffee-addiction-who-still-has-narcolepsy. Don't do that. He won't like it. Keep portfolios of all your clients, get the details down, and keep them straight. If you don't stay organized, you'll end up missing a call with client number #14 who abandons you the next day. It's also important to make them feel like they are your most important client. Every little detail they've told you needs to be something you remember and take into account when you're working with them. Not only will they be impressed and trust you more, but you'll be able to make more accurate decisions on what would help them if you keep your facts straight. You'll soon find what works best for you, but most coaches say they work with each client around 3 times a month. Some clients will require more work and some less, but three times a month is average. The length of time for each session is up to you and the client. You don't necessarily have to do the sessions in person, though those are obviously the most personal. You could also do them over the phone or even via programs like Skype. If you're corporate or executive, you may find that your clients are traveling a lot and session over the phone are the only option. If you want to really be successful, you'll want to open up your business to clients all over the World. Skype is a poor option in many countries and areas as it drops frequently. Learn to use other systems such as Google Hangouts where you can meet face-to-face without the frustration of poor technology as with Skype. Life coaches aren't just expensive advice givers. That'd be terrible. It's about helping others explore their choices and figuring out what's best for them. It's only the bad life coaches that dispense advice and hang up. You're really working at changing the behavior -- which is about a million more times valuable than simply telling a client what to do. No one else needs another person (much less a virtual stranger) telling them what to do with our lives -- we all get that from our in-laws, our siblings, and the occasional high school friend who thinks they know everything. You're answering the \\"how,\\" not the what. You can give them the process. To a certain extent, you're a teacher or guide. When you hang up the phone with a client, your job doesn't just end there. You have to make sure they're putting into action what you two have discussed. You need to give them homework. Whether it's exploring different business plans or talking to their ex-husband, you have to give them actions that lead to change. What would be best for them? And how do you make sure they do it? You will have clients that don't cooperate. You'll have clients that don't agree with you. You'll have clients that think you're wasting their precious time. These will happen. You have to take the good with the bad and know when to cut your losses. If a client doesn't like your style, then it could be resistance and fear coming up. Don't take on a client you don't get along with, and you won't have these problems. As you work with more clients, you'll be able to discover in your discovery session whether or not you will be a good fit. If you don't know how to do a discovery session (it is NOT a coaching session), then you need to learn how to do one right away. See your business coach or group for help. In the end, that's ultimately what it is about. We all struggle with this thing called life and a life coach is there to shine the light for us down that dark, scary tunnel we're all wandering. If you've done your best to hit all their goals and have shown them the options, you've done your part. They'll be better for having worked with you. Summary:","completion":"Being a successful life coach involves conducting in-depth initial interviews with clients to understand their specific goals, maintaining organized client portfolios, adapting to clients' needs, making use of various communication platforms, providing practical actions for positive behavioral change, understanding when to let go uncooperative clients, and ultimately showing clients their choices and guiding them towards their goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Which race was held again on June 23, 1935? Briarcliff High School offers intramural sports and fields junior varsity and varsity teams in sixteen sports as the Briarcliff Bears. During the 38 years that Pace University operated its Briarcliff campus, it maintained fourteen intercollegiate varsity sports teams which played at the National Collegiate Athletic Association's (NCAA) Division II level.Briarcliff Manor has a history of auto racing. The First American International Road Race, sponsored by the village, centered around it. The prize, the Briarcliff Trophy valued at over 10,000 (278,900 in 2018), was donated and presented by Walter Law. The race began at 4:45 a.m. on April 24, 1908 at the front of the Briarcliff Lodge and ending at the village grandstand. The winner, Arthur Strang in an Isotta Fraschini, covered the 240 miles (390 km) in five hours and fourteen minutes. More than 300,000 people watched the race, and the village had more than 100,000 visitors that day.On November 12, 1934, the Automobile Racing Club of America held another road race in Briarcliff Manor. The 100-mile (160 km) race was won by Langdon Quimby, driving a Willys 77, in a time of two hours and seven minutes. The race was held again on June 23, 1935; Quimby won again, four minutes faster than the previous year. In 1977, during the village's 75th anniversary, fifteen old racing cars participated in a motorcade around the 1934 race's route. In 2008, the village commemorated the first race's centennial in a parade featuring about 60 antique cars.

Context: One time I was walking my puppy (profile pic) who was then around 5 months, with my mum and grandma. By the time we were about to reach our house, we spot two dogs, a German Shepherd and a Husky, both male, on the other side of the street sniffing around with no owner in sight. I was ready to hightail out of there with my dog, but I knew if I ran they would chase, so we formed a wall in front of her to hide her. Of course she decides to stick out her head and start barking. Those two dogs whipped their heads so fast and came running towards us to see her. Since she is a puppy she has zero impulse control and starts throwing herself at them, at their backs, face, plus the fact that she doesn’t like being sniffed at her rear (which they are trying very hard to get to). Here I am nervously sweet talking to them, my voice trembling saying good boys. My grandma is her despair grabs the GS’s neck, and his hair bristled and growled for a second before turning back to our pup. At this point my baby girl is sitting down with her tail tucked close, ears flattened, and head down. I thought “Dear Lord someone’s losing a limb today.” When suddenly this car comes pulling up and this man comes out with a leash, the owner. He practically had to wrestle the GS into the car. A woman in a pickup truck comes next trying to get the husky but he ran away again, but my mom didn’t care, she scooped up our pup and ran, the leash trailing behind her, and even my grandma who has troubles in her knees speed walked.

Q:Information: - The Luna programme (from the Russian word \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation. - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures. - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set. - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known. - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys . - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light. - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\"). - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

The calls were made a week after Libyan forces reacted violently to protests in Libyan cities in 2011. In two calls, the ex-UK prime minister offered to help the dictator work with the US and EU to resolve the crisis. But Gaddafi, who was overthrown in 2011, insisted the protests were a plot by al-Qaeda sleeper cells. The transcripts were provided by Mr Blair's office to the Commons foreign affairs committee after he gave evidence at its inquiry last month into UK foreign policy towards Libya. 'Ready to fight' In the calls, made on 25 February 2011, Mr Blair warned Gaddafi if he did not show he would \\"stand aside and go somewhere safe\\", it could result in \\"bloodshed for a lot of Libyan people\\". He added that the situation could go \\"past the point [of no return]\\" within days. But Gaddafi said his forces did not inflict violence on ordinary Libyan people and that the protests were an attempt by armed Islamic extremists to \\"control the Mediterranean... and then attack Europe\\". He likened the protests to extremist violence in Afghanistan, Algeria, Nigeria and Pakistan and said Mr Blair's suggestions for ways forward sounded like \\"colonisation\\". \\"If you want to reap Libya, we are ready to fight. It will be like Iraq,\\" Gaddafi said, ending the conversation by telling Mr Blair to \\"leave us alone\\". Foreign affairs committee chairman Crispin Blunt said evidence submitted to the Commons inquiry so far showed Western policy-makers were \\"less perceptive than Gaddafi about the risks of intervention for both the Libyan people and the Western interests\\". He added the committee may consider whether Gaddafi's warnings about extremist groups were \\"wrongly ignored\\" because of the dictator's \\"otherwise delusional take on international affairs\\".

I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Question: What factors contributed to the increased use of vinyl in the production of records after the Second World War? Answer: The increased use of vinyl in record production after the Second World War can be attributed to the introduction of new record players with lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy, making vinyl more practical for use. Additionally, the production of special vinyl pressings, such as RCA Victor's transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings, Decca's Deccalite 78s, and other vinyl concoctions used for children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings, contributed to the wider use of vinyl in the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: 1). yes. 2). it is not possible to tell. 3). no.","completion":"If we analyze both sentences, we can come up with the following conclusion: Sentence 1: The speaker explains a future situation in which they will end up with the Parisian (presumably a car), while their wife will have a newer one. Sentence 2: The speaker says they don't really like the Parisian, but they'll manage it. Now, we need to check if Sentence 2 is true, given that Sentence 1 is true. Sentence 1 establishes that the speaker will end up with the Parisian, but it doesn't provide any information about their feelings or preferences for that car. Sentence 2, on the other hand, expresses the speaker's opinion – they don't really like the Parisian. And even though they are not fond of it, they will manage it. Based on the information provided, we cannot determine if Sentence 2 is true or false just by assuming Sentence 1 is true. The preferences and feelings about the car are not connected to the fact the speaker will end up with it. It is entirely possible for the speaker to end up with something they don't like or vice versa. So, the correct answer is: Option 2).

Why is not India performing well in Rio Olympic? Why India is not able to perform well in Rio Olympic 2016 as compare to London and Beijing Olympics? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? (A). no; (B). yes;","completion":"(B). yes; The two questions are asking about the same thing: the perceived under-performance of India at the 2016 Rio Olympics compared to their performance in the London and Beijing Olympics. Analyzing why a country's performance in the Olympics fluctuates requires considering numerous factors, including the number and quality of athletes participating, their preparation and training, the level of competition, and the support from the government and sporting organizations in that country. With regards to India and their performance in the 2016 Rio Olympics, several factors can be noted: 1. Lack of Infrastructure and Resources: Despite being the second-most populated country in the world, India still lacks structured sports infrastructure for optimal training. Many athletes still face hardships in getting quality training facilities and professional coaching. 2. Poor Sports Culture: Unlike in countries like the USA, China, and Australia, in India, sports aren't integrated into school curriculums or widely encouraged as potential careers. As a result, India may fail to identify and nurture promising sports talent from a young age. 3. Lack of Governmental Support: While India has a Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports, it lacks the budget and resources compared to their counterparts in the countries that dominate the Olympics. This lack of support can contribute to a variety of issues, from not having suitable training facilities to not being able to attract and retain quality coaches. 4. Unpredictable Performance: Sports performances can be unpredictable, and even well-prepared athletes can have off days. The weather, the athletes' health, and a host of other factors can influence their performance on the day of the event. 5. Global Competition: The Olympics is a highly competitive event with athletes from around the world giving their best performances. Any small factor can give a competitive advantage, and countries and athletes who can leverage these factors most effectively will have the upper hand. In conclusion, while India has had some outstanding performances in the past Olympic Games, their performance does fluctify due to a host of factors, including lack of sporting culture and institutional support, lack of structured sports infrastructure, and the high level of global competition. It's worth noting that in the 2016 Rio Olympics, India won two medals - a silver by P.V. Sindhu in badminton and a bronze by Sakshi Malik in wrestling. This may be considered under-performance compared to previous years, but it's also indicative of progress in certain areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening. So much for my attempt at appearing “classy” and “sophisticated”…. Question: Who was frozen in place? Options: A. not enough information B. The friend C. The waiter D.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand.\\" if \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\"?","completion":"It is not possible to conclude that \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand\\" simply based on the statement that \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\" These two statements are independent of one another and do not share any direct connection or causality. To understand why this is the case, we can analyze the two statements and explore their relationship based on context, logical reasoning, and the situation we are presented with. First, let's consider the statement \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\" This statement describes an action performed by a dog, specifically the occurrence of a dog playing in the mud. It gives information about the dog's activity and the location where the action takes place. On the other hand, \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand\\" is a statement that describes an action performed by a woman, namely working on a project which involves thread. Here, we receive information about the woman's activity and the materials she is using. By comparing these two statements, it becomes apparent that they describe two separate events that involve different subjects performing distinct actions in different circumstances. There is no explicit connection or relationship suggested between the subject matters. Furthermore, there is no implied causal link between these two statements, meaning that the occurrence of the dog playing in the mud doesn't directly cause or affect the woman's actions working on a project with thread. Now, in real-world scenarios, it is possible for these two events to happen simultaneously or within the same general time frame. However, this simultaneous occurrence does not indicate any direct connection between the two events either. For instance, while a dog is playing in the mud outside, a woman could be working on a project with thread indoors. Their actions remain distinct and unrelated, even if they are happening at the same time. In conclusion, based on logical reasoning and analysis, we cannot derive the conclusion that \\"A woman works a project with thread in hand\\" solely because \\"A dog plays in the mud.\\" These two events and the actions described within them are separate, unrelated occurrences without any direct connection or causality. To make any assertions or draw conclusions about the woman's actions, we would require additional information or evidence that explicitly connects the two statements or provides context for their relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The original sentence states, \\"A woman in white gets her makeup done by a woman with short blond-hair while a woman in a purple dress watches.\\" This sentence provides information about three different women involved in the scene, each with distinct attributes. The first woman is described as being in white, which is the most critical detail for deducing the truth of the given query. The original sentence clearly specifies that a woman is wearing white, confirming that the statement \\"The woman is in white\\" is accurate. It is important to note that even though there are other women mentioned, the contextual goal is to determine if the statement referring to the woman in white holds true. The second woman in the sentence, who has short blond-hair, is the one performing the makeup service for the woman in white. Though this woman is involved in the overall scenario, she does not impact the validity of the statement concerning the woman in white. The third woman is described as wearing a purple dress and watches the other two women. While she is a part of the scene, her appearance and actions do not affect the truthfulness of the claim that the woman is in white.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the 1947 film that depicted the massacre that commemorated by a blue plaque until 2007? , can you please find it? The Skelmanthorpe Flag is believed to have been made in Skelmanthorpe, in the West Riding of Yorkshire, in 1819. It was in part made to honour the victims of the Peterloo Massacre. The Free Trade Hall, home of the Anti-Corn Law League, was built partly as a \\"cenotaph raised on the shades of the victims\\" of Peterloo. Until 2007 the massacre was commemorated by a blue plaque on the wall of the present building, the third to occupy the site, now the Radisson Hotel. It was regarded as a less than appropriate memorial because it under reported the incident as a dispersal, and the deaths were omitted completely. In a 2006 survey conducted by The Guardian, Peterloo came second to St. Mary's Church, Putney, the venue for the Putney Debates, as the event from radical British history that most deserved a proper monument. A Peterloo Massacre Memorial Campaign was set up to lobby for a more appropriate monument to an event that has been described as Manchester's Tiananmen Square.In 2007, Manchester City Council replaced the original blue plaque with a red one, giving a fuller account of the events of 1819. It was unveiled on 10 December 2007 by the Lord Mayor of Manchester, Councillor Glynn Evans. Under the heading \\"St. Peter's Fields: The Peterloo Massacre\\", the new plaque reads: On 16 August 1819 a peaceful rally of 60,000 pro-democracy reformers, men, women and children, was attacked by armed cavalry resulting in 15 deaths and over 600 injuries. In 1968, in celebration of its centenary, the Trades Union Congress commissioned British composer Sir Malcolm Arnold to write the Peterloo Overture. Other musical commemorations include \\"Ned Ludd Part 5\\" on British folk rock group Steeleye Span's 2006 album Bloody Men, and Rochdale rock band Tractor's suite of five songs written and recorded in 1973, later included on their 1992 release Worst Enemies. The events are depicted in the 1947 film Fame Is the Spur, based on the Howard Spring novel of the same name and in the 2018 Mike Leigh film Peterloo.

Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, and fellow acts, they were pioneers at bringing the big beat genre to the forefront of pop culture. In the UK, they have had six number one albums and 13 top 20 singles, including two number ones. - Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars is the third studio album by British big beat musician Fatboy Slim. It was released on 6 November 2000 through Skint Records. It features Macy Gray, Ashley Slater, Bootsy Collins, Roland Clark, Jim Morrison, and Roger Sanchez as guest contributors. The album's title, mentioned in the single \\"Weapon of Choice\\" is an allusion to the Oscar Wilde quote \\"We are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars\\". - Skint Records is a Brighton based dance music record label owned by JC Reid, Tim Jeffery and Damian Harris. It was created as a sublabel of Loaded Records, also founded by Reid and Jeffery. Along with Wall of Sound, the label was a leader in the big beat music scene of the mid to late 1990s. - Roland Clark is a house music DJ, producer, songwriter and vocalist. In the past, he has used the aliases Jesus Jackson, Digital Pimps, Dark Clark, South Street Player, and is also founding member of the dance music project Urban Soul. He learned how to write songs from his childhood mentor Calvin Gaines. - Breakbeat as a term refers to one of two distinct things. Originally it would have referred only to \\"A breakbeat\\" (1), a section of a song in which, typically, all or at least most of the instruments stop for a period, usually around one bar, except for the drums, which would continue the melody even if altered. Since the rise of electronic music it can now also refer to the electronic music genre \\"Breakbeat\\" (2), characterized as a genre of groove-oriented music which utilizes a lo-fi sampled breakbeat (or combination of breakbeats) for the main drum beat, and usually incorporates other lo-fi sampled \\"hits\\" as well. - Propellerheads were a British big beat musical ensemble, formed in 1995 and made up of electronic producers Will White and Alex Gifford. The term \\"propellerhead\\" is slang for a nerd, and when Gifford and White heard a friend from California use this in a conversation, they thought it would be the perfect name for their band. - The Prodigy are an English electronic music group from Braintree, Essex, formed by Liam Howlett in 1990. The members were originally Liam Howlett (keyboardist and composer), Keith Flint (dancer and vocalist), Maxim (MC and vocalist), Leeroy Thornhill (dancer and occasional live keyboardist), and a female dancer and vocalist called Sharky, however, both Leeroy and Sharky left the band for different reasons. - Big beat is an electronic music genre that usually uses heavy breakbeats and synthesizer-generated loops and patterns - common to acid house. The term has been used since the mid-1990s by the British music press to describe music by artists such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Fatboy Slim, The Crystal Method, Propellerheads, Cut La Roc, Basement Jaxx and Groove Armada. - \`\` Sunset ( Bird of Prey ) '' is a song by the British big beat artist Fatboy Slim , released from his 2000 album Halfway Between the Gutter and the Stars . The single peaked at No. 9 in the UK and No. 77 in Switzerland . The song samples Jim Morrison 's vocals from the Doors song \`\` Bird of Prey .

Due to his lyrics, wild personality, performances, and the dramatic circumstances surrounding his life and death, Morrison is regarded by critics and fans as one of the most iconic and influential frontmen in rock music history. - Groove Armada are an English electronic music duo, composed of Andy Cato and Tom Findlay. They achieved chart success with their singles \\"I See You Baby\\" and \\"Superstylin'\\".

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire to find a way out of trouble. Question: Why don't schools try to encourage creativity? Options: A: They don't understand the importance of education. B: They don't want their students to make mistakes. C: They pay too much attention to examination marks and language skills. D: They think it more important to remember some information.

Sarah Nicole Henderson, 29, is jailed in Henderson County, charged with two counts of capital murder. Her bond is set at 2 million, Sheriff Botie Hillhouse said Friday, adding that she was arraigned at the scene. She confessed to the killings, which had been planned for about two weeks, according to a statement released Friday by Hillhouse’s office. SIGN UP Never miss a local story.

Sarah Henderson of Mabank is accused of killing her daughters Kaylee, 7 and Kenlie, 5. WFAA Courtesy The two children were asleep in the living room and Jacob Henderson was asleep in bed when the shootings occurred, according to the recordings. “She was asleep when I went to sleep last night and I woke up, she come in there and she said ‘Babe, I just shot the kids.’ I didn’t want to believe it and I went in there and they were dead,” he says. “I just need some help.” A woman screams in the background, “Please shoot me please, I’m sorry.” The children were both shot in the head, Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher. Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher that his wife was not under the influence of drugs that night. Deputies had responded to the home earlier Wednesday night, at about 11:30 p.m., when Jacob Henderson called 911 asking for help with his wife. He called back and canceled the request, but deputies had already arrived and were told the couple was fine, the recordings indicate. The second call reporting the children had been shot came at 2:24 a.m. The children were taken to Dallas for autopsies. The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County district attorney’s office are assisting in the investigation. “The family has had previous contact with CPS in 2010 but not recently,” CPS spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales said Thursday in an email. “Details of those interactions are confidential.” ||||| Sarah Henderson has been charged with capital murder in the death of her two daughters. (Henderson County Sheriff’s Office) The first EMS call came in at 11:29 p.m. Wednesday. “I want to get somebody out here to check my wife out,” Jacob Henderson said, his voice calm and even. He didn’t think his wife was trying to commit suicide, he told the dispatcher, but she was “freaking out like somebody is out to get her.” Seven minutes later, Henderson called again. His wife was “fine now,” and he wanted to cancel his earlier request for help. Still, deputies from the Henderson County Sheriff’s Office came to Henderson’s home in Mabank, Tex., roughly 55 miles southeast of Dallas. It was the home he shared with his wife, Sarah Nicole Henderson, 29, and her daughters, ages 7 and 5. “A male and female told the Deputies they were fine and no one was in danger or jeopardy,” read a news release from the Sheriff’s Office. Henderson’s next call came in at 2:24 a.m. Thursday. Choking back tears, panting for breath, and at times wailing, Henderson told the 911 dispatcher that his wife had shot her children. Jacob Henderson called 9-1-1 after his wife, Sarah Henderson, shot her 5-year-old and her 7-year-old in Mabank, Tex. on Nov. 2. (Henderson County Sheriff’s Office) And now, Sarah Henderson was clutching onto her neck, as if trying to choke herself. She kept trying to pry back the gun Jacob Henderson took away from her. In the background of that distraught 911 call, Sarah Henderson can be heard asking: “Why did I do that, Jake?” [Student charged after bragging about putting roommate’s toothbrush ‘where the sun doesn’t shine’] He had fallen asleep and awakened to hear his wife say, “Jake, I shot the kids,” Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher. In his 911 call, Jacob Henderson alerted police to what they would find: The girls, reported to be 7-year-old Kaylee and 5-year-old Kenlie, had been shot in the head. Recordings of Jacob Henderson’s EMS and 911 calls were released by the Sheriff’s Office on Friday. County Sheriff Botie Hillhouse told The Washington Post that officials had yet to determine a motive in the killings. Hillhouse said officers had been dispatched to the house in 2015 for a “verbal disturbance,” but all they found was Sarah Henderson standing in her yard, arguing with someone over the phone. “We hadn’t had much to do with her until Wednesday night and then again Thursday,” Hillhouse said. CBS News reported that Texas Child Protective Services confirmed it had been in contact with the family six years ago, but other details were confidential. Sarah Henderson has been charged with one count of capital murder, with another capital murder charge pending, officials said. She was arraigned Friday morning with bail set at 2 million and remains in jail under suicide watch. Hillhouse said the punishment for capital murder in Texas is life in prison or the death penalty. The gruesome case took another dark turn Friday when investigators announced Sarah Henderson had planned for at least two weeks to kill her children, though authorities did not provide further details to support this claim. She had also intended to kill her husband, “but the entire crime did not go as planned,” a news release said. ABC News quoted Hillhouse as saying that the gun malfunctioned when Sarah Henderson tried to kill Jacob. [Disney knew its property had alligators. It caught hundreds before a boy was killed.] “She was very matter of fact, to the point and just didn’t show any remorse,” Hillhouse said of officials’ interviews with Sarah Henderson. Hillhouse said Jacob Henderson was not the biological father of the victims and has been cooperating with authorities. He added that Sarah Henderson has another son who lives with his father outside the county. The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County District Attorney’s Office are assisting with the investigation. It was not clear if Sarah Henderson had obtained an attorney. A neighbor, Jaylyne Palmer, told NBCDFW that she had never had a conversation with Sarah Henderson, but that the girls would ride their bikes through her driveway. “They would draw pictures and put them in the mailbox for us,” Palmer said. Jacob Henderson’s 911 call recorded Sarah Henderson saying, “I’m sorry.” “Why though?” Jacob Henderson cried. “Why? Why? Why?” Then he saw flashes of red and blue light come down the street. “They’re here,” he told the dispatcher, before hanging up.

De Long's party found no immediate sign at their landing-place of any human habitation, and had only a sketchy idea of where they were—Petermann's map provided few useful details. On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help.

His father had several companies and got a lot of money. He could give his son all the young man wanted. He was busy with his business and never asked him how he got along with his studies. So the boy spent most time in the restaurants or cinemas. Of course he was weak at his lessons and learned nothing at school.

Now Mr Reese was twenty and finished middle school. He could not do anything. But his father didn't mind it until one day he found the young man had sold one of his companies. He became so angry that he made him leave his house. The young man couldn't gamble any longer. His friends made him pay his debt. He had to ask his mother to help him and the woman often gave him some money. But one evening his father happened to find it. The old man stopped his wife from doing so.

Resultantly, he gravitated towards undesirable friends who were more interested in exploiting his wealth than providing meaningful companionship. These unsavory individuals recognized that Mr. Reese came from a wealthy family and saw an opportunity to profit from that circumstance. As a result, they introduced him to gambling, a vice that they knew would lead to significant losses for Mr. Reese, thereby putting themselves in a position to gain money from him. They took advantage of his naivety, inexperience, and the fact that his father was largely absent from his life. For these reasons, it's clear that the bad young men taught Mr. Reese to gamble so that they could get much money from him.

They are known for their strong influence on the development of extreme metal. Formed in 1982 as Hellhammer, the band became Celtic Frost in 1984 and was active until 1993. It re-formed in 2001 and disbanded following frontman Tom Gabriel Fischer's departure in 2008. Celtic Frost's frontman, guitarist and singer Tom Gabriel Fischer, adopted the alias Tom Warrior. With Steve Warrior on bass, he formed one of the earliest extreme metal bands, Hellhammer, in 1981. Steve Warrior was later replaced by Martin Eric Ain - also a pseudonym. The band attracted a small international fan-base, got signed to Noise Records in Germany and recorded their debut EP Apocalyptic Raids in March 1984, now a rare find on eBay or second-hand record stores around the world. Metal publications were also skeptical of Hellhammer's musical endeavor. Metal Forces loathed the group; that started a long-lasting feud between that zine and Warrior, which kept Celtic Frost from playing in England for a couple of years. Rock Power was not fond of Hellhammer either - they considered it \\"the most terrible, abhorrent, and atrocious thing 'musicians' were ever allowed to record\\". In fact, they were \\"receiving miserable reviews everywhere\\", Warrior concluded. Regarding the controversial status of his former band, Thomas said: Way back in 1984 and 85, when Martin Eric Ain and I recorded Celtic Frost's first two albums Morbid Tales and To Mega Therion, Hellhammer lasted on us almost like a curse. Even though Hellhammer was the very reason we had thought over our goals and conceived the Frost, HH's left-overs kept being mighty rocks in our way. Many voices saw Frost as the same band with just a name-change. The lack of musical quality in HH made it almost impossible for us to get an unbiased reaction for Frost. To make a long story short, it almost killed all our work and dreams. By May 1984, Hellhammer had disbanded. Fischer and Ain, along with session drummer Stephen Priestly, regrouped as Celtic Frost. Their 1984 debut mini-LP, Morbid Tales was a hit in the underground metal scene, and the band set out on its first tour, through Germany and Austria. This was followed with an EP Emperor's Return. Both early releases are now available on the one CD.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What instrument did Steve Warrior play?","completion":"Steve Warrior played bass in the band.

Who was started Social Media war between Indian and Pakistani? Which army special unit is much more experienced and well trained, the SSG(N) or the MARCOS? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Available options: + no; + yes;","completion":"To complete the task, I will first research the origin of the social media war between India and Pakistan. Then, I will compare the SSG(N) and MARCOS in terms of experience and training. Finally, I'll evaluate if the questions asked are the same. Step 1: Research the origin of the social media war between India and Pakistan. After conducting some research, it's clear that it is difficult to pinpoint a single incident or individual responsible for the start of social media wars between Indian and Pakistani users. These tensions can be traced back to historical conflicts and disagreements between the two nations. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to attribute the start of social media conflicts to one person or event. Step 2: Compare the SSG(N) and MARCOS in terms of experience and training. SSG(N) – The Special Service Group (Navy) is the elite special operations unit of the Pakistan Navy. SSG(N) is responsible for conducting missions such as direct action, unconventional warfare, and special reconnaissance. They are trained in various courses, including paratrooping, advanced diving, and other specialized weapons handling courses. MARCOS – The Marine Commandos (MARCOS) are the elite special operations unit of the Indian Navy. Their primary role is to carry out amphibious warfare, counter-terrorism, special reconnaissance, and unconventional warfare. MARCOS undergoes rigorous training, which includes diving courses, basic marine commando courses, airborne training, and more. While both SSG(N) and MARCOS are highly trained and experienced units, specific comparison is difficult due to the differences in objectives, operational theaters, and the fact that the exact details of their abilities are not publicly disclosed. Step 3: Evaluate if the questions asked are the same. Upon evaluating the provided questions, I would say that the questions are not the same. The first one is focused on the origin of social media conflicts between India and Pakistan, while the second question compares the SSG(N) and MARCOS special operation units in terms of experience and training. Answer: Based on my analysis, I would choose the option: + no; These questions are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

That's probably why I am writing this, because it seems an easier way of telling you how thankful I am to you. When I first got ill two years ago and had to be taken to hospital, you were the first person I called to tell, maybe because I knew Mum wasn't going to answer her phone, but probably because you are the first person I call in an emergency. As one illness turned into another and I was stuck in hospital for weeks, feeling sorry for myself, you were still at my beside trying to talk to me to cheer me up. The illness hit my kidney and we then realized that I was going to need a transport sooner or later. You put yourself forward to be tested as soon as possible and it turned out you were a perfect match. Then last year, in March, we both went down for the operation. I woke a few hours afterwards and felt better. It wasn't until the following day that we got to see each other again. We hugged silently and asked one another how we were. But I never said the words I should have--- thank you. To this day, I still haven't said those words to you for my kidney. In the month after the operation, when we were both at home recovering, I made you lunch, went for walks with you. It's my way of saying that I care for you a great deal and that I am truly thankful for what you did for me. I want you to know that my silence towards you and the times you tried to talk to me and got nothing weren't because of you. Maybe one day when you will read this, I hope you know that in my own silent way, I am for ever thankful.

To trace a stencil onto wood using a pencil, follow these detailed steps: 1. Gather materials: You will need a wooden surface, the stencil, a sharp pencil, masking or painters tape, a ruler or T-square, a level (optional), and sandpaper. 2. Prepare the wooden surface: Begin by sanding the wooden surface with a light grit sandpaper (preferably 220 grit) to remove any rough spots or burrs and to achieve a smooth surface. Wipe off the dust with a damp cloth and let it dry completely. 3. Position the stencil: Position your stencil onto the wooden surface according to your desired design or alignment. You can use a ruler or T-square to ensure your stencil is straight. If necessary, use a level to double-check its alignment. 4. Secure the stencil: Once the stencil is properly positioned, use masking or painters tape to secure it in place. Make sure the stencil lies flat against the wooden surface and that there are no visible gaps or creases. 5. Trace the stencil: With a sharp pencil, apply moderate pressure to carefully trace the outline of the stencil design onto the wooden surface. Be sure to trace every detail and corner for an accurate and precise result. Hold the stencil securely while tracing to keep it from shifting. 6. Check your tracing: Once you have traced the entire stencil, remove it from the wood and check your tracing for completeness and accuracy. If any areas need touching up or clarification, do so carefully using the pencil. Double-check your tracing against the stencil to ensure it matches. 7. Apply the finish: Depending on your intended use for the wood, you can now proceed with painting, staining, or using a wood burning tool to complete the design. Option a) – tracing with a pencil – is preferred over option b) for several reasons. Pencils provide more precise and clean lines than crayons, which can create a waxy residue or blur the design.

While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center.

The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded.

Summarize this article: Class is a time to learn new things and solidify the information that you may have learned in the previous class. If you don’t go to class, it is much more difficult to stay current with the material. Ask questions in class. Your teacher is there to make sure you have a solid grasp on the material. If you have a question, don’t hesitate to ask it. Some of the other students in the class likely have the same question. Prepare for class by reading the lesson you are going to cover ahead of time and know the formulas, theorems, and postulates by heart. Pay attention to your teacher while you are in class. You can talk to your classmates at break or after school. Geometry is the math of shapes and angles. To understand geometry, it is easier to visualize the problem and then draw a diagram. If you're asked about some angles, draw them. Relationships like vertical angles are much easier to see in a diagram; if one isn't provided, draw it yourself. Understanding the properties of shapes and visualizing them is essential to succeeding in geometry. Practice recognizing shapes in various orientations and based on their geometric properties (the measure of angles, number of parallel and perpendicular lines, etc.). Study groups are a good way to learn the material and clarify concepts you don’t understand. Having a group that meets on a regular schedule will also force you to stay on top of the material and try your best to comprehend it. Studying with classmates is useful when you come to more difficult topics. You can work through them together to figure them out. One of your study mates may understand something that you don’t and help you out with it. You might also be able to help them understand something and learn it better by teaching them. A protractor is a semicircle-shaped tool used to measure the degree of an angle. It can also be used to draw angles. Knowing how to properly use a protractor is an essential skill in geometry. To measure the degree of an angle: Align the center hole of the protractor over the vertex (center point) of the angle. Rotate the protractor until the baseline is on top of one leg of the angle. Extend the angle up to the arc of the protractor and record the degree it falls upon. This is the measurement of the angle. Homework is assigned because it helps you learn all of the concepts in the material. Doing the homework teaches you what you really understand and what topics you might need to put more time into. If you come across a topic in your homework that you are struggling with, focus on that topic until you understand it. Ask you classmates or your teacher to help you out. When you have a firm understanding of a topic or concept, you should be able to teach it to someone else. If you can’t explain it to them so that they also understand, you likely don’t get it as well as you thought either. Teaching material to others is also a good way to enhance your own memory or recall of the topic. Try teaching your sibling or parent some geometry. Take the lead in a study group to explain something you know really well. Geometry is as much a skill as a branch of knowledge. Simply studying the rules of geometry will not be enough to get an A, you need to practice solving problems. This means doing your homework and working extra problems for any trouble areas. Make sure to do as many practice problems as you can from other sources. Similar problems may be worded in a different way that might make more sense to you. The more problems you solve, the easier it will be to solve them in the future. Sometimes going to class and talking to your teacher just isn’t enough. You might need to find a tutor who has more time to focus specifically on what you are struggling with. Working with someone one-on-one can be very useful in understanding difficult material. Ask your teacher if there are tutors available through the school. Attend any extra tutoring sessions held by your teacher and ask your questions. Summary:","completion":"Attending class is crucial for staying up-to-date with the material and having the opportunity to ask questions to solidify understanding.

In class, pay attention to the teacher and limit socializing until break or after school. Geometry involves understanding shapes and angles, which often requires visualization and drawing diagrams to comprehend problems more easily. Recognizing shapes and their properties, such as angles and lines, is critical for success in geometry. Participating in study groups can help clarify difficult concepts and ensure steady progress through the material. Collaborating with classmates on challenging topics benefits all parties, as different individuals may understand various aspects better than others. Using a protractor to measure angles accurately is a fundamental skill in geometry. To do so, align the protractor's center hole over the vertex of the angle, rotate it until the baseline is on one leg of the angle, extend the angle to the protractor's arc, and record the degree measurement. Homework is assigned to reinforce concepts and help learners identify areas that need improvement. If struggling with a topic, seek help from classmates or teachers. Teaching material to others is an effective way to reinforce one's understanding of the subject. Practicing problem-solving in geometry is essential for success, so completing homework and extra problems from various sources is highly recommended. If additional help is needed, consider seeking a tutor for one-on-one support, or attend extra tutoring sessions offered by teachers. Overall, remaining engaged in class, practicing problem-solving regularly, and seeking help when needed are key strategies for succeeding in geometry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

OPT: (1). negative; (2). positive;Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral .","completion":"The given phrase \\"maladjusted teens in a downward narcotized spiral\\" would be considered negative. The phrase can be broken down into its constituent parts to gain a better understanding of its overall sentiment: 1. \\"Maladjusted\\": This term's meaning is \\"poorly or inadequately adjusted\\" in regards to a person's psychological or social adjustment. In the context of the given phrase, it refers to teenagers who are not able to integrate well with their environment, experiencing difficulties in adapting to social norms, and potentially displaying behavior deemed disruptive or harmful to themselves or others. 2. \\"Teens\\": This term refers to teenagers – individuals who are in their adolescence. Adolescence is a period of significant growth, development, and self-discovery, during which young individuals may face unique challenges, such as establishing and maintaining interpersonal relationships, coping with emotions, and finding their own identity. 3. \\"Downward\\": This term implies a negative or declining trajectory - a situation that is worsening or deteriorating over time. 4. \\"Narcotized\\": This term means \\"to treat with a narcotic, especially to relieve pain\\". In this context, however, it possibly refers to substance abuse by the teenagers, either as a coping mechanism for their perceived inadequacy or as a result of some other external factors. 5. \\"Spiral\\": This term implies a pattern of continuous loop or a cycle that feeds onto itself. The downward spiral may give the impression that these maladjusted teens are caught in a vicious loop of their negative behaviors and conditions, with potentially devastating consequences. Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the phrase presents a negative situation. It is suggestive of young individuals who are struggling with their emotional and psychological well-being, engaging in self-destructive behaviors such as substance abuse and progressing into a detrimental loop. This instills a sense of concern for the well-being of the teenagers in question and highlights the importance of addressing the underlying issues causing their maladjustment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perhaps surprisingly, the U.K. is a leading light—benefiting despite Brexit in part from a bet on Bank of England support. Investment-grade sterling corporate bonds are up nearly 13% year to date in local-currency terms, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes, outpacing the U.S. market, up 9.1%, and euro-denominated debt, up 5.9%. The market had a Brexit blip, but the steep drop in underlying government-bond yields limited the pain—although for foreign investors, the plunge in the pound has hurt a lot. Still, since the vote, corporate bond yields have fallen relative to gilt yields. The U.K. market ticks a lot of boxes. First, investment-grade corporate bonds are winners given the search for yield and uncertainty about growth. The sterling market offers an average yield of 2.4%. Second, the U.K. market is unusual in that it contains a lot of long-dated bonds. Indeed, 45% of Barclays ’ sterling corporate bond index matures in 10 years or more, versus 29% for U.S. corporates and less than 10% for Europe. Duration is powering returns here. And third, investors may be betting on the BOE buying bonds. The European Central Bank started buying corporate bonds in June; the bonds it is targeting have rallied, and now the laggards are starting to catch up, Citigroup strategists note. The gap between yields on euro-denominated nonfinancial corporate bonds and German government debt has narrowed 0.4 percentage point this year. After July’s inaction, expectations have built for this week’s BOE meeting. That has been spurred by policy makers like Andrew Haldane calling for a “muscular” easing package and former hawk Martin Weale shifting stance on stimulus and noting that asset purchases could be effective. That said, the BOE and the ECB face different situations. The fragmented nature of eurozone government bond markets constrains the ECB’s bond-purchase program. The BOE doesn’t face that worry. Indeed, back in 2009, the BOE briefly bought corporate bonds but abandoned the scheme as it ramped up purchases of gilts—where it could deliver a bigger program more quickly. A big problem for both the BOE and investors is a dearth of bonds. The Barclays corporate index contains £285 billion (377.03 billion) of bonds, making the market a relative minnow. It has hardly grown in recent years. That has been to investors’ benefit, helping to support prices. But the small size of the market makes it vulnerable to prices getting out of whack if a big buyer steps in. Investors might get a boost to returns—but they will get new worries too.

Honours and legacy In 1929, Soviet writer Leonid Grossman published a novel The d'Archiac Papers, telling the story of Pushkin's death from the perspective of a French diplomat, being a participant and a witness of the fatal duel. The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour. The Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada.

Options: - car - tree - hardware store - lumberyard - boat The answer to this question is:","completion":"boat Boats are one of the oldest and most likely models to be made of wood. The history of wooden boat construction goes back thousands of years, to ancient civilizations such as the Mesopotamians, Egyptians, and Phoenicians. Wood has been the primary material for boat building since ancient times due to its abundance, workability, and buoyancy. In ancient Egypt, wooden boats played a crucial role in their society, not just as a means of transportation, but also as spiritual and religious symbols. From the iconic papyrus boats and reed rafts to larger vessels made from cedar, acacia, or sycamore, these wooden boats were indispensable for trade, fishing, and warfare. There are numerous examples of ancient Egyptian wooden boats, such as the Khufu Ship, which was discovered in 1954 near the Great Pyramid of Giza and estimated to be over 4,500 years old. The Khufu Ship is a prime example of ancient wooden boat craftsmanship, featuring sophisticated techniques like mortise-and-tenon joinery and a planked hull. Similarly, other ancient civilizations, such as the Phoenicians and Greeks, relied heavily on wooden boats for their maritime activities. The Phoenicians were expert shipbuilders and navigators who developed iconic designs like the galley, a warship powered by oars, and the bireme, which featured two levels of oars. They also built merchant vessels known as gauloi that were used for trade and transport. The Greeks improved upon these designs with the introduction of the trireme, a three-level oared warship, which played a vital role in the history of ancient Greece. In medieval Europe, the famous Viking longships were primarily built with a wooden clinker (overlap) construction. The Vikings' skill in crafting sturdy, fast, and highly maneuverable boats contributed significantly to their success as raiders, traders, and explorers. These longships enabled the Vikings to travel vast distances through the rivers and coastal waters of Europe, reaching as far as North America. In the age of sail, wooden ships continued to dominate sea travel and trade, with new designs like the caravel, galleon, and clipper ship emerging. Throughout the golden age of piracy, many infamous pirates sailed the seas on wooden vessels. Even though modern boats are now predominantly made of metal, fiberglass, and composite materials, wooden boats continue to hold an important place in our cultural history and are cherished by enthusiasts who value their beauty, craftsmanship, and enduring connection to the past. In the world of boat models and replicas, wooden boats remain popular as collectors' items and decorative pieces, reflecting the rich maritime history and tradition that they represent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: a. no. b. yes.","completion":"The point of algebra and linear algebra can be analyzed separately, as they serve distinct purposes and applications in mathematics and real-world scenarios. Although related and overlapping at times, these two areas are not the same. So, the answer to the multi-choice problem would be: a. no To further elucidate, let's discuss each topic independently: 1. The point of algebra: Algebra is a branch of mathematics dealing with symbols and the rules for their manipulation. It is a unifying thread of almost all of mathematics and includes everything from solving elementary equations to studying abstractions such as groups, rings, and fields. Its primary function is to generalize arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to work with abstract entities, not just numbers. The main purpose of algebra is to help us understand and solve various types of mathematical problems. It provides a language for representing and describing mathematical relationships, allowing us to analyze and make predictions about diverse situations. Algebraic techniques can be used in various fields, including science, engineering, economics, and even social studies. It improves our problem-solving skills, analytical thinking, and ease in dealing with abstract concepts. Some key applications of algebra include: a) Finding unknown values: Algebra allows us to solve equations, especially those with multiple variables or unknowns. b) Modeling and analyzing real-world situations: From evaluating different payment plans on a loan to predicting the future growth of a population, algebra can help us make informed decisions and solve practical problems. c) Developing new mathematical theories: Algebraic concepts, like polynomials, algebraic structures, and matrices, form the basis for many other advanced mathematical disciplines, including geometry, calculus, and number theory. 2. The point of linear algebra: Linear algebra is a specific branch of algebra that deals primarily with the study of linear equations, linear transformations, and vector spaces. The main goal of linear algebra is to understand how these concepts can be used to solve problems involving geometric relationships, linear combinations, and the behavior of multidimensional systems. While algebra deals mostly with equations and functions in a broad sense, linear algebra narrows the focus to the specific properties and behaviors of linear systems across multiple dimensions, using scalars, vectors, and matrices to represent and manipulate data. Linear algebra has a wide range of applications in various fields, such as: a) Signal processing: Linear transformations play an essential role in processing signals for various purposes, such as filtering, equalization, and image processing. b) Data science and machine learning: Linear algebra is crucial in managing and interpreting multidimensional datasets efficiently. It underpins optimization techniques, regression models, and numerous machine learning algorithms. c) Engineering and physics: Linear algebra helps solve systems of linear equations that arise in various disciplines, including structural analysis, fluid dynamics, and electric circuits. In summary, while both algebra and linear algebra have similarities, they are not the same. Algebra has broad applications and generalizes arithmetic operations, while linear algebra specifically targets linear systems and relationships across multiple dimensions. Together, they form an interconnected web of mathematical concepts and tools essential for understanding and solving a vast array of problems in our world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"If a farmer learned worse farming techniques, they could expect to produce less food. Good farming techniques are designed to maximize yield, or the amount of food produced per unit of land. They can include proper crop rotation to preserve soil nutrients, efficient irrigation, effective use of fertilizers, pest and disease control, and the use of high-yield crop varieties. On the other hand, poor or worse farming techniques might involve inefficient use of water, overuse or underuse of fertilizers, lack of crop rotation leading to soil depletion, or ineffective pest and disease control. These practices could lead to lower crop yield, thus, less food will be produced. Moreover, the quality of the food produced might also decline, as worse farming techniques could lead to less healthy, lower-nutrient crops. This can be due to depleted soil nutrients or unhealthy growth conditions. Lastly, poor farming techniques may also negatively affect the distribution of food. This distribution can be impacted not only by the quantity of food produced, but also by how well the food can be stored and transported. If the produced crops are of poor quality, they may not store or transport as well, leading to greater losses and less efficient distribution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The family business, known as Friedrich Krupp AG, was the largest company in Europe at the beginning of the 20th century. It was important to weapons development and production in both world wars. One of the most powerful dynasties in European history, for 400 years Krupp flourished as the premier weapons manufacturer for Germany. From the Thirty Years' War until the end of the Second World War, they produced everything from battleships, U-boats, tanks, howitzers, guns, utilities, and hundreds of other commodities. - A railway gun, also called a railroad gun, is a large artillery piece, often surplus naval artillery, mounted on, transported by, and fired from a specially designed railway wagon. Many countries have built railway guns, but the best known are the large Krupp-built pieces used by Germany in World War I and World War II. Smaller guns were often part of an armoured train. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare.

Crusaders replied through Michael Carvill, Paul Heatley and an Aaron Smyth own goal but sub Ben Roy's 87th minute finish sealed the surprise win. Josh Robinson of Crusaders and Carrick boss Gary Haveron got late red cards. Crusaders remain five points ahead of second-placed Linfield.

In this case, the hypothesis is a simplified reformulation of the original premise. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve the same core idea — that Osag is expressing the fact that a regulation is not being followed. Analyzing the two statements, the premise \\"Obviously we have a regulation which is not being followed,' Osag said\\", clearly narrates that Osag says a certain regulation isn't being followed. In principle, the subject 'Osag' and his recognizable point that 'the regulation was not being followed' are present. Meanwhile, the hypothesis \\"Osag said the regulation was not being followed\\" also communicates the same message. It also suggests that Osag stated that a regulation is not being followed. Despite the difference in wording, both express the same essential point. The wording of the hypothesis is slightly different and perhaps less explicit about Osag's opinion towards the issue (the word 'obviously') compared to the premise. But, in essence, it paraphrases Osag's indication of a standard not being adhered to. Thus, exploring the context, it can be established that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise provided - if the premise is true (which we are assuming it is), then the hypothesis would also be true. It means that Osag's statement about the regulation not being followed can be inferred from the premise. The premise fully entails the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Glam rock (also known as glitter rock) is a style of rock and pop music that developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1970s performed by musicians who wore outrageous costumes, makeup, and hairstyles, particularly platform shoes and glitter.

The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City. - Universal Motown Republic Group, also abbreviated as UMRG, was an umbrella label founded in 1999 by Universal Music Group to oversee the labels assigned to its unit.

It refers to a condition where individuals experience adverse reactions— ranging from mild to severe— upon exposure to fragrances or other strong odors. These reactions can range from headaches and dizziness to respiratory issues and even full-blown asthma attacks. But addressing scent sensitivity in your environment isn't simply about making special accommodations for one person; it's about fostering a respectful, more inclusive, and healthier space for everyone. This article will discuss ways to educate people on scent sensitivity and provide tips on how to create an accommodating environment. Scent Sensitivity Awareness Raising awareness about scent sensitivity is the first crucial step in addressing the situation and ensuring a comfortable environment for all. This begins with providing a clear explanation of the condition and emphasizing its impact on affected individuals. It's essential to clarify the seriousness of the symptoms and ensure everyone grasps their role in minimizing triggers for scent-sensitive individuals. One effective way to raise awareness is by sharing personal experiences. Encourage individuals with scent sensitivity to speak out about their challenges and experiences and share resources like articles, videos, and medical research on the subject. It’s through empathy and understanding that colleagues can grow to appreciate the complexities of living with scent sensitivity. Polite Requests In addition to fostering a broader understanding of scent sensitivity, it's crucial to make specific, polite requests for minimizing potential triggers. Encourage people to reduce or eliminate their use of strongly scented personal care products like perfumes, deodorants, and hair sprays. It's important to assure everyone that these requests are not judgments on their choices or habits, and that their cooperation benefits everyone in the long run. It may seem uncomfortable to approach coworkers about their choice of personal care products, but there are ways to frame the conversation professionally and constructively. Consider starting with a compliment, expressing your respect for their space and needs before making your request. Keep the focus on your personal condition, avoiding accusatory language or derogatory comments. Altering Work Environments In cases where scent sensitivity still persists after addressing personal care products, discuss with your boss the possibility of making changes to the work environment. This can include: 1. Improved ventilation: Ensuring proper airflow can considerably diminish the concentration of scents and potential irritants, making it easier to breathe for everyone. 2. Designating scent-free areas: Establish zones within the workplace where people are asked to refrain from wearing fragrances, providing a safer space for sensitive individuals. 3. Encouraging clean and tidy workspaces: A well-organized and clean workspace reduces allergens and potential triggers. 4. Implementing scent-free policies: Talk to your boss about establishing official guidelines for reducing scents at work. This can include specific policies restricting the use of certain products or recommending scent-free alternatives. Flexible Work Schedules Another option for accommodating scent-sensitive individuals is offering flexible work hours or telecommuting opportunities, if possible. These adjustments can help workers in avoiding peak times when colleagues might be more likely to apply fragrances, or allow them to work from home, minimizing the chances of adverse reactions. Conclusion Scent sensitivity is an issue deserving our collective attention and understanding. By fostering a culture of awareness throughout the workplace, politely requesting changes in personal habits, adapting work environments, and offering flexible work schedules, we can create spaces that respect the needs and well-being of each and every employee. In doing so, we make significant strides towards a more inclusive and comfortable working experience for all."},{"prompt":"Q: If I tell you that Poisonous substances can cause harm to living things, and ask you the question \\"poisonous substances can cause what to come to living things\\", is the correct answer \\"health\\"?

The given answer, \\"How big is the Earth?\\" is not related to the questions that fossils cause humans to ask about. Rather, fossils lead humans to inquire about the history of life on Earth, the types of creatures that once inhabited our planet, the environment in which they lived, and how these organisms have evolved over time. Additionally, the discovery of fossils has often served as a catalyst for human curiosity, sparking scientific advances in the understanding of Earth's past, as well as inspiring myths and legends in various cultures. Fossils raise a multitude of questions for humans to explore, such as: 1. What types of organisms did these fossils originate from? 2. How did these organisms live, interact, and evolve within their environment? 3. What can these fossils reveal about Earth's past climate and environmental conditions? 4. How do different fossils relate to one another in the context of the larger geologic time scale and the evolution of life on Earth? 5. What can the study of fossils contribute to our understanding of modern ecosystems and the potential future of biodiversity on our planet? 6. How can fossils inform us about the process of evolution and the mechanisms that drive species differentiation and extinction? By analyzing and interpreting fossils, scientists can reconstruct Earth's history, gain insights into extinct species, and better comprehend the complex web of life that has shaped our planet over millions of years. As such, fossils provide a critical foundation for our understanding of the natural world and our place within it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - bouquet of flowers - trash can - pizza - sky - united states Answer:","completion":"A bee would most likely appreciate a bouquet of flowers as a gift. Bees are well-known for their essential role as pollinators in the ecosystem. Their primary food source comes from flowers, specifically the nectar and pollen they contain. By offering a bouquet of flowers as a gift, you are providing the bee with a food source rich in nutrients and energy, which is highly beneficial for their overall well-being. Flowers serve a dual purpose for bees: they provide sustenance in the form of nectar and pollen while also providing an opportunity for them to engage in the necessary process of pollination. When bees visit multiple flowers in search of food, they inadvertently transfer pollen from one flower to another, effectively facilitating the process of pollination. This process allows plants to produce seeds and reproduce, ensuring the survival of various plant species and consequently maintaining the diversity and stability of ecosystems. A bouquet of flowers would be the most suitable option when compared to the other choices. Trash cans, pizzas, the sky, and the United States are all largely irrelevant to a bee's biological needs, preferences, and natural behavior. 1. Trash can: Bees do not interact with trash cans and do not derive any nutritional or other benefits from these objects. 2. Pizza: Bees do not consume human food like pizza, as it does not contain the essential nutrients, nectar, or pollen that they need for sustenance. 3. Sky: While the sky is indeed a part of the bee's natural environment, it is far too vast and abstract to be considered a suitable gift for a bee. 4. United States: The United States is a geographical area and political entity, which has no direct relevance to the needs or preferences of individual bees. In conclusion, a bouquet of flowers would be the most appropriate and meaningful gift for a bee, as it caters to their primary needs, preferences, and natural behavior patterns. By offering a bouquet of flowers, you would not only be supporting the bee's dietary requirements but also their essential role as pollinators in the wider ecosystem."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It debuted on September 25, 2016, and concluded on May 14, 2017. In January 2017, it was stated that the sixth season would end the main storyline, and for a seventh season, the series would be softly rebooted with a new storyline. Question: season 6 once upon a time last season?","completion":"Season 6 of Once Upon a Time, an American fantasy-drama series that aired on ABC, was not technically the last season of the show; however, it did mark the end of the main storyline that had been followed since the series began. The sixth season was ordered on March 3, 2016, and premiered on September 25, 2016. It concluded on May 14, 2017, and during January 2017, it was announced that the show would be experiencing a significant change in format. While a seventh season did indeed follow, the series underwent a \\"soft reboot\\" with a fresh plot and some new characters joining the cast, departing from the main narrative that was utilized throughout the first six seasons. This change caused the seventh season of Once Upon a Time to be viewed differently than the previous installments, and in a way, it could be considered the start of a new chapter rather than a direct continuation of what viewers had seen before. The original storyline had revolved around the story of Emma Swan, played by Jennifer Morrison, a woman who discovers her familial connections to Storybrooke, Maine, a town filled with fairy-tale characters who have forgotten their true identities due to a curse. The primary narrative followed Emma, her family, friends, and foes navigating through various adventures as they unraveled their true identities and faced numerous challenges along the way. In season six, major story arcs and characters' arcs were brought to a conclusion, and this season had a sense of finality to it. With the story wrapping up, the seventh season was given the green light to start anew, providing fans with a new set of adventures to immerse themselves in. The soft reboot allowed the show to take a different direction, attracting both old fans and newcomers alike, and giving the series the opportunity to explore new narratives within the realm of fairy tales and classic stories. In summary, while season six of Once Upon a Time was not the official last season, it did signify the end of the main storyline that fans had been engrossed in since the series' inception. The seventh season, with its soft reboot and fresh storyline, can be considered a separate entity that moved away from the earlier narrative arc, making the sixth season a fitting conclusion to the original story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
