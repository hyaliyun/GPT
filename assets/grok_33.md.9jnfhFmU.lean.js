What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation -30*a + 4 = -26*a for a, first, you need to isolate the variable a by using the appropriate algebraic operations. Here are the steps: Step 1: We have the equation -30*a + 4 = -26*a. Step 2: To isolate the variable a, we should gather all the terms containing a on one side. In this case, let's add 30*a to both sides of the equation to move the -30*a term from the left side to the right side: (-30*a + 30*a) + 4 = -26*a + 30*a 0 + 4 = 4*a 4 = 4*a Step 3: Now, a is multiplied by 4, so to find the value of the variable a, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 4: 4 / 4 = 4*a / 4 1 = a Step 4: We have now found that a equals 1. So the solution to the equation -30*a + 4 = -26*a is a = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

If seeds stick to the fur of an animal then that seed will be transported by the animal, and most plants grow from seeds. Given these facts, what can help plants grow among the following options: - Solar energy - honeybees - Light - Animal fur - evaporation - energy - Enzymes - Energy. Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, the factors that can help plants grow are: 1. Solar energy: Solar energy is essential for plants to perform photosynthesis, the process by which they create food and energy. 2. Light: Light is a crucial component of photosynthesis, and plants require it to grow and survive. It provides the energy plants need to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. 3. Animal fur: Seeds sticking to animal fur can help in the dispersal of seeds, increasing the chances of germination and growth of new plants. This indirectly plays a role in plant growth by aiding in seed propagation. 4. Enzymes: Enzymes are crucial for many biochemical processes that occur within plants, such as breaking down nutrients and facilitating chemical reactions that are necessary for plant growth. 5. Energy: Energy is required for many processes in plants, like photosynthesis, respiration, and growth. Although it is not directly provided in the options, energy comes from sources like solar energy and nutrients obtained from the soil. Other options like honeybees, evaporation, and the repetition of the word \\"energy\\" are not factors directly involved in helping plants grow.

The title of what poetic drama by Robert Browning was used to name a Kentucky town?","completion":"The title of the poetic drama by Robert Browning that was used to name a Kentucky town is \\"Pippa Passes.\\" \\"Pippa Passes\\" is a verse drama written by the English poet and playwright Robert Browning, first published in 1841 as part of the collection, \\"Bells and Pomegranates.\\" The play is set in the silk-manufacturing region of Northern Italy, in the small town of Asolo. It revolves around the life of a young innocent girl, Pippa, who works in a silk mill. The drama unfolds over the course of a single day, New Year's Day, when Pippa has her only day off throughout the year. Divided into four parts, it tells four interconnected stories as Pippa wanders through the town, unknowingly influencing the lives of its inhabitants by singing songs as she passes by. Her presence serves as a moral compass, guiding the characters to reexamine their lives and make better decisions. The influence of Robert Browning's \\"Pippa Passes\\" on the naming of a Kentucky town is an interesting example of the deep-seated impact that literature can have on culture and placemaking. In 1888, the president of the American Sunday School Union, Reverend John N. Norton, initiated the establishment of a new college for civics and ethical education in Eastern Kentucky. Reverend Norton was an admirer and avid reader of Browning's works and felt that \\"Pippa Passes\\" encapsulated the spirit of enlightenment, growth, and positive change that he envisioned for the college and its surrounding community. In 1889, the railroad terminus containing the new college was officially founded as a settlement and dubbed \\"Pippa Passes\\" in honor of Browning's poetic drama. Later, Alice Lloyd College, named after its founder, was established in the town, fulfilling Reverend Norton's vision for an institution dedicated to education. Today, Pippa Passes is a small town in the Appalachian Mountains in Eastern Kentucky, located in Knott County. It is home to Alice Lloyd College, which remains a prominent institution in the region, providing higher education opportunities for local students with limited resources. Thus, the poetic drama \\"Pippa Passes\\" by Robert Browning not only made an impact as a literary work, but its title also became an enduring symbol for growth, education, and positive change through its influence on the naming of a Kentucky town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The given phrase, \\"Gross domestic product in 2011 US dollars per capita, adjusted for inflation and purchasing power parity (log scale) from 1860 to 2011, with population (disk area) for the US (yellow), UK (orange), Japan (red), China (red), and India (blue)\\", is not a reasonable answer to the question about primary components of globalization that affect the practice of medicine in the U.S. Instead, it primarily focuses on the economic growth and population size of different countries. To address the question, let's identify and discuss the primary components of globalization that affect how the practice of medicine takes place in the United States. 1. Flow of information: Globalization has led to a rapid exchange of information and knowledge across borders, which has significantly impacted the medical field. Easy access to research, best practices, and innovative technologies from other countries has led to improvements in healthcare delivery and quality in the U.S. Advancements in telemedicine and remote diagnosis further allow American healthcare providers to treat patients in other countries. 2. Medical tourism: Globalization has made it easier for people to travel across borders for medical treatments. Higher income individuals from countries with inadequate healthcare systems may travel to the U.S. for advanced treatments, while cost-conscious Americans may seek affordable care in countries like India or Mexico. This trend has resulted in a need for greater cross-cultural understanding and collaboration among healthcare providers. 3. Education and workforce migration: The global movement of medical professionals has influenced the practice of medicine in the U.S. International medical graduates are increasingly selected to join the U.S. healthcare workforce, enhancing the diversity of skills and perspectives in the sector. Additionally, cross-border exchanges and collaborations in medical education, such as joint degrees and research programs, contribute to the ongoing improvement of healthcare practices. 4. Pharmaceutics and medical technology: With globalization comes the international trade of pharmaceuticals and medical devices. The U.S. collaborates with other countries to develop and share the distribution of advanced medical technologies and drugs, greatly impacting patient outcomes. However, it also raises concerns about intellectual property rights, product safety, and the control of counterfeit drugs. 5. Global health governance and regulations: The U.S. is actively involved in international health organizations and treaties, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), to develop and promote global health policies. These international efforts shape the domestic practices of healthcare, including infection control, emergency preparedness, and the prevention and treatment of global diseases. 6. Changing demographics and disease patterns: Globalization has contributed to the increased movement of people across borders, leading to a diverse population with unique healthcare needs. The transmission of infectious diseases and the emergence of new health challenges add complexity to healthcare provision in the United States. In conclusion, the primary components of globalization that affect the practice of medicine in the U.S. include the flow of information, medical tourism, education and workforce migration, pharmaceutics and medical technology, global health governance and regulations, and changing demographics and disease patterns. Understanding and adapting to these components can help improve the healthcare system and promote better health outcomes for patients worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within.

The Lenape (English: or ), also called the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape and Delaware people, are an indigenous people of the Northeastern Woodlands, who live in Canada and the United States. Their historical territory included present-day New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania along the Delaware River watershed, New York City, western Long Island, and the Lower Hudson Valley. Today, Lenape people belong to the Delaware Nation and Delaware Tribe of Indians in Oklahoma, the Stockbridge-Munsee Community in Wisconsin, and the Munsee-Delaware Nation, Moravian of the Thames First Nation, and Delaware of Six Nations in Ontario. The Lenape have a matrilineal clan system and historically were matrilocal. At the time of sustained European contact in the 16th centuries and 17th centuries, the Lenape were a powerful Native American nation who inhabited a region on the mid-Atlantic coast spanning the latitudes of southern Massachusetts to the southern extent of Delaware in what anthropologists call the Northeastern Woodlands. Although never politically unified, the confederation of the Delaware roughly encompassed the area around and between the Delaware and lower Hudson rivers, and included the western part of Long Island in present-day New York. Some of their place names, such as Manhattan (\\"the island of many hills\\"), Raritan, and Tappan were adopted by Dutch and English colonists to identify the Lenape people that lived there. Based on the historical record of the mid-17th century, it has been estimated that most Lenape polities consisted of several hundred people but it is conceivable that some had been considerably larger prior to close contact, given the wars between the Susquehannocks and the Iroquois, both of whom were armed by the Dutch fur traders, while the Lenape were at odds with the Dutch and so lost that particular arms race. During the Beaver Wars in the first half of the 17th century, European colonists were careful to keep firearms from the coastally located Delaware, while rival Iroquoian peoples such as the Susquehannocks and Confederation of the Iroquois became comparatively well armed. Subsequently, the Lenape became subjugated and made tributary to first the Susquehannocks, then the Iroquois, even needing their rivals' (superiors') agreement to initiate treaties such as land sales. Like most tribes, Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases originating in Europe, mainly smallpox but also cholera, influenza and dysentery, and recurrent violent racial conflict with Europeans. Iroquoian peoples occasionally fought the Lenape. As the 18th century progressed, many surviving Lenape moved west--into the (relatively empty) upper Ohio River basin. Smallpox devastated Native American communities even located far from European settlements by the 1640s. The Lenape and Susquehannocks fought a war in the middle of the 17th century that left the Delaware a tributary state even as the Susquehannocks had defeated the Province of Maryland between 1642-50s.","completion":"This text is about the Lenape people, also known as the Leni Lenape, Lenni Lenape, and Delaware people.

For the two people in the world that care about Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds, we have good news for you! Blake Lively is pregnant, and she and hubby Ryan Reynolds are expecting their first child together. And shocker [not], the announcement of Blake’s pregnancy came via her new website Preserve, conveniently attached with a picture of her holding her baby bump. Oh Blake, could you be any more transparent? Let’s see, Blake Lively gets her website up and running, all in favor of expanding her ‘lifestyle’ brand. Preserve gets this big opening, with all the media interviews and magazine covers. Blake promotes the hell out of the enterprise, all the while claiming that she’s still interested in acting but this is just a ‘side’ passion. And then, when she realizes that no one gives two shits about Preserve, she decides to announce her pregnancy and showcase her baby bump on the website. It’s like she’s finally realized that she can’t act, and that capitalizing on her motherhood is the only way she’ll stay relevant in the industry. And trust, it’s not the first time that actresses have used this strategy. Jessica Alba is a prime example of having done exactly that, using her children to get her Honest Company off the ground and somehow turned it into a success. Just like Blake, Jessica realized that her future in acing was limited, but she knows there are people out there that will follow celebrity mothers no matter what. Blake without a child, running Preserve? Meh. Blake using Preserve to upload pictures of her child, her baby bump, and her *wonderful* process of motherhood? Well, then people are clicking on her website and Preserve becomes a proper brand name. The whole thing reeks of Business Branding 101, and you know what’s worse? No matter how transparent it is, it’ll probably be successful. Image Credit: Preserve – Blake Lively Baby Bump ||||| Since tying the knot, both Blake and Ryan have vocalized their desire to raise kids. \\"I've always wanted a big family,\\" the actress, 27, told Allure in October 2012. \\"Oh, I'd love 30 [children] if I could.\\" In August 2013, her husband made similar comments in Details. \\"We'd love to have a big family. We both come from big families—my parents did four, Blake's did five. A lot of people say it's crazy, but we'll only know when we're there, you know?\\" Ryan, 37, said. \\"We'll walk through that fire pretty happily, I think.\\" In the August 2014 issue of Vogue, Blake gushed about the twice-wed R.I.P.D. actor, telling the magazine, \\"He's going to be a great father and leader and patriarch—he's so meant to be all of those things. The fact that he lived so much before we got together, he's the exact realized person that he should be. And so I get to share my life with the person he's become, and we get to grow from there.\\" Most recently, Blake told Marie Claire that she needed to \\"get started\\" having babies right away. \\"If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would,\\" she said. ||||| Think back to when you had a life before kids. I know it's challenging. There is something about having kids that wipes out part of your memory. But if you can recall dreaming about being a parent before you actually were one, try to remember how many kids you wanted to have. Blake Lively reportedly once said she would have 30 kids with her husband of two years Ryan Reynolds. \\"If I could spit out a litter of kids, I would,\\" she told Marie Claire magazine. Right now I'm picturing Blake and Ryan as the new Brad and Angie. Though we must remember that there is the fantasy of having kids and the reality of having kids once we have them. I'm wondering if Blake is going to feel differently once she has one. The 26-year-old actress seems to have a great love with Ryan -- she calls him her \\"best, best friend.\\" The couple have never gone a week without seeing each other, and in Hollyweird-land, that is something to be proud of. It's clear they have a great bond, so why wouldn't they want to bring a ton of kids into their world? Because bringing a ton of kids into your world is HARD! I've caught myself saying that I want to have a ton of kids. The thought of making a dozen babies with my boyfriend right now is very appealing to me. I adore my partner -- I want to make a million little love babies with him. But the reality is that sometimes you have one baby and you just fall in this beautiful parent love with that child and that is all you need. Or maybe you have another (or twins like I did) and you think this is it! The jackpot! I have all the kids I need. And then maybe you think you want one more and then just one more and your bank account slaps you in the face and tells you otherwise. More from The Stir: How Many Kids Should You Have? Take This Quiz! Kids are great. Amazing little creatures. They are love and joy and happiness and chocolate chip cookie dough brownies all rolled up into one. I love kids. But having a litter of them? No way. Once you have a kid, the reality of having a kid starts. But before you ever had one, there is this fantasy about being a parent. Maybe you think you look like Angelina Jolie all the time with all those kids in tow. You are the perfect mother -- a symbol of beauty and all that is good, and you are well rested because you've somehow beat the system. But being a parent means that there are sleepless nights. There isn't enough coffee to help you during the day. There are the terrible twos, or terrible threes, or terrible fours, which only eventually gives in to the terrible teens. There are bullies or bullying and peer pressure and ... just take a minute to remember your own teenage years and what you put your parents through. Supposedly that stuff comes back to you tenfold. In which case, I'm screwed. If I had tenfold with a litter of kids ... um ... no thanks. Can't do it. Of course, if you can and want to have a ton of kids, then go for it. Please make sure they are fantastic little citizens of this world so they grow up to make this great Earth greater. I'm looking forward to the babies that Blake and Ryan have. I'm also wondering if she's going to change her mind about having a litter or 30 kids after she has one. We all have that number of kids we think is the perfect number before we had a kid, and we all know that number sometimes changes drastically. How many kids did you think you wanted to have before you had one? Is the number the same now?

In what is declared to be a world first, the Tullibardine distillery in Perthshire has linked up with a spin-out company from Napier University in Edinburgh. They plan to use bacteria to feed on the \\"leftovers\\" from the whisky making process. This will produce butanol which can be used to fuel vehicles. More than 90% of the stuff that comes out of a whisky distillery is not whisky. It is leftovers like draff and pot ales -- both produced in the early stages of the process. They are high in sugar and are currently used for things like fertiliser and cattle feed. Napier University's Biofuel Research Centre (BfRC) has already shown that the right bacteria can feed on those by-products to produce butanol--a direct replacement for vehicle fuel. Now the spin-out company, Celtic Renewables, and independent whisky producer Tullibardine have signed an agreement. Together they will apply the process to thousands of tons of the distillery's leftovers. Professor Martin Tangney, founder of Celtic Renewables, said \\"Our partnership with Tullibardine is an important step in the development of a business which combines two important Scottish industries -- whisky and renewables. This project shows that creative use of existing technologies can _ resources on our doorstep to benefit both the environment and the economy.\\" Douglas Ross, managing director of Tullibardine, which spends PS250,000 disposing of its by-products every year, said \\"We are delighted to be partnering Celtic Renewables in this creative business, the obvious benefits of which are environmental. It takes a cost to us and turns it into something that has social as well as commercial value.\\" The project is being supported by a grant from the Scottish government's Zero Waste Scotland initiative. Celtic Renewables said it eventually aimed to build a processing plant in Scotland, with the hope of building an industry that could be worth PS60m a year.

Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter.

Sentence 2: ESOP are not attractive anymore. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence \\"ESOPs are not attractive anymore\\" is entailed or implied by the first sentence. The first sentence talks about how \\"the bloom has gone from the ESOP rose,\\" which essentially means that the attractiveness or popularity of ESOPs (Employee Stock Ownership Plans) has diminished. This is further supported by the mention that Avis, a company that previously had an ESOP, was sold to HFS, indicating that Avis' ESOP was no longer a sustainable or advantageous business arrangement in that context. The fact that HFS also owns other well-known franchises and brands like Howard Johnson, Days Inn, and Century 21 helps to emphasize the point that ESOPs have lost their appeal in comparison to other business models, as these brands are also not using the ESOP model despite being under the same umbrella as Avis. The second sentence \\"ESOPs are not attractive anymore\\" is a more concise way of expressing the main idea behind the first sentence. It emphasizes that Employee Stock Ownership Plans are no longer seen as a desirable option for businesses, which is clearly implied in the first sentence's description of the situation involving Avis and HFS. In summary, the second sentence is indeed entailed by the first sentence as both sentences convey the notion that ESOPs have lost their appeal and are no longer considered attractive options for businesses.

Process: - Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes - Air enters bronchioles - Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli - Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels - Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels - Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body - Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale. Question: suppose there will be more water in the clounds happens, how will it affect more oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"To answer this question, let's evaluate each step in the process and analyze how an increase in water content in clouds might affect oxygen absorption by small blood vessels. 1. Air enters the lungs through bronchial tubes: The increase in water content in clouds will not affect the air entering the lungs, as this process is not directly related to cloud water content. 2. Air enters bronchioles: Again, the water content of clouds does not affect the air entering the bronchioles. 3. Bronchioles have tiny air sacs called alveoli: There's no direct connection between alveoli and the water content of clouds. 4. Alveoli surrounded by small blood vessels: This step is not influenced by the water content in clouds. 5. Oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels: An increase in water content in clouds would lead to more precipitation, but this would not directly increase or decrease the amount of oxygen in the air. Therefore, the amount of oxygen available for absorption by small blood vessels should not be significantly affected. 6. Vessels deliver oxygen to every cell in the body: The transportation of oxygen to cells in the body would not be influenced by the water content of clouds. 7. Blood brings carbon dioxide back to lungs: This step is also not related to the water content in clouds. 8. Carbon dioxide released when you exhale: Exhaling carbon dioxide is an essential part of respiration and is not affected by the water content in clouds. Based on this analysis, it appears that an increase in water content in clouds would have no direct effect on the amount of oxygen absorbed by small blood vessels. Therefore, the answer is C: no effect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Underpinning Houston's land surface are unconsolidated clays, clay shales, and poorly cemented sands up to several miles deep. The region's geology developed from river deposits formed from the erosion of the Rocky Mountains. These sediments consist of a series of sands and clays deposited on decaying organic marine matter, that over time, transformed into oil and natural gas. Beneath the layers of sediment is a water-deposited layer of halite, a rock salt. The porous layers were compressed over time and forced upward. As it pushed upward, the salt dragged surrounding sediments into salt dome formations, often trapping oil and gas that seeped from the surrounding porous sands.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What Republics did the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public, except on special occasions? ? The 1896 French colonisation of Madagascar brought an end to the rule of the Merina sovereigns. The Rova of Antananarivo was converted into a museum the following year, and the Fitomiandalana tombs were excavated and moved to a new location behind the tombs of Radama I and Rasoherina. The bodies of sovereigns previously interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga were exhumed and transferred to the tombs in the Rova grounds, a sacrilegious move that degraded the status of Ambohimanga as a site of sacred pilgrimage. According to Frémigacci (1999), French colonial administrator General Joseph Gallieni undertook this desacralisation of the Rova in an attempt to break popular belief in the power of the royal ancestors. By the same token, his actions relegated Malagasy sovereignty under the Merina rulers to a relic of an unenlightened past. The desecration of the two most sacred sites of Merina royalty represented a calculated political move intended to establish the political and cultural superiority of the colonial power.Following independence the Rova compound remained largely closed to the public throughout the First (1960–1972) and Second (1975–1992) Republics except on special occasions. In 1995, three years into the Third Republic (1992–2010), the Rova compound was destroyed by fire. The tombs, chapel, exterior of Manjakamiadina and two traditional wooden houses (Besakana and Mahitsy) have since been restored with further restorations planned to continue until at least 2013.

Given the following context: In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose monument says they died at 51?

They are caused by unequal heating of Earth’s surface. The Coriolis effect causes global winds to blow on a diagonal over the surface. Unequal heating also causes jet streams high in the troposphere. Q: What effect causes global winds to blow on a diagonal over the earth's surface? A: Options: (A). dopler effect (B). resonant effect (C). centrifugal effect (D). coriolis effect The answer is:","completion":"(D). Coriolis effect The Coriolis effect is the primary cause of global winds blowing on a diagonal over the Earth's surface. This phenomenon occurs due to the rotation of the Earth and its impact on the movement of fluids (like air) over the planet's surface. As the Earth spins on its axis, the speed of rotation varies at different latitudes, with the equator having the highest rotational speed and the poles having the lowest. This variation causes the paths of air masses to deflect, resulting in diagonal wind patterns rather than a direct movement from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. The uneven heating of the Earth's surface also plays a crucial role in generating global winds. When the sun's energy heats the Earth, the air near the surface becomes warmer and rises, creating areas of low pressure. Similarly, cooler air starts to descend, resulting in high-pressure areas. The air then flows horizontally from areas of high pressure to areas of low pressure, forming wind. The interaction between these horizontal pressure gradients and the vertical temperature gradients leads to the formation of global wind belts. Moreover, the Coriolis effect also influences the formation of jet streams high in the troposphere. These fast-moving, narrow air currents are found at altitudes of around six to ten miles above the Earth's surface and play a significant role in shaping weather patterns around the world. Jet streams are primarily created from the temperature differences between polar and tropical air masses, with the Coriolis effect further amplifying their movement. Overall, the Coriolis effect works in conjunction with other factors like uneven heating and pressure variations to shape the global winds and weather we experience on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What is the date of the worst oil spill in history?\\" is \\"20th April 2010\\"?","completion":"Yes, according to the information provided in the paragraph, the worst oil spill in history, the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, occurred on the 20th of April 2010."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

TOKYO - A strong quake with a preliminary magnitude of 5.7 jolted Japan #39;s northernmost main island of Hokkaido Thursday night, the Japan Meteorological Agency said.","completion":"This news report is about a powerful earthquake that struck the northernmost main island of Hokkaido in Japan on a Thursday night. The Japan Meteorological Agency has provided a preliminary magnitude estimate of 5.7 for this earthquake. To provide you with a more detailed and comprehensive analysis of the situation, let's break down the key information points from this news report: 1. Location: The earthquake occurred in Hokkaido, which is the northernmost main island of Japan. Hokkaido is not only Japan's largest prefecture but also one of the most seismically active regions in the world. It lies on the Pacific \\"Ring of Fire\\" where tectonic plates collide, resulting in frequent volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. 2. Magnitude: According to the Japan Meteorological Agency, the preliminary magnitude of this earthquake is 5.7. Earthquakes of this magnitude are considered moderate to strong and can cause considerable damage in areas close to the epicenter, especially if they occur in densely populated regions or if the buildings and infrastructure are not constructed to withstand such seismic events. In Japan, strict building codes and earthquake-resistant design features are implemented, which can help mitigate the impact of earthquakes of this magnitude. 3. Timing: This earthquake took place on a Thursday night, which could have implications for the response and recovery efforts. As nighttime earthquakes can catch people off guard while they are asleep, it may take a longer time for emergency responders to assess the situation, rescue survivors from damaged buildings, and restore essential services in the affected areas. 4. Japan Meteorological Agency: This organization plays a crucial role in monitoring and providing accurate information about earthquakes in Japan. They issue bulletins, provide real-time data, and work closely with other agencies to ensure that the public is well-informed and able to make appropriate decisions to stay safe during seismic events. 5. Potential impacts: Although this news report does not provide specific information on the damages or casualties caused by this 5.7 magnitude earthquake, it is essential to consider the potential consequences of such an event. Aside from damage to buildings and infrastructure, earthquakes of this magnitude can disrupt communication systems, impact transportation networks, and cause power outages. Additionally, the psychological impact of earthquakes should not be underestimated as they can cause fear, stress, and anxiety among affected populations, while also straining the resources of relief and rescue services. In conclusion, this news report is about a 5.7 magnitude earthquake that struck Hokkaido, the northernmost main island of Japan. The Japan Meteorological Agency provided crucial information about the earthquake, and the response and recovery efforts would likely be underway to mitigate its impacts. Earthquakes of this magnitude can have considerable effects on communities, infrastructure, and the built environment in affected areas, but Japan's strict building codes and earthquake-resistant designs can help to minimize these impacts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Queen Victoria In 1870, republican sentiment in Britain, fed by the Queen's seclusion, was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic. A republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria's removal, and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871, she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm, which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871, at the height of the republican movement, the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever, the disease that was believed to have killed his father, and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband's death approached, her son's condition grew no better, and Victoria's distress continued. To general rejoicing, he pulled through. Mother and son attended a public parade through London and a grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul's Cathedral on 27 February 1872, and republican feeling subsided. Q: WHat was a new antiseptic being used to treat abcesses in the 1870's?","completion":"In the 1870s, a new antiseptic was being used to treat abscesses: carbolic acid spray.

In the case of Queen Victoria, her abscess in the arm was successfully lanced and treated with the carbolic acid spray, highlighting the effectiveness of this innovative antiseptic during that time period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tokugawa Takes All: When Hideyoshi died in 1598, he hoped to have his five-year-old son continue his \\"dynasty,\\" initially under the tutelage of five regents. But one of the regents was Ieyasu Tokugawa, who had been biding his time at Edo for 12 years, nurturing dynastic ambitions of his own. Of the cunning, ruthless triumvirate that came out on top at the end of the country's century of civil war, Tokugawa was without doubt the most patient, the most prudent — and most treacherous. He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.

Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Paragraph: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure.

What Shakespeare tragedy features the House of Capulet and the House of Montague, sworn enemies all?","completion":"The Shakespearean tragedy that features the House of Capulet and the House of Montague, both sworn enemies, is \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" The play, written by William Shakespeare in the late 16th century, between 1591 and 1595, has become one of his most well-known and celebrated works. The plot revolves around the star-crossed lovers, Romeo Montague and Juliet Capulet, who come from two powerful and feuding families in the city of Verona, Italy. The animosity between the House of Capulet and the House of Montague has a long history, with a deep-rooted enmity that extends beyond the memory of the characters within the play. The violent feud between these families creates an atmosphere of chaos and social disorder within the Veronese society, which serves to fuel the tragic outcomes of the story. Despite this bitter feud, Romeo and Juliet fall deeply in love at first sight and try to overcome the obstacles posed by their warring families. The tragic story of Romeo and Juliet begins at a masquerade ball held by the Capulets, where Romeo, a Montague, sneaks in and catches sight of Juliet, a Capulet. Despite being aware of the potential danger of their forbidden love, the two characters are drawn to each other and decide to secretly marry with the help of the kind-hearted Friar Laurence. However, their secret union does not shield them from the harsh reality of the world outside their love. The play's plot is marked by a series of unfortunate events and misunderstandings. The confrontational nature of the enmity between the two families takes the lives of beloved friends and family members, including Romeo's close friend Mercutio and Juliet's cousin Tybalt. In a tragic turn of events, Romeo is banished from Verona after killing Tybalt in retaliation for Mercutio's death. In an attempt to reunite the two lovers and put an end to the family feud, Friar Laurence devises a plan for Juliet to feign her own death using a sleeping potion. However, a series of miscommunications and mishaps prevent Romeo from receiving word of Juliet's plan, leading him to believe that she is genuinely dead. Overcome with grief, Romeo takes his own life, and when Juliet awakens to find Romeo dead, she too decides to end her life. The deaths of Romeo and Juliet ultimately compel the Capulet and Montague families to reconcile their differences and end their bitter feud. The tragedy highlights the devastating consequences of hatred and the power of love to transcend even the most rigid societal barriers. Through the dramatic portrayal of the protagonists' doomed love, Shakespeare provides a timeless reflection on the human experience, exploring themes of love, passion, fate, violence, and the heartbreaking cost of an ongoing conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Morteza Safari is a high-ranking naval officer whose title in English is \\"Rear Admiral.\\" This suggests that he holds a significant position within the naval hierarchy and is responsible for overseeing and commanding a proportion of a navy's fleet or operations. In terms of ranking, a Rear Admiral is typically below Vice Admiral and above Commodore, possessing extensive experience and expertise in naval warfare, tactics, and operations. It is important to note that the title 'kontraadmirál' is the Czech or Slovak equivalent of Rear Admiral, indicating that this term may have originated from a source in either the Czech Republic or Slovakia. However, since Morteza Safari is a more common name within Iranian culture, it is plausible that this officer may belong to the Iranian Navy or has served in the armed forces of another Persian-speaking country. Rear Admirals often play an essential role in the coordination and management of naval operations. They may be responsible for managing specific areas or divisions, such as logistics, weapons systems, or submarine fleets. Furthermore, they can hold key positions within the chain of command, serving as the primary point of contact between higher-ranking officers and those under their jurisdiction. Ultimately, Morteza Safari's title of Rear Admiral signifies a distinguished military career and a high level of responsibility within the naval forces to which he belongs. His expertise, strategic mindset, and leadership abilities undoubtedly contribute significantly to the success of naval operations and the defense of the nation he serves."},{"prompt":"This article: Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings. Question: \\"Why do some critics call California the nanny state?\\" Response: \\"They have more nannies per capita\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The critics call California a 'nanny state' due to its numerous health and safety laws, not because it has more nannies per capita. These critics believe that the state has an excessive number of regulations that dictate how people should live their lives.

What is the name of the album on which Glyn Johns was given \\"free rein,\\" as the band had \\"all but washed their hands of the entire project\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Although Let It Be was the Beatles' final album release, it was largely recorded before Abbey Road. The project's impetus came from an idea Martin attributes to McCartney, who suggested they \\"record an album of new material and rehearse it, then perform it before a live audience for the very first time – on record and on film\\". Originally intended for a one-hour television programme to be called Beatles at Work, in the event much of the album's content came from studio work beginning in January 1969, many hours of which were captured on film by director Michael Lindsay-Hogg. Martin has said that the project was \\"not at all a happy recording experience. It was a time when relations between the Beatles were at their lowest ebb.\\" Lennon described the largely impromptu sessions as \\"hell ... the most miserable ... on Earth\\", and Harrison, \\"the low of all-time\\". Irritated by both McCartney and Lennon, Harrison walked out for five days. Upon returning, he threatened to leave the band unless they \\"abandon[ed] all talk of live performance\\" and instead focused on finishing a new album, initially titled Get Back, using songs recorded for the TV special. He also demanded they cease work at Twickenham Film Studios, where the sessions had begun, and relocate to the newly finished Apple Studio. The other band members agreed, and the idea came about to salvage the footage shot for the TV production for use in a feature film. In an effort to alleviate tensions within the band and improve the quality of their live sound, Harrison invited keyboardist Billy Preston to participate in the last nine days of sessions. Preston received label billing on the \\"Get Back\\" single – the only musician ever to receive that acknowledgment on an official Beatles release. At the conclusion of the rehearsals, the band could not agree on a location to film a concert, rejecting several ideas, including a boat at sea, a lunatic asylum, the Tunisian desert, and the Colosseum.

In 1878 a hardened American gunfighter arrives in a small town in the foothills of the Canadian Rockies, a place that doesn't understand or appreciate the brutal code of the American Wild West. Gunslinger Sean Lafferty, known as the Montana Kid, has a bounty on his head for killing eleven people across the western United States. He arrives in town on his horse, riding backwards, bound, with a noose around his neck, and dragging the broken tree branch over which a group had tried to hang him on the American side of the border. After being helped off his horse by a young Chinese girl named Adell, he begins to explore the town, starting with the town general store. After leaving the store, he finds his horse gone and accuses Jack, the blacksmith, of stealing it, even though Jack was simply replacing the horse's damaged shoes. After unsuccessfully trying to intimidate the blacksmith, the Montana Kid decides to call him out. Since the blacksmith has no gun, though, Sean can't shoot him because the Kid lives by a code of ethics that prevents him from killing unarmed men. When she witnesses this, Jane Taylor, one of the townsfolk, says the Kid can have her broken gun (to fix and give to Jack) if he builds her a windmill.

Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend!

Generate a detailed description of this data.","completion":"From the data given, we can get quite a clear idea of what Zizzi is and what kind of service they provide. Zizzi appears to be an establishment categorised as a pub. This classification tells us that Zizzi is fundamentally a social establishment where its main offering is mainly beverages, typically alcoholic -- such as beer, ale, and other spirited drinks. Pubs typically also serve food, often having a specific type of cuisine they specialise in. They are known for their casual, laid-back atmosphere which is great for people looking to unwind, enjoy a drink and have a meal. Which brings us to the more unique aspects of Zizzi as a pub. As per the data provided, Zizzi specialises in Japanese food. Japanese cuisine is one that is highly revered all around the world for its simplicity, freshly sourced ingredients, distinctive flavor profiles, and meticulous presentation. It heavily utilizes seafood, rice, and various types of vegetables in its dishes. This food type includes a wide variety of dishes such as sushi, ramen, tempura, and teriyaki, to name a few. By specializing in this cuisine, Zizzi sets itself apart from traditional pubs which generally serve local or more universally popular Western dishes. In terms of customer ratings, Zizzi appears to hover in the average range. An average rating would suggest that while Zizzi meets customer expectations and provides a satisfactory service, there might be room for improvement. Factors influencing this average rating could be anything from the quality or variety of food and beverage, the ambiance, service, location, or even the price. Lastly, the data indicates that Zizzi is indeed family-friendly. This factor is important to consider as it means that Zizzi caters to customers of all ages. Family-friendly establishments typically provide facilities and services that cater to families with children such as kids' menu, high-chairs, activity sheets, or play areas. This is an important feature that makes the place accessible to a wider range of customers, particularly those with children, thus considerably broadening Zizzi's patronage. In conclusion, Zizzi operates as a unique family-friendly pub that serves Japanese cuisine and has been given an average rating by its customers. The establishment seems to have found a cosy middle-ground between a pub and a restaurant, offering a comfortable venue for every member of the family while also providing unique and potentially exotic Japanese culinary experiences. As is the case with any establishment, there is always room for improvement, and the average customer rating only substantiates this assertion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song \\"The Sensual World\\" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film \\"Felicia's Journey\\".In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua.

Middle 1: She didn't win but she bought more anyway. Middle 2: She won and she bought more. Ending: Hope can be dangerously addictive. We need to decide which middle part makes the story less plausible or coherent. In Middle 1, the woman doesn't win but still buys more lottery scratch-offs, which aligns with the theme of \\"hope can be dangerously addictive.\\" In Middle 2, the woman wins and buys more lottery scratch-offs, showing that she is eager to win more.

Is the premise \\"A few people are on sitting on a train.\\" true if \\"A family waits for the train to depart.\\"?","completion":"Whether the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" can be considered true given the statement \\"A family waits for the train to depart\\" depends on interpreting the context of both sentences and making reasonable assumptions based on that context. If we examine the scenarios, we can infer some connections and speculate to what extent the premise is true or false. Scenario 1: In this situation, the family waiting for the train to depart can be understood as them sitting inside the train, waiting for it to start moving. If we interpret the statement this way, we can assume: - The family consists of a few people. - These few people (the family) are seated in the train. - There might be other passengers on board too. In this case, the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" is true, as the family waiting for the train to depart indicates their presence inside the train itself. Scenario 2: Alternatively, the statement \\"A family waits for the train to depart\\" might suggest that the family is waiting at the station, not yet aboard the train. In this scenario: - The family consists of a few people. - These few people (the family) are outside the train, perhaps at the platform, waiting for the doors to open or to ensure they're boarding the right train. - Since the family is not yet on the train, we cannot confirm that there are passengers inside. In this case, the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" is uncertain or indeterminable. We cannot say for sure whether the train currently has passengers sitting inside or not, as the family mentioned is not yet on board. Considering these two scenarios, we can conclude that it is not possible to definitively state whether the premise \\"A few people are sitting on a train\\" is true or false based solely on the statement \\"A family waits for the train to depart.\\" There is an element of uncertainty in the situation, and further details would be necessary to answer with certainty."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The development of a three-field rotation system for planting crops[AA] increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent increase in production. The development of the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by the spread of the horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What invention allowed horses rather than oxen to be used to plow?","completion":"The invention that allowed horses rather than oxen to be used for plowing was the horse collar. The horse collar is a padded, supportive appliance worn around a horse's neck that distributes the weight of a plow or other draft equipment evenly, allowing the horse to pull heavy loads more efficiently and comfortably. The horse collar was a significant improvement over the traditional yoke used for oxen, which is a wooden beam placed across the animals' necks. Before the development of the horse collar, horses were not as effective at pulling heavy loads like plows compared to oxen. This was largely due to the fact that when a yoke was placed on a horse, it tended to rest on the animal's windpipe, making it difficult for the horse to breathe and seriously limiting its ability to exert force. The horse collar addressed this issue by redistributing the force of the load across a larger surface area around the horse's neck and shoulders, which not only provided more comfort for the horse but also allowed it to generate more power and work for longer periods of time. This increased effectiveness and efficiency ultimately led to the widespread use of horses instead of oxen for plowing and other agricultural tasks. In addition to enabling the use of horses for plowing, the horse collar also had other benefits. Horses, being faster than oxen, were better suited to the three-field rotation system, where the faster plowing of fields was valuable. Horses also required less pasture, which meant that more land could be devoted to growing crops rather than providing grazing land for the draft animals. Overall, the invention of the horse collar played a significant role in the advancements in agriculture during the Middle Ages, as it facilitated the transition from oxen to horses for plowing and other labor-intensive tasks. This, in turn, increased agricultural production and efficiency, as well as made the three-field rotation system more effective, leading to greater food security and prosperity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Trump hits ‘joke candidates’ Paul and Huntsman (CNN) – Donald Trump stoked an ongoing back-and-forth with Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul Monday, dismissing Paul's decision to skip a presidential forum he is set to moderate in December. Trump said the choice by Texas Rep. Paul and rival candidate Jon Huntsman not to attend will result in a better event. \\"I think most candidates are going to join, and I think these two candidates have zero chance of getting elected, so it makes no difference,\\" Trump said Monday on NBC's \\"Today.\\" \\"I think that they are joke candidates and they are doing very poorly.\\" \\"Frankly, it gives more air time to people that really have a chance at getting elected,\\" Trump added. The reality show star, who decided against his own presidential bid in May, is set to host a debate, with the conservative Newsmax magazine Dec. 27 in Iowa, the first-in-the-nation caucus state. Paul and Huntsman are the only candidates thus far to announce they will not attend. The other contenders have yet to formally declare their decisions. Trump's comments comprise the latest jabs between him and Paul, which started during the Conservative Political Action Conference in February. During his speech Trump said Paul, who is making his third bid for the White House, had \\"no chance\\" of winning the GOP presidential nomination. Paul rebutted the remarks at the time and after the debate announcement last week said the Republican Party could be hurt by allowing Trump to moderate the final debate before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses. During an appearance on CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" Sunday, the twelve-term congressman told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley that he doesn't \\"understand the marching to his office.\\" \\"I don't know that he had the ability to lay on hands and anoint people,\\" Paul said. The comments come as former House Speaker Newt Gingrich becomes the fifth potential Republican nominee to visit Trump in New York. Trump said Gingrich's recent rise in national and state-wide polls is due to his blunt and truthful rhetoric. \\"I think one of the reasons he's surging, he's like a rocket ship because of the fact that he says it like it is,\\" Trump said. – CNN Associate Producer Rebecca Stewart contributed to this report.

Question: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: Why was Patch hungry?

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: After the release of the new AHA guidelines, what is going to happen to the author's patients? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"After the release of the new AHA/ACC guidelines, the author does not plan to change their clinical practice or recommendations for their patients.

Virgil: At Maecenas' insistence (according to the tradition) Virgil spent the ensuing years (perhaps 37–29 BC) on the long didactic hexameter poem called the Georgics (from Greek, \\"On Working the Earth\\") which he dedicated to Maecenas. The ostensible theme of the Georgics is instruction in the methods of running a farm. In handling this theme, Virgil follows in the didactic (\\"how to\\") tradition of the Greek poet Hesiod's Works and Days and several works of the later Hellenistic poets. The four books of the Georgics focus respectively on raising crops and trees (1 and 2), livestock and horses (3), and beekeeping and the qualities of bees (4). Well-known passages include the beloved Laus Italiae of Book 2, the prologue description of the temple in Book 3, and the description of the plague at the end of Book 3. Book 4 concludes with a long mythological narrative, in the form of an epyllion which describes vividly the discovery of beekeeping by Aristaeus and the story of Orpheus' journey to the underworld.

The teams first three years of operation (1960 Oakland Raiders season–1962 Oakland Raiders season) were marred by poor on-field performance, financial difficulties, and spotty attendance. In 1963 Oakland Raiders season, however, the Raiders fortunes improved dramatically with the introduction of head coach (and eventual owner) Al Davis. In 1967 Oakland Raiders season, after several years of improvement, the Raiders reached the postseason for the first time. The team would go on to win its first (and only) 1967 American Football League Championship Game that year; in doing so, the Raiders advanced to Super Bowl II, where they were soundly defeated by the Green Bay Packers.

Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... and the situation: PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers.

The girl might smile and laugh a lot around you, kind of like how the flower seems to dance when the wind is blowing gently. 2. She may look at you a lot and make eye contact, just as the flower would seem to follow the sun throughout the day. 3. The girl might want to be around you more often or try to talk to you more, like the flower leaning towards sunlight to grow better. 4. She may get a little shy, just like how a flower would close its petals when it's cold outside. Remember that every girl is different, just like every flower is unique. Some might show different signs or even hide them a little, but if you pay attention and observe, you'll be able to understand if a girl likes you or not."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

By Ted Thornhill PUBLISHED: 08:46 EST, 14 January 2014 | UPDATED: 14:10 EST, 14 January 2014 Prosecutors will seek an indictment against a North Carolina police officer accused of fatally shooting an unarmed man 10 times after he survived a car accident and banged on the door of a nearby house in the middle of the night looking for help. The officer, Randall Kerrick, 27, is charged with voluntary manslaughter in the September shooting of Jonathan Ferrell, a 24-year-old former Florida A&M University football player. Jonathan’s family claim that Ferrell was in a submissive position – either on his knees or lying on the ground – when he was shot, according to NBC News. The autopsy report revealed that the bullets were on a downward trajectory when they struck. Officer Kerrick fired 12 shots at Ferrell, striking","completion":"him 10 times, with the autopsy confirming that the majority of the bullets struck him in the chest, with other shots hitting his extremities. As Ferrell was unarmed at the time of the shooting, the family claims that the use of deadly force was not justified and was clearly excessive. The case gained national attention, sparking discussions around police use of force, racial profiling, and the need for enhanced police training and accountability. The grand jury was convened to decide whether or not to indict Officer Kerrick on the charge of voluntary manslaughter. After examining the evidence, including dashcam footage, witness testimonies, and the results of the autopsy, the jury decided that there was enough evidence to proceed with the case against Officer Kerrick. The ensuing trial saw both the prosecution and defense present their case, with the prosecution arguing that Officer Kerrick acted out of excessive fear and without just cause in shooting Ferrell. They discussed how Ferrell was merely seeking help after surviving a car accident and did not pose a threat to Officer Kerrick or anyone else. The defense, on the other hand, argued that Officer Kerrick was only following his training and acted in self-defense, believing that Ferrell was a threat due to his behavior and the circumstances of the incident. The trial took place in a highly charged atmosphere, with the public closely following every development and the family of Jonathan Ferrell pushing for justice. During this time, the family, as well as advocacy groups, called for reforms to avoid similar tragedies, such as improved police training in dealing with unarmed suspects and better overall accountability for officers involved in fatal shootings. Eventually, a verdict was reached in the case, and the jury found Officer Randall Kerrick not guilty of voluntary manslaughter. The verdict was met with a range of reactions, from relief to outrage, as many felt that the trial had not resulted in justice for Jonathan Ferrell. As a result, the ongoing debates surrounding police use of force and accountability continued to grow in intensity, with many questioning whether the criminal justice system is effectively equipped to handle cases involving law enforcement officers who use excessive force. Following the trial, the City of Charlotte settled a lawsuit with Jonathan Ferrell's family for 2.25 million. Additionally, North Carolina lawmakers and police departments across the nation began to make changes to their policies and training procedures in response to this case and other similar incidents. While the events of that fateful night ultimately ended with the tragic and untimely death of Jonathan Ferrell, his story continues to serve as a rallying point for those seeking to reform the criminal justice system and improve police-community relations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

They make too much noise in shopping malls; they drive carelessly up and down America's main streets. And at least some of the time those things are true. But we shouldn't forget that there are hard moments in the life of a teenager too. I watched such a moment not long ago at a woman's funeral which happened in a church. A teenage grandson stepped forward. Softly he began:\\"I want to share a few values that Nana taught me. She never failed to see light in any situation. When our family dog would attack her, what would Nana say? Oh, what beautiful markings that dog has.\\" That was Nana. \\"She was a strong woman who often lived in the shadow of my grandpa, who was a successful businessman in this city. But she was the one behind the scenes who provided the strength and support for Grandpa's career,\\" he said, with a voice now trembling. \\"That was Nana's way.\\" Finally, in a voice breaking free of sorrow, he looked up and said, \\"Nana taught me courage. She put up a fight to the end, when she died peacefully, which is how she lived her life. That was Nana's way, and I hope I can carry on in the same manner.\\" There are no hearts as sensitive as those of teenagers, because everything is happening to them for the first time.

Question: Where would you put a folding chair if you do not plan to use it and you do not have any large doors in your house? Options: A. roof B. school C. beach D. closet E. garage The answer is:","completion":"D. closet The most reasonable and practical option among the given choices for storing a folding chair when not in use and without large doors in your home is inside a closet. There are several reasons for this choice, which are outlined below. A. Roof - Storing a folding chair on the roof is not a feasible option, as it would necessitate climbing onto the roof and securing the chair to prevent it from falling or being blown away by the wind. Additionally, constant exposure to the elements (sun, rain, snow) could cause the chair to deteriorate over time, rendering it less reliable when you eventually plan to use it. B. School - Presumably, the school is not your property, and storing a personal item there would be inappropriate. Also, even if someone at the school permitted you to store your folding chair on their property, it would not be a convenient choice, as you would have to carry the chair to the school and retrieve it each time you wish to use it. C. Beach - Similar to the roof option, storing a folding chair on the beach would expose it to the elements, such as sun, sand, wind, and sea spray. Furthermore, leaving your chair on public property like a beach could result in it being damaged, stolen, or discarded. D. Closet - Placing a folding chair inside a closet is a common-sense solution because it keeps the chair safe from the elements and out of sight when not in use, while also affording easy access when needed. Closets typically provide enough storage space for a folding chair due to their vertical storage capacity. Additionally, storing the chair in a closet helps maintain an organized living space. E. Garage - While a garage may also be a suitable option, it is not always available as not all homes have a garage. Furthermore, garages often contain vehicles, tools, and other large equipment, which might result in less space for odds and ends such as folding chairs. A cluttered garage can make it difficult to locate and access the chair, whereas keeping it inside a closet ensures it's easier to find and retrieve. Ultimately, the most practical option for storing a folding chair when not in use and without large doors in your home is within a closet. It offers protection from environmental factors, ensures accessibility and orderliness, and maintains an organized living space."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

That statement is related to the Second Vatican Council and the expectations of Pope John XXIII regarding the time frame in which the Council's work should be completed. The context is relevant, but it doesn't provide the specific year you're looking for. Now, for the correct answer: Giovanni Battista Montini, the future Pope Paul VI, was appointed to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1960. The Central Preparatory Commission was responsible for preparing the documents and topics to be discussed during the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965). Pope John XXIII established the commission to ensure a comprehensive and well-organized agenda for the Council, and he chose Montini due to the latter's experience and reputation as a diplomat and a theologian. Montini played a critical role in shaping the work of the Second Vatican Council, especially in its early stages. His appointment to the Central Preparatory Commission alongside other key figures in the Catholic Church at the time illustrates the importance that Pope John XXIII placed on the Council as a significant event in the modern history of the Church. Giovanni Battista Montini's work within the Central Preparatory Commission allowed him to contribute significantly to the drafting, amending, and approval of the documents that would eventually be voted upon and promulgated during the Second Vatican Council sessions. Montini's experience and insight also influenced the Council's approach to the Church's relationship with the modern world and its commitment to social justice, as well as the promotion of unity among Christian denominations and various religious traditions. Ultimately, Montini's appointment to the Central Preparatory Commission in 1960 marked an important milestone in his career within the Catholic Church, as he would later be elected Pope in 1963, taking the name Pope Paul VI, and continuing to implement the reforms and teachings established during the Second Vatican Council."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I read this background article the other day: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. I am facing a new situation today: A team of researchers named Alpha did some research on the inflammatory response in humans for a science contest.

The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis.

Q: If I tell you that The largest organ in the body can be used for detecting texture, and ask you the question \\"what can be used for detecting texture?\\", is the correct answer \\"encoded information\\"? A:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"encoded information.\\" When the statement refers to the largest organ in the body used for detecting texture, it is referring to the skin. The human skin serves numerous functions, one of which is serving as a sensory organ that enables us to perceive or detect various sensations, including texture. The skin contains different types of sensory nerve receptors, also known as mechanoreceptors, which are responsible for detecting various mechanical stimuli like touch, pressure, and vibration. These receptors are widely distributed in our skin and play a crucial role in providing sensory information that our brain interprets. When it comes to detecting texture, the skin primarily relies on two types of these specialized receptors - the Merkel cells and the Meissner's corpuscles. Merkel cells, which are found in the epidermis, respond to light touch and pressure, thus helping us perceive fine details of an object or surface. Meissner's corpuscles, located in the dermis, are sensitive to light touch and vibrations, enabling us to discern the texture of different materials. When you touch something, these nerve endings create nerve impulses that travel through the nervous system to the brain. The brain then interprets this information, allowing us to perceive the texture of the object. In summary, the correct answer to the question, \\"what can be used for detecting texture?\\" would be \\"the skin,\\" specifically due to the presence and function of specialized nerve receptors, such as Merkel cells and Meissner's corpuscles. It is through these receptors that our skin enables us to detect or sense the texture of various surfaces and objects."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

From November 1940 – February 1941, the Luftwaffe shifted its strategy and attacked other industrial cities. In particular, the West Midlands were targeted. On the night of 13/14 November, 77 He 111s of Kampfgeschwader 26 (26th Bomber Wing, or KG 26) bombed London while 63 from KG 55 hit Birmingham. The next night, a large force hit Coventry. \\"Pathfinders\\" from 12 Kampfgruppe 100 (Bomb Group 100 or KGr 100) led 437 bombers from KG 1, KG 3, KG 26, KG 27, KG 55 and Lehrgeschwader 1 (1st Training Wing, or LG 1) which dropped 394 short tons (357 t) of high explosive, 56 short tons (51 t) of incendiaries, and 127 parachute mines. Other sources say 449 bombers and a total of 530 short tons (480 t) of bombs were dropped. The raid against Coventry was particularly devastating, and led to widespread use of the phrase \\"to conventrate\\". Over 10,000 incendiaries were dropped. Around 21 factories were seriously damaged in Coventry, and loss of public utilities stopped work at nine others, disrupting industrial output for several months. Only one bomber was lost, to anti-aircraft fire, despite the RAF flying 125 night sorties. No follow up raids were made, as OKL underestimated the British power of recovery (as Bomber Command would do over Germany from 1943–1945). The Germans were surprised by the success of the attack.

Step 2: Identify the emotional state The individual expresses fear or apprehension about looking at the message from Nick. Step 3: Consider possible reasons for the fear Since we don't have any specific information about Nick or the relationship between the individual and Nick, we can only speculate on possible reasons for the fear.

The Phoenix The answer is:","completion":"Title: The Rise of the Phoenix Genre: Superhero/Action/Adventure/Drama Plot: The movie opens in a remote and secretive laboratory where powerful mutants are being studied and experimented upon. The main antagonist, Dr. Nathaniel Essex (Mister Sinister), is a mutant expert and mad scientist obsessed with studying and unlocking the potential of powerful mutants. He stumbles upon a method to extract and transfer the powers of one mutant to another and plans to become unstoppable by acquiring the unique abilities of many mutants. In the meanwhile, Logan (Wolverine) continues to lead his retired life away from the rest of the X-Men. He begrudgingly agrees to train a new recruit, under the tutelage of Professor Charles Xavier. This new recruit, an orphan teenage girl named Samantha, has displayed unique powers that the X-Men have never seen before. Unbeknownst to them, Samantha is the daughter of Jean Grey and Scott Summers (Cyclops), and she inherited a dark presence hidden within her - The Phoenix Force. As Logan and Samantha train and bond, he becomes protective of her, coming to care for her as he did with other young mutants he has mentored in the past. During a visit to Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters for Samantha's evaluation, Professor X realizes that Samantha carries the Phoenix Force within her, unbeknownst to her. Fearing the devastating consequences of unleashing the Phoenix Force, he warns Logan to keep a close eye on Samantha, while they find a way to safely suppress the power within her. In the meantime, news of Samantha's powers and her connection to the Phoenix Force reaches Dr. Essex through his network of underground mutants. Sensing an opportunity to unlock unprecedented power, Essex decides to attack the X-Men and kidnap Samantha. The Phoenix Force, which is steadily growing more and more aware within Samantha, starts to emerge erratically in response to the threats, causing Samantha to struggle with containing and controlling this immensely destructive power. Desperate to save Samantha from falling victim to the darkness within her, as had her mother before her, Logan, along with the X-Men, devises a plan to thwart Dr. Essex's life-threatening advances. During an intense rescue mission, Logan engages Essex, who is now a powerful and seemingly unstoppable foe from the various mutant abilities he has absorbed. As the battle escalates, Logan is critically injured and left with no other choice but to call upon Samantha for help. Despite the danger involved, Samantha decides to tap into the Phoenix Force to aid Logan and stop Essex. The Phoenix emerges at Samantha's emotional peak and, in a high-powered, emotional scene, it knocks out Logan in the process of subduing Dr. Essex. Logan, witnessing Samantha's struggle against the darkness within her, finds the strength to rise back into action and helps Samantha regain control over the Phoenix Force, all while fighting and defeating Essex. During the process, Logan teaches Samantha the importance of embracing her power and wielding it responsively. In the aftermath of the film, Samantha decides to join the X-Men, while Professor Xavier and Logan embark on a mission to uncover more about the Phoenix Force and its connection to Samantha's mutant lineage. With Samantha's addition to the team, the X-Men are stronger than ever, ready to face new challenges and protect mutants and humankind alike.

Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill OAM (19 February 1937 - 3 March 2008) was a cricketer who played for New South Wales and Australia. A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Standing six feet tall, O'Neill was compared to Don Bradman upon his entry into Test cricket. At his best, he was a dynamic stroke maker who was a crowd favourite because of his ability to score at a high pace, in particular with his power off the back foot. He was noted for his nimble footwork, which he used to negate spin bowling; however this slowed in his later career as he put on weight. O'Neill particularly liked to sweep the slower bowlers. He often put too much emphasis on his right hand, allowing a large space between his hands on the bat handle, and then turning his right shoulder too square towards the bowler. The renowned English batsman and captain Wally Hammond said that O'Neill was the best all-round batsman he had seen since World War II. O'Neill's tall build, strength and good looks also drew comparison to his boyhood idol Keith Miller. Despite the comparisons to Bradman, O'Neill was much taller and broader, and was often impetuous whereas Bradman was known for his patience and lack of rashness. O'Neill was also criticised for hitting across the line early in his innings. O'Neill was highly regarded for his style and entertainment values. Teammate Alan Davidson said \\"once set he was the most exhilarating player you'd ever want to see--he was dynamite. He'd play attacking shots off balls other people would only think of defending. He had wonderful skill and technique. His shots off the back foot down the ground off fast bowlers--you can't really describe how good they were.\\" His captain for Australia and New South Wales, Richie Benaud said that he was \\"one of the greatest entertainers we've had in Australian cricket\\". O'Neill's style led the British writer EW Swanton to say \\"the art of batting, he reminded us, was not dead, merely inexplicably dormant\\" Wisden opined that \\"A high innings by O'Neill is a thing of masterful beauty. His stroking is delectable, immense in its power.\\" Later in his career, O'Neill became a nervous and superstitious batsman, particular at the start of an innings. He wrote \\"batting is a lonely business\\" in his 1964 autobiography Ins and Outs, opining that he sometimes found first-class cricket to be \\"depressing and lonely\\". He was regarded as an excellent fieldsman at cover, with a powerful and accurate throw, described by Wisden as a \\"dream throw\\" honed from a junior career as a baseballer. He was named as utility player in the 1957 All Australian baseball team, and his ability was such that he was approached by Major League Baseball scouts. Before the retirement of Neil Harvey, he and O'Neill fielded in tandem in the covers and the pair were regarded as the finest fielding combination of the time.","completion":"This text is about Norman Clifford Louis O'Neill, who was a famous Australian cricket player.

Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut.

Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the FBI, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to con Lonnegan.

Bloodhype ( 1973 ) was the second novel to include Pip and Flinx , but it is eleventh chronologically in the series and the two characters had a relatively small part in that novel 's plot . - Del Rey Books is a branch of Ballantine Books, which is owned by Random House and, in turn, by Penguin Random House. It is a separate imprint established in 1977 under the editorship of author Lester del Rey and his wife Judy-Lynn del Rey. It specializes in science fiction and fantasy books, and formerly manga under its (now defunct) Del Rey Manga imprint. It publishes the \\"Star Wars\\" novels under the LucasBooks imprint (licensed from Lucasfilm, a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Studios division of The Walt Disney Company). - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - The Humanx Commonwealth is a fictional interstellar ethical/political entity featured in the science fiction novels of Alan Dean Foster. The Commonwealth takes its name from its two major sapient species, who jointly inhabit Commonwealth planets and administer both the political and religious/ethical aspects. They are the mammalian Humans of the planet Earth and the insectoid Thranx which dwell upon Hivehom. The Commonwealth is described as a progressive, well-intentioned liberal democracy spanning many star systems, and is somewhat similar to the United Federation of Planets from \\"Star Trek\\". The Humanx Commonwealth is notable for its portrayal of a humanalien relationship that is not just mutually beneficial but symbiotic, allowing an amalgamation of the two species. - Bloodhype (1973) is a science fiction novel written by Alan Dean Foster. The book is eleventh chronologically in the Pip and Flinx series, though it was written second, and it is an oddity for the characters since they only appear in the last third of the book. Foster originally started the novel as a stand-alone work, but was encouraged by his publishers to include the characters from his previous novel. Although it was written as a second novel, it logically falls -after- Orphan Star, where he meets the aliens who build him his ship, the Teacher. - Philip Lynx, known by the nickname of \\"Flinx,\\" is a fictional character, an adventurous young man with unusual qualities in a series of books set in the \\"Humanx Commonwealth\\", written by Alan Dean Foster and published by Del Rey Books. - A novelization (or novelisation) is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the advent of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film's script and on a tight deadline.

Analyzing the different aspects of the review, we can identify key points that lead us to this conclusion: 1. Title: The customer mentions that the picture is misleading. This indicates that their expectations were not met when they received the product, leading to a negative initial impression. 2. Content: The customer states that they only received one filter when the picture showed two. This further emphasizes that their expectations were not met, and they feel misled by the product's presentation. 3. Pricing: The customer mentions receiving an order form with a lower price than what they paid, which creates dissatisfaction as they feel they didn't get the best value for their money. 4. Comparison: The customer notes that they could have gotten two filters for the same price elsewhere.

Many of Porter's contemporaries criticized his administration, and historians since have disparaged his leadership. Levesque argues Porter was not a simple-minded reactionary, uncritically committed to tradition, but a principled and selective conservative. He did not endorse everything old or reject everything new; rather, he sought to apply long-established ethical and pedagogical principles to a rapidly changing culture.

Traditionally made of leather or rubber, modern boots are made from a variety of materials. Boots are worn both for their functionality protecting the foot and leg from water, extreme cold, mud or hazards (e.g., work boots may protect wearers from chemicals or use a steel toe) or providing additional ankle support for strenuous activities with added traction requirements (e.g., hiking) and for reasons of style and fashion. - Mount Vesuvius ( also \\"Vesevus\\" or \\"Vesaevus\\" in some Roman sources) is a somma-stratovolcano located on the Gulf of Naples in Campania, Italy, about east of Naples and a short distance from the shore.

Etna, on Sicily itself. - The Camorra is an Italian Mafia-type crime syndicate, or secret society, which arose in the region of Campania and its capital Naples. It is one of the oldest and largest criminal organizations in Italy, dating back to the 16th century. Unlike the pyramidal structure of the Sicilian Mafia, the Camorra's organizational structure is more horizontal than vertical. Consequently, individual Camorra clans act independently of each other, and are more prone to feuding among themselves. - The Sicilian Mafia, also known as simply the Mafia or Cosa Nostra (\\"Our thing\\"), is a criminal syndicate in Sicily, Italy. It is a loose association of criminal groups that share a common organisational structure and code of conduct. The basic group is known as a \\"family\\", \\"clan\\", or \\"\\"cosca\\"\\" or \\"cosche\\" in Sicilian. Each family claims sovereignty over a territory, usually a town or village or a neighbourhood (\\"borgata\\") of a larger city, in which it operates its rackets. Its members call themselves \\"men of honour\\", although the public often refers to them as \\"mafiosi\\". The mafia's core activities are protection racketeering, the arbitration of disputes between criminals, and the organizing and oversight of illegal agreements and transactions. - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics.

Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power. - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as . - MILAN (\\"milan(e)\\" is French for kite) is a European anti-tank guided missile. Design of the MILAN started in 1962, it was ready for trials in 1971, and was accepted for service in 1972. It is a wire guided SACLOS (semi-automatic command to line-of-sight) missile, which means the sight of the launch unit has to be aimed at the target to guide the missile. The MILAN can be equipped with a MIRA or MILIS thermal sight to give it night-firing ability. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain.

Rachel bought a box of donuts from Patricia's shop. Eating sweets was a passion for OPTIONS: 1). Rachel .. 2). Patricia ..","completion":"Eating sweets was a passion for Rachel. While both options are valid ways to end the sentence, they convey different meanings. If the sentence ends with \\"Rachel,\\" it emphasizes her love for sweets as the reason behind her purchase of donuts, creating a stronger connection between the action and Rachel's passion. This ending would likely lead to a narrative that revolves around Rachel and her affection for sweet treats. On the other hand, if the sentence ends with \\"Patricia,\\" it would shift the focus to Patricia's passion for sweets, which could imply that her love for them is a driving factor behind her decision to open a shop. However, this option might result in a less cohesive narrative than the first option, as it shifts the attention from the main subject, Rachel, and her action of buying donuts.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: Who is Corky unwilling to kill? Movie title: Magic Movie plot: Charles \\"Corky\\" Withers has just failed in his first attempt at professional magic. His mentor \\"Merlin\\" (E.J.AndrÃ©) says that he needs to have a better show business gimmick. A year later, Corky comes back as a combination magician and ventriloquist with a foul-mouthed dummy named Fats and is a huge success. His powerful agent Ben Greene is on the verge of signing Corky for his own television show, but Corky bails out for the Catskills, where he grew up, claiming to be \\"afraid of success.\\" In truth, he does not want to take the TV network's required medical examination because doctors might find out that he suffers from severe issues, and that even off-stage he cannot control Fats (a manifestation of Corky's id). In the Catskills, he reunites with his high-school crush, Peggy Ann Snow, who is stuck in a passionless marriage with Corky's friend from high school, Duke. A magic trick with a deck of cards charms Peg into thinking they are soulmates. She and Corky make love, which sparks the jealousy not only of Peggy's tough-guy husband but also the dummy Fats. Greene arrives unexpectedly, having tracked Corky down. After a tense confrontation, in which Greene discovers the truth about Corky's mental state, the agent demands that Corky get help. Fats, however, convinces Corky to kill Greene. Corky does this by using Fats' hard, wooden head. He then removes all of Greene's identification and drags the corpse to the lake. When Corky tries to dispose of the body, however, Greene suddenly lunges at him, still alive. Corky, after an intense fight, manages to drown him. The next morning, Fats becomes even more possessive and jealous when Corky says that he plans to leave Fats behind so that he and Peggy can honeymoon by themselves. Duke returns from his trip earlier than expected. He suspects his wife cheated on him and wants to have a talk with Corky on the lake. Rather than confront him, Duke awkwardly confides to Corky that he loves Peggy and is worried about losing her. Duke suddenly spots a dead body on the edge... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Magic,\\" Corky is unwilling to kill his high-school friend Duke, despite Fats' possessiveness and jealousy stemming from Corky's romantic relationship with Peggy, Duke's wife. Throughout the film, Corky struggles with controlling Fats, who acts as an embodiment of his id, expressing Corky's subconscious desires and urges. Corky's severe psychological issues become more apparent as the movie progresses, revealing that his inability to control Fats is both a sign of his deteriorating mental state and an indication of the extent to which his fear of failure and success impacts his life. His avoidance of the medical examination required for a potential television show highlights these issues, preventing him from achieving professional success and greater public exposure. As the movie's plot unfolds, Corky and Peggy's romantic involvement ultimately results in a complicated love triangle with Duke. This further intensifies Fats' jealousy, causing the dummy to push Corky towards increasingly violent actions. Despite this pressure, Corky hesitates to kill his old friend, demonstrating that he still maintains some remnants of his original, more rational personality. In the thrilling climax, Duke returns from his trip and suspects that Peggy has cheated on him with Corky. The tension between the characters comes to a head when Duke finds the dead body of Corky's agent, Ben Greene, whom Corky killed under Fats' influence. This moment presents a pivotal opportunity for Corky to determine whether he will continue to allow Fats to control him and lead him down the path of destruction or gain the strength to assert control over his id and live a more emotionally healthy life. In deciding not to harm Duke and resisting Fats' urgings to kill his friend, Corky exhibits a strong sense of morality and loyalty to those he cares about. Although he is forced to confront his severe psychological issues and the consequences of his violent actions, Corky's unwillingness to kill Duke can be seen as a significant turning point in the story, which may encourage viewers to root for the struggling protagonist despite his flaws. In conclusion, considering the complex emotions and themes explored in the movie \\"Magic,\\" the film proposal appears to be a thought-provoking venture that delves into the darker aspects of human psychology, relationships, and the struggle for control over one's actions. The intriguing plot and Corky's journey as a character, both professionally and personally, make it a potential investment worth considering for its captivating narrative and potential for stimulating discussions among audiences. The ultimate deciding factor will depend on the financial feasibility and the other aspects of the movie-making process, such as the attached talent and production crew, which may drive the film's overall success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sarah Palin has signed a deal to make a pilot for a reality courtroom TV show. Warm Springs Productions spokesman Howard Bragman said Tuesday that the company will use the pilot to try to find a buyer to air the show five days a week starting in fall 2017. Bragman says Palin is a natural for the role because she's telegenic and not afraid to give her opinion. She has no legal training. The Montana-based production company specializes in outdoors shows and programming for the National Rifle Association. This would be its first reality courtroom show. Bragman says it will be produced by Larry Lyttle, who also produced shows \\"Judge Judy\\" and \\"Judge Joe Brown.\\" ||||| Getty Sarah Palin is getting her own courtroom reality-TV show The gavel is in Sarah Palin’s court — well, it will be. The former Alaska governor will star in a reality-TV courtroom, according to a report from People magazine. Story Continued Below Palin signed a deal in February to preside over a “Judge Judy”-type show expected to premiere in the fall of 2017. A source told People that the Donald Trump surrogate will meet with stations, create a pilot episode and then sell it. Warm Springs, the Montana-based production company Palin reportedly signed with, approached the controversial former politician with the idea last year. The production team will include a TV executive who discovered judges Judy Sheindlin and Joe Brown, both of whom hosted their own eponymous courtroom shows. The show hasn’t been named yet, but it is expected to premiere as a nationally syndicated daytime show. Palin is no stranger to reality TV. She hosted, “Sarah Palin’s Alaska,” a show that broadcast for one season on TLC in 2010 and 2011. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive. Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. ||||| Move over, Judge Judy. There could be a new TV courtroom judge coming to town – and it’s none other than former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. The onetime vice presidential candidate has been tapped to preside over a planned reality court show that would premiere next year, if it gets picked up by stations. She signed a deal in February with Montana-based production company Warm Springs, a source close to the process tells PEOPLE. “It’s a production deal,” the source explains. “What happens next is she’ll meet with stations, make a pilot and sell it.” Warm Springs first approached Palin with the idea in 2015 and has since put together a team that includes the TV executive who found Judge Judy and Judge Joe Brown. Unlike the two famous TV judges, Palin does not have a juris doctor degree. But the source notes that the bestselling author has a variety of other qualities that make her perfectly suited to the job. “Palin’s telegenic personality, wide appeal and common sense wisdom make her a natural for this kind of format and she was Warm Springs’ top pick for this project.” The as-yet-untitled show would premiere as a nationwide syndicated daytime show in the fall of 2017, the source adds. Palin is currently in Alaska caring for her husband, Todd, who’s transitioning from intensive care following a serious snowmachine accident on March 13. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Sarah Palin, a famous politician from Alaska, is going to be on a television show where she will act as a judge in a courtroom, kind of like another show called \\"Judge Judy.\\" The people who make this show think she will be good at it because she's good at talking on TV and sharing her opinions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In A River Runs Through It, Redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high Rocky Mountains of Montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of Thomas Moran or Albert Bierstadt. This film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author Norman Maclean, and stunning camera work by Phillippe Rousselot (Serpent's Kiss, Reigne Margot). Redford's cast is perfect. Tom Skerritt is the Rev. MacLean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the Bible, Brenda Blythen, the mother, and his sons, Craig Schaffer and Brad Pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. Both Schaffer and Pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. It is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds A River Runs Through It to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of Hollywood films produced in recent years. What makes these relationships special however, is the attention Redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. This is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning Montana rivers and mountains. The words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. While the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in Redford's directorial hands. Given the material, Redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again. Choose your answer. What is the sentiment of this review?

A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, it can be inferred that Bailey experienced an immense amount of joy and delight during their time at the circus. Therefore, the best description of Bailey from the given answer options would be [1]. joy after having fun at the circus. Bailey's experience at the circus would have likely revolved around an array of stimulating performances and acts, ranging from the visually captivating acrobats effortlessly soaring through the air to the mesmerizing skills of the jugglers gracefully tossing items with perfect precision. Additionally, Bailey might have marveled at the well-rehearsed routines of the trapeze artists as they effortlessly glided over the astonished audience members. The sounds of the daring high-wire performers would have had Bailey clinging to the edge of their seat in suspense, while the comical antics of the clowns brought spontaneous eruptions of laughter. Apart from the incredible performances, the surroundings of the circus itself would have contributed to Bailey's enjoyment. The vibrant colors of the big top, the smell of popcorn and cotton candy wafting through the air, and the excited chatter of fellow attendees would have evoked a general atmosphere of excitement and wonder. It is also worth mentioning that Bailey's love for every minute of the circus could be a reflection of an open-minded and adventurous spirit, one that looks forward to experiencing a diverse and captivating set of activities. Bailey's ability to fully embrace and enjoy the circus shows a deep appreciation for the talents and dedication showcased by the performers. Moreover, Bailey's positive reaction to the circus may also indicate their ability to lose themselves in the present moment and enjoy the activities they engage in without worries. They could be someone who is genuinely appreciative of such experiences and looks forward to them with great anticipation, becoming elated and joyous in the process. In conclusion, given Bailey's response to their experience at the circus, it is safe to describe them as experiencing tremendous joy and delight after having fun at the circus. This description encapsulates Bailey's excitement, joy, and appreciation for the captivating performances, the festive atmosphere, and the remarkable talents exhibited by the performers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Produce a sentence which mentions all of these concepts: live, organism, reproduction","completion":"A live organism is a complex biological structure that sustains life through various systems and processes, with reproduction being integral to its survival as it ensures the continuity of their species, fostering biodiversity and evolution. These living organisms occupy every corner of the earth, from the deepest parts of the ocean to the highest peaks of mountains, and they all share fundamental characteristics: growth, responsiveness to stimuli, metabolism, homeostasis, and notably, reproduction. Reproduction, an essential hallmark of life, refers to the process by which organisms create offspring. This is vitally important for the propagation and continuation of each species. Depending on the type of organism, reproduction can occur sexually or asexually. In sexually reproducing organisms, the process typically involves the fusion of male and female gametes or sex cells, resulting in offspring that genetically differ from their parents. This diversity is a cornerstone of evolution, as it introduces genetic variation that potentially allows the species to adapt better to changing environments. In contrast, asexually reproducing organisms are capable of producing offspring without the need for a partner, and the resultant offspring are genetically identical to the parent. This type of reproduction is seen in many types of organisms, from single-celled bacteria to complex multicellular organisms like plants. However, regardless of the type of reproduction, the central theme remains the same: the continuity of life. These live organisms, through reproduction, ensure that life persists - from generation to generation, from the tiniest microorganisms to the most complex forms of life. In conclusion, a live organism is not a simple, discrete entity but a dynamic system of life processes where reproduction plays a crucial role. It brings about the emergence of new life, ensuring the survival and evolution of each species. Therefore, when we talk about a live organism, we are not just referring to an individual entity, but a link in the continuous chain of life, underpinned by the fundamental process of reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In order to provide a comprehensive explanation, let us break down the given premise and hypothesis. Premise: \\"Then the Yankees did a lot of fancy cussin' out 'bout him, trying to make out that he was a Reb' cause Johnny lit off with th' Southerners.\\" In this statement, we understand that the Yankees (referring to the Union forces during the American Civil War) are expressing their displeasure towards a certain individual (presumably \\"Johnny\\") who chose to join the Southerners (Confederate forces). They are attempting to paint him in a negative light by labeling him as a Rebel or Confederate sympathizer. This suggests there is some tension or animosity towards \\"Johnny\\" among the Yankees. Hypothesis: \\"The Yankees have a vested interest in making him look good.\\" This statement suggests that the Yankees, contrary to their actions in the premise, have a motive or reason to make \\"Johnny\\" appear favorable or positively in the eyes of others. It implies that the Yankees may stand to benefit in some way from portraying this individual as a valuable or esteemed person. Now, to determine whether the hypothesis holds true, we need to analyze the given information and make connections. The key to finding this answer lies in the relationship between the Yankees and \\"Johnny,\\" as well as any potential benefits the Yankees could garner from making him appear positively. In the premise, the Yankees are expressing negative emotions towards \\"Johnny\\" and attempting to associate him with the opposing group. This animosity makes it difficult to then assume that they would be motivated to make \\"Johnny\\" look good, as their actions directly contradict that statement. Instead, there might be an interest in discrediting him or diminishing his reputation in the eyes of others due to perceived betrayal or shifting allegiances. Moreover, there is no information provided that suggests the Yankees would benefit from portraying \\"Johnny\\" positively. Therefore, without any additional context or evidence linking the Yankees' motivations to make \\"Johnny\\" look good, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true based solely on the provided premise. In conclusion, the given premise does not support the hypothesis that \\"The Yankees have a vested interest in making him look good.\\" Instead, the information provided only reveals animosity expressed by the Yankees towards \\"Johnny\\" and their attempts to discredit his allegiance.

Definitions of the term vary. Nikolai Trubetzkoy in Grundzüge der Phonologie (1939) defines phonology as \\"the study of sound pertaining to the system of language,\\" as opposed to phonetics, which is \\"the study of sound pertaining to the act of speech\\" (the distinction between language and speech being basically Saussure's distinction between langue and parole). More recently, Lass (1998) writes that phonology refers broadly to the subdiscipline of linguistics concerned with the sounds of language, while in more narrow terms, \\"phonology proper is concerned with the function, behavior and organization of sounds as linguistic items.\\" According to Clark et al.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose guitar technician played rhythm guitar on several songs? Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about. But after 45 or 50 minutes we can tell we've won them over. And fans who come to hear Ozzy go home liking Metallica.\\" Metallica won over Osbourne's fans and slowly began to establish a mainstream following.The tour, however, was notable for several incidents. Hetfield broke his wrist in a mid-tour skateboarding accident, and his guitar technician John Marshall played rhythm guitar on several dates. The European leg of the Damage, Inc. Tour commenced in September, with Anthrax as the supporting band. After the performance of September 26 in Stockholm, the band's bus rolled over on a stretch of icy road the following morning.

We came here expecting a nice lunch after attending my bff's daughters dance recital. When we walked in there was no one in the place, cool. I had to use to restroom before we were even sat so I quickly ran off to the restroom, when I entered I almost busted my ass from slipping on the large puddle of random water sitting in the middle of the floor (no the toilet or sink wasnt leaking nor was there a mop bucket in there). Despite the puddle of water on the floor the restroom was clean. The over all cleanliness of the facility was clean. It was a Saturday afternoon (during lunch time hours according to their menu instructions) and we chose to get the AYCE for lunch. The waitress notified us that during the weekends they only observe the AYCE dinner pricing, AYCE lunch pricing was for during the week only. Okay, fine. Next she asked how old the child with us was, we told her she was 7, so she said that the child would only be half price. Cool! BONUS! Why a bonus? Because this child eats like an adult. Our initial food came out quickly. YUM! So being that there was a total of 4 bodies at the table, hungry bodies at that, you would think that we would be monitored by our waitress or wait staff to see when we were out of meat and veggies, but no we weren't. If we got more food it was because we had to flagg them down. Then when they would bring it out it would sit on the table holding the warm tee crap that was across from us. When it finally arrived at the table they would throw it on and turn the heat down. WTF? WE ARE HUNGRY! Why would you turn the heat down? It was cooking to slow. So every time I would make my cousin turn the heat up some staff member would come by and turn it down. WTF? Is this the way that they keep you there longer but not serve you AYCE because theres a time limit? I also had to ask twice for a drink. I was willing to let all this shitty service fly right over my head because the food was good, and never mind it until the bill arrived.... 1. We were told that the child would be half price. They charged us full price. I took my bill up to the front counter and notified the kid up there it was wrong and what it should be. After fumbling with the calculator trying to prove they had charged me 3 full price and 1 half price, he finally realized I was right and then proceeded to blame the cash register being incorrect because they just installed a new system. Whatever. I was able to figure out our total bill including tax on my phone before he was able to fix it in the system. 2. After he fixed the bill and handed it back to me I noticed that the sales tax rate was at 8.15% which I am pretty sure that the current tax rate in Clark County, Nevada is at 8.10%. After seeing this I decided that they could use the extra few cents they got from me on charging the wrong tax, as their tip. I didn't even bother asking him to fix this. Ya know I am a good tipper, a really good tipper when I get excellent service especially. I know what its like to be a household that relies on income that is generated from tips. And this place just flat out pisses me off (like you couldn't already tell). I will never return to this place.

It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse.

President Richard Nixon officially declared the War on Drugs in a press conference on June 17, 1971, when he stated that drug abuse was \\"public enemy number one.\\" The War on Drugs has involved a variety of strategies to combat the flow of illegal drugs and discourage their use. Some of these strategies include: 1. Increased funding for drug prevention and treatment programs: Over the past five decades, the U.S. government has allocated billions of dollars to fund educational programs about the dangers of drug use and addiction, as well as treatment centers and rehabilitation services for those suffering from addiction. 2. Strengthening law enforcement: The War on Drugs has also involved bolstering the efforts of law enforcement agencies such as the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to target and dismantle drug trafficking organizations. 3. International cooperation: The U.S. has engaged in numerous international initiatives to dismantle global drug cartels and disrupt their supply chains. These efforts have included ing collaborating with foreign governments to conduct drug interdiction missions, providing training and resources to foreign law enforcement agencies, and implementing economic sanctions against individuals and entities involved in the drug trade. 4. Mandatory minimum sentencing laws: As part of the War on Drugs, the U.S. enacted a series of mandatory minimum sentencing laws for drug offenses. These laws require judges to impose pre-determined prison sentences based on the type and amount of drugs involved in the crime, which has led to an increase in the U.S. prison population. 5. Asset forfeiture laws: To further target criminal organizations and individuals engaged in drug trafficking, the U.S. government implemented asset forfeiture laws that allow for the seizure of property and assets associated with the illegal drug trade. This, in turn, has been used to further fund law enforcement efforts against drug trafficking. The War on Drugs has been a controversial and long-standing issue in the United States, with critics arguing that it has resulted in the over-incarceration of non-violent drug offenders, disproportionately affected communities of color, and failed to significantly reduce drug addiction rates. Others have criticized the war for contributing to systemic racial and social injustices and for its significant financial and human resources costs. In recent years, there has been a growing shift towards alternative approaches to drug policy, such as drug decriminalization, treatment-focused strategies, harm reduction measures, and a greater emphasis on addressing the root causes of addiction, such as poverty and mental health issues. While the War on Drugs continues to be a significant aspect of U.S. policy, discussions and debates surrounding its effectiveness and consequences are still prevalent today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of plant morphology and access to specimens and references. - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.

Movie title: Zeder Movie plot: In 1956, Gabriella (Veronica Moriconi)âa girl with apparent psychic powersâis brought to the enormous house of Dr. Meyer (Cesare Barbetti) in Chartres, France. Meyer intends to conduct an experiment testing her abilities. He takes her into his basement, where the youngster abruptly falls to her knees and begins digging into the dirt. \\"This is where you're hiding, isn't it?\\" Meyer yells. He rushes upstairs for help from his assistants and leaves Gabriella by herself. She is attacked by something unseen and is taken to the hospital. In the basement, further digging reveals a rotted corpse, with a nearby wallet identifying the dead man as Paolo Zeder. Dr. Meyer realizes that the earth in which Zeder was buried was a 'K-Zone'. In present day Bologna, Stefano (Gabriele Lavia), a novelist, is given an old typewriter as a birthday present by his wife Alessandra (Anne Canovas). One night, after Alessandra has gone to bed, he discovers a series of typed letters on the typewriter's ribbon. As he reads the ribbon, he finds it is an essay written by scientist Paolo Zeder discussing the existence of K-Zonesâareas where death ceases to exist. According to Zeder's essay, bodies buried in these zones can return from the dead. Stefano investigates the message left on the typewriter ribbon. He encounters people who make it clear that they do not appreciate any questions relating to Paolo Zeder or K-Zones. However, the resistance he experiences intrigues him even more. He becomes obsessed with getting answers to the mystery and temporarily abandons his wife. His investigation leads him to a huge old property, ostensibly abandoned but protected by electrified fences. A nearby service station attendant tells Stefano that French investors are building a gigantic hotel on the property, but no work is ever seen being done. Stefano sneaks onto the property, and discovers surveillance equipment with numerous monitors showing the dead face of a man buried in a coffin. Stefano watches the monitors. The dead man is Don Luigi Costa,... Answer:","completion":"Based on the movie plot provided, it appears that Gabriella (played by Veronica Moriconi) possesses psychic powers. These powers allow her to sense and detect things or events that are not perceptible through ordinary human senses. Psychic powers can present in various forms such as clairvoyance, telepathy, and psychometry, among others. In the case of Gabriella, her psychic powers seem to be oriented towards finding hidden objects or locations. In the beginning, she is brought to Dr. Meyer's house, where she is immediately drawn to his basement. Using her psychic abilities, she quickly begins digging into the earth, knowing that something is hidden beneath the surface. Once her abilities are put to the test, she is able to uncover the rotting corpse of a man named Paolo Zeder. This discovery leads to the concept of K-Zones, which becomes one of the central themes of the movie. Throughout the film, Gabriella's psychic powers seem to act as a guiding force that helps the protagonists navigate through the complex mystery surrounding Dr. Meyer, Paolo Zeder, and the K-Zones. This ability to sense and uncover hidden information is a critical tool in Stefano's investigation, as he encounters resistance from those who do not want the truth about the K-Zones to be uncovered. Overall, Gabriella's psychic powers play a significant role in the movie's plot, as they help to advance the narrative and uncover the secrets surrounding the mysterious K-Zones. Her abilities not only aid in the discovery of the corpse of Paolo Zeder but also help Stefano navigate the intricate web of deception and intrigue that surrounds the existence and purpose of K-Zones."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Changes in the underground environment and geology can influence various aspects of the volcanic process. Some factors that can indirectly impact volcanic activity are the composition of magma, the temperature and pressure conditions, and the structure of the Earth's crust. These factors can, in turn, influence the magma's viscosity, gas content, and the capacity of the crust to store magma, thereby affecting the frequency and intensity of volcanic eruptions. For example, if there is an increase in the supply of magma, it may cause more frequent eruptions due to increased pressure. Additionally, if the composition of magma changes, it may alter its viscosity and gas content, affecting the explosiveness of eruptions. Indirectly impacting a step in the process, such as increasing pressure in the magma chamber or changing the Earth's crust's structure, can ultimately lead to more or greater volcanic eruptions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Process: - Prophase is the first and longest stage of mitosis - In this stage the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In prophase the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In metaphase the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fiber at their centromere - In anaphase the sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart - During telophase the chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes - Two new nuclear membranes then form around each of the two regions of DNA and the spindle fibers disappear. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more daughter and parent cells happens, how will it affect HURTING mitosis to proceed normally. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a change in the number of daughter and parent cells would have an effect on mitosis, potentially hindering its normal progression. To understand how this hypothesis might have an impact, it is important to analyze the individual stages of mitosis and how the proposed change could influence them. 1. Prophase: In this initial stage of mitosis, the chromosomes become visible, and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell. A change in the number of daughter and parent cells could affect the organization of the centrioles and their separation, leading to complications in the formation of the mitotic spindle, which is essential for proper chromosome movement and segregation. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fibers at their centromere. An increased number of daughter and parent cells could result in overcrowding or improper alignment of chromosomes at the metaphase plate, which could lead to errors in the chromosomal attachment to spindle fibers and later segregation. 3. Anaphase: The sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart. With an altered number of daughter and parent cells, the distribution of chromosomes might be uneven or incomplete, increasing the likelihood of chromosomal missegregation and the potential for deleterious cellular consequences. 4. Telophase: The chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes. Two new nuclear membranes form around each of the two regions of DNA, and the spindle fibers disappear. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, there could be difficulties in the formation of these new nuclear membranes due to an uneven distribution of cellular components resulting from the increased number of daughter and parent cells. This could lead to defects in nuclear formation or function. While a direct effect of the perturbation on mitosis is not guaranteed, it is likely that the proposed change in the number of daughter and parent cells could have indirect consequences on the process. In particular, the change could lead to errors in the formation of the mitotic spindle, the alignment of chromosomes, and the segregation of sister chromatids. These errors, in turn, could result in genomic instability and deleterious cellular effects, such as aneuploidy and a higher likelihood of cell death or dysfunction. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in the number of daughter and parent cells could have an indirect effect on the normal progression of mitosis. The proposed change may result in errors during the various stages of the process, potentially leading to genomic instability and adverse cellular consequences. Further research would be necessary to determine how such changes might affect specific cellular processes and the overall health of the organism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: What is the chess playing robot called in TV's Thunderbirds?","completion":"The chess-playing robot featured in the TV series \\"Thunderbirds\\" is called Braman. \\"Thunderbirds\\" is a British science fiction television series originally produced between 1964 and 1966 by AP Films (later becoming Century 21 Productions). The show was created by Gerry and Sylvia Anderson, who also employed \\"Supermarionation,\\" which refers to the use of marionette puppets connected to electronically operated lip-sync mechanisms. This innovative approach was their trademark production technique. Braman made its first appearance on the show in Episode 22, \\"Cry Wolf,\\" which originally aired on February 17, 1966. This particular episode revolves around two brothers, Tony and Bob, who idolize International Rescue and ultimately save the day after a Satellite Monitor is damaged by a meteor shower. International Rescue members are then sent out to protect the boys from the crash that threatens to happen. The chess-playing robot Braman is introduced as one of the many advanced technologies created by the series' Brains, a genius scientist and inventor who is a member of International Rescue. Brains created Braman to serve as a personal assistant and companion, designed to assist him with his various projects. A vital feature of Braman is its impressive computational and analytical skills, which are showcased when Brains plays chess against it. The robot moves its pieces with retractable arms, and its electronic brain permits it to calculate countless moves ahead - essentially making it nearly impossible for even its intelligent creator, Brains, to defeat. Even though Braman is mostly known for its chess-playing capabilities, the robot is far more than a mere amusement. Throughout the series, Braman demonstrates exceptional abilities that aid International Rescue in their daring exploits. It can also perform maintenance tasks, assist with calculations, and help in the development of various vehicles and technologies. In conclusion, Braman is the chess-playing robot in TV's Thunderbirds, a significant creation by the expert inventor, Brains.

Today, we are going to learn how to fold a jacket and a shirt in a super easy way, so that they stay neat and don’t take up too much space when you're packing or storing them away. This will help keep your clothes looking great, and your room looking tidy! Step 1: Hold your jacket with both hands First, find a jacket you want to fold. Hold it with the backside facing away from you, like you're giving it a hug. This is so you can see the sleeves (the long parts you put your arms in) and the front of the jacket where the buttons or zipper is. Step 2: Turn one side of the jacket inside out Now, look at the sleeves of your jacket. Pick one of them (it can be any side) and gently pull the sleeve until it is inside out. The smooth part of the jacket will now be on the inside, and the bumpy part will be on the outside. Don't worry if it looks a little funny - we are just getting started! Step 3: Slip the other side of the jacket into the inside-out side Keep holding onto your jacket. Now, take the other sleeve that’s still right-side out and gently slip it into the inside-out sleeve. Just like how one hand fits into the other when you clap, you will see that the two sleeves fit together nicely. Step 4: Roll up a shirt and place it into the shoulder of the jacket Find a shirt that you want to fold too. Lay it flat on a surface like a bed or a table. Starting from the bottom of the shirt, roll it up like a sleeping bag until you reach the top. Now, put the rolled-up shirt into the shoulder area of your jacket (where your shoulders would be when you wear the jacket). Step 5: Roll up your jacket and shirt lengthwise Almost done! Keep holding onto your jacket, and start rolling it up lengthwise from one end to the other. Make sure the shirt stays inside the jacket as you roll. When you're done, you'll have a neat little bundle that will be easy to pack or put away. There you have it, little friends! Now you know how to fold your jacket and shirt in a super-neat way. This will help keep your clothes nice and wrinkle-free. Plus, it will make it easy to find them when you need to get dressed for a special occasion, like a birthday party or a fancy dinner with your family.

Helfeld refused to give his name when he joined the company, so he was listed on the time sheets as \\"Elephant\\" in reference to his bulk. Situated on the corner of Tottenham High Road and Chesnut Road, the factory sat opposite Tottenham Police Station, which was under the control of the Metropolitan Police.Special Branch suspected another individual, the Russian revolutionary Christian Salnish, of having organised the robbery. Salnish, who often went under the name Jacob Fogel, had been an active revolutionary since the age of 13. He participated in the 1905 Russian Revolution and afterwards helped to build resistance groups in the Baltic states and Saint Petersburg, then the capital of Imperial Russia. Special Branch suspected a political element to the crime based on Salnish's involvement, but as both Helfeld and Lepidus died during the chase, the motivation for the crime...

The specificity of base pairing occurs because adenine and thymine align form two hydrogen bonds, whereas cytosine and guanine form three hydrogen bonds. The two strands in a double helix must therefore be complementary, with their sequence of bases matching such that the adenines of one strand are paired with the thymines of the other strand, and so on.:4.1\\", answer the following question.

The analysis of the sentiment can be broken down into different components that come together to support this conclusion. 1. Context: Celebi, a mythical Pokémon representing time-travel, suggests that the speaker wants to undo past events. This implies a negative connotation, as they wish to erase their memory of watching the movie instead of reliving it. 2. Intention: The sentence reflects the desire of the speaker to travel back in time to prevent or change an action. This indicates a sense of regret or dissatisfaction, which are negative sentiments. 3. Implication: By stating this, the speaker implies that they did not enjoy or appreciate the movie. This negative experience is the primary driving force behind the sentiment in the sentence. 4. Choice of words: The phrasing \\"a time before I saw this movie\\" underscores the negativity of the sentiment. This specific construction highlights the speaker's dissatisfaction with the experience and their wish to revert to the time before they watched the film. It is essential to consider that the interpretation of sentiment often relies on contextual cues and might vary depending on individual perspectives.

Answer the following question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: how does lsd impact the human body Suggested answer: LSD is very potent, with 20–30 μg (micrograms) being the threshold dose. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, you can validate the given answer as it is accurate in mentioning that LSD is a potent substance and has a low threshold dose. However, for a more comprehensive understanding, here's a detailed answer: LSD (Lysergic acid diethylamide) is a potent hallucinogenic drug that impacts the human body in several ways: 1. Effect on serotonin receptors: LSD primarily affects the serotonin receptors in the brain. Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that plays a crucial role in regulating mood, perceptions, and thought processes. LSD stimulates these receptors, specifically the 5-HT2A receptor, which can cause altered perceptions, intense emotional experiences, and hallucinations. 2. Physical effects: The use of LSD can result in various physical effects, including increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, dilated pupils, sweating, dry mouth, tremors, and loss of appetite. In some cases, users may experience dizziness, nausea, or weakness as well. 3. Psychological effects: LSD can cause intense shifts in emotions, mood, and thoughts. Users often report feeling a sense of unity or interconnectedness with the world around them. Other psychological effects include visual and auditory hallucinations, distortion of time perception, and synesthesia (a mixing of senses, such as hearing colors or seeing sounds). In some cases, users may experience negative psychological effects such as paranoia, anxiety, and panic attacks. 4. \\"Bad trips\\" and long-term effects: Although many users report profound insights and transformative experiences on LSD, some may experience \\"bad trips\\" characterized by disturbing hallucinations, extreme anxiety, and a feeling of losing control. Additionally, the long-term effects of using LSD can include prolonged anxiety, depression, flashbacks, and, in rare cases, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD), a condition in which users experience persistent hallucination-like symptoms long after the drug has left their system. In summary, the suggested answer provides accurate information about the potency and threshold dose of LSD. However, it is essential to consider how LSD affects the human body more broadly, including its impact on serotonin receptors, physical and psychological effects, and potential long-term consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However,some players complained right away that the new balls bounced differently and were actually harder to control than the leather ones. Physics helped answer questions about why the new balls felt different.For example,the scientists studied friction ,which in this case affects the ability of a player to hold onto a ball.\\"The greater the friction,the better it will stick to his hand,\\"explains a scientist. Tests on both wet and dry balls showed that while the synthetic ball was easier to hold onto when dry,it had less friction and became much harder to hold onto when wet.That's because _ stays on the surface of the synthetic balls but gets taken into the leather balls. The scientists also tested bounce and found that the logo printed on the new balls made their surface uneven and caused them to bounce a little strangely com- pared with the leather balls. In January,the NBA went back to using the leather balls.They aren't perfect,but for now,that's just the way the ball bounces.

At the present time, the teachings of all three branches of Buddhism have spread throughout the world, and Buddhist texts are increasingly translated into local languages. While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive, in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional. Buddhists in Asia are frequently well organized and well funded.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Sharing more of your emotions with your partner and encouraging your partner to do the same with you will help strengthen your bond. Make it a habit to confide in each other every day. Some opening questions for confiding in your partner include: “Remember when we used to go walking and talking around the neighborhood, walking the dogs together? Let’s do that tonight… How about it?” “What happened yesterday between us didn’t go so well, and I want to try another way — can we start over, and this time I will take some deep breaths and listen more patiently. I also want to say what works better for me and find out what you are hoping for.” In order to move forward in your relationship, you will both need to learn how to understand each other’s needs. The best way to uncover what your partner needs, and let them know what you need, is to talk about it. If you are not sure what your spouse wants or needs, the best way to find out is to ask questions and listen. If you still are not sure, ask more questions. For example, you could say something like, “I think that what you need from me is ________. Is that what you mean?” Showing appreciation through sincere compliments is an important part of a healthy relationship. Make sure that you and your partner are aware of the importance of complimenting each other and that you both know how to do it well. Good compliments should not only be sincere and specific, they should also be phrased as an “I” statement rather than as a “you” statement. For example, if your partner cleans the kitchen, don’t say “You did a nice job of cleaning the kitchen.” Instead, say \\"I appreciate that you cleaned the kitchen.” Using I instead of you lets your partner know how you feel, not just that you noticed. If you decide that you are ready to move forward in your relationship with your partner, you should ask your partner to promise you that they will not follow the same pattern of behavior that led to the affair. Ask your partner to articulate or even write out what that behavior includes and commit to change. Since there is a possibility that your partner may cheat again, you should work together to establish consequences for another affair. These consequences may include things like divorce or other repercussions. You may want to get these consequences in writing and work with a lawyer to make them legally binding. If things don’t improve despite all of your best efforts and the help of marriage counseling, you may have to accept that the relationship cannot be repaired. Signs that the relationship may be beyond repair include: Constant fighting Inability to connect with your partner Inability to empathize with or receive empathy from your partner Hurt and anger that does not subside with time Inability to forgive your partner Summary:","completion":"The article is about how sharing emotions, talking about needs, giving compliments, and setting boundaries can help strengthen your relationship with your partner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Just as he attempts to leap off the bridge, he is distracted by Milt Manville, an old friend from fifteen years ago. Harry doesn't really recognize him at first but there appears to be a contrast between the two of them with Milt boasting of how well he is doing in life while Harry tries to listen. Milt takes Harry to his house to meet Ellen Manville (Elaine May), Milt's long-suffering wife. She is complaining that their sex life is non-existent but Milt has a secret lover in the form of beautiful blonde Linda. Milt convinces a barely-there Harry to make a go of things with Ellen so that she is not left lonely when he will divorce her for Linda. It takes a while but Harry and Ellen eventually fall in love. They marry and go to Niagara Falls for their honeymoon but this is when Ellen realizes that Harry is the world's worst roommate and childish at heart. In one example, Harry unexpectedly stomps on Ellen's toe in order to test her love for him. As she hobbles in pain, she asks, \\"What did you do that for?,\\" and in response, he asks her if she still loves him, and she says she does. As Milt and Linda start to settle down as a couple, she quickly realizes that he has an addiction to selling household items and junk for a quick buck, something that she is strongly against. She immediately dumps him, which leads to Milt to want Ellen back when he realizes how much he loves her for real. She admits that she doesn't really love Harry as much as she thought, as his bizarre day-to-day activities get to her.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The fact of the matter is that anything you do that makes money is going to take time. And time + money = a job. No matter what you're doing in order to make enough money to support yourself, it can technically be considered a job, even if it isn't a job in the traditional way. If you just want to avoid a job you hate or that feeling of working too hard, turn your favorite hobby into a job. No matter what you do, there is a way to monetize it. There are a number of websites that will let you do quick tasks for small amounts of money. The most popular is Amazon's Mechanical Turk, but Short Task is also a good option. Keep in mind that the amount of money you get from these tasks is very small, but you should be able to do them easily while doing other tasks (like watching tv, using the toilet, or riding on the bus). When people go away on vacation or for business, especially if it's for a long time, they will often want to make sure that nothing goes wrong in their home or with their pets so they'll pay someone a small amount to live in their home or to take their pets until they get back. Start by house sitting for people that you know to build up references, they advertise online and in newspapers. Go to garage sales or hang out on websites like Craigslist and look for free or low cost items. Oftentimes you can slightly clean up an item or refurbish it a bit and get a lot more money when you resell it. Sometimes you don't need to do anything at all: people will often sell their items for less than they're worth if they just want to get rid of it quickly or they don't know what it's really worth. If you own a house, you can rent a small, cheap apartment for yourself and then in turn rent out your own home. If your home rents well, your temporary apartment is cheap, and your mortgage is paid off or low, then this can be a good way to make some money. It can either be a very short-term thing (such as for conventions or special events) or it can be more long-term. Just make sure to check your cities rules regarding rentals. You can get in a lot of trouble if your city doesn't allow them without a permit. You can sell your hair or be a test subject for cosmetic studies. (Remember to be sure that it's legal in your country) Lots of people have quick errands or chores that they need done but don't want to do them or don't have the time. This can range from picking up groceries to mowing the lawn, a ride to the doctor to delivering a package. A good place to find such tasks that need doing is TaskRabbit. You will usually need a background check and a car, but as long as you have those you should be able to find lots of quick ways to earn cash. When websites, magazines, or other media need images, instead of taking them themselves they'll often pay a small fee and license someone else's pictures. This is called stock photography. Using a high quality camera, take some good pictures and then license them through Flickr or other stock photo websites. Get enough of them and you'll make money without having to do much more. If you know how to do something pretty well (for example, you were really good at math in school), you can take quick and easy tutoring jobs to help kids do better in school. You can find lots of advertisements for tutors on sites like Craigslist. You'll probably need references but the money can be good for almost no work. There are lots of opportunities to make money by helping companies with things like advertising. You can get paid to take part in focus groups and surveys. You can also sometimes find work as a secret shopper, after which you can resell the products you buy to make money. 20|20 Panel is a common place to find opportunities like these. If you've got Photoshop and basic art skills, you can make money be designing some t-shirts and other products and selling them online through special retailers. Websites like Society 6 and Redbubble allow you to make clothing and household items. They'll sell, produce, and ship them for you (in exchange for a cut of the profit), but you'll still make a good chunk of money off your sales. Lots of websites will give you money for producing content for them. Listiverse and eHow will pay for articles you write, for example. This requires that you be able to write content quickly, though, in order to be worth the effort. Have something to say and good command of your keyboard! This can get pretty job-like but if you have fun and do it in a way that you enjoy then it won't be that big of a deal. Find a topic that you understand and enjoy and make blog posts, Youtube videos, etc. Ads places on your site and videos can make you a pretty tidy sum and tools like Google Ads makes it really easy to do too.","completion":"The article offers various unconventional methods to make money, such as monetizing hobbies, completing small tasks on websites, house sitting, reselling items, renting out property, participating in studies, running errands, selling stock photos, tutoring, joining focus groups, designing and selling products, and creating content through writing or media."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: So Angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter, rather than the son that she was born, and now holds a job as - wait for it - a camp counselor! How appropriate, right? I know, I love it. Anyway, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels - more blood, more imaginative killings (which aren't imaginative, but still more so than the original), more nudity, a more elaborate plot, and generally worse than the original. It is entertaining in the same way as the original was, in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80's that you can't help getting a good laugh. At one point, a guy asks Angela out, and she says \\"I'll call you,\\" and then quickly walks away. The guy says to himself, \\"How is she gonna call me? I don't have a phone!\\" and then he sniffs his armpits, wondering what turned her off (it's the hair, dude!!). It is a well-known fact that in 80s slasher movies, the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior, usually for being too promiscuous. When I first started getting into horror movies and saw the Friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s, I didn't realize this. I learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness. I was pretty impressed, not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message, albeit a morbid one, but that there was actually some thought put into it. But not in this movie! At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says \\"Let this be a lesson to you. Say no to drugs!\\" Real subtle screen writing there, guys. Then again, the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie. Angela (who, by the way, went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person and then changed her name from Angela to, umm, Angela), says at one point, \\"I don't like being the wicked witch of the west, but I know what happens when things get out of control.\\" (People start getting killed...by me! HA!) Then later, she demands that one of the counselors, Mare, make an apology, to which the girl replies, \\"I'd rather die!\\" Sorry, Mare, but you really walked into that one... Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie (except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules, which the one in the movie doesn't). This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like. That's okay though, you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around, although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie. I hadn't seen that kind of thing much before. Definitely bad taste, even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie....","completion":"The sentiment of this review feels mixed. The person seems to enjoy some aspects of the movie, like the humor and the authentic 80's feel, but also finds it worse than the original and has some criticisms about the dialogue and the portrayal of camp life. They also mention that some scenes are in bad taste. So, overall, the person finds the movie entertaining but also has several issues with it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Community service is an important component of education here at our university. We encourage all students to volunteer for at least one community activity before they graduate. A new community program called \\"One On One\\" helps elementary students who've fallen behind. Your education majors might be especially interested in it because it offers the opportunity to do some teaching, that is, tutoring in math and English. You'd have to volunteer two hours a week for one semester. You can choose to help a child with math, English, or both. Half-hour lessons are fine, so you could do a half hour of each subject two days a week. Professor Dodge will act as a mentor to the tutors-he'll be available to help you with lesson plans or to offer suggestions for activities. He has office hours every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon. You can sign up for the program with him and begin the tutoring next week. I'm sure you'll enjoy this community service...and you'll gain valuable experience at the same time. It looks good on your resume, too, showing that you've had experience with children and that you care about your community.

Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear.

Other than their race, destination, and gender, the men have nothing in common: George is the trip organizer; Xavier is an aspiring filmmaker hoping to make a documentary of the March; Flip is the vain but charismatic and openly homophobic and sexist actor; Kyle and Randall are a homosexual couple; Gary, a biracial police officer; Jamal is a former gang banger turned devout Muslim who has evaded prosecution for the murders he committed; Evan Jr., is a petty criminal who has been permitted to break probation to attend the march on the condition that he remain handcuffed to his father, Evan Sr. As the bus travels across country, Xavier conducts interviews with the various attendees, allowing them to express their views on race, religion, and politics. The interviews often provoke outbursts from other men on the bus, invariably leading to many political confrontations. Jeremiah, the eldest member of the group, is an 80-year-old former alcoholic who lost his job and family, has found new meaning in life and is energized by the Million Man March, and embraces his African heritage; his philosophies on the black experience and stories of precolonial Africa serve to unite the men and ease tensions and the infighting among them. En route the bus breaks down and the men are forced to board another bus, driven by an ethnically Jewish white man named Rick. A couple of the passengers harass Rick as a white man, and Rick ultimately refuses to drive any further, citing the group's prejudice and his opposition to antisemitic remarks made by the leader of the march, Louis Farrakhan.

We should have arrived at Liverpool at 9:19, but due to a typical London fog, the train had to move along so slowly that it was not until 10:30 that it got there. In spite of our late arrival, Joan, my wife's sister, decided that she would go to see the Crown Jewels in the Tower of London while we went shopping. It was only after her sister had disappeared into the fog that my wife realized that we hadn't decided where we should meet for lunch. Since I had our three tickets for the concert in my pocket, this was indeed a problem. There seemed to be nothing we could do except taking a taxi to the Tower of London, and try to find her there. Needless to say, we didn't find her. It was now one o'clock, and the concert began at 2:30. \\"Perhaps she will think of waiting outside the concert hall,\\" suggested my wife hopefully. By this time the fog was so thick that road traffic had to stop, and the only way to get there was by underground railway. Hand in hand we felt our way along the road to where we thought the nearest station should be. An hour later we were still trying to find it. Just as I was about to lose my temper completely when we met a blind man tapping his way confidently through the fog. With his help we found Tower Hill tube station just fifty yards down the road. By now it was far too late even to try to get to the concert hall before the performance began at 2:30, so we decided to return to Cambridge. It took seven long hours instead of the usual two to make that journey. Nor were we able to get any food and drink on the train. Tired and hungry we finally reached home at ten, opening the door to the sound of the telephone bell.

Just make sure you're listening to music that matches the mood; too slow and it might lull you to sleep. Every person has their own get-jazzed kind of music. Do some experimenting with Internet radio; you may find that in-the-zone-work-music is different than the music you prefer to listen to in your free time. If possible, get out of the office. Take a short walk or drive to get food, and eat out instead of in the conference room. Getting others to come with you is another good idea. That long, social break may be what you need to power through the afternoon. Avoid going to the bathroom or doing other things that can be done before/after your lunch in order to get the most time out of your lunch. Try going to a new place for lunch every once in a while, and recruit co-workers. This way there is something to look forward to during the morning. A cluttered area is a cluttered mind. A cluttered mind leads to slower and poorer decision making. Take five minutes to just organize whatever's at your desk or in your space. When it's cleaner, you've not only killed a bit of time, but you've also made it easier to breathe. On a slow day, it's all about keeping yourself busy. If you don't have your own area to clean, consider organizing a community area. How could your boss say no? When we get home from work, it's all too easy to plop down in front of the TV for hours on end and go on autopilot. This is great in theory, but then when work rolls around the next morning, it's like it never happened. This is even worse when it takes up your entire weekend. In your downtime at work, make a plan. If your boss asks, you're just practicing time management. This not only keeps you busy now, but it gives you something to look forward to. And then when that time does roll around, it'll be time well-spent. You'll be recharged and work won't seem so bad since you had quality time off. If it's a slow day at work, you may just need another new task to take care of. And the fact that it's new will make the time go by much faster. Ask your boss if you can go get everyone lunch or take care of the inside of the microwave that everyone knows about but no one acknowledges openly.

In fact, just a two-minutes break can increase your productivity by 11%. It can literally keep you on schedule. So don't feel guilty about taking a second to browse Facebook, check your email, or send that text or Tweet. In the long run, it'll make you perform better.

Because of distribution problems with the newly formed Candlelight Records, the album was not released until May 15, 1995, and only in Europe. Orchid tested the boundaries of traditional death metal, featuring acoustic guitars, piano, and clean vocals.After a few live shows in the United Kingdom, Opeth returned to the studio in March 1996 to begin work on a second album, again produced by Dan Swanö. The album was named Morningrise, and was released in Europe on June 24, 1996. With only five songs, but lasting 66 minutes, it features Opeth's longest song, the twenty-minute \\"Black Rose Immortal\\". Opeth toured the UK in support of Morningrise, followed by a 26-date Scandinavian tour with Cradle of Filth. While on tour, Opeth attracted the attention of Century Media Records, who signed the band and released the first two albums in the United States in 1997.In 1997, after the tour, Åkerfeldt and Lindgren dismissed De Farfalla for personal reasons, without the consent of Nordin. When Åkerfeldt informed Nordin, who was on a vacation in Brazil, Nordin left the band and remained in Brazil for personal reasons. Former Eternal members, drummer Martín López (formerly of Amon Amarth) and bassist Martín Méndez, responded to an ad at a music shop placed by Åkerfeldt. López and Méndez were fans of the band and took the ads down themselves so no other musicians could apply for the job. Åkerfeldt and Lindgren did not want the Martíns to join at first, due to them already knowing each other; they felt that they wanted two strangers so that there wouldn't be two camps in the band, but eventually hired both. López made his debut with Opeth playing on a cover version of Iron Maiden's \\"Remember Tomorrow\\", which was included on the album A Call to Irons: A Tribute to Iron Maiden.With a larger recording budget from Century Media, Opeth began work on its third album, with noted Swedish producer Fredrik Nordström, at Studio Fredman in August 1997.

This specific phrasing indicates that the marriage and the creation of the empress happened in the aforementioned year. 2. \\"Emperor Yang Zhi agreed and married 276 Wu and created her Empress.\\" This sentence is grammatically incorrect in English, and its meaning is not clearly conveyed due to the misplaced number. The number 276 is misplaced, making it seem as if it is qualifying \\"Wu\\", which doesn't make sense in this context. Also, the capital 'E' in the word 'Empress' would typically mean it's a name or title for a specific person rather than a general title. However, this could also be a typographical error. From these descriptions, it's clear that the sentences do not mean the same thing. The first sentence implies a historic event where Emperor Yang Zhi married Wu in the year 276 and made her the Empress. The second sentence, due to its erroneous construct, fails to clearly state whether 276 is the number of times he married Wu, a nonsensical suggestion, or when he married her.

What the USADA doping report said about Lance Armstrong's entourage Lawyers working for Armstrong later attempted to persuade Betsy into asking her to sign a statement discrediting Walsh which she refused. Andreu claimed after this she was “vilified”. Lance’s wife at the time of his first successes in the Tour de France, the report claims she had full knowledge of his doping activities and even played an active role. In his affidavit, Jonathan Vaughters recalled: “On the day of the road race at the 1998 World Championships someone apparently decided that cortisone should be made available for the team; I recall that Kristin Armstrong was wrapping cortisone tablets in tin foil and handing them out to the riders. Someone made the remark, ‘Lance’s wife is rolling joints.’” A year later, during the Milan-San Remo race, Kristin was asked by her friend Betsy Andreu what her feelings were about EPO. “Kristin responded along the lines of, ‘it was a necessary evil’,” Andreu recalled. “I understood from this that Kristin was aware that Lance was using EPO but wasn’t concerned about it.” The report claimed that Armstrong sent the wife of his former team-mate Levi Leipheimer, Odessa Gunn, threatening text messages after her husband testified before a federal grand jury about doping. “Shortly after my testimony,” he recalled, “I attended a dinner with Lance and sat next to him. Lance was very cold towards me and I figured he had learned of my testimony. Although he did not speak to me, Lance sent a text message to my wife Odessa that said, ‘Run, don’t walk’. This was the first time in several years that Lance had communicated to Odessa and in context his message to her felt threatening.” A similar incident occurred during the 2012 Tour de France, after Leipheimer had been interviewed by USADA. Leipheimer wrote in his affidavit: “Odessa received a text from Lance asking, ‘Are you in CA’ Both Odessa and I found this text to be very disturbing as she was indeed home alone at the time. The text made her feel very vulnerable and there was no legitimate reason for Lance to communicate with Odessa.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a report from the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) that talks about Lance Armstrong, a famous cyclist, and his friends and family who knew about and were involved in his use of illegal drugs to help him in races. These drugs, like EPO and cortisone, are not allowed because they give an unfair advantage. The report shares stories from people who saw these actions, and it also talks about some situations where Lance was not very nice to people who told the truth about his cheating."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Christmas Day is very popular in China, especially for young people. Should Chinese people celebrate Christmas Day? 60% people think that we should not take Christmas so seriously, 10% think everyone should celebrate Christmas. Some people think celebrating Christmas Day can help them understand western culture better. Some people think it is a great holiday to have a good time with their families and friends. During Christmas Day, they can meet friends, go shopping, watch movies and go to different parties. But I have different ideas. Most of us celebrate Christmas just because we see many people around us do it. China has its own holidays, such as the Spring Festival and Mid-Autumn Day, so we don't have to celebrate holidays from other countries. Some people spend a lot of money celebrating Christmas Day. People buy lots of gifts for their friends and families, but this is not the best way to show their love.

Given the question: What is the first name of Penelope's son that died? Answer the above question based on the context below: Three years after the death of a young man, Liam Lombard, the story flashes forward to assess the toll it has taken on his parents, brother, and ex-girlfriend, all set against the backdrop of suburban Sydney. Jordan Lombard is a broken man, now hideously obese and unable to function. His once happy marriage is skidding hopelessly out of control. His wife Penelope is trapped in routine, devoid of self-respect. Her pain only deepens with the onset of menopause. This humiliation has driven her straight into the arms of another, younger, man. Their surviving son Ben has developed a peculiar relationship with the local boy Matt. Though an unlikely pair, a romance has begun to blossom. As Ben's sexuality comes further into question, he turns his attentions to the girl next-door Indigo, his dead brothers former lover. Never quite the same since his death, her destructive relationship with a married man, Greg, is fading as is her relationship with her mother Jackie. As Ben sets out to woo her in his own twisted fashion, including dressing like an old neighbour, Indigo comes to find he might be her one true friend. Then history repeats. Jordan suffers a heart attack, shaking his family to their core. In the middle of a night, three years on from the death of her son, Penelope fights for her husband at a hospital bedside. Desperate to reclaim his life, Jordan races to quit his oppressive job in spectacular and uncharacteristic fashion on his bosses doorstep. When Jordan finally gets home that night – he crumbles in his wife's arms - a second chance now awarded. Meanwhile, Ben makes his way to a lonely bus, planning to skip the city with Indigo.

Not until 1998 did al Qaeda undertake a major terrorist operation of its own, in large part because Bin Laden lost his base in Sudan. Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies. Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him. Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case, Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely. After reading the above, is \\"They attempted to assassinate General Omar al Bashir,\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Sudan refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot of who?\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"Sudan refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot of who?\\" is not \\"They attempted to assassinate General Omar al Bashir.\\" Instead, the correct answer is \\"They attempted to assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.\\" The text mentions that the would-be killers came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, and they had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by Bin Laden."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared. After he throws the leaves in, the child pounces on him, spins him around, grabs his hat, and taunts him. Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head. Both Mickey and the youngster have a tug'o'war on the basket until it shatters on Mickey, who is entangled. Then, the child makes an army of leaves and marches around the house. Mickey manages to trap the child with a sack, which he ties and punts away. The tornadoling retaliates with just 2 punches, then attempts to get away, with Mickey hot on his heels. As Mickey chases him with a rake the terrified child calls out for help. The mother tornado, unamused with Mickey tormenting her offspring (and unaware of what her child has been doing to Mickey), furiously pursues him with a look of relentlessness on her face.

The phrase \\"plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire Olympic swim team through\\" is a strongly worded and vivid description that implies the movie has significant issues with its storyline and continuity. The critic is using a metaphor to emphasize the extent of the problems in the movie's plot, suggesting that these issues are large and detrimental to the overall enjoyment and quality of the film. The movie review doesn't only use negative language but also employs exaggeration to emphasize the issues found in the movie. Comparing the plot holes to something that an Olympic swim team could go through suggests that the issues are not just minor or easily overlooked, but rather substantial and highly noticeable.

The central point, they argue, was a constitutional ban against aid to religious schools, followed by a later ban on religious observance in public education.

What is the title of this article: Aboriginal peoples in Canada comprise the First Nations, Inuit and Métis; the descriptors \\"Indian\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" are falling into disuse, and other than in neighboring Alaska. \\"Eskimo\\" is considered derogatory in many other places because it was given by non-Inuit people and was said to mean \\"eater of raw meat.\\" Hundreds of Aboriginal nations evolved trade, spiritual and social hierarchies. The Métis culture of mixed blood originated in the mid-17th century when First Nation and native Inuit married European settlers. The Inuit had more limited interaction with European settlers during that early period.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: : “Walk/Work your talk!” with integrity -- and in doing that, earn the right to have responsibility for others' success. True authority is born from respect for the purpose, good character and trustworthiness of the person who leads them to opportunity for success. People will respond more openly to a person of passion and dedication -- but by not complaining against the student and never demeaning the work... Leaders need to be able to be a \\"source of inspiration\\", and be a motivator getting the work into gear towards the required action or cause. It is impossible to make a student do anything -- but inspire and coach the techniques: \\"Do it this way!\\" -- and \\"Right. That's it!\\" Although the responsibilities and roles of a leader and follower are different, the leader needs to be seen to be part of the team working towards the goal. This kind of leader will not be afraid to work. People look to the leader during times of uncertainty and unfamiliarity to find reassurance and security. Storms, emotions, and crises come and go and a good leader takes these as part of the journey and keeps a cool head. In turn, students learn to follow suit. So then, the goal is in view – a good leader views the situation as a whole, and also in part: Always be breaking the course down into manageable steps and making progress towards each part and the finish line. The course changes each day. It is not one race, but many sprints. A good leader is committed to excellence. Second best does not lead to the best success. The good leader not only maintains high standards, but is proactive to advance the goal forward in order to achieve excellence in all areas.","completion":"\\"Walk/Work your talk!\\" is a phrase that emphasizes the importance of leading with integrity and being a responsible leader. It highlights that true authority stems from a leader's respect for their purpose, good character, and trustworthiness. Leaders who are passionate and dedicated are more likely to inspire others, and by avoiding complaints and demeaning behavior towards their students, they can foster an environment of open communication and growth. A successful leader serves as a source of inspiration while also being an effective motivator. They can guide their students by providing direction, coaching, and encouragement, instead of forcing them to perform tasks. A key aspect of being a competent leader is being part of the team, working collaboratively towards a shared goal. Such leaders are unafraid to work hard and contribute to the team's efforts. During challenging times, people often turn to leaders for reassurance and stability. An effective leader remains level-headed in the face of uncertainties, emotional turmoil, and crises, thereby setting an example for their students to follow. This calm and collected approach helps leaders maintain focus on accomplishing the larger goals, while simultaneously breaking it down into smaller, achievable steps. Understanding that the journey to success is made up of many smaller milestones enables leaders to adapt and make progress consistently. A leader's commitment to excellence is crucial, as settling for second best hampers overall success. By holding themselves and their team to high standards, good leaders remain ambitious, proactive, and dedicated to achieving excellence. By embodying these essential qualities, a leader can inspire and motivate their team or students, leading them to greater success and fostering growth in every aspect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is unlikely that I will ever own a (genuine) Chanel handbag. However, a Chanel nail polish was definitely attainable. Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me. Then, Myers sent me a 10 voucher for my birthday and I got a 30 voucher for doing a survey so the decision was made. For 38 of my own money (less than the cost of two OPI's!) I became the proud owner of Peridot and Graphite. Here is my review of Graphite. Graphite is the most stunningly intriguing nail polish I have ever owned. In the bottle it looks a little bit dull and boring - grey and bland. But on the nail it is completely different. In some lights it is silvery, others a more gun metal grey, and in others it has almost a goldish tone to it. It is super sparkly, yet is not a glitter polish - though in saying that it appears more glitter than shimmer. It is quite opaque. Two coats and you can't see the nail line. In the photos below I have actually applied three coats (plus an addition two top coats of clear) because I was going to a wedding and I wanted it to be perfect. But ordinarily two would be sufficient. Question: How long did the writer argue with herself about whether to buy the Chanel nail polishes?

Given the question: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of.

Thomas Stearns Eliot, (26 September 1888 - 4 January 1965) was a British essayist, publisher, playwright, literary and social critic, and \\"one of the twentieth century's major poets\\". He moved from his native United States to England in 1914 at the age of 25, settling, working, and marrying there. He eventually became a British subject in 1927 at the age of 39, renouncing his American passport. Eliot attracted widespread attention for his poem \\"The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock\\" (1915), which was seen as a masterpiece of the Modernist movement. With the important exception of Four Quartets, Eliot directed much of his creative energies after Ash Wednesday to writing plays in verse, mostly comedies or plays with redemptive endings. He was long a critic and admirer of Elizabethan and Jacobean verse drama; witness his allusions to Webster, Thomas Middleton, William Shakespeare and Thomas Kyd in The Waste Land. In a 1933 lecture he said \\"Every poet would like, I fancy, to be able to think that he had some direct social utility . . . . He would like to be something of a popular entertainer, and be able to think his own thoughts behind a tragic or a comic mask. He would like to convey the pleasures of poetry, not only to a larger audience, but to larger groups of people collectively; and the theatre is the best place in which to do it.\\" After The Waste Land (1922), he wrote that he was \\"now feeling toward a new form and style\\". One project he had in mind was writing a play in verse, using some of the rhythms of early jazz. The play featured \\"Sweeney\\", a character who had appeared in a number of his poems. Although Eliot did not finish the play, he did publish two scenes from the piece. These scenes, titled Fragment of a Prologue (1926) and Fragment of an Agon (1927), were published together in 1932 as Sweeney Agonistes. Although Eliot noted that this was not intended to be a one-act play, it is sometimes performed as one. A pageant play by Eliot called The Rock was performed in 1934 for the benefit of churches in the Diocese of London. Much of it was a collaborative effort; Eliot accepted credit only for the authorship of one scene and the choruses. George Bell, the Bishop of Chichester, had been instrumental in connecting Eliot with producer E. Martin Browne for the production of The Rock, and later commissioned Eliot to write another play for the Canterbury Festival in 1935. This one, Murder in the Cathedral, concerning the death of the martyr, Thomas Becket, was more under Eliot's control. Eliot biographer Peter Ackroyd comments that \\"for [Eliot], Murder in the Cathedral and succeeding verse plays offered a double advantage; it allowed him to practice poetry but it also offered a convenient home for his religious sensibility.\\" After this, he worked on more \\"commercial\\" plays for more general audiences: The Family Reunion (1939), The Cocktail Party (1949), The Confidential Clerk, (1953) and The Elder Statesman (1958) (the latter three were produced by Henry Sherek and directed by E. Martin Browne). The Broadway production in New York of The Cocktail Party received the 1950 Tony Award for Best Play. Eliot wrote The Cocktail Party while he was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study. Regarding his method of playwriting, Eliot explained, \\"If I set out to write a play, I start by an act of choice. I settle upon a particular emotional situation, out of which characters and a plot will emerge. And then lines of poetry may come into being: not from the original impulse but from a secondary stimulation of the unconscious mind.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What other plays did he write?","completion":"Thomas Stearns Eliot wrote several plays in addition to \\"Murder in the Cathedral.\\" These include \\"The Family Reunion\\" (1939), \\"The Cocktail Party\\" (1949), \\"The Confidential Clerk\\" (1953), and \\"The Elder Statesman\\" (1958).

Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat. Still others lay the blame on the Americans, complaining that pounds have piled on thanks to eating too much American-style fast food. Some also blame their parents--their genes. But unfortunately, the parents are wronged because they're normal in shape, or rather slim. It's a similar story around the world, although people are relatively unlikely to have tried to lose weight. Parents are eager to see their kids shape up. Do as I say--not as I do. Question: The example of Finland is used to illustrate _ . - the cause of heart disease - the fashion of body shaping - the effectiveness of a campaign - the history of a body-conscious country The answer is:","completion":"the effectiveness of a campaign"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The stocky woman, wearing a knee-length lace dress and a deep yellow beret is blunt about why she, and other women, opt for a church birth with a traditional birth attendant rather than going to a maternity clinic. \\"They do fasting and prayer here, and if you are pregnant you need to go to the place where there is God and there is daily fasting and prayers. \\"At the hospital there is nothing like prayer. They don't pray. They only give you injections. But as you pray at the church, you get closer to God. \\"On the day of your delivery, God will help you and you will deliver successfully.\\" Ms Martin believes that the church and God will offer more protection than modern health facilities. Unfortunately, there are reports of many women dying while giving birth in the facilities provided by a church. \\"I have first-hand experience of pregnant women being rushed in at critical times when they can no longer be helped.\\" Dr Linda Ayade, the state governor's wife, is so concerned about the possible dangers of a church birth that she is campaigning to ban the practice, and is encouraging women to instead go to health centres to deliver their babies. She has been going from village to village across the state, trying to persuade expectant mothers. At a meeting in Uwanse village she speaks with passion in a local language, Efik, and the women are attentive, excited at being visited by a high-ranking official. Later, she explains her motivation: \\"I have worked in hospitals in Nigeria and I have first-hand experience of pregnant women being rushed in at critical times when they can no longer be helped. \\"Some are even confirmed dead on arrival, and it happens quite often. I have taken it as an obligation to save lives and reduce incidences of maternal mortality relating to child birth and delivery, knowing what it means for a mother to die and leaving children behind.\\" It may, however, take some time before everyone is won over, as child delivery is associated with deep-seated traditional beliefs. Dr Ayade's status does attract a crowd to her meetings, but prayer sessions are also packed out. At the Land of Promise church, a congregation of mostly pregnant women sings and prays, asking God to intervene and deliver their babies at the appointed time. Attached to the prayer hall is the room where the women will give birth - it is small and dirty and lit by a paraffin lamp. Sister Indoreyin Sambhor is the pastor and the church's traditional birth attendant. The short, middle-aged woman says delivering babies is a tradition in her family handed down from mother to daughter. \\"This is the work that God gave me to do. From my youth, I helped my mother to deliver babies. God has been helping me, and God will not allow anything dangerous or evil to happen. \\"I pray with the mothers and my followers can testify about my skills... Every pregnant woman that has come to me has delivered safely and gone home with their children.\\" \\"God has been helping me, and God will not allow anything dangerous or evil to happen. I pray with the mothers and my followers can testify about my skills.\\" \\"God has been helping us so I don't even believe that there can be complications in children delivery.\\" Twenty-six-year-old Mercy Martin Udofia, in her eighth month of pregnancy, is a follower of Sister Indoreyin. The dark-skinned woman, wearing a tight-fitting dress that shows her bulging tummy, says she gave birth to her first child in this church, and she will come back for a second time. \\"As a child of God, you do not stay idle, you have to be closer to God. So that as a pregnant woman, when it comes to the time of delivery, everything will be easy for you.\\" But things are not always so rosy. A woman recently died while giving birth to twins at a church in the Burrow Pit suburb of Calabar. A relative of the deceased said she passed away following complications arising from a retained placenta which the traditional birth attendant could not deal with. The twins survived and are currently being treated at a hospital in Calabar. The authorities are taking action to deal with the issue. Head of the state primary health agency Betta Edu says the state government will soon be passing a law aimed at stopping pregnant women giving birth in churches and seeing traditional birth attendants. She thinks that many traditional birth attendants tell women that hospitals and health centres only carry out caesareans, and some of them could die as a result of heavy bleeding. With such fears at the back of their minds, they see the birth attendants as the best choice, as they are both closer to God and have the traditional skills to help them deliver safely. But Dr Edu argues that the practice will die out with a change in the law and the building of new health centres in every community. All those involved in trying to change attitudes recognise that a lot of work still needs to be done. \\"Our people are deeply religious, and some of them are so deep in the traditional practise that it's usually very difficult to shrug them off,\\" Dr Ayade says. \\"We need to educate them, encourage them and even entice them.\\"","completion":"In southern Nigeria, many pregnant women choose to give birth in churches under the guidance of traditional birth attendants rather than at maternity clinics. These women believe that prayer and God offer more protection than modern health facilities. However, there are instances of women dying while giving birth in church facilities. Dr. Linda Ayade, the state governor's wife, is campaigning to ban this practice and encourage women to go to health centers for delivery. She has been visiting villages to persuade pregnant women to seek professional medical care. Child delivery in Nigeria is deeply rooted in traditional beliefs, making it difficult to change mindsets, but Dr. Ayade believes education, encouragement, and building new health centers can help.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: When it comes to playing spin the bottle, the very first thing you'll need is other people (unless you want to play by yourself, which would be a pretty sad sight). To begin, find a group of willing friends — the more the merrier! Try to get a group that contains people of both genders so that there are a range of many different combinations of people who can potentially kiss. Make sure your friends know what they are getting into before you start playing. Kissing is something that's usually reserved for people who really like each other, so forcing people to kiss who don't want to can be really embarrassing for everyone involved. Don't pressure anyone into playing with you who doesn't want to. When everyone is ready (and willing) to play, arrange yourselves in a circle so that you're all facing inward. Traditionally, this is done on the floor, though there's no reason you can't also do it standing or sitting around a table. Regardless of exactly how you arrange your group in a circle, it's usually best to pick a spot with a tough, hard surface, like a section of hardwood floor. This ensures that the bottle you use can spin well without scuffing or damaging the floor. When you're all ready to play, pick one person to start the game. This person grabs a bottle (or, really, any similarly spin-able object, like a pen, glass, key, etc.) and spins it hard in the middle of the circle of players. After it starts spinning, no one may touch the bottle until it comes to a complete stop. If you're unsure of how to decide who should spin the bottle first, you may want to try letting the oldest or youngest play go first or having one person think of a random number and starting with the person who guesses closest to it. When the bottle comes to a stop, its \\"neck\\" (the end that opens) should be pointing at someone sitting in the circle. The person who spun the bottle has to kiss this person! If you're not using a bottle, designate one end of the object you're using as the pointing end. For instance, if you're using a pen, you might want to use the writing end of the pen as its \\"point\\". If you spin the bottle and it lands on you, spin again. That's really all there is to it! After one person has spun the bottle and given a kiss to the person the bottle ends up pointing at, the person next to him or her in the circle gives the bottle a spin and gives a kiss to the person his or her spin lands on. Play proceeds in one direction — either clockwise or counter-clockwise. Note that sometimes the bottle will end up pointing at the space between two people — in this case, you may want to make the spinner kiss the person that the bottle's point is closest to. Additionally, the bottle may end up pointing at someone that you're not comfortable kissing because of your romantic preferences (for instance, if you're attracted to boys and it lands on a girl). In this case, you may want to kiss the person of the appropriate gender who's closest to the bottle's point. Congratulations! You've learned how to play spin the bottle. This fun and easy game is best enjoyed with a light-hearted attitude from all involved. Don't let things get too romantic or sexual — it's just a game, and one which can become pretty awkward pretty fast if it's taken too seriously. However, if you do feel that telltale \\"spark\\" with someone after playing the game, there's no reason why you shouldn't make a point to get to know him or her after the game! Spin the bottle is great for igniting new connections you might not otherwise have made. Summary:","completion":"Spin the bottle is a traditional game played with friends, usually involving kissing between the participants. To play, gather a group of people, ideally with diverse gender representation, and make sure everyone is comfortable participating. Arrange the group in a circle, either sitting on a hard surface or standing, and determine the order of play by either picking the oldest, youngest, or using a random number method. One person starts by spinning a bottle (or any spin-able object) in the center of the circle. When the bottle stops spinning, the person it points to is the one to be kissed by the spinner. To maintain a fun and light-hearted atmosphere, it's crucial to avoid pressuring anyone into participating and respect personal boundaries. In cases where the bottle points between two people or to someone the spinner is not comfortable kissing due to romantic preferences, the spinner can choose the person closest to the bottle's point in the desired gender. The game proceeds in one direction, either clockwise or counter-clockwise, with each person taking a turn spinning the bottle and kissing the person it points to. Enjoy the game as a casual and entertaining activity, but also feel free to pursue any connections that may arise outside of the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Donald Trump told a group of Republican lawmakers at a meeting Tuesday he backs a pair of their immigration bills under consideration in the House of Representatives. The meeting came as criticism continued over the Trump administration's policy of separating children from their parents and other adults at the southern border with Mexico as they illegally enter the United States. In his remarks to lawmakers, according to White House principal deputy press secretary Raj Shah, Trump \\"endorsed both House immigration bills that build the wall, close legal loopholes, cancel the visa lottery, curb so-called \\"chain migration,\\" and solve the border crisis and family separation issue by allowing for family detention and removal.\\" Republican Rep.

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: who was the partnership between?","completion":"The partnership was between Rockefeller, Maurice B.

Movie plot: In the year 1900, a depressed writer named Christian begins writing on his typewriter (\\"Nature Boy\\"). One year earlier, Christian moved to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He encounters performers led by Toulouse-Lautrec; his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge. The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Lady Marmalade/Zidler's Rap (Can Can)/Smells Like Teen Spirit\\"). Toulouse arranges for Christian to see Satine, the star courtesan, in her private quarters to present the work, unaware that Zidler is promising Satine to the wealthy and unscrupulous Duke of Monroth, a potential investor in the cabaret (\\"Sparkling Diamonds\\" medley). Satine mistakes Christian for the Duke, and dances with him before retiring to her private chamber with him to discuss things privately (\\"Rhythm of the Night), but soon learns he is just a writer; by this time Christian has fallen in love with her (\\"Your Song\\"). The Duke interrupts them; Christian and Satine claim they were practicing lines for \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\". With Zidler's help, Toulouse and the rest of the troupe pitch the show to the Duke with an improvised plot about an evil maharajah attempting to woo an Indian courtesan who loves a poor sitar player (\\"The Pitch (Spectacular Spectacular)\\").

This storyline is concocted during the pitch to the Duke of Monroth, the potential investor in the cabaret, who agrees to back the show with the condition that only he gets to see Satine, the star courtesan at the heart of the narrative. The story of the Indian courtesan and the poor sitar player serves as a parallel to the unfolding love affair between Christian, the writer, and Satine, who he falls in love with. Their secret liaison has a similar struggle like the characters in the improvised plot, as they have to hide their love affair from the Duke, who becomes suspicious and jealous. The film, Moulin Rouge!, combines this fiction within fiction with vibrant and energetic musical performances, iconic design elements, and complex character relationships.

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band? is inside the article: The Mothers of Invention played in New York in late 1966 and were offered a contract at the Garrick Theater (at 152 Bleecker Street, above the Cafe au Go Go) during Easter 1967. This proved successful and Herb Cohen extended the booking, which eventually lasted half a year. As a result, Zappa and his wife, along with the Mothers of Invention, moved to New York. Their shows became a combination of improvised acts showcasing individual talents of the band as well as tight performances of Zappa's music. Everything was directed by Zappa using hand signals. Guest performers and audience participation became a regular part of the Garrick Theater shows. One evening, Zappa managed to entice some U.S. Marines from the audience onto the stage, where they proceeded to dismember a big baby doll, having been told by Zappa to pretend that it was a \\"gook baby\\".Zappa uniquely contributed to the avant-garde, anti-establishment music scene of the 1960s, sampling radio tape recordings and incorporating his own philosophical ideals to music and freedom of expression in his pieces. Bands such as AMM and Faust also contributed to the radio sampling techniques of the 1960s. Situated in New York, and only interrupted by the band's first European tour, the Mothers of Invention recorded the album widely regarded as the peak of the group's late 1960s work, We're Only in It for the Money (released 1968). It was produced by Zappa, with Wilson credited as executive producer. From then on, Zappa produced all albums released by the Mothers of Invention and as a solo artist. We're Only in It for the Money featured some of the most creative audio editing and production yet heard in pop music, and the songs ruthlessly satirized the hippie and flower power phenomena. He sampled plundered surf music in We're only in It for the Money, as well as the Beatles' tape work from their song Tomorrow Never Knows. The cover photo parodied that of the Beatles' Sgt.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to answer the given multiple-choice question on the physics. Classify your answers into 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e'. Problem:Problem: a alone can finish a work in 10 days which b alone can finish in 15 days . if they work together and finish it , then out of a total wages of rs . 3000 , a will get : Options: a ) rs . 1200 , b ) rs . 1500 , c ) rs . 1800 , d ) rs . 2000 , e ) none of these Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Determine the individual work rates. If 'a' can finish the work in 10 days, their work rate is 1/10 of the work per day. If 'b' can finish the work in 15 days, their work rate is 1/15 of the work per day. Step 2: Calculate their combined work rate. When they work together, their combined work rate is the sum of their individual work rates: (1/10 + 1/15) Step 3: Simplify the combined work rate. To simplify, find the least common denominator (LCD) which is 30 in this case: [(3/30) + (2/30)] = 5/30 The combined work rate when they work together is 5/30 or 1/6 of the work per day. Step 4: Calculate the ratio of their work rates. To determine how much each person should get paid based on their work rate, we need to find the ratio of their work rates: a's work rate : b's work rate = (1/10) : (1/15) Step 5: Simplify the ratio. To simplify, multiply each side by the LCD (30): [(1/10)*30] : [(1/15)*30] = 3 : 2 Hence, the ratio of their work rates is 3:2. Step 6: Distribute the wages based on the ratio. Now, we need to distribute the total wages of Rs. 3000 based on the ratio 3:2. Step 7: Find the shares of 'a' and 'b'. Let x represent the share of 'a' and y represent the share of 'b'. According to the ratio, x/y = 3/2, and x + y = 3000. Step 8: Solve the equations. We can solve the equations to find the shares of 'a' and 'b': x/y = 3/2 -> x = (3/2)y x + y = 3000 -> (3/2)y + y = 3000 Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction: 3y + 2y = 6000 -> 5y = 6000 Divide both sides by 5 to get the value of y: y = 1200 Now substitute the value of y back into the equation for x: x = (3/2)y -> x = (3/2)*1200 -> x = 1800 Step 9: Verify the answer. 'a' will receive Rs. 1800, and 'b' will receive Rs. 1200. The total wages are still Rs. 3000, so our answer is correct. Answer: c) Rs. 1800"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

The 33-year-old, the winner of the 2007 Hong Kong Open, carded a best-of-the-day eight-under-par 64 to finish on 271 (-17), level with joint overnight leader Lynn -- who posted a 68 for his final 18 holes. The pair finished three strokes clear of Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round before falling away with a 71, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell (69). However, on the first extra hole,","completion":"the par-four 18th, it was Lara who kept his nerve and secured the win with a solid par as Lynn agonizingly bogeyed after finding the greenside bunker with his approach shot. This victory not only marks Lara's second European Tour title but also demonstrates the Spaniard's tremendous grit and determination to excel amidst intense competition. Despite starting the final round four shots behind the leaders, Lara produced an exceptional display of golf to close the gap and eventually force a playoff with Lynn. His round of 64, which included nine birdies and just one dropped shot, underlines the impressive form he displayed throughout the day. It is worth noting that Lara's triumph did not come as a complete surprise, given that he was previously successful at the 2007 Hong Kong Open, where he showed his capability to perform at the highest level. In contrast, Lynn, the joint overnight leader, managed a respectable round of 68, which consisted of six birdies and two bogeys. However, it wasn't enough to keep Lara at bay and deny him the coveted Austrian Open title. Despite the setback, Lynn's performance throughout the tournament demonstrates a high level of skill and consistency, which will undoubtedly serve as a source of motivation for future competitions. Finishing three strokes behind Lara and Lynn were a strong group of contenders, including Sweden's Alexander Noren, England's Danny Willet, and European Ryder Cup star Graeme McDowell. Noren carded a final-round 67, while Willet, who led with Lynn after the third round, slipped to a 71. Meanwhile, McDowell managed a respectable 69, ensuring a solid end to his tournament campaign. This group, rich in talent and skill, served to intensify the battle for the Austrian Open title and kept the pressure on the eventual winner, Lara. The playoff at the end of the Austrian Open is emblematic of the competitiveness present in modern professional golf. The ability to perform at an elite level, under immense pressure, and in a sudden-death situation highlights the mental fortitude and physical prowess of these athletes. Lara's triumph in Atzenbrugg will serve as a reminder and inspiration to both seasoned professionals and aspiring golfers alike that success is often the result of defying the odds and fighting until the very end. In conclusion, Jose Manuel Lara's victory in the Austrian Open marks a significant achievement in his career, adding to his 2007 Hong Kong Open win. By overcoming a formidable field of competitors and forcing a playoff with the talented David Lynn, Lara has once again proven his mettle on the European Tour. This thrilling competition not only showcases the skill and intensity of professional golf but also serves as a testament to the resilience and determination required to excel in this elite sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fleming (John Forsythe) while arguing the case of Jeff McCullaugh (Thomas G. Waites). McCullagh was stopped for a minor traffic offence, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and has already spent a year and a half in jail; Fleming has repeatedly stymied Kirkland's efforts to have the case reviewed. Though there is strong new evidence that Jeff is innocent, Fleming refuses McCullaugh's appeal due to its late submission and leaves him in prison. After being released, Arthur takes another case, that of a transgender Ralph Agee (Robert Christian), arrested for small crime and becoming a victim of the legal system. Arthur pays regular visits to his grandfather Sam (Lee Strasberg) in a nursing home, who is progressively becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age, and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer (Christine Lahti). Arthur has a friendly relationship with Judge Francis Rayford (Jack Warden), who takes him on a hair-raising ride in his personal helicopter, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while a terrified Arthur begs him to land. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is borderline suicidal and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse, a 1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times, and eats his lunch on the ledge outside his office window, four stories up.

A sickly Mina Van Helsing (Jan Francis), who is visiting her friend Lucy Seward (Kate Nelligan), discovers Dracula's body after his ship has run aground. The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have.

Florida came out on top over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. \\"We need a playoff,\\" Obama told reporters after being asked about Florida's 24-14 victory over Oklahoma in Thursday night's BCS championship game. \\"If I'm Utah, or if I'm USC or if I'm Texas, I might still have some quibbles.\\" Since its inception in 1998, the NCAA's Bowl Championship Series has weathered criticism from nearly all directions. The BCS is the system that chooses the contenders for college football's most prominent postseason games: the Fiesta, Orange, Rose and Sugar bowls, as well the National Championship game, which this year put Oklahoma against Florida. In 2008, legislators -- for one reason or another -- drafted legislation to invalidate the","completion":"BCS and push for a playoff system as the preferred method to determine college football's national champion. Proponents of the playoff system argue that it would create a more even playing field, offering teams from smaller conferences and schools a better chance to prove themselves and compete for the ultimate title. Critics of the BCS, including Obama himself, declared that the current system often leads to unfair outcomes, as it relies heavily on polls, computer rankings, and a myriad of other factors that do not necessarily reflect a team's true capabilities or achievements on the field. Those in favor of maintaining the BCS argue that it helps preserve the longstanding tradition of college football bowl games, which often generate significant revenue for the participating schools and create exciting matchup opportunities for fans. Furthermore, proponents of the BCS suggest that it provides stability and predictability to the college football landscape by clearly specifying a set of criteria that teams must meet in order to qualify for one of the prestigious BCS bowl games. However, the anti-BCS sentiment has gained significant traction over the years, leading to heated debates among politicians, sports figures, and fans alike. Advocates for change assert that the BCS system creates an oligarchy of power in college football, where only a select few schools and conferences benefit from the system's structure, leaving smaller and less prominent athletic programs perpetually disadvantaged. Some of the suggested alternatives to the BCS include an eight or sixteen-team playoff, which would see the top teams in the nation compete in a single-elimination tournament to determine the national champion. In this model, the winning team would have to demonstrate their prowess and consistency on the field by defeating a series of challengers in head-to-head matchups, rather than relying on the subjective opinions and calculations that help shape BCS rankings. While the playoff system has garnered widespread support, it has also encountered resistance from those who worry that it might dilute the significance and appeal of regular-season games. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential impact on student-athletes' educational commitments and the possibility of extending the season, which could lead to increased risk of player injuries. In summary, the debate over the BCS system and the need for a playoff system in college football is one that is driven by differing opinions on what constitutes a fair and equitable means of determining a national champion. While the BCS has succeeded in generating revenue and maintaining certain aspects of college football tradition, it has also been criticized as an exclusive and flawed approach to evaluating a team's worthiness for championship contention. As public opinion continues to shift, it remains to be seen whether a playoff system will eventually be implemented, providing a chance for more schools to vie for the prestigious title of National Champion. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, it is clear that passionate college football fans, players, administrators, and even President-elect Obama will continue to fight for what they believe is the best path forward for the beloved sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They travel to planets inserting themselves into a host body of that planet's dominant species while suppressing the host's consciousness. They access the host's memories, and occupied hosts are identifiable by silver rings in the hosts' eyes. A human on the run, Melanie Stryder, is captured and infused with a soul called \\"Wanderer.\\" Wanderer is asked by Seeker to access Melanie's memories in order to discover the location of a pocket of unassimilated humans. Melanie's consciousness, however, has not been completely eliminated, and it struggles to regain control of her body. Melanie and Wanderer carry out an internal conversation and debate with each other, forming a friendship. Wanderer shares with Seeker that Melanie was traveling with her brother, Jamie, and her boyfriend, Jared Howe, to find Melanie's uncle Jeb in the desert. Wanderer admits that Melanie is still present, so Seeker decides to be transferred into Melanie's body to get the information herself. With the help of Melanie, Wanderer escapes and makes her way to the desert, where she is found by Jeb, who takes her to a series of caves hidden inside a mountain where the humans (including Jared and Jamie) are hiding. Wanderer's presence is met with hostility by all but Jeb and Jamie. Melanie instructs Wanderer not to tell anyone she is still alive, since it would provoke them, though she later allows her to tell Jamie. Wanderer begins interacting with the humans and slowly begins to gain their trust, forming a bond with Ian O'Shea. Seeker leads a search party into the desert to find Wanderer. They intercept one of the shelter's supply teams, and in the ensuing chase, Aaron and Brandt commit suicide to avoid capture. During the chase, Seeker accidentally kills another Soul, leading her superiors to call off the search. Returning to the caves, Jared and Kyle move to kill Wanderer, causing Jamie to reveal that Melanie's consciousness is alive. Jeb and Ian accept this, but... The answer is:","completion":"Seeker's superiors called off the search to find Wanderer because Seeker accidentally killed another Soul during the chase.

Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. Question: What will likely happen when the teacher finishes her instructions?

But the identity of \\"Jihadi John\\" remained a mystery -- until Thursday, when two U.S. officials and two U.S. congressional sources confirmed it. The man, the officials said, is Mohammed Emwazi, a Kuwaiti-born Londoner. The officials, who've been briefed on the matter, spoke to CNN after a Washington Post report first revealed Emwazi's identity.

Even with a name and face for the man behind the mask, uncertainty still swirled Thursday. London police and British officials declined to confirm his identity.

So how can we know what food is healthy? Unluckily, a lot of food that looks good may have pollution. Where is the pollution from? It has something to do with how people produce food: growing it on the farm, processing it in factories, and making it ready for you to eat. Here's what happens: Most farmers use chemicals to stop their crops from getting sick. Many of these chemicals remain in the food that you eat. Some people believe this may cause cancer. These chemicals may also pollute water and air, and kill animals and even people by accident. Most drinks are just flavored water . Every drink coming in plastic bottles which you then throw away means a waste. Sugary drinks make you fat. In the factories, much of what you eat and drink gets messed.

When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see.

So, we'll add 457 and 1133: 457 + 1133 = 1590 Now our equation looks like this: 1590 * b + 23939 = -30121 It's time to get \\"b\\" all alone on one side. To do that, we need to move 23939 to the other side of the equals sign. We do this by subtracting 23939 from both sides: -30121 - 23939 = -54060 Now our equation looks like this: 1590 * b = -54060 The last step is to find out what \\"b\\" is.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighbors attended the same school. Mike learned about biology while Dan learned more about the weather. They both were among the best in the school.

Hint: A red giant star is a star with a mass like the Sun that is in the last phase of its life, when Hydrogen fusion reactions in the core decrease due to the lack of fuel. With the gravitational collapse of the core, the fusion reactions now occur in a shell surrounding the core. The outer layer of the star expands enormously up to 1000 times the size of the Sun. When the Sun becomes a red giant, its volume will include the orbit of Mercury and Venus and maybe even Earth. The increased size increases the luminosity even though the outer layer cools to only 3000 K or so. The cooler outer layer causes it to be a red star.

In recent years, the world has seen a rapid advancement in technology, particularly in the area of internet usage and online platforms. While this has brought numerous benefits to society, it has also unfortunately provided an avenue for potential harm to vulnerable individuals, especially children. As a result, it has become crucial to review and update existing policies and regulations to better protect young users from potential dangers, such as child sexual exploitation and grooming by pedophiles. One of the primary steps that can be taken to enhance the protection of children online is raising awareness among parents and other caregivers. They should be educated on how to identify potential risks, recognize signs of online grooming, and establish open communication lines with their children about internet safety. Additionally, parents should be encouraged to apply basic rules, including limiting screen time, adjusting privacy settings, and using age-appropriate content filters. Moreover, it is essential to invest in the development of advanced technologies that can automatically detect and block explicit content, inappropriate communication, and predators' online activities. Internet service providers, social media platforms, and other online services should be encouraged to adopt such advanced technologies to safeguard their users' welfare, especially that of children. Furthermore, law enforcement agencies should be provided with the necessary resources and training to tackle online exploitation of children. This includes the development of best practices for online investigations, international cooperation to apprehend perpetrators, and strategic partnerships with technology companies to dismantle criminal networks. Education is another crucial aspect in combatting the risk of pedophiles targeting children online. Schools, in partnership with parents and community organizations, should implement comprehensive digital citizenship and internet safety programs as part of their curriculum. These programs should focus on teaching children about responsible online behavior, personal information protection, and reporting suspicious or inappropriate encounters. Finally, governments should review and update existing legal frameworks to ensure that online sexual exploitation and grooming of children are criminalized and that perpetrators are effectively prosecuted. This may include implementing stricter penalties, promoting international legal cooperation, and establishing specialized courts or units to handle such cases. In conclusion, the growing prevalence of new technologies has opened the door to novel risks and forms of exploitation, particularly for children. To counter these evolving threats and protect young users online, it is imperative that governments and society as a whole take decisive action in updating and implementing robust measures to provide a safer online experience for children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem.

Predators are animals that hunt and consume other animals for their survival and nourishment.

Since Team A focused their study on predators, they would have gained more knowledge and insights about the wolf population, their ecological role, hunting patterns, and behaviors, compared to Team B which focused on grazers (herbivorous animals).

Step 1: Assess the situation The first step in continuing the story is to assess the situation and identify the main problem. The main issue in this case is that the Smiths are unable to fit their furniture into the van because it is too large. Step 2: Identify possible solutions The next step is to think about possible solutions that the characters in the story might consider. In this case, the potential solutions include: a) Disassembling the furniture to make it fit in the van. b) Renting a larger van. c) Selling or donating the large furniture and acquiring new furniture in their new home. d) Asking friends or neighbors for help. Step 3: Choose the most logical solution In order to make the story more believable, I would choose a solution that is logical and feasible. In this scenario, the best option would be to disassemble the furniture, if possible. Disassembling the furniture can make it easier to fit in the moving van, and will also minimize the need for additional expenses such as renting a larger van or buying new furniture. Step 4: Write the continuation of the story Mrs. Smith looked at the van and then at the oversized furniture, feeling a sense of frustration.

Mr. Smith used his Tetris skills, continuously reorganizing the van to make every item fit as efficiently as possible.

This copy may not be in its final form and may be updated. Watch \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\" weeknights at 8 p.m. and 11 p.m. ET! O'REILLY: Continuing now with our lead story. The Obama administration objecting to critical reporting of it. Speaking on the radio today, former Clinton advisor Lanny Davis said that while he was writing a column his editor was threatened by the Obama Administration. DAVIS: He received a phone call from a senior Obama White House official who didn't like some of my columns, even though I'm a supporter of him, I couldn't imagine why this call was made. And he did threaten and the word I was told was the word \\"threaten\\" by this editor that if he continued to run my columns, he would lose or his reporters would lose their White House credentials. O'REILLY: And joining us now from Washington is Mr. Davis. So first of all, what do you think teed off the Obama Administration? What did you write about them? DAVIS: You know I went back to read my columns 95 percent of them were supporting President Obama. I'm guess that I criticized at times their handling of the stories. The crisis management sides of the communication shop and I think that might have gotten under the skin of the person who made the phone call. O'REILLY: All right. Now, who is the White House guy who threatened the editor? DAVIS: I can't tell that you because the editor when he called me said I have to ask you to honor the request that you never mention the name of the person who called me because he said it was off the record. So I talk to the editor -- O'REILLY: Ok so let me get this straight. So -- so let me get this straight your editor agreed to be threatened and not to publicize who is doing the threat? That doesn't sound right. That doesn't sound right to me man. I have been a reporter for more than 35 years. I don't give anybody off the record credence if they are going to threaten me. Do you know what I'm talking about? DAVIS: Well, he asked me to keep it anonymous and I have got to honor that. O'REILLY: All right, you're an honorable man. Ok. Now, you were in -- Clinton White House. I mean, they did the same thing Bill and Hillary they don't like people criticizing them, did they? DAVIS: Look, there is nothing wrong with pushing back as Ed Henry said. And I don't think Gene Sperling -- I accept your interpretation -- intended it to be a threat. But he should have been on the White House lawn yesterday saying you know I used the word you're going to regret it I respect Bob Woodward he's a great reporter. We have a disagreement. And I apologize if there was a misinterpretation. This story -- I wouldn't be on tonight if they had done it yesterday. But waiting is another example of crisis mismanagement. O'REILLY: No but it's more than that. Plouffe goes and Twitters that Woodward is a has-been. Come on. DAVIS: I can't figure that -- David Plouffe is a pro. Why in god's name would he take on an icon, one of the great reporters of our age and still doing. O'REILLY: But he did it, I don't know why did he it but he did it. Now you dodged my question -- you dodged my question very neatly, Lanny. But you know you can't slip it by me. Bill and Hillary Clinton if they criticize them they do the same thing. DAVIS: Ok so Bill and Hillary Clinton as far as I know never threatened a reporter. They were unhappy with critical reporting -- every White House is. Reagan, Carter, Clinton, Bush -- there isn't a single White House that loves the White House reporters. But I never was aware of anybody being threatened. And I accept Gene Sperling's explanation he didn't intend that but no I don't believe he intended anything like that. O'REILLY: All right, do you believe based on your personal experience that the Obama Administration is more sensitive than the other people and overreacts to media criticism? Do you believe that? DAVIS: No. They are no different than any other White House which is sensitive to criticism and sometimes has individuals acting stupidly. This one individual who called my editor made some very serious threats against me professionally. I called several people at the White House and 48 hours later I was told it's over it will never happen again. O'REILLY: But you're still protecting this weasel. DAVIS: I have to under the obligation of my -- O'REILLY: You have to protect the weasel? All right. O'REILLY: Why don't you tell us somebody else -- tell us somebody and have them call me.

Article: A lot of management training each year for Circle K Corporation, a national chain of convenience stores. Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed.

Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for general lighting service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products.

News article: Bill Clinton Presses Senators to Pass Health Bill WASHINGTON -- Former President Bill Clinton came to Capitol Hill Tuesday to underline for Democrats the political consequences of failing to pass a health overhaul, saying doing nothing was the worst outcome. Bill Clinton, right, is accompanied by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse as he heads to a lunch with Senate Democrats at the Capitol on Tuesday. Mr. Clinton spoke as both sides in the Senate braced for a battle on the floor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) said Tuesday that once Senate debate begins, Republicans would offer \\"a lot of amendments\\" on subjects from abortion to immigration to a government-run insurance plan. \\"This is a big bill,\\" Mr. McConnell told reporters. \\"The majority seeks to take over one-sixth of our economy.\\" The appearance by Mr. Clinton, whose own attempt at a health bill failed 15 years ago, reflected the urgency Democrats feel to maintain the momentum behind the bill following its narrow House passage Saturday and signs of a tempestuous debate ahead in the Senate. Some Democrats remain skeptical about the legislation. \\"Failure could be passing a bad bill,\\" said Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska. Mr. Clinton spoke to a closed-door meeting of Senate Democrats as party leaders were struggling to contain a growing number of conflicting demands and ultimatums from senators. \\"It's not important to be perfect here. It's important to act, to move, to start the ball rolling,\\" Mr. Clinton said afterward. \\"And whatever they can get the votes for, I'm going to support.\\" As costs have risen, attempts at change Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D., Nev.) has submitted a Senate version to the Congressional Budget Office for a cost estimate. Once the CBO issues its report, probably by week's end, the bill would be cleared to come to the Senate floor. But Democrats need 60 votes -- every Democrat and the Senate's two independents -- simply to begin debate. And it isn't clear they have those votes yet. Mr. Nelson says he won't support starting debate on a bill that doesn't contain strong language restricting federal funding of abortion. Sen. Joseph Lieberman, a Connecticut independent who caucuses with the Democrats, says he won't support a package that includes a government-administered health plan to compete with private insurers. Democratic leaders want their members to refrain from making non-negotiable demands, fearing that will undercut the bill before it even comes to the floor. If the Senate begins considering the bill, Democratic leaders hope the ensuing amendments and horse-trading will produce legislation that eases many senators' concerns. \\"It's critically important that individual senators refrain from laying down markers, because you could then get to a point where it becomes very difficult to see this bill moving forward,\\" said Sen.

Because he went to a military school, attended some college, and had some flight experience, Tibbets qualified for the Aviation Cadet Training Program. On 25 February 1937, he enlisted in the army at Fort Thomas, Kentucky, and was sent to Randolph Field in San Antonio, Texas, for primary and basic flight instruction. During his training, he showed himself to be an above-average pilot. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant and received his pilot rating in 1938 at Kelly Field in San Antonio. After graduation, Tibbets was assigned to the 16th Observation Squadron, which was based at Lawson Field, Georgia, with a flight supporting the Infantry School at nearby Fort Benning. It was at Fort Benning that Tibbets met Lucy Frances Wingate, then a clerk at a department store in Columbus, Georgia. The two quietly married in a Roman Catholic seminary in Holy Trinity, Alabama on June 19, 1938. Tibbets did not inform his family or his commanding officer, and the couple arranged for the notice to be kept out of the local newspaper. They had two sons. Paul III was born in 1940, in Columbus, Georgia, and graduated from Huntingdon College and Auburn University. He was a colonel in the United States Army Reserves and worked as a hospital pharmacist. He died in West Monroe, Louisiana, in 2016. The younger son, Gene Wingate Tibbets, was born in 1944, and was at the time of his death in 2012 residing in Georgiana in Butler County in southern Alabama. While Tibbets was stationed at Fort Benning, he was promoted to first lieutenant and served as a personal pilot for Brigadier General George S. Patton, Jr., in 1940 and 1941. In June 1941, Tibbets transferred to the 9th Bombardment Squadron of the 3d Bombardment Group at Hunter Field, Savannah, Georgia, as the engineering officer, and flew the A-20 Havoc. While there he was promoted to captain. In December 1941, he received orders to join the 29th Bombardment Group at MacDill Field, Florida, for training on the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress. On 7 December 1941, Tibbets heard about the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor while listening to the radio during a routine flight. Due to fears that German U-Boats might enter Tampa Bay and bombard MacDill Field, the 29th Bombardment Group moved to Savannah. Tibbets remained on temporary duty with the 3d Bombardment Group, forming an anti-submarine patrol at Pope Army Airfield, North Carolina, with 21 B-18 Bolo medium bombers.

We are given: Rate (R) = 4% per annum Time (T) = 8 years Interest (I) = P - 204 (since the interest is Rs. 204 less than the sum lent) We need to find the principal amount (P). Using the formula for simple interest, we have: I = P * R * T Substitute the given values and the expression for I: P - 204 = P * (4/100) * 8 Now, we need to solve this equation for P. Divide both sides by 8: (P - 204) / 8 = P * (1/25) Cross-multiply: (P - 204) * 25 = P * 8 Distribute the 25 on the left side: 25P - 5100 = 8P Subtract 8P from both sides: 17P = 5100 Now, divide both sides by 17 to find P: P = 5100 / 17 P = 300 So, the sum lent was Rs. 300, making the correct answer choice 'c' (300)."},{"prompt":"Information: - The 25th Cannes Film Festival was held on May 419, 1972.

Question: SEOUL — North Korea’s recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea’s nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North’s unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. “He'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.” Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North’s insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why does Trump want North Korea to denuclearize?

In November 2007, a significant financial milestone was achieved as a budget surplus of 0.1 billion dollars (100 million dollars) was recorded. This represented a positive development in the country's financial status, as it showcased the government's ability to generate more revenue than its total expenditures during that particular month. It is important to note, however, that this surplus was lower compared to the figure recorded in November 2006, which stood at 0.5 billion dollars (500 million dollars). To understand the context of this budget surplus, it would be useful to consider the contributing factors that led to this achievement. Some of these factors could include improved economic growth, efficient fiscal management, and the implementation of appropriate monetary policies. Moreover, this milestone also highlights the importance of proper economic planning and evaluation, which allows the government to allocate its resources effectively and minimize any potential wastage. Another significant aspect to consider is the potential impact of this budget surplus on the nation's overall financial health. For example, the surplus can be used to pay down existing debt, invest in critical infrastructure, or be kept as a rainy-day fund to prepare for any future financial crises or downturns. Furthermore, a budget surplus sends a positive signal to investors and international organizations, as it is often seen as an indicator of a healthy and well-managed economy. However, it is also crucial to understand that a budget surplus does not necessarily guarantee financial stability or economic prosperity indefinitely. Governments must continue to be diligent in their fiscal planning and ensure that the policies and measures put in place are sustainable and will continue to yield positive results in the long term. In conclusion, the budget surplus of 0.1 billion dollars recorded in November 2007 signifies a noteworthy accomplishment that highlights the effectiveness of various fiscal management strategies employed by the government at the time. Despite being smaller than the surplus of the previous year, it still marked a positive development in the nation's financial landscape. Such achievements highlight the importance of continuous evaluation, efficient resource allocation, and prudent policy implementation to maintain and enhance a country's financial stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Produced by Roger Pusey, and assisted by Ted De Bono, this version of the song was first included on the 1984 compilation Hatful of Hollow. On 28 October 1983, the \\"Manchester\\" version was released in the UK in 7\\" and 12\\" formats, reaching number 25 in the UK charts. The record sleeve uses a still frame from Jean Cocteau's 1949 film Orphée, featuring French actor Jean Marais. The song was later included as a bonus track on the cassette version of the band's debut album The Smiths in the UK, and subsequently on all American versions. Following the 1989 bankruptcy of Rough Trade, WEA Records purchased the Smiths' back catalogue. In 1992 WEA re-issued the band's catalogue, and all subsequent pressings of The Smiths have incorporated \\"This Charming Man\\". WEA re-released the single itself in 1992 to support the Best... I compilation album. The reissued single reached number 8 on the British singles chart, the band's highest chart placing.In December 1983, DJ François Kevorkian released a \\"New York\\" mix of the single on Megadisc records. Kevorkian geared the song for nightclub dancefloors. The track was intended to be pressed in limited numbers for New York club DJs. However, Rough Trade boss Geoff Travis liked the mix and gave the release wide distribution in the UK. Morrissey publicly disowned the mix, and urged fans not to purchase copies. Travis later claimed, \\"it was my idea, but they agreed. They said 'Go ahead', then didn't like it so it was withdrawn.\\" He also said, \\"Nothing that ever happened in the Smiths occurred without Morrissey's guidance; there's not one Smiths record that went out that Morrissey didn't ask to do, so there's nothing on my conscience.\\", what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"The specific name used to refer to the mix of \\"This Charming Man\\" that was intended to be pressed in limited numbers for New York club DJs is the \\"New York\\" mix. It was released by DJ François Kevorkian in December 1983 on Megadisc records, and it was created to cater to nightclub dancefloors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No. The following sentence \\"Telman was a short and stocky kid.\\" does not follow, given the preceding text. According to the provided information, Telman Thurgood was described as a lanky kid who had trouble with his limbs and was teased at school because of it. The word \\"lanky\\" typically refers to someone who is tall, thin, and ungraceful in their movements. This description contradicts the statement that Telman was short and stocky. Despite his physical challenges and the teasing from his peers, Telman went on to become an Olympic gold medalist in swimming at the age of 19.

Earlier this year my depression got very bad, very quickly. I’d been having intrusive suicidal thoughts for a while. It was a combination of a bad medication regimen and lots of little stressors—school, work, a car accident, you name it. I took to a very private social media account that only those I was closest to could see. I used that account to rant about my problems. It was my coping mechanism and how I kept myself sane. Somehow just typing it out got it off my chest in ways writing in a journal couldn’t (now, I try to use Quora for this purpose instead). One night in early March I went to a performance that my friends were part of. I went alone. While I was there, I got a series of texts regarding my girlfriend. I knew that what those texts said would cause me an immense amount of stress and sleepless nights. I went onto my social media account. I don’t remember exactly what I posted. It wasn’t specific, but rather something along the lines of “I’m stressed, this is the cherry on top, I honestly don’t know how I’m going to handle this.” Whatever it was, someone who followed that account knew I was at my breaking point. They called an anonymous tip line and reported that they believed I was in danger of killing myself. I got home from the performance at midnight and my dad was in my driveway. I asked him why. He told me he’d been contacted and that someone reported a concern about me. I was admitted to the hospital the next day, and I spent a week an an inpatient psychiatric unit where I received better medication, therapy and coaching on positive coping mechanisms. Whoever called saved me, but in a way I saved my own life that day. What I thought was just another routine post about stress got me the help I so desperately needed. I know without it, I would have ended my own life that day. Funny how that works. Question: How long did his dad wait for him in the driveway? === The answer to the above question is Select from: A).

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

I barely managed to squeeze in and had to stand on the step of the packed bus on the way to school. BTW, smoking was STILL happening on these buses!

So, when it was time to return home, the bus was not as crowded, and I actually was able to sit down. Again, every time we turned the corner, a bell would ring. So I held on tight!

I admitted to him, I had no knowledge of riding on a city bus. He was kind, explained to pull the bell pull 1 block prior to my stop. He explained he would circle back around and I could get off at my stop on the return trip. I was SO relieved!

Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the given product review, the sentiment appears to be mixed. The reviewer acknowledges that the vendor provided timely and good-quality service, but the product itself—specifically, the zapper—does not work on new technology because it is outdated. The reviewer seems to have found it a fun idea but ultimately decided to use a different product, such as the Wii remote, which may offer a similar experience. The review is not entirely positive because the zapper fails to work on newer devices, which limits its usefulness for the reviewer. However, the reviewer does not seem to be upset with the vendor or the product's condition. This suggests that rather than a purely positive review, the sentiment here is more neutral. The reviewer acknowledges their fault for not knowing the compatibility limitations but still expresses some disappointment in not being able to use the zapper for its intended purpose, such as playing games like Duck Hunt. It's essential to understand that the inability to use the product on new devices is not inherently a negative aspect of the product itself as it might still work effectively on older devices for which it was designed. Instead, the disappointment arises from the reviewer's expectations not being met due to their personal circumstances (e.g., not owning a compatible device).

Maybe because I'm from a different era and a different country, but I found Crosby's continual references to the Good Old USA pleasant at first, trite after a while and then finally annoying. Don't get me wrong - I'm not anti-American whatsoever - but it seemed that the English could do no right and/or needed this brave, oh so smart American visitor to show them the way. It's a \\"fish out of water\\" story, but unlike most movies of this sort, this time it's the \\"fish\\" who has the upper hand. To be fair to both myself and the movie, I have watched it a few times spaced over a few years and get the same impression each time. (I watched another Crosby movie last night - The Emperor's Waltz - and that, too, produced the same reaction in me. And to my surprise even my wife - who for what's it's worth is American - found the \\"in your face\\" attitude of American Crosby to be irritating. One too many references to Teddy Roosevelt, as she put it.) As for the premise of the movie, it's unique enough for its day and the supporting cast is of course very good. The scenery and the music is also good, as are the great costumes - although I agree with a previous reviewer that the wig on William Bendix looks horrid (picture Moe of The Three Stooges). All in all for me this would be a much more enjoyable picture without the attitude of Bing Crosby but because he is in virtually every shot it's pretty hard to sit through this movie.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information: - Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\". - Adolph Friedrich Erdmann von Menzel (December 8, 1815February 9, 1905) was a German Realist artist noted for drawings, etchings, and paintings. Along with Caspar David Friedrich, he is considered one of the two most prominent German artists of the 19th century, and was the most successful artist of his era in Germany. First known as Adolph Menzel, he was knighted in 1898 and changed his name to Adolph von Menzel. - Studio Wall ( 1872 ) is an oil painting by the German artist Adolph Menzel , now in the collection of the Hamburger Kunsthalle . It is considered one of the \`\` masterpieces of Menzel 's maturity '' , and the artist deemed it his best painting . The painting depicts a red colored wall of the artist 's studio at night , upon which are hung a series of plaster casts illuminated from below . The casts include portrait busts , death masks and life masks of friends of the artist , children , classical personae such as Dante , Schiller , and possibly Goethe or Wagner , a dog , and male and female torsos ; art historian Werner Hofmann saw this assemblage as a conscious blurring of \`\` the dividing line between fame and anonymity . '' Numerous commentators have noted that the array of dramatically lit casts \`\` convey an uncanny impression of quasi-animateness . '' Studio Wall was preceded by a work of the same title painted in 1852 , an oil on paper now in the Alte Nationalgalerie in Berlin . That painting features casts of two arms and a separate hand , the arms arranged so as to suggest a relationship to a body from which they have been removed . Studio Wall is also seen as related to Menzel 's larger painting Iron Rolling Mill ( 1872 -- 1875 ) , for which it may have served as a study in dramatic lighting , yet it has greater import than that of a merely preparatory exercise , and may have functioned as a kind of memorial : the central death mask is that of the artist 's friend Friedrich Eggers , the first critic sympathetic to Menzel 's work . Eggers died in August 1872 , and the painting is dated from October of that year . A contemplation on the transience of life , Studio Wall is also a bravura piece of alla prima painting . Interpretations of the work vary greatly . For art historian Julius Meier - Graefe , Studio Wall was a harmonious example of pictorial unity ; to the contrary , Hofmann saw the painting as a \`\` coded manifesto '' , a rejection by Menzel of academic canons in favor of an aesthetic that...

Given the question: Information: - The xylophone (from the Greek words \\"xylon\\", \\"wood\\" + \\"phn\\", \\"sound, voice\\", meaning \\"wooden sound\\") is a musical instrument in the percussion family that consists of wooden bars struck by mallets. Each bar is an idiophone tuned to a pitch of a musical scale, whether pentatonic or heptatonic in the case of many African and Asian instruments, diatonic in many western children's instruments, or chromatic for orchestral use. - A metallophone is any musical instrument consisting of tuned metal bars which are struck to make sound, usually with a mallet. - Tembang sunda, also called seni mamaos cianjuran, is a style of classical vocal music that originated in the Priangan highland of western Java. Unlike Sundanese gamelan music, tembang sunda was developed in the court of the regent Kabupaten Cianjur during the Dutch colonial period (mid-nineteenth century). The traditional vocal portion is sung free verse poetry, the instrumental accompaniment being performed on kacapi (zither), suling (bamboo flute) and sometimes, rebab (violin). A more modern, and metrical, form of lyrics exists that is called panambih. - Java (Indonesian: Jawa; Javanese: ; Sundanese: ) is an island of Indonesia. With a population of over 141 million (the island itself) or 145 million (the administrative region) Census released in December 2015, Java is home to 56.7 percent of the Indonesian population and is the most populous island on Earth. The Indonesian capital city, Jakarta, is located on western Java. Much of Indonesian history took place on Java. It was the center of powerful Hindu-Buddhist empires, the Islamic sultanates, and the core of the colonial Dutch East Indies. Java was also the center of the Indonesian struggle for independence during the 1930s and 1940s. Java dominates Indonesia politically, economically and culturally. - Kacapi is a zither-like Sundanese musical instrument played as the main accompanying instrument in the Tembang Sunda or Mamaos Cianjuran, kacapi suling (tembang Sunda without vocal accompaniment) genre (called \\"kecapi seruling\\" in Indonesian), pantun stories recitation or an additional instrument in Gamelan Degung performance. - Gamelan Degung is a Sundanese musical ensemble that uses a subset of modified gamelan instruments with a particular mode of pelog scale. The instruments are manufactured under local conditions in towns in West Java such as Bogor. Degung music is often played at public gatherings in West Java, such as at local elections, as well as many other events. There is international interest in degung as well amongst communities in other countries interested in Indonesia and gamelan music. - Kacapi suling is a form of Sundanese music from West Java. It is essentially \\"tembang Sunda\\" minus vocals, and also at interludes between songs at a typical Tembang Sunda performance. The higher pitched kacapi rincik, the lower pitched kacapi indung and the suling flute are the instruments used for kacapi suling. Kacapi suling has instrumental pieces performed in two different scales; the first four in laras pelog convey a light mood, the last four, in laras sorog are more slow and grave. The change to laras sorog usually takes place at midnight and lasts til sunrise. - The siter and celempung are plucked string instruments used in Javanese gamelan . They are related to the kacapi used in Sundanese gamelan . The siter and celempung each have between 11 and 13 pairs of strings , strung on each side , between a box resonator . Typically the strings on one side tuned to pélog and the other to slendro . The siter is generally about a foot long and fits in a box ( which it is set upon while played ) , while the celempung is about three feet long and sits on four legs , and is tuned one octave below the siter . They are used as one of the elaborating instruments ( panerusan ) , that play cengkok ( melodic patterns based on the balungan ) . Both the siter and celempung play at the same speed as the gambang ( which is rapidly ) . The name \`\` siter '' comes from the Dutch word \`\` citer '' , which corresponds to the English word \`\` zither '' . \`\` Celempung '' is related to the Sundanese musical form celempungan . The strings of the siter are played with the thumbnails , while the fingers are used to dampen the strings when the next one is hit , as is typical with instruments in the gamelan . The fingers of both hands are used for the damping , with the right hand below the strings and the left hand above them . Siters and celempung of various sizes are the characteristic instrument in Gamelan Siteran , although they are used in many other varieties of gamelan as well . - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - The rebab (\\"rabb\\", variously spelled \\"rebap\\", \\"rabab\\", \\"rebeb\\", \\"rababa\\" and \\"rabeba\\", also known as jawza or \\"joza\\" in Iraq) is a type of a bowed string instrument so named no later than the 8th century and spread via Islamic trading routes over much of North Africa, the Middle East, parts of Europe, and the Far East. The bowed variety often has a spike at the bottom to rest on the ground (see first image to the right), and is thus called a spike fiddle in certain areas, but plucked versions like the \\"kabuli rebab\\" (sometimes referred to as the \\"robab\\" or \\"rubab\\") also exist. - Bali (Balinese: ) is an island and province of Indonesia. The province includes the island of Bali and a few smaller neighbouring islands, notably Nusa Penida, Nusa Lembongan, and Nusa Ceningan. It is located at the westernmost end of the Lesser Sunda Islands, between Java to the west and Lombok to the east. Its capital, Denpasar, is located in the southern part of the island. - Gamelan is the traditional ensemble music of Java and Bali in Indonesia, made up predominantly of percussive instruments. The most common instruments used are metallophones played by mallets and a set of hand-played drums called \\"kendhang\\" which register the beat. Other instruments include xylophones, bamboo flutes, a bowed instrument called a \\"rebab\\", and even vocalists called \\"sindhen\\". - Zither (or ) is a class of stringed instruments. What is the relationship between 'siter' and 'musical instrument'? The answer is:","completion":"The siter is a type of musical instrument belonging to the plucked string instruments family and is predominantly used in Javanese gamelan, a traditional Indonesian musical ensemble. It is closely related to the kacapi, a similar instrument used in Sundanese gamelan. The siter consists of 11 to 13 pairs of strings with each side strung on a box resonator. Typically, the strings on one side are tuned to pélog, while the other side is tuned to slendro, both being traditional Javanese music scales. The siter's name comes from the Dutch word \\"citer,\\" which corresponds to the English word \\"zither.\\" As an integral part of the Javanese gamelan ensemble, the siter plays an elaborating role, contributing to the development of melodic patterns or cengkok based on the balungan, which is the core melody. It is played at the same speed as the gambang, another elaborating instrument in the ensemble. The siter is played using the thumbnails to pluck the strings while using the fingers to dampen the strings, a technique typically found in gamelan instruments. In a broader context, the siter, as a musical instrument, plays an essential role in preserving and promoting traditional Indonesian music culture, especially in the context of Javanese gamelan. It contributes to the unique sound and texture of the ensemble and showcases the rich musical heritage of the Indonesian archipelago. Being a part of gamelan music, the siter also reflects the social, cultural, and artistic values embedded in Javanese and Indonesian society, as gamelan ensembles are often performed during various religious, social, and cultural events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But with the Valentine’s Day weekend premiere of “Fifty Shades of Grey,” many of the tie-ins to the film are for adults only. The sex toy industry is banking on the hope that the Universal Pictures film will generate soaring sales, much the way the blockbuster erotic novel of the same name created thousands of new customers from the female readers who passed the book around their suburban culs-de-sac. In anticipation of such keen interest, mainstream retailers are stocking up on the pleasure industry’s blindfolds, whips, handcuffs and masks. Manufacturers have designed new packaging and products to fit the kinky tone and theme of the film, which is based on E. L.

In early 1989, he wrote an open letter to Communist Party leader Deng Xiaoping, calling for the release of Chinese political prisoners. After the bloody crackdown during the Tiananmen protests on June 4, 1989, Fang and his wife Li Shuxian sought refuge inside the U.S. embassy in Beijing.

Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin. After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser - use just water to cleanse - use abrasive soap - not enough information Answer:","completion":"using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They decided to accept the job offer. Given the context: How would Addison feel afterwards? Possible answers: a conformist, that it might not be the right choice, grateful to others Answer:","completion":"Given the context, after accepting the job offer, Addison might feel that it might not be the right choice. Here's my step-by-step justification: 1. The scenario states that Addison was \\"persuaded\\" to take the job, which implies that they might not have been completely convinced or confident in their decision initially. 2. \\"They decided to accept the job offer\\" indicates a level of agency on Addison's part, which suggests that they may have weighed the options and made a choice. 3. Out of the possible answers, two of them (a conformist and grateful to others) reflect external influences that could potentially contribute to doubts or uncertainty, while one (that it might not be the right choice) directly addresses internal feelings about the decision. 4. Considering the situation and the context, internal feelings are likely to be more relevant than external factors, because the question revolves around Addison's feelings after making the decision.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM. Going to Afghanistan The available evidence indicates that in 1999, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah decided to fight in Chechnya against the Russians.

Possible answers: -- It may constitute a challenge to computer progranmers.. -- It accompanies all machinery involving high technology.. -- It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language.. -- It has become an inevitable peril as technology gets more sophisticated.. Given those answer options, answer the question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Question: What does the author say about the threat of robots?

Translate this to English?","completion":"The conversion of (mostly decomposed) organic material is possible through several processes. In this sentence, the German phrase \\"Die Umsetzung des (meist abgestorbenen) organischen Materials\\" refers to the transformation or conversion of mostly decomposed organic material. This organic matter has typically gone through a natural decay process, which plays a vital role in nutrient cycling, the breakdown of complex molecules, and the generation of new compounds. The latter part of the sentence \\"ist über mehrere Prozesse möglich\\" translates to \\"is possible through several processes.\\" These processes involve various physical, chemical, and biological steps, which can convert the decomposed organic material into different forms, such as humus, nutrient-rich substances, and energy resources. Some of these methods include: 1. Decomp osition: This is the initial breakdown of organic matter by decomposers like bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms. They secrete enzymes to disintegrate complex organic compounds, ultimately resulting in the formation of simpler compounds like carbon dioxide, water, and nutrients, which can be used by plants. 2. Mineralization: It is the process by which organic matter is converted into inorganic minerals. The decomposition products formed above are acted upon by other microorganisms, resulting in the release of elements like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are essential for plant growth. 3. Humification: This process involves the formation of humus, a dark-colored, highly stable organic matter, from the partially decomposed remains of plants and animals. Humus is beneficial for soil structure, aeration, and water-holding capacity. It also serves as a long-term storage form of essential nutrients. 4. Methanogenesis: In this process, microorganisms called methanogens produce methane gas from organic matter under anaerobic conditions. Methanogenesis is a crucial step in anaerobic digestion and biogas production, which can be used as an alternative energy source. 5. Composting: Composting is a controlled process of decomposing organic materials, such as agriculture and food waste, yard trimmings, and other biodegradable materials, into a stable and nutrient-rich product called compost. This process accelerates natural decomposition by providing the right environmental conditions, such as appropriate moisture and temperature levels and proper aeration. These various processes contribute to the recycling of nutrients within ecosystems and can also provide energy sources for sustainable development, further illustrating the importance of the conversion of decomposed organic matter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, _ . They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery has reached full capacity. There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area. Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away. The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death. \\"I haven't got a job, nor am I healthy. And now they say I can't die.

Step 2: According to the first part of the problem, 5 years ago Paula was 3 times as old as Karl. So, we can write the equation: P - 5 = 3(K - 5). Step 3: Simplify the equation: P - 5 = 3K - 15. Step 4: According to the second part of the problem, in 6 years Paula will be twice as old as Karl. So, we can write the equation: P + 6 = 2(K + 6). Step 5: Simplify the equation: P + 6 = 2K + 12. Step 6: We now have a system of linear equations: P - 5 = 3K - 15. P + 6 = 2K + 12. Step 7: Solve for P from the second equation: P = 2K + 12 - 6. P = 2K + 6. Step 8: Substitute this value of P into the first equation: (2K + 6) - 5 = 3K - 15. Step 9: Simplify and solve for K: 2K + 1 = 3K - 15. K = 16. Step 10: Now that we have Karl's current age, we can find Paula's current age using P = 2K + 6. P = 2(16) + 6. P = 32 + 6. P = 38. Step 11: To find the sum of their ages now, we simply add their ages together: Sum = P + K. Sum = 38 + 16. Sum = 54. Answer: The sum of their ages now is 54.

An inquest into the death of a woman accused of trolling Madeleine McCann's parents has been adjourned after a post-mortem examination yesterday failed to establish a cause of death. An inquest at Leicester Coroner's Court was told the post-mortem examination conducted yesterday had failed to establish the cause of 63-year-old Brenda Leyland's death. A few days earlier she had been confronted by Sky News reporter Martin Brunt about trolling the McCanns on Twitter. During the exchange, Mrs Leyland initially refused to speak but then replied: ‘I’m entitled to do that.’ Opening the inquest, Leicester Coroner Catherine Mason was told there was no evidence of foul play or third party involvement in the death. Police Sergeant Kevin Taylor told the coroner he was informed that Mrs Leyland was dead after being sent to the Marriott Hotel in Enderby. The officer said: 'At the scene I was joined by another officer and a county ambulance first responder unit. 'I was then informed by the paramedic and the other officer that there was a deceased female within the room.' Sgt Taylor added that officers were awaiting the results of additional post-mortem tests and were still undertaking inquiries into the death. Adjourning the inquest until December 18, Mrs Mason said: 'It's quite clear from the evidence before me that I am not in a position to conclude (the inquest) today.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Installation process: Once you bring the software home, you would likely attempt to install it on your computer. You would insert the software disc (or use the digital download code if it was a digital purchase) into your computer and follow the installation prompts provided by the software's installer. 2. Encountering the issue: During the installation process, you would discover that there is a scratch on the disc, preventing the installation from proceeding further. This would be an unexpected issue that would hinder you from using the software you just purchased. 3. Seeking a solution: After encountering the problem, you might try to find a workaround for the scratch, such as cleaning the disc gently with a soft, lint-free cloth. You may also consider searching online for potential solutions to fix scratched discs or assessing if the installation can be completed through an alternative method (e.g., downloading the software from the publisher's website using the provided product key). 4. Deciding to return the product: If none of the attempted solutions work, you would likely decide to return the software to the store where you purchased it, as it is essentially unusable in its current state. Having the original receipt and packaging would be beneficial as they are typically required for returns at most retail establishments. 5. Visiting the store: You would then visit the store where you bought the software, possibly bringing the receipt, original packaging, and the scratched disc with you. At the store, you would likely approach a customer service representative or staff member and explain the situation to them. 6. Requesting a refund or exchange: During your interaction with the customer service representative, you would request a refund or an exchange due to the defective product.

Question: Q: What is the term for diseases in which blood does not clot normally? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Hemophilia is a group of diseases in which blood does not clot normally. Factors in blood are involved in clotting. When you bleed, your body begins a coagulation cascade of reactions, involving special proteins known as coagulation factors, to stop that bleeding. When one or more of these clotting factors are missing, there is a higher chance of having dificulties stoping the bleeding. Hemophiliacs lacking the normal Factor VIII are said to have Hemophilia A (or Factor VIII deficiency), the most common form. Hemophilia is a genetic disease, passed down through family. It is linked to the X-chromosome, so it mostly affects males. F8 is the gene for the Factor VIII protein. Mutations in the F8 gene lead to the production of an abnormal version of coagulation factor VIII, or reduce the amount of the protein. The altered or missing protein cannot participate effectively in the blood clotting process.

On the fateful day, the U.S. aircraft was on a routine non-combat mission over Zaire's airspace when it was suddenly met with gunfire. According to initial reports, the attack appeared to be unprovoked and took the crew by surprise. (Step 1: Introduce the main event - a U.S. aircraft being shot at over Zaire) The aircraft, which was fortunately not hit, immediately initiated evasive maneuvers to escape the danger and moved toward the safety of international airspace. It is speculated that despite the swift reaction by the pilots, the attack could have resulted in the loss of lives and significant damage to the aircraft, had it been successful. (Step 2: Describe the outcome and response of the plane's crew) In light of this incident, authorities are investigating to determine the identity of the attackers and their motive. Early assessments suggest that local militants or rebels could be responsible, as the attack may be a symptom of the ongoing political unrest and violence that has been plaguing Zaire for years. (Step 3: Discuss the possible motives behind the attack and the ongoing situation in Zaire) The United States government has expressed its concern over the attack and the safety of its personnel in the region. They have urged the Zaire authorities to take appropriate action to ensure the security of foreign nationals and their assets in the country. The attack also prompts an examination of the current measures in place to maintain a secure environment in the conflict-ridden nation. (Step 4: Include the reactions and concerns from the United States and the implication for the security situation) This unprovoked attack on the U.S. aircraft highlights the mounting risks and perils associated with operating in Zaire's fragile environment.

Tweet:is getting mad that i cant get my picture to upload","completion":"The sentiment expressed in the tweet: \\"is getting mad that I can't get my picture to upload\\" is negative. Sentiment analysis is the technique of identifying and categorizing a person's feelings, emotions, or opinions from a piece of text. It primarily focuses on three categories: positive, negative, and neutral. In understanding the sentiment of the text, we must critically analyze the words and their contextual implication. In the given tweet, the user conveys dissatisfaction or frustration with the situation, which is indicated by the words \\"mad\\" and \\"can't.\\" The user is frustrated because they can't upload their picture. This statement exhibits a negative sentiment because the words mentioned have a particularly negative connotation. The words \\"mad\\" and \\"can't\\" are the sentiment-bearing words in this scenario. \\"Mad\\" is often used to express a negative emotion such as anger or annoyance, while \\"can't\\" denotes an inability to do something which, especially in a context of frustration, is also received negatively. Both form a negative sentiment when combined in the context of the tweet. Hence, the tweet does not mirror a positive or neutral sentiment as the user is clearly frustrated (negative emotion) with their inability (portraying disadvantage or negative experience) to perform a task, which in this case is uploading a picture. Therefore, while analyzing the words and context closely, we can understand that the author of the tweet feels a negative sentiment towards their current situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is During this era, some giant dragonfly-like forms reached wingspans of 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 in), making them far larger than any living insect. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the information you provided is a good starting point to answer the question. However, to create a more detailed and long answer, you can expand on the information by discussing the specific era, the types of insects, and the reasons for their large wingspans. Here's an expanded answer incorporating these details: During the late Carboniferous and early Permian period, approximately 299 to 359 million years ago, some giant insects, specifically dragonfly-like creatures known as Meganeura, roamed the Earth with wingspans ranging from 55 to 70 cm (22 to 28 inches), making them far larger than any living insect. These ancient arthropods belonged to the order Protodonata, which includes the ancestors of today's dragonflies and damselflies. One of the most well-known species within this group is Meganeura monyi. With a wingspan reaching up to 65 cm (25.6 inches) and a body length of around 43 cm (17 inches), it was an impressive predator in the tropical swamps that covered much of the Earth during that era. There are several factors believed to be responsible for the large size of these insects. One primary reason is the high levels of oxygen in the atmosphere during this period. The late Carboniferous had oxygen levels estimated to be around 35%, significantly higher than the 21% found in today's atmosphere. This increased oxygen availability allowed insects to develop larger and more efficient respiratory systems, supporting their massive size. Another contributing factor is the absence of certain ecological traits and competitors that exist today, which has limited the growth of insects. During the Carboniferous and early Permian periods, flying vertebrates such as birds and bats were yet to evolve; thus, there was little competition in the skies for these giant insects. Lastly, these large creatures also benefitted from the abundance of plant life during this time, providing ample resources to support their energy needs. In conclusion, during the late Carboniferous and early Permian period, giant dragonfly-like insects, specifically within the order Protodonata, had wingspans reaching up to 70 cm due to a combination of high oxygen levels, limited competition, and ample resources. This made these insects far larger than any living insect today and highlights the different environmental conditions of Earth millions of years ago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:There was no additional air in the tire the second time Lawrence checked the air pressure, but something did change between the two measurements. The tires had rolled over 10 miles of road on the trip to school. Any time one surface moves over another, it causes friction. Friction is a force that opposes the motion of two surfaces that are touching, and friction between two surfaces always generates heat. Quickly rub your hands together and you’ll feel the heat generated by the friction between them. As the tires moved over the road, friction between the tires and road generated heat. In short, the tires got warmer and so did the air inside them. There was a carnival game at the fair that allowed you to win a basketball if you could correctly guess which of the two balls had spun around a circular track more times. Each ball would be dropped into identical circular tracks and then a curtain would cover them. Ball A would then spin around the track a certain amount of times, and Ball B would spin around a certain amount of times. After they were done spinning, you had to guess which ball completed more revolutions. A boy came up and had no idea how to figure out the answer, but when he picked them up he noticed that Ball A was slightly warmer than Ball B. Which ball completed less revolutions? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, friction generates heat when one surface moves over another. When the boy picked up Ball A and Ball B, he noticed that Ball A was slightly warmer than Ball B. As the warmth of the balls is related to the friction caused by spinning in the circular tracks, we can infer that the ball with more heat would have experienced more friction due to spinning more times. Since Ball A was warmer, it likely completed more revolutions compared to Ball B. Therefore, Ball B completed less revolutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What city contained the Antonia Fortress? The Acra was not the first Hellenistic stronghold in Jerusalem. Sources indicate that an earlier citadel, the Ptolemaic Baris, had also occupied a location overlooking the Temple's precincts. Although the exact location of the Baris is still debated, it is generally accepted to have stood north of the Temple Mount on the site later occupied by the Antonia Fortress. The Baris fell to Antiochus III at the turn of the 2nd century BCE and is absent from all accounts of the Maccabean Revolt. Despite the narratives which have the Acra constructed within a very short time-span, it was nevertheless formidable enough to weather long periods of siege. These factors, coupled with references in which the Baris was itself called an acra, have led some to suggest that the Baris and the Acra were in fact the same structure. Although both 1 Maccabees and Josephus seem to describe the Acra as a new construction, this may not have been the case. Antiquities of the Jews 12:253 may be translated to give the sense that the \\"impious or wicked\\" had \\"remained\\" rather than \\"dwelt\\" in the citadel, which could be taken to mean that the Acra had been standing before the revolt and that only the Macedonian garrison was new.Koen Decoster proposes that Josephus wrote of \\"a citadel in the lower part of the city\\" to an audience that would have been familiar with the Jerusalem of the 1st century CE—a city that did feature two citadels: the Antonia Fortress and the Herodian palace. As Josephus' Roman Jerusalem had already expanded to the higher western hill, \\"a citadel in the lower city\\" could have referred to anything located east of the Tyropoeon Valley, including the Antonia which stood north of the Temple and did indeed rise above and dominate it. In his view, this is the place Josephus must have had in mind when he wrote of the Acra.Opponents of a northern location counter that this site is not supported by the historical sources, and that this would place the Acra away from Jerusalem's population center.

(1) Staunton answered that he needed more time to prepare , and Morphy wrote to him again : (2) Staunton wrote that he needed more time to prepare , and Morphy replied to him again : Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"No, these two sentences do not mean the exact same thing. They are similar but the roles of the characters Staunton and Morphy are reversed, thus shifting who is taking action and who is responding. In the first sentence: \\"(1) Staunton answered that he needed more time to prepare, and Morphy wrote to him again\\", Staunton is responding to a previous interaction, presumably with Morphy. He expresses his need for more time to prepare, implying there is an event or situation that he's getting ready for that may have been initiated by Morphy. Morphy then continues the conversation or correspondence by writing to Staunton again, perhaps responding to Staunton's request for more preparatory time. On the other hand, the second sentence: \\"(2) Staunton wrote that he needed more time to prepare, and Morphy replied to him again\\", Staunton is the one initiating the communication this time. He writes to Morphy about his need for more time. Morphy responds to this request, indicated by 'replied to him again'. Therefore, while the dialogue between the two characters Staunton and Morphy and the content about needing more time remains a constant in both cases, the roles they take in continuing their correspondence and initiating the conversation is reversed in both instances. This changes the dynamics and progression of the ongoing dialogue or negotiation between these two individuals, which makes these sentences different in their implications and progression of the storyline. This especially would matter in a context where the sequence of events or whose turn it is to respond has an impact, such as in a game, a real-time negotiation, or a tense discussion.

It is true that Sénizergues has had a successful and impressive career as a French computer scientist, working at the University of Bordeaux and collaborating with Yuri Matiyasevich to obtain results about the Post correspondence problem. Additionally, he won the prestigious 2002 Gödel Prize for proving that equivalence of deterministic pushdown automata is decidable. These accomplishments certainly highlight his expertise and contributions to the field of computer science. However, the given paragraph does not provide any specific information regarding Sénizergues' salary or compensation level in relation to other computer scientists. While it is logical to assume that a successful and accomplished computer scientist may be well-compensated for their work, we do not have the necessary data to compare Sénizergues' salary with those of other professionals in his field. To accurately determine if Géraud Sénizergues is one of the highest paid computer scientists, additional research is required. We would need to gather information about the average salaries for computer scientists in France and internationally, assess the compensation levels of Sénizergues' peers and colleagues, and compare his salary to those figures. Factors such as years of experience, additional roles or responsibilities within the University of Bordeaux, and the specific achievements and qualifications of other computer scientists should also be considered when analyzing salary data. In conclusion, the hypothesis that Géraud Sénizergues is one of the highest paid computer scientists in his field cannot be confirmed as true based solely on the information provided in the paragraph. More research on salaries in the field of computer science is needed to make an accurate determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From the moment I walked in the door, it was apparent that something special was happening here. Firstly, the ambiance was absolutely perfect. The establishment was spotless, with stylish and modern decor, but it managed to maintain a cozy and inviting atmosphere. The soft background music helped create a relaxing environment that set the perfect mood for our dining experience. As for the service, it was truly top-notch. The moment we entered, we were greeted with warm smiles by the hostess who promptly escorted us to our table. Our server was incredibly attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable. They took the time to answer all our questions about the various dishes on the menu, and their recommendations were spot on! Now, let's talk about the food. It was nothing short of amazing! We started with the appetizers, which were delicious, unique, and beautifully presented. I was particularly impressed with the calamari; it was tender and cooked to perfection, paired with a flavorful dipping sauce that really elevated the dish. For our main courses, we each chose a different entree, and not a single one disappointed. The flavors were well-balanced, the ingredients fresh, and the presentation was visually appealing. A standout dish for me was the seafood pasta; the delicate flavors of each ingredient melded together perfectly to create a dish that was truly unforgettable. Even though we were full from our entrees, we couldn't resist trying a couple of desserts, and I'm happy to report that they were the perfect capstone to a delightful meal. Both the tiramisu and the chocolate lava cake were heavenly, and the portions were generous enough to share. Throughout our time at this wonderful establishment, we never felt rushed or pressured. The staff made sure to check on us regularly and ensured that we had everything we needed. It was evident that customer satisfaction is their top priority, and they go above and beyond to make everyone feel welcome and pampered. In conclusion, I cannot recommend this place highly enough!

Movie title: Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior Movie plot: With supplies of petroleum nearly exhausted in the near future following a major energy crisis and a global nuclear war, ex-Main Force Patrol officer \\"Mad\\" Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson) roams the now-depopulated and desolate desert in his scarred, black supercharged V-8 Pursuit Special several years after the events of the first film, scavenging for food, water, and fuel. His only companions are an Australian Cattle Dog and a rare functioning firearm â a sawn-off shotgun â for which ammunition is very scarce. While trying to escape a group of gang members â led by a crazed motorcycle rider named Wez (Vernon Wells) - Max manages to crash two of the gang members' vehicles and injure Wez; recognising his defeat, Wez flees. After collecting some fuel from the destroyed cars and checking a nearby Mack semi, Max inspects a nearby autogyro for fuel. Its pilot, the Gyro Captain (Bruce Spence), ambushes Max and manages to capture him briefly before being overpowered. In exchange for his own life, the pilot guides Max to a small oil refinery nearby. Max arrives to see the facility is under siege by a gang of marauders riding a motley collection of cars and motorbikes. The gang leader, known as \\"Lord Humungus\\" (Kjell Nilsson), tries to convince the refinery's defenders to surrender the facility in exchange for safe passage out of the area. A group of defenders attempts to break out of the compound, but the marauders capture, torture, and kill all but one of them, who is rescued by Max. Max makes a deal with the mortally-wounded sole survivor: he will bring him back to the compound in exchange for a tank of fuel. The man dies shortly after they enter the facility, and the facility leader, Pappagallo (Michael Preston), reneges on the deal, saying it died when the survivor died. His group is on the verge of killing Max when the marauders return, and Humungus repeats his offer. When the Feral Kid (Emil Minty) kills Wez's male companion, Wez becomes enraged, urging his leader to take the compound; Humungus wrestles Wez... A:","completion":"The facility leader in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is Pappagallo, played by actor Michael Preston. As the leader of the oil refinery, he is responsible for managing the facility and ensuring the safety of the people within it. Pappagallo plays a crucial role in the film as he makes decisions that ultimately affect the community's survival against the marauders, who are trying to seize control of the refinery under the leadership of Lord Humungus. Under Pappagallo's guidance, the refinery's defenders work together to fend off the relentless attacks from Lord Humungus and his gang of marauders. His leadership is tested when Max enters the scene, offering a deal for a tank of fuel. Although Pappagallo reneges on the agreement after the deal's essential component (the mortally wounded survivor) dies, he ultimately reconsiders working with Max to secure the community's safety. Throughout the movie, Pappagallo showcases his tenacity and intelligence when faced with adversity. He ensures the facility's survival and the well-being of its inhabitants, even when it means making difficult decisions. His strategic thinking becomes evident when he collaborates with Max in a daring plan to outwit the marauders. To summarize, the facility leader in Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior is Pappagallo (Michael Preston), who serves as the central authority figure within the embattled oil refinery and plays a key part in the struggle against Lord Humungus and his marauding gang. Pappagallo's leadership skills and strategic thinking contribute significantly to the film's plot, making his character an integral part of the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage: The German torpedo boat T7 was one of a dozen Type 35 torpedo boats built for the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) during the late 1930s. Completed in 1939, she was not combat ready until mid-1940 when she spent several months escorting minelayers as they laid minefields in the North Sea and the English Channel. The boat participated in an abortive attempt to attack several convoys off the Scottish coast in November. T7 returned to Germany for a refit in January 1941 and then supported operations in the Baltic Sea after the start of Operation Barbarossa in June. The boat was one of the escorts for several commerce raiders passing through the English Channel in late 1941 and then escorted German ships in Norwegian waters in mid-1942. She was briefly placed in reserve later that year and was then reactivated for service with the Torpedo School. T7 was sunk in an air raid in July 1944, but was refloated several months later. She was never repaired and was scrapped in 1947–1949.

Which uncle doesn't take a drug that works slightly differently in many people? Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference?

But the fact that such fears are common and normal doesn't mean they can be taken lightly. Kids experience fears and phobias much more strongly than adults. And the influence of the fear can be physical as well as psychological . It can build up so they almost seem scared of everything--a kind of childhood anxiety. Dr. Creswell says: \\"Your child may always seem to expect the worst to happen and lack confidence in his or her ability to deal with any challenge.\\" So don't make the same old mistake of treating them as if they're silly for being a\\"scaredy cat\\". Handling the fears is essential. Children can be born nervous and, if you have such a baby, you'll tend to prevent them from getting worried. So if they fear dogs, you'll keep them away from dogs, but in fact that can just confirm to the child that dogs are scary. What is worse, keeping your child away from what they fear can turn that feeling into a phobia. Instead, you should encourage them to get in touch with the thing they fear, in a safe and supportive environment. Dr. Andy Field, a researcher of childhood fears, says: \\"You shouldn't force, for example, a dog anxious child to go up to a dog.

While gazing at the image of a pumpkin patch, a dozen decayed arms punch through the wall clutching at her....She wakes from this surreal horror in the back of a helicopter. She's reminded she is living a real nightmare, looking down over a deserted Florida city, in which they land near an abandoned harbor. She is part of a team searching for survivors of a gruesome crisis that began almost a year earlier, a plague that started mysteriously and eventually collapsed human civilization. Her sometimes lover Miguel, an overworked and nerve-wracked soldier, calls for survivors on a bullhorn as they stand on the edge of the street of this now decaying town. Amid the scattered palm fronds, a newspaper blows in the death-scented wind near an early century federal building. It's big bold headline: THE DEAD WALK!

No scientist-no army, could contain or cure it. Now the only living creatures in the outside world are the alligators, tarantulas and land crabs that scavenge remains in the streets of this city of the living dead. The hundreds of wailing hordes of dead humans turn towards the bullhorn calls and en masse, march toward the survivors instinctively like cattle, forcing the team to head back to their sanctuary.The helicopter lands almost out of gas inside the military compound surrounded by wire fence.

IOC awards 2018 Olympics to Pyeongchang, South Korea After two unsuccessful bids for the Winter Olympics, Pyeongchang won the right to hold the 2018 Winter Games when 90-plus members of the International Olympic Committee in Durban, South Africa, selected the South Korean city in the first round of voting Wednesday. Pyeongchang soundly defeated Munich and Annecy, France, sending the Winter Games to Asia for the first time since the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. The IOC’s 95 eligible members from 76 countries voted by secret ballot. Pyeongchang won 63 votes; Munich, 25; and Annecy claimed just seven. “We are absolutely delighted,” Cho Yang-ho, the leader of the Korean bid, said during a televised news conference after the announcement. “Over the course of 10 years of bidding, we have been listening and learning from the Olympic family. . . . today our effort and commitment to having the Olympic Games has been rewarded.” When IOC President Jacques Rogge announced the result after opening a sealed envelope in front of representatives from all three cities and the organization’s entire membership, a roar went up from the Pyeongchang contingent. Bid team members leaped, waved South Korean flags, chanted briefly and embraced as representatives from the two other bid cities clapped politely. The last time a city had been selected in the first round was in 1995, when Salt Lake City won the right to hold the 2002 Winter Games. “We understand, of course, [Annecy and Munich] are disappointed,” Rogge said. “But I think there is maybe a lesson . . . patience and perseverance have prevailed.” After losses to Vancouver in the race for the 2010 Winter Games and Sochi, Russia, for the 2014 Olympics, Pyeongchang offered an uncustomary third straight bid. The third-largest city in South Korea, Pyeongchang had actually secured the most votes in the first rounds of its two previous bids, but since it did not receive a majority, the cities that received the lowest number of votes had been eliminated, and voting continued. Rio de Janeiro, which won the right to hold the 2016 Summer Games, bid three times before winning in 2009. “In the past, we think the Olympics are only for rich and big countries,” said Park Yong-sung, the president of the Korean Olympic Committee. “But now Rio, and us, means even those developing countries with good programs and campaigns, they can have the Games in the future.” A 2018 Games in South Korea opens the door to a 2020 Summer Games in Europe and perhaps discourages Tokyo, which has announced plans to contend for that Olympics. Rome has already announced its candidacy and Paris and Madrid could join the field. Scott Blackmun, chief executive of the U.S. Olympic Committee, has repeatedly said the United States would not offer a bid until its longstanding revenue-sharing dispute with the IOC had been worked out. That seems unlikely in time for the September entry deadline. South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and 2010 Olympic figure skating gold medal winner Kim Yu-na participated in Pyeongchang’s formal presentation, which pushed the theme of “new horizons.” Each of the bid cities made an hour-long presentation before the vote. The 1988 Summer Games took place in Seoul, but South Korea has never held a Winter Olympics. Munich, the site of the 1972 Summer Games, was attempting to become the first city to host a winter and summer Olympics. Annecy, considered the outsider in the race, cast itself as an authentic, non-commercialized winter sports center. Pyeongchang relied heavily on the corporate support of Samsung, the emphatic backing of the South Korean government and its reputation for persistence. Munich tried to leverage the insider support of IOC Vice President Thomas Bach of Germany and the general appeal of two-time Olympic champion figure skater Katerina Witt, a key bid team member while declaring the bid about “friendship.” The nation last held a Winter Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen in 1936. Annecy, which struggled at times with bid organization and public support, was attempting to become fourth French city to hold a Winter Olympics. Chamonix held the inaugural Winter Games in 1924; Grenoble played host in 1968; and Albertville, in 1992.

I was in Vegas with my husband and in-laws to have a sin city Christmas. We decided to try Hikari for the AYCE sushi as our Christmas Eve dinner. While our waitress was super sweet and friendly, it didn't make up for the poor service we received over the entire evening. First, we sat down and were asked what we would like to drink (4 hot teas and 4 glasses of water, please) and we excitedly gave the waitress our marked up sushi order so we can get our food ASAP. 10+ minutes pass by and... nothing. The waitress frantically returns and tells us that they must' have lost our sushi order. WHAT. So she asked us to repeat our order by memory, which was really confusing for a second, until I asked her for another menu to look at so we can try to remember. Jeez. 10 minutes later, a big tray of sushi is dropped off by another waitress and is left at the empty side of the counter. We sit and stare at the tray of our sushi for another 10 minutes before our original waitress comes back and brings it to us. I would've served us ourselves, but we weren't sure it was even our food. It was just left there. As for the food, it was decent. The fried rice and soup were standard but yummy. The rolls were pretty good (I liked the Win Roll... fried with jalapenos) and the sushi and sashimi were just ok. They were cut all weird like they had just been hacked up. I've never seen such poorly cut sushi & sashimi before. And it didn't really taste all that fresh. I know it's not like I expected the freshest and bestest sushi & sashimi ever. But c'mon. Sad to say I arrived with high hopes and left really frustrated and unsatisfied. I will not be a return customer. Side note: the chefs put raw meat & seafood on the trays when they do the teppan style dinner. No plates or anything. Just raw chicken, shrimp, and steaks on plastic lunch trays. The same trays they bring out your other food on. I hope they wash those with really hot water. Ew. Choose the sentiment of this review?

Given the question: Information: - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - Chamber pop (or \\"ork-pop\\") is a subgenre of indie pop or indie rock which grew in the mid 1990s as a reaction against the fuzz distortion and \\"lo-fi aesthetic\\" prominent in alternative music. Inspired partly by the era's lounge music revivalism, chamber pop is typified by the use of strings, horns, and piano, and a dissociation from contemporary genres of the time, like grunge or electronica. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson heavily influenced much of the genre, as did composer Burt Bacharach. Specific works which helped define chamber pop include the Beach Boys' albums \\"Pet Sounds\\" (1966) and \\"Smile\\" (196667), as well as the majority of Louis Phillipe's productions for él Records (198489). - Twee pop is a subgenre of indie pop that maintained a reasonable amount of success and notoriety distinctive from the overall indie pop current. - Athens (formally known as Athens-Clarke County) is a consolidated citycounty in the U.S. state of Georgia, in the northeastern part of the state, comprising the former city of Athens proper (the county seat) and Clarke County. The University of Georgia, the state's flagship public research university, is located in this college town, and contributed to its initial growth. In 1991, after a vote the preceding year, the original city abandoned its charter to form a unified government with Clarke County, referred to jointly as Athens-Clarke County. As of the 2010 census, the consolidated city-county (including all of Athens-Clarke County except Winterville and a portion of Bogart) had a total population of 115,452; all of Clarke County had a population of 116,714. Athens is the sixth-largest city in Georgia, and the principal city of the Athens-Clarke County, Georgia Metropolitan Statistical Area, which had a population of 192,541 as of the 2010 census. Athens-Clarke County has the smallest geographical area of a county in Georgia. - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl. - I Am Not A Freemdoom is the second album by Masters of the Hemisphere, released in 2000 on Kindercore Records. It is a concept album containing a comic book, for which the songs provide the soundtrack. - Masters of the Hemisphere is the first full album by the Athens , Georgia based indie pop band of the same name . Though it lacks the elaborateness of their followup , the heavily concept - based I Am Not A Freemdoom , it still maintains the essential element of the band 's indie pop songcraft , drawing comparisons to R.E.M. , among others . - Indie pop is a subgenre and subculture of alternative/indie rock that originated in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. The style is inspired by punk's DIY ethic and related ideologies, and it generated a thriving fanzine, label, and club and gig circuit. Indie pop differs from indie rock to the extent that it is more melodic, less abrasive, and relatively angst-free. Its substyles include chamber pop and twee pop. - Kindercore Records is an independent record label based in Athens, Georgia, which was founded in 1996 by Ryan Lewis and Daniel Geller to document the emerging music scene in Athens, Georgia. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - A concept album is an album unified by a larger purpose or meaning to the album collectively than to its tracks individually. This may be achieved through a single central narrative or theme, or through a sense of artistic cohesiveness. The scope and definition of a \\"concept album\\" varies, and there is no consensus over what exactly the term constitutes. - Masters of the Hemisphere are an American indie pop group, founded by Bren Mead and Sean Rawls. The two moved to Athens, Georgia, to attend college in 1996. There they met Ryan Lewis, co-founder of Kindercore Records, who played drums at the first Masters of the Hemisphere show. Jeff Griggs (also of The Mendoza Line) soon replaced Lewis. In 1997 Kindercore released their debut seven-inch ep, \\"Going on a Trek to Iceland\\". The group then recorded their first full length album, the eponymous \\"Masters of the Hemisphere\\", which was released on Kindercore Records in 1998. The band soon expanded to a four-piece, adding multi-instrumentalist Adrian Finch. Several singles and compilation appearances followed, including a release on the Happy Happy Birthday To Me Records singles club, before the band released their second full length, the concept album \\"I Am Not a Freemdoom\\", also on Kindercore. The record garnered mixed reviews, which in part was likely due to the album's rather complicated concept, regarding an island of reservoir-dwelling creatures being enslaved by an evil dog. The \\"Permanent Stranger\\" EP followed in 2002, on the dcBaltimore2012 label. The band split up after their next album, 2002's well received \\"Protest a Dark Anniversary\\". A recording of their then-final show at Athens, Georgia's 40 Watt Club was later released as \\"The Last Show Ever\\". After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'masters of the hemisphere ' exhibits the relationship of 'record label'.

RESPONSE TO SEVERE INFESTATIONS OF BARK BEETLES AND OTHER INSECTS ON FEDERAL LAND IN COLORADO. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds the following: (1) Fire and bark beetles and other insects that feed on trees are natural parts of Colorado's forest ecology that have some beneficial effects and help shape the forests by thinning dense tree stands and promoting cyclical re-growth. (2) However, in various parts of Colorado, large-scale infestations of bark beetles and other insects, in combination with other factors, have increased the likelihood of unusually severe wildfires that pose a threat to lives and property in nearby communities and to municipal water supplies and other infrastructure. (3) The Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (Public Law 108-148; 16 U.S.C. 6501 et seq.) was enacted to address the need to reduce the volume of fuel that can feed the most severe wildfires that threaten communities. (4) The modification of some provisions of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 will help to further expedite action to reduce the risks of severe wildfires to Colorado communities, water supplies, and infrastructure in or near forested areas most severely affected by infestations of bark beetles and other insects. (b) Insect-Emergency Area Defined.--Section 101 of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6511) is amended-- (1) by redesignating paragraphs (12) through (16) as paragraphs (13) through (17), respectively; and (2) by inserting after paragraph (11) the following new paragraph: \`\`(12) Insect-emergency area.--The term \`insect-emergency area' means an area of Federal land in Colorado designated by the Secretary pursuant to section 107.''. (c) Alternative Analysis Process.--Section 104(d)(2) of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6514(d)(2)) is amended by inserting after \`\`at-risk community'' the following: \`\`or on any other lands identified for such a project in a community wildfire protection plan for an at-risk community in or adjacent to an insect-emergency area''. (d) Response to Insect Emergencies.--Title I of the Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2003 is amended-- (1) by redesignating sections 107 and 108 as sections 108 and 109, respectively; and (2) by inserting after section 106 (16 U.S.C. 6516) the following new section: \`\`SEC. 107. COLORADO INSECT-EMERGENCY AREAS. \`\`(a) Designation of Insect-Emergency Areas.-- \`\`(1) Designation authority.--The Secretary may designate an area of Federal land in Colorado as an insect-emergency area if-- \`\`(A) the Secretary determines that the area is subject to a widespread infestation of bark beetles or other insects; \`\`(B) the Secretary determines that the area is characterized by insect-induced tree mortality that has, or within one year of the determination will have, produced a condition such that an immediate reduction in hazardous fuels is required in order to reduce the risks to human life and property or to a municipal water supply from a severe wildfire; and \`\`(C) the area is identified for hazardous fuel reduction treatment in a community wildfire protection plan. \`\`(2) Criteria.--The determinations required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) shall be made on the basis of the best information available, including observation of relevant insect infestations. \`\`(3) Limitation on delegation.--In the case of National Forest System lands, the authority to designate an insect- emergency area may be delegated only to a Regional Forester. \`\`(b) Initiation of Designation Process.-- \`\`(1) Initiation.--The designation of an insect-emergency area may be made on the initiative of the Secretary or in response to a request by any agency of the State of Colorado or a political subdivision thereof. \`\`(2) Deadline.--If a request for designation is initiated by the State or a political subdivision thereof, the Secretary shall issue a decision regarding the request not later than 90 days after receipt of the request. \`\`(c) Consultation and Public Comment.--Before making the determinations required by subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) with respect to an area, the Secretary shall-- \`\`(1) consult with any Federal agency responsible for management of lands within a relevant community wildfire protection plan and appropriate State and local officials; and \`\`(2) provide public notice and seek public comments on the possible determinations. \`\`(d) Review of Designation.--Any administrative or judicial review of the decision of the Secretary to designate an insect-emergency area shall be subject to regulations issued pursuant to section 105 and to the provisions of section 106. \`\`(e) Authorized Hazardous Fuel Reduction Projects in Designated Areas.--An authorized hazardous fuel reduction project involving only lands within an insect-emergency area may be categorically excluded from documentation in an environmental impact statement and environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) if-- \`\`(1) the project involves only lands that are identified for hazardous-fuel reduction treatment in a community wildfire protection plan; and \`\`(2) the decision to categorically exclude the project is made in accordance with applicable extraordinary circumstances procedures established pursuant to section 1508.4 of title 40, Code of Federal Regulations.''.

If two Grand Lodges claim jurisdiction over the same area, the other Grand Lodges will have to choose between them, and they may not all decide to recognise the same one.

Other Grand Lodges had to choose between them until the schism was healed.) Exclusive Jurisdiction can be waived when the two over-lapping Grand Lodges are themselves in Amity and agree to share jurisdiction (for example, since the Grand Lodge of Connecticut is in Amity with the Prince Hall Grand Lodge of Connecticut, the principle of Exclusive Jurisdiction does not apply, and other Grand Lodges may recognise both).

For JKB, this, and her inability to have children, is a problem. Gajapathi (Janagaraj) works for JKB as a Tambura musician, and he is a compulsive liar. The film starts with an introduction of all characters of the film followed by JKB going to a concert where he finds Gurumoorthy (Delhi Ganesh), who works for JKB as a Mridangam musician, drunk. He instructs Gurumoorthy to leave the premises and performs in the concert without the use of Mridangam which is considered a basic/compulsory instrument to perform a carnatic concert. When Gurumoorthy is asked to permanently leave the band, he promises not to drink again. While Bhairavi's grandfather is going to receive his pension, which he does on the first of every month, Gajapathi lies to him that his pension has been cancelled. The old man starts crying and JKB intervenes to confirm that his pension is not canceled and that he can go and collect it. JKB then scolds Gajapathi for it and tells him the old man could have died on hearing such a lies, as he is very particular about his pension. Following this, when JKB finds out that Gajapathi has lied to him too and others causing problems he asks him to promise to speak the truth. Sindhu (Suhasini), working as a music teacher in a school, attends one of the concerts of JKB, where he is performing a Tyagaraja keerthanam which is in Telugu Language and she finds some the audience speaking to each other instead of listening to the music.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: THE results are in and the conclusion is overwhelming: left-handed people are 71% more satisfied in bed than right-handed people. So say the results of intimate lifestyle products company, LELO’s 2014 Global Sex Survey. When asked about their sex life in a survey of 10,000 people, 86% of left-handed people reported that they were “Extremely Satisfied” as compared to only 15% of right-handed people. Who knows what the reason is for this. Maybe because the left-handed are forced to find solutions for living in a world predominantly created for the right-handed, they develop a stronger sense of ingenuity and that same ingenuity transfers to the bedroom? Just a theory. In light of these surprising results, LELO has designed a new sex toy that aims to give the North paws a little taste of the South paw sex drive. BEST COMPLIMENTS TO GIVE A WOMAN It is fittingly titled DEXTRUS and is the first sex toy that claims it will increase your sexual pleasure as well as make you smarter. Even crazier, the way it works, you could use it in front of a crowded room of people without getting sued for indecent exposure. The sex toy is shaped like a stress ball and used similarly: When the user squeezes the ball with their left-hand, vibrations are sent up the arm, stimulating the right side of the brain. This is based on findings from a study conducted last April that “test[ed] effects of unilateral hand clenching on episodic memory” and found that “left hand clenching (right hemisphere activation) pre-recall,...result[s] in superior memory.” The idea is to get right-handed people to stimulate the supposed lesser-used right side of their brain by activating the stimulating vibrations with their left hand. This is not the first time people have tried to use “good vibrations” to stimulate the brain. Researches have also experimented with magnetic stimulation and ultrasound stimulation to cure certain types of depression with some degree of success. So where does the sex part come in? The creators of DEXTRUS suggest using the toy similarly in the bedroom to tap in to the left-handed sexual mentality. You can also just use it all over the body as a regular vibrator, but you’re probably going to want to wash it off before bringing it back into work the next day... This is a sex toy that requires buying in to a lot of seemingly outlandish claims, but who knows? They might be on to something...

The wonders of technology help to bring people together, but is it also a key factor in keeping them apart? With today's couples interacting with their devices more than each other, could gadgets and gizmos be the main reason behind the fact that people are having 20% less sex than in 2000*? 20% of US 18-34 year olds have admitted to having used a smartphone during sex (Harris Interactive) and Twitter users on average have shorter relationships than non users (OK Cupid) - is tech just turning us off? A recent poll for Durex (OnePoll) on the UK's sex life revealed shocking statistics including 12% of people had answered a phone during sex, one in ten had read a text and over 5% of respondents had even checked Facebook while making love. Durex believes nothing should get in the way of great sex. So let's log off and switch off. Escape the screen to embrace the dark. This Earth Hour, let's take the opportunity to reconnect while the lights are off. As a call to action, Durex is releasing a short film which follows the stories of several couples who, like most of us, have become distracted by the lure of a screen. The short film can be viewed on YouTube beginning March 19, 2014 at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6VPUTtuKuk #turnofftoturnon. By not only turning off all lights on March 29, 2014, but also switching off all gadgets and gizmos, people can use this opportunity as an excuse to swap their laptops for some loving and ditch their phones to enjoy some foreplay. Ukonwa Ojo, who leads Global Brand Equity Marketing for Durex says: \\"Earth Hour provides the perfect opportunity for couples to switch off for an hour and focus exclusively on reconnecting with each other. What else is as much fun to do in the dark that is as energy efficient as it is energetic?!\\" \\"Earth Hour is a great, yet rare excuse for couples to give each other their undivided attention. With over 80 years bedroom experience, Durex knows physical touch and intimacy are extremely important for feeling connected in your relationship,\\" said Aurore Trepo, marketing director, Durex USA. \\"And with recent survey research revealing our smartphones get more attention than our partners, we want to encourage all of America to turn off and get turned on for March 29. Durex offers everything from lubricants to personal massagers to ensure that when the lights go out couples will be so busy they'll forget to switch the power back on!\\" This film is a passionate plea to escape the screen and embrace the physical.

Stories about being slapped on the wrist for being a lefty aside, there must be some deeper, evolutionary reason, scientists figure. A new study suggests lefties are rare because of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The findings come thanks to some data from the sports world. Representing only 10 percent of the general human population, left-handers have been viewed with suspicion and persecuted across history. The word “sinister” even derives from “left or left-hand.” Researchers at Northwestern University now report that a high degree of cooperation, not something odd or sinister, plays a key role in the rarity of left-handedness. They developed a mathematical model that shows the low percentage of lefties is a result of the balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. Professor Daniel M. Abrams and graduate student Mark J. Panaggio—both right-handers—are the first to use real-world data (from competitive sports) to test and confirm the hypothesis that social behavior is related to population-level handedness. The results are published this week in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface. “The more social the animal—where cooperation is highly valued—the more the general population will trend toward one side,” says Abrams, an assistant professor of engineering sciences and applied mathematics at the McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science. “The most important factor for an efficient society is a high degree of cooperation. In humans, this has resulted in a right-handed majority.” If societies were entirely cooperative everyone would be same-handed, Abrams said. But if competition were more important, one could expect the population to be 50-50. The new model can predict accurately the percentage of left-handers in a group—humans, parrots, baseball players, golfers—based on the degrees of cooperation and competition in the social interaction. The model helps to explain our right-handed world now and historically: the 90-10 right-handed to left-handed ratio has remained the same for more than 5,000 years. It also explains the dominance of left-handed athletes in many sports where competition can drive the number of lefties up to a disproportionate level. Cooperation favors same-handedness—for sharing the same tools, for example. Physical competition, on the other hand, favors the unusual. In a fight, a left-hander would have the advantage in a right-handed world. Abrams and Panaggio turned to the world of sports for data to support their balance of cooperation and competition theory. Their model accurately predicted the number of elite left-handed athletes in baseball, boxing, hockey, fencing, and table tennis—more than 50 percent among top baseball players and well above 10 percent (the general population rate) for the other sports. On the other hand, the number of successful left-handed PGA golfers is very low, only 4 percent. The model also accurately predicted this. “The accuracy of our model’s predictions when applied to sports data supports the idea that we are seeing the same effect in human society,” Abrams says. Handedness, the preference for using one hand over the other, is partially genetic and partially environmental. Identical twins, who share exactly the same genes, don’t always share the same handedness. “As computers and simulation become more widespread in science, it remains important to create understandable mathematical models of the phenomena that interest us, such as the left-handed minority,” Abrams says. “By discarding unnecessary elements, these simple models can give us insight into the most important aspects of a problem, sometimes even shedding light on things seemingly outside the domain of math.” The James S. McDonnell Foundation supported this research. ||||| Share ! tweet (*Exclusively for Right-Handed People) The following article is from our 2014 April Fool’s joke that appeared in hundreds of international news outlets all over the world. Please enjoy this ‘launch’ of the world’s first vibrator that can make you a smarter person — but only if you’re right handed! Explosive new findings for the LELO Global Sex Survey have shown left-handed people are not only more creative and intelligent than right-handers (who make up 90% of the global population), they are also up to 71% more sexually satisfied! To level the playing field and change the world at the same time, LELO is thrilled to announce the launch of ‘DEXTRÜS’ – the first ever vibrator that makes you smart – exclusively for right handed people. How DEXTRÜS will change the world! LELO’s survey results, as verified by Le Gauche Institute, Paris, showed 86% of left-handed respondents claim to be ‘Extremely Satisfied’ with their sex lives, compared to only 15% of right-handed people. That’s because left-handers receive pleasure from the right-side of the brain, which is responsible for more artistic, creative and sensual thinking. Right-handers, on the other hand, experience pleasure through the linear, analytical and logical left side of the brain. Not only is LELO’s survey showing the first ever link between sexual satisfaction and handedness, it also complements an earlier April 2013 study from Ruth Propper and colleagues at Montclair State University, which highlighted the benefits of right-handers using their left hands for various actions. LELO has since partnered with scientists from Sinister College, Oxford, to launch the world’s first ‘right-handed vibrator’, used in the left hand, for pleasure and smartness combined. How DEXTRÜS works: TO MAKE YOU SMARTER: LELO’s new DEXTRÜS vibrator is set to be the first ever sex toy to penetrate the modern work-place, as users squeeze the silicone shell during meetings to enhance their natural spontaneity. Every time pressure is applied to DEXTRÜS, its Right-Squeeze™ technology causes whisper-quiet vibrations to travel through the left-arm and stimulate the right-side of the brain, blocking distractions and encouraging smarter, more creative thought.

TO DELIVER “THE LEFT-HANDED ORGASM”: Following the ground-breaking revelations that left-handers are more sexually satisfied, LELO suggests right-handers continually squeeze DEXTRÜS with their left-hand during love-making. Every squeeze prompts the touch-sensors to emit the same series of powerful vibration patterns that can be applied all over the body, while at the same time allowing the user to access a left-handers’ state of mind.

And that’s not right. Not right at all. When it comes to spontaneity and pleasure, no one should be left behind, so I’m very pleased that LELO has done the right thing by launching an item like DEXTRÜS.” Gary Adroit, President, Coalition for Right-Appendaged People: “With DEXTRÜS, LELO is standing up for rights’ rights to right wrongs subjected to the right-handed peoples of the world, to which I say; right on, LELO!” Olef Thander, LELO’s Head of Right-Handed Research: “On the one hand, we were looking at a massive segment of the population who just couldn’t enjoy our products as much as they should, and on the other hand, we wanted to design a product that right-handers would feel comfortable using in public. While I can count on one hand how many right-handed people I know – only a handful, really – I’ve got to say, it feels pretty good to lend them a hand.” SHARE THE GOOD NEWS!

They asked 10,000 people lots of questions about how satisfied they were with their intimate or private lives. The surprising result was 86% of left-handed people, or people who use their left hand more than their right hand, said they were \\"extremely satisfied\\". But, only 15% of the right-handed people said the same thing. People have some theories why this might be true. Maybe it's because left-handed people have to think more creatively because most things are made for right-handed people. This creativity could then also make their private lives better. The company LELO used this information to design a new toy called DEXTRUS that can stimulate the right part of our brains. It looks like a stress ball and sends out vibrations when you squeeze it with your left hand. The toy is supposed to make right-handed people use the right parts of their brains more, just like the left-handed people do. Separately, another company called Durex is suggesting we should all turn off our gadgets and devices for Earth Hour, to focus more on our loved ones and improve our private lives. They found that too much device use is causing people to have less physical affection compared to 20 years ago. Scientists also believe that left-handedness is rare because it shows a balance between cooperation and competition in human evolution. The fact that only 10% of human population is left-handed could be because our societies value cooperation or people working together more than competition or people working against each other. For example, many sports teams have more left-handed players because sports often involve competition. In short, whether it's because of using certain parts of the brain more or because we evolved to cooperate better, these studies suggest that left-handed people often report being more satisfied in their private lives. But, all of us, no matter if we're left-handed or right-handed, can work on improving our happiness and satisfaction too!"},{"prompt":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC. Question: Why the disappointed father was angry? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The disappointed father was angry because his child did not get accepted into the Part-time Evening Elementary School, and he believed that only children of VIPs (wealthy and influential people) were accepted into the school."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. she brings this energy with her into c3, when she delivers training in danish culture, general cultural awareness and global team development. How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","completion":"The correctly capitalized sentence should read: \\"She brings this energy with her into C3, when she delivers training in Danish culture, general cultural awareness and global team development.\\" Here's the detailed explanation: 1. \\"She\\" starts with a capital \\"S\\" because it is the first word of the sentence. This is the basic rule that the first word of any sentence starts with a capital letter. 2. The term \\"C3\\" is already capitalized correctly as it most likely refers to a certain organization, company, project or place, which are types of proper nouns that need to be capitalized. 3. \\"Danish\\" is capitalized because it is used as a descriptor for \\"culture\\" and it refers to a specific nationality or country—Denmark. Country names and adjectives derived from them are always capitalized in English. 4. All other words in the sentence are not capitalized because they are common nouns or they don't fall under any category that requires capitalization per English grammar rules. Words like \\"culture,\\" \\"awareness,\\" and \\"team\\" are all common nouns and thus don't require capitalization unless they start a sentence or are part of a title or proper noun. Similarly, \\"and,\\" \\"in,\\" and \\"when\\" are a conjunction, preposition, and subordinating conjunction respectively, and these types of words are typically not capitalized in sentences unless they're the first word. 5. The word \\"global\\" is a descriptive adjective for \\"team development\\" and doesn't need to be capitalized because English rules do not require adjectives to be capitalized unless they are a part of a title, proper noun, or start a sentence. 6. Finally, the period at the end of the sentence is properly placed to indicate the end of the sentence. So, to conclude, capitalization rules in English state that the first word of each sentence, names of specific entities or proper nouns, and adjectives derived from proper nouns need to be capitalized in a sentence. All other words do not generally require capitalization unless they start a sentence or are part of a title or proper noun. Therefore, this is the corrected version of the sentence: \\"She brings this energy with her into C3, when she delivers training in Danish culture, general cultural awareness and global team development.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Book store: Although people can discuss and analyze poetry in a book store, it is not necessarily the most likely place for younger people to analyze a poet. 2. University: Universities are known for hosting discussions and analysis sessions on various topics, including poetry. This could be a possible location for younger people to analyze a poet. 3. Home: Homes can be a setting for gatherings and discussions, but are not typically the primary place where younger people would analyze a poet. 4. Classroom: Classrooms are another strong possibility, as teachers often lead discussions and analyze poets with younger people as part of their curriculum. 5. Speakeasy: A speakeasy is a hidden or secret establishment that sells alcohol, which is not typically a place where younger people would analyze a poet.

Answer the following question: Like many other inventors before him, professor Slawomir Suwak designed only the things he needed himself. He had several patents on his conscience already: an automatic cork opener for wine in the indicative state, a portable set of board games for solving personality problems, a wallet with a mini-device for the duplications of 100 zloty bills, and a piece of equipment \\"the day after\\" used to irretrievably eliminate from the time-space continuum days burdened with a hangover. Now came the time for a mini-device preventing the development of symptoms of psycho-motor aggression. The device was really simple. It weighed about a kilo and was the size of a bag of flour. It was to be worn on the right wrist. The fact it had to be the right wrist was very important. Otherwise, the invention didn't work properly, or even worse, it produced results opposite to its intended effect. Each day, its mini-containers had to be re-filled with substances promoting positive processes in the body leading to the return of good mood. There were three containers to re-fill, and the substances were not available on the local market and had to be imported using diplomatic channels from the USA. To operate the device, turning it on stand-by was enough. In that mode, it could be used continuously for one and a half hours. To recharge the batteries, you needed a charger, which was stored in a small suitcase. The device, when it was turned on, made a low murmur (or according to some - a loud growl) designed to keep the owner in a good mood. Professor Suwak called his new baby \\"mini-anti-aggressor.\\" The McPhilips corporation expressed its interest in the product early on, even when it was still at the drawing-board stage. The company partially financed the purchase of sub-assembly elements from its subsidiary specializing in the productions of components for technologically advanced products.

While the other gods are joyful, Zeus' jealous brother Hades plots to overthrow Zeus and rule Mount Olympus. Turning to the Fates for help, Hades learns that in eighteen years, a planetary alignment will allow Hades to locate and free the Titans to conquer Olympus, but only if Hercules does not interfere. Hades sends his minions Pain and Panic to dispose of Hercules. The two succeed at kidnapping and feeding him a formula that turns him mortal, but fail to remove his superhuman strength before Hercules is found and adopted by the farmers Amphitryon and Alcmene. Years later, the teenaged Hercules becomes an outcast due to his strength, and wonders where he came from. After his foster parents reveal the necklace they found him with, Hercules decides to visit the temple of Zeus for answers. The temple's statue of Zeus comes to life and reveals all to Hercules, telling him that he can regain his godhood by becoming a \\"true hero\\". Zeus sends Hercules and his forgotten infant-hood friend Pegasus to find the satyr Philoctetesâ\\"Phil\\" for shortâwho is known for training heroes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Employees feel frustration as: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. Directors follow a stringent hierarchy B. a new SVP is hired C. not enough information D. The organization grows and divides A:","completion":"C. not enough information The frustration within organizations often arises due to not enough information being shared and a lack of communication between different levels of hierarchy. As an organization grows, maintaining open channels of communication and ensuring that all employees feel engaged and valued can become increasingly challenging. However, this can be addressed with relatively simple solutions that promote a more transparent and inclusive environment. One approach is to create spaces and opportunities for employees to voice their ideas, concerns, and opinions. Encouraging a culture of open dialogue and feedback across all levels of the organization can help in bridging the gap between senior management and other employees. Regular town hall meetings, skip-level meetings, and suggestion boxes are some ways to achieve this. Another method to improve the organizational dynamic is to implement a flatter management structure that minimizes bureaucracy and empowers decision-making at lower levels. This can lead to increased innovation, productivity, and employee satisfaction, as individuals feel more involved in shaping the organization's future. Additionally, providing ongoing training and development opportunities can play a crucial role in fostering employee engagement. By investing in employees' growth, organizations demonstrate their commitment to the workforce and create a sense of shared responsibility and ownership. Moreover, recognizing and rewarding the contributions of employees helps in boosting morale, increasing motivation, and ensuring that their efforts are acknowledged and valued. Implementing both formal and informal recognition programs can have a significant impact on employees' job satisfaction and, in turn, on organizational success. In summary, while it is common for organizations to experience challenges as they grow, fostering a culture of open communication, employee engagement, and empowerment can help bridge the gap between leadership and employees. Providing transparent information flow, enabling decision-making at all levels, investing in employee development, and recognizing achievements are key ingredients to creating an inclusive and dynamic organization where both leaders and followers can thrive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Bailey needed every cent to pay taxes and didn't cut the tenants any breaks. Given the context: How would Others feel as a result? Possible answers: are shrewd and tactful with her money and tenants, put out, are strict and miserly towards the tenants The answer to this question is:","completion":"As a result, others might feel that Bailey is being strict and miserly towards the tenants since she is unwilling to provide any financial relief or understanding in regards to their rent payments. Elaborating on the possible answers, we can analyze how people could perceive Bailey's actions from different perspectives: 1. Shrewd and tactful with her money and tenants: Some people may view Bailey in a positive light, admiring her ability to handle her finances effectively. They might consider her as a person who is conscious about her financial responsibilities, like paying taxes, and ensuring that her tenants are equally responsible for their rent payments. In this case, people could perceive Bailey as a business-minded individual who prioritizes her financial stability over cutting tenants any breaks. 2. Put out: On the other hand, some people may feel put out by Bailey's actions as she is unwilling to offer any leniency towards her tenants. This could make them question her empathy and compassion as a landlord, especially if the tenants are going through difficult financial situations themselves. People with this perspective may think that Bailey prioritizes her interests above the wellbeing of her tenants, creating a sense of discontent and frustration. 3. Strict and miserly towards the tenants: The majority of people might consider Bailey as being overly strict and miserly towards her tenants due to her inflexibility in providing any financial assistance or understanding. This perception could lead to the belief that she is focused solely on protecting her assets rather than nurturing a supportive and understanding landlord-tenant relationship. People with this viewpoint may perceive Bailey as a cold-hearted individual who lacks compassion for the human element in her business dealings. In conclusion, Bailey's actions of not cutting her tenants any breaks in order to pay taxes can create mixed feelings among others. Some may appreciate her attention to financial matters and consider her a responsible landlord, while others may be frustrated and perceive her as strict, miserly, and lacking empathy for her tenants' situations. Ultimately, the perception of Bailey's actions would depend on individual values and beliefs around responsibility, empathy, and the role of a landlord in supporting their tenants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Determine the circumstances of Balder's death In Norse mythology, Balder was the son of Odin and Frigg and was known for his beauty, gentleness, and wisdom. Balder had a dream warning him of his impending death. Upon discussing this with his mother Frigg, she made everything in the world swear an oath not to harm Balder. However, Frigg overlooked the mistletoe. Loki, the god of mischief, learned of this vulnerability and crafted a dart or an arrow from mistletoe. He then approached Höðr, who was blind, and offered to assist him in joining the gods' games, where they were throwing various objects at Balder, knowing they couldn't harm him.

Susan ate yesterday at the restaurant. OPT: + unacceptable; + acceptable;","completion":"A linguist would find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically: Susan ate yesterday at the restaurant. This sentence could be labeled as \\"acceptable.\\" Let's analyze it according to standard English grammar rules. The sentence consists of a subject (Susan), a verb (ate), an adverb indicating the time (yesterday), and a prepositional phrase indicating the place (at the restaurant). The sentence adheres to the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) structure, which is common in standard English. 1. Subject: Susan The subject of the sentence is \\"Susan,\\" which is a proper noun representing a person. This satisfies the requirement for a subject in a grammatically correct English sentence. 2. Verb: ate The verb \\"ate\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to eat.\\" This verb is transitive, meaning it requires an object to complete its meaning. However, in this sentence, the object is implied and not explicitly stated. In context, the sentence means that Susan ate something (most likely a meal) at the restaurant. The missing object is due to ellipsis, which is a grammatical feature that omits redundant information. This is acceptable in English as long as the missing information can be inferred from the context. 3. Adverb: yesterday The adverb \\"yesterday\\" modifies the verb \\"ate\\" and indicates the time when the action took place. Placement of adverbs in English can be flexible, and it is acceptable to place an adverb of time between the subject and the verb or after the verb. 4. Prepositional Phrase: at the restaurant The prepositional phrase \\"at the restaurant\\" consists of a preposition (\\"at\\") and a noun phrase (\\"the restaurant\\"). This phrase provides additional information about the location where the action took place and is a common way to denote location in English. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Susan ate yesterday at the restaurant\\" is grammatically acceptable in English, as it consists of a subject, verb, adverb, and prepositional phrase in a structure that adheres to standard English rules. The missing object, which can be inferred from context, is due to ellipsis, a common feature in the English language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities—such as velocity—so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose first venture was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public? from the following article ? The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany. When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill – the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\". In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind.

Do these questions have the same meaning? How does a catabolic and an anabolic pathway differ? What are the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways? Choose from: *no; *yes;","completion":"Yes, the two questions essentially have the same meaning, as they both ask for the differences between catabolic and anabolic pathways. Here is a detailed and comprehensive comparison of catabolic and anabolic pathways: 1. Definition: Catabolic pathways (catabolism) involve the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones, whereas anabolic pathways (anabolism) involve the synthesis of complex molecules from simpler precursors. 2. Energy: Catabolic pathways release energy in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate) or other high-energy molecules, while anabolic pathways generally require the input of energy in the form of ATP to synthesize the new molecules. 3. Function: The primary function of catabolic pathways is to provide energy and building blocks needed for cellular processes, while anabolic pathways function to maintain and create cellular structures and biochemical molecules that are necessary for the growth and repair of cells and tissues. 4. Chemical Reactions: Catabolic reactions are typically exergonic, which means they release energy, while anabolic reactions are often endergonic, requiring the input of energy to proceed. 5. Enzymes: Different types of enzymes catalyze catabolic and anabolic reactions. Catabolic enzymes, often called hydrolases, break down large molecules, while anabolic enzymes, commonly referred to as synthases, facilitate the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller precursors. 6. Examples of Processes: Catabolic processes include digestion of food, glycolysis (breaking down glucose to generate ATP), and cellular respiration. Anabolic processes include protein synthesis, DNA replication, and the synthesis of lipids and carbohydrates. 7. Hormones: Key hormones regulate catabolic and anabolic processes. Examples of hormones that promote catabolism include cortisol, glucagon, and adrenaline. Hormones that favor anabilosm include insulin, growth hormone, and testosterone. 8. Cellular Location: Catabolic and anabolic pathways may occur in different cellular locations within a cell. For example, glycolysis, a catabolic pathway, occurs in the cytoplasm, while the synthesis of fatty acids, an anabolic pathway, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum. 9. Significance in Metabolism: Catabolic and anabolic pathways work in coordination to maintain the balance between the breakdown of substances and their synthesis, which is crucial for maintaining optimal health and homeostasis in an organism. In conclusion, while the two questions have the same meaning, it is essential to understand the various aspects that differentiate catabolic and anabolic pathways, including their molecular processes, energy requirements, and hormonal regulation. The balance between the two pathways is crucial for overall metabolic homeostasis and health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How do you do this: How to properly clean a piece of pork?","completion":"To properly clean a piece of pork, follow these steps: Step 1: Gather necessary items - Obtain a cutting board, preferably one used specifically for raw meats - Have a sharp knife ready - Collect paper towels or clean cloth towels - Prepare a clean working surface - Make sure to have a sink with running water (cold or cool water is ideal) Step 2: Inspect the pork Before cleaning, examine the pork for any signs of spoilage, including off odors, sliminess, or an unusual color. If any of these signs are present, discard the pork as it may be unsafe to consume. If the pork appears to be fresh, proceed to the next step. Step 3: Remove excess fat and connective tissue Place the pork on the cutting board. Using a sharp knife, carefully trim away any excess fat or silver skin (thin, silvery membrane) on the pork. Keep both the pork and the cutting board away from other foods or surfaces to avoid cross-contamination. Step 4: Rinse the pork Hold the pork under cold running water, gently rubbing the surface to remove any dirt, stray hairs, or small bone fragments. It's important to note that rinsing is a controversial step, as it can potentially spread bacteria to other surfaces. Some people prefer to pat the pork dry instead. If you choose to rinse, be sure to clean and sanitize your sink and surrounding area afterward. Step 5: Pat the pork dry After rinsing, use paper towels or a clean cloth towel to gently pat the pork dry. This step helps remove any remaining surface bacteria and also allows for more even cooking. Step 6: Dispose of any trimmings Dispose of the used paper towels, fat, and connective tissues in a trash bag. Wash and sanitize the knife and cutting board, as well as any other utensils or surfaces used during the cleaning process. Step 7: Store or prepare the pork Immediately cook the clean pork, or store it in the refrigerator (at a temperature below 40°F/4°C) wrapped in plastic or butcher paper until you are ready to cook it. It is best to use or freeze the pork within a day or two. By following these steps, you can ensure that you are properly cleaning a piece of pork in a safe, hygienic manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

With his distinctive raspy voice and a stage show that features guillotines, electric chairs, fake blood, deadly snakes, baby dolls, and dueling swords, Cooper is considered by music journalists and peers alike to be \\"The Godfather of Shock Rock\\". He has drawn equally from horror films, vaudeville, and garage rock to pioneer a macabre and theatrical brand of rock designed to shock people. - Vaudeville is a theatrical genre of variety entertainment. It was especially popular in the United States and Canada from the early 1880s until the early 1930s. A typical vaudeville performance is made up of a series of separate, unrelated acts grouped together on a common bill. Types of acts have included popular and classical musicians, singers, dancers, comedians, trained animals, magicians, strongmen, female and male impersonators, acrobats, illustrated songs, jugglers, one-act plays or scenes from plays, athletes, lecturing celebrities, minstrels, and movies.

In this meaning, it involves both the benefactor in their identifying and exercising their values, and the beneficiary in their receipt and benefit from the service or goods provided. A conventional modern definition is \\"private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality of life,\\" which combines an original humanistic tradition with a social scientific aspect developed in the 20th century. The definition also serves to contrast philanthropy with \\"business\\" endeavors, which are private initiatives for private good, e.g., focusing on material gain, and with \\"government\\" endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on provision of public services.

The reviewer appears to be quite disappointed and dissatisfied with their experience at the restaurant, which they decided to try based on positive Yelp reviews. Several key aspects contribute to the negative sentiment of the review: 1. Disappointment: The reviewer explicitly states that they are \\"totally disappointed.\\" This indicates that their experience at the restaurant was not up to their expectations, and they feel let down by both the Yelp reviews that influenced them and the restaurant itself. 2. Lack of flavor: The review conveys the dissatisfaction with the food by emphasizing that there was \\"no flavor at all.\\" When emphasizing the lack of taste, it becomes apparent that the reviewer believes the food to be bland and undesirable. 3. Comparison to good Chinese cooking: By suggesting that \\"those reviewers never had good Chinese cooking,\\" the person who wrote the review seems to question the credibility of the positive Yelp reviews they initially read before trying the restaurant. This implies that the experience was disappointing not only in comparison to their expectations but also in comparison to other Chinese cooking they have tried. 4.

Title: Mother and Son Movie plot: The film opens on two human forms, which soon reveal themselves to be that of a young man and a frail old woman. They recline in a silence broken only by whispers and indistinguishable noises. The young man is the son (Alexei Ananishnov) who is taking care of his exhausted sick mother (Gudrun Geyer). Her illness is undefined and from time to time causes her great pain as she gasps for air. Her son combs her hair, feeds her, covers her with a coat, and takes her in his arms. She is totally dependent on him as he himself was once totally dependent on her. As the film progresses, the son carries his mother on a long journey from her sickbed to her deathbed. It is a circular motion which travels a long walk through a dreamlike landscape in the countryside, along winding dirt roads. At each of their brief stops on the journey is a moment of contemplation, caresses, and tender murmurs. These soft murmurs tell of the mother's love for her son when she was nurturing him and of the son's love for his mother as he opens for her the mysterious path to her death. They progress under the leaden and luminous sky of the Baltic, in totally isolated landscapes. From time to time, there is a far away train or a sail on the sea, emphasizing further their isolation from the rest of the world. They return to the house. The son tenderly lowers his mother into her bed that now seems to resemble a coffin. Although he tries to reassure her to the contrary they both know that the end is coming. He leaves her and goes for a long solitary walk. When he returns he weeps for his mother who's died.

Everytime I get close to a girl, I push them away due to a lack of self esteem, what can I do to gain confidence with girls?","completion":"While the two questions appear to be related to self-confidence issues, they do not have the exact same meaning. The first question is a broader inquiry about managing shyness and building general self-confidence, while the second question is more specific, focusing on self-confidence in the context of romantic relationships and interactions with the opposite gender. Let's discuss both questions in detail. 1. How do I control my shy nature and gain self-confidence? To control your shy nature and boost your self-confidence, consider the following steps: a. Self-reflection: First, identify the root cause of your shyness and lack of self-confidence. Is it due to past experiences, negative thoughts, or social anxiety? Understanding the underlying cause of your shyness is the first step in addressing the issue. b. Avoid comparing yourself to others: Focus on your own personal development and growth rather than dwelling on the accomplishments or characteristics of others. Constant comparison can lead to low self-esteem and decreased confidence. c. Develop positive self-talk: Cultivate positive affirmations and self-talk to counteract any negative thoughts. This helps in rewiring your brain to think more positively about yourself and boosts your self-esteem. d. Set personal goals: Set achievable goals for yourself and work towards them. As you accomplish your goals, you'll naturally feel more confident in your abilities. e. Embrace failure: Don't shy away from trying new things because you're afraid of failure. Embrace failure as a natural part of the learning process and use each failure as an opportunity for self-improvement. f. Practice social skills: Engage in social activities and practice these skills to overcome your shyness. It may be helpful to start with small, informal gatherings before moving to larger events or more intimidating social situations. g. Work on body language: Improve your body language by standing tall, making eye contact, and offering a genuine smile. This nonverbal communication will not only make you appear more confident but also make you feel more confident. h. Seek professional help: If necessary, consider seeking advice from a professional therapist or counselor, who can provide valuable guidance and support in your journey to overcome shyness and improve self-confidence. 2. Every time I get close to a girl, I push them away due to a lack of self-esteem, what can I do to gain confidence with girls? To gain confidence in your interactions with girls, you can take the following steps: a. Enhance general self-confidence: First and foremost, work on improving your overall self-confidence (as discussed in response to your first question), as this can automatically have a positive effect on your interactions with girls. b. Build genuine connections: Focus on getting to know the girl as a person rather than as a potential romantic partner. This will help alleviate some pressure and allow you to build a genuine connection based on common interests and shared experiences. c. Improve communication skills: Practice active listening, maintain eye contact, and project your voice clearly and calmly. This shows that you're engaged in the conversation and helps in establishing a positive rapport. d. Get out of your comfort zone: Put yourself in social situations where you're likely to interact with girls and build your confidence in various contexts, such as parties, clubs, workshops, or even online. e. Practice empathy: Try to understand and empathize with the feelings of the girl you're interacting with. This will make your conversations more meaningful and show that you genuinely care about her thoughts and emotions. f. Accept and embrace rejection: Understand that rejection is a natural part of any interaction and doesn't define your worth. Learn from rejection and use it to improve your communication skills. g. Seek guidance from friends or mentors: Talk to friends or trusted mentors who have more experience in building successful relationships with the opposite gender. They can offer valuable insights and advice on improving your skills and confidence. h. Consider professional help: If your lack of confidence with girls is significantly impacting your everyday life or causing severe anxiety, don't hesitate to seek advice from therapists or counselors specializing in relationships and social dynamics. In conclusion, while both questions point towards self-confidence issues, they address different aspects of confidence-building. The first question deals with overcoming shyness and building general self-confidence, whereas the second question is specific to boosting confidence in romantic interactions and relationships with the opposite gender. It is essential to address both aspects to achieve a comprehensive improvement in your overall confidence and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process mentioned is the formation of a tropical cyclone (also referred to as a hurricane or typhoon, depending on the region). Here's a detailed breakdown of the process: 1. Thunderstorms form over the ocean: Warm, moist air over the ocean rises, creating areas of low pressure beneath. This rising air then cools and condenses, forming clouds and thunderstorms. 2. An area of low pressure causes rotation: The Earth's rotation causes the Coriolis effect, which imparts a spin to the rising air masses, creating a rotation around the area of low pressure. 3. Several thunderstorms come together around this area: As the rotating air continues to pull in more moisture and energy from the warm ocean water, multiple thunderstorms group together, creating a larger and more organized weather system. 4. The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating: The warm ocean water provides the necessary fuel for the storm to intensify. The heat from the water causes more water to evaporate, which rises and cools, releasing latent heat in the process. This heat release further fuels the development and intensification of the storm. Final Step: Formation of a tropical cyclone (hurricane or typhoon): As the storm continues to gather strength and organizes itself around a central core, it becomes a tropical cyclone. This is characterized by a well-defined circulation with a calm central eye, surrounded by a wall of powerful thunderstorms and strong winds. The tropical cyclone will continue to grow and intensify as long as it has access to warm ocean waters and favorable atmospheric conditions. Once the cyclone moves over land or into cooler waters, it will lose its energy source and gradually weaken and dissipate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

At a spring conference in Liverpool, Ms Lucas will say the two parties could \\"forge a new grouping in Parliament\\". The Greens are polling in similar numbers to the Lib Dems and say their membership quadrupled in the past year. But the party's leader Natalie Bennett has faced criticism of her performance in recent weeks. She struggled in a radio interview to explain how a flagship policy to build 500,000 new social rented homes would be funded, later attributing her performance to an \\"excruciating mind blank\\". The leader of the Green Party on Liverpool council, John Coyne, said he had been \\"taken aback\\" by her \\"excruciating\\" performance and she had clearly been \\"underprepared\\". He told the BBC that it wouldn't happen again as Ms Bennett - who could take part in a TV debate with other party leaders should they go ahead - would in future rehearse her performance in mock interviews. \\"It's a failure that she was underprepared we know why that happened and we know it will be fixed for the future,\\" Mr Coyne - a former Liberal Democrat who is now chair of the Green Councillors Association - said. Main pledges \\"It was a serious failure and we thought it might be damaging to us but one thing that perhaps is saving us from that is people who are attracted to the Green Party tend to have a more generous disposition anyway tend to be able to forgive a mistake.\\" In her conference speech, Ms Bennett will say her party offers a \\"message of hope and real change\\" and would create \\"a political system that puts the public first\\". The Green Party in England and Wales is fielding its largest ever slate of candidates, aiming to stand in 90% of parliamentary seats on 7 May. The Green parties in Scotland and Northern Ireland are separate organisations. In her address, former leader Ms Lucas will say the Green Party should join forces with the SNP in the next Parliament to maximise their influence on the next government. \\"With the rise of the SNP, and with our own Green surge, we have the chance to forge a new grouping in Parliament. A progressive alliance. \\"Of course, in Scotland and in Wales we'll be fighting hard for our distinctive values and policies.

Summarize this article: Talk to the girl about where she feels comfortable going. Choose a location where the girl will likely feel comfortable, such as your home or a hotel room. Make sure you'll be alone and uninterrupted while you're hooking up. For instance, you might take her to your home or you might ask to go back to hers. If you can't take her home, you could rent a hotel room or arrange to go to a friend's home. Consent is essential when you’re hooking up. Don’t assume that she wants to have sex just because she agrees to be alone with you. Pay attention to her words and body language to see if she’s into it. When in doubt, ask her directly if she wants to have sex. Signs she’s into it include smiling, initiating kissing and physical contact, asking you to do sexual things to her, and getting close to you. Signals she’s not into it include pulling away, looking away from you, and changing the subject. You could just ask, “Do you want to have sex?” or “Do you want to take this to the bedroom?” Hooking up can be super fun, but it’s important to avoid potential complications. Talk to the girl before you become intimate to decide what kind of protection you'll use. Ask her if she is currently on birth control pills, has received a birth control shot, or has an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy. Additionally, wear a condom or dental dam to protect you against sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). Even if the girl is on birth control, it’s typically best to use a barrier form of protection to protect against STDs anyway. Start by kissing her on the hand, arm, or cheek. Then, give her a passionate kiss on the lips. If you’re both into it, kiss her in other intimate places, like her neck, breasts, or thighs. Go slow at first. Give her a light kiss and gauge her reaction. Don’t use tongue when you first start kissing her. Build up to it so she doesn’t feel like you’re rushing things. She’s going to be more interested in a hookup if she feels sexually excited. Don’t rush things by trying to start intercourse too soon. Instead, take your time to caress her, kiss her body, and rub against her. This will help her get into the mood for sex. For instance, start by gently caressing her body. Then, move from kissing her lips to making a trail of kisses down her neck, chest, stomach, and thighs. Simply shift her clothing or remove it as you go. Don't just get up an leave after a hook-up. Instead, talk to the girl to make sure she enjoyed it. Then, clean yourself up and get dressed. If you're at her place, thank her for having you over before you leave. If you're at your place, offer to help her get home safely. If you've gotten a hotel room, ask her if she'd prefer to stay overnight or go home. Both your and her experience will be better if you part on good terms. Show her that you care about her health and well-being by helping her get home. Offer to drive her home or to call her a ride if she can't drive herself home. If she's got her car and feels comfortable driving herself home, walk her to her car and ask her to text when she gets home. If you stay the night together, talk to her before you fall asleep so you both understand each other's expectations for the morning after. For instance, decide if you're both okay with the person who slept over leaving without waking the other. While you might not be interested in a relationship, it's still important to be kind to the girl you hooked-up with. Tell her that you enjoyed meeting her and had a good time. Additionally, ask her if she had a nice time so she feels like you care about her. You might text, \\"It was great meeting you last night! I had a great time and hope you did, as well.\\" You don't have to have a long conversation with her. However, sending a check-up text shows her that you don't just see her as an object. Summary:","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of creating a comfortable environment for both parties during a hook-up, and highlights the significance of consent, communication, and protection against STDs and pregnancy. It advises to pay attention to body language and verbal cues to assess the girl's interest and level of comfort.

Ensuring mutual enjoyment and maintaining a friendly and respectful attitude after the hook-up is essential for a good experience on both sides. Additionally, taking responsibility for the girl's safe return home and following up with a kind message are recommended to show genuine care and consideration for her well-being."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

Title: Munich Movie plot: A scene from the film representing the Mossad team from 1972. From left to right: Avner Kaufman, Robert, Carl, Hans and Steve. Munich begins with a depiction of the events of the 1972 Munich Olympics and then cuts to the home of Prime Minister of Israel Golda Meir, where Avner Kaufman (Eric Bana), a Mossad agent of German-Jewish descent, is chosen to lead an assassination mission against 11 Palestinians allegedly involved in the massacre. To give the Israeli government plausible deniability and at the direction of his handler Ephraim (Geoffrey Rush), Avner resigns from Mossad and operates with no official ties to Israel. His team includes four Jewish volunteers from around the world: South African driver Steve (Daniel Craig), Belgian toy-maker and explosives expert Robert (Mathieu Kassovitz), former Israeli soldier and \\"cleaner\\" Carl (CiarÃ¡n Hinds), and a Danish document forger named Hans (Hanns Zischler). They are given information by a shadowy French informant, Louis (Mathieu Amalric). In Rome, the team shoots and kills Wael Zwaiter, who is broke and living as a poet. In Paris, they detonate a bomb in the home of Mahmoud Hamshari; in Cyprus, they bomb the hotel room of Hussein Abd Al Chir. With Israel Defense Forces (IDF) commandos, they pursue three Palestinians to BeirutâMuhammad Youssef al-Najjar; Kamal Adwan; and Kamal Nasser, a Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) spokesmanâpenetrating the Palestinians' guarded compound and killing all three. Between hits, the often-reluctant assassins argue about the morality and logistics of their mission, expressing fear about their individual lack of experience, as well as ambivalence about accidentally killing innocent bystanders. Avner makes a brief visit to his wife, who has given birth to their first baby. In Athens, when they track down Zaiad Muchasi, the team finds out that Louis arranged for them to share a safehouse with their rival PLO members, and the Mossad agents escape trouble by pretending to be foreign terrorist groups like ETA, IRA, ANC, and...

Whether it's planting vibrant flowers, carefully cultivating vegetables, or creating peaceful, green spaces, gardening is an art form that brings life, color, and texture to any landscape. A well-crafted garden can serve as an inviting escape for homeowners while simultaneously attracting admiration from friends, family, and passersby. In today's digital age, it's easier than ever to showcase and share your creative accomplishments through blogging—all the while learning from, inspiring, and engaging with a gardening community that shares your passion. In this article, we'll break down how to design and create an eye-catching garden display, capture it effectively in digital format, and launch a successful blog to share your progress and enthusiasm with the world. 1. Start Crafting Your Garden Display The journey to a breathtaking garden showcase begins with setting a clear goal for your landscape. Consider your available space and resources, then decide what type of garden display would suit your environment and personal preferences. Here are three styles to contemplate: a. The Container Garden – If you're short on space, a container garden can be an excellent solution. With this approach, you'll cultivate a variety of plants in pots and creatively arrange them on balconies, patios, or terraces to create a visually appealing display. b. Themed Garden – Themed gardens showcase plants and garden features with a specific focus, such as color schemes, symbolism, or regional influences. These can be an excellent choice if you want to make a unique statement and showcase your personal interests or ideas. c. Edible Landscape – Vegetable and herb gardens are not only practical but also artistically appealing. Combine flowers, vegetables, and herbs in inventive ways to create an eye-catching, edible display. No matter what style you choose, start with a well-planned layout that includes paths, benches, or other functional elements to create a welcoming, comfortable space. Use color combinations, height variations, and eye-catching containers or garden props to enhance visual interest. 2. Capture Your Garden's Beauty As your garden comes to life, it's crucial to document its progress and development. Photography is one of the best ways to convey the essence and flair of your blooming masterpiece. Consider the following tips for photographing your garden: a. Light it up – The quality and type of light can have a significant impact on garden photography. Early morning and late afternoon sunlight are ideal for capturing warm, soft images. b. Use different perspectives – Experiment with various angles and viewpoints to capture interesting shots. Get up close to focus on the details of individual plants or step back to showcase your entire garden layout. c. Pay attention to composition – A well-composed photograph is crucial for capturing your garden's spirit effectively. Use the rule of thirds, selective focus, and leading lines to create visual balance and interest. 3. Launch Your Garden Blog Starting a garden blog is an excellent way to share your passion, discoveries, and progress with a broader audience. Follow these steps to establish and grow a successful garden blog: a. Choose a platform – There are many blogging platforms available today, such as WordPress, Blogger, or Wix. Pick one that suits your style, technical prowess, and budget. b. Craft a compelling design – Your blog's design should reflect the aesthetics and themes of your garden. Customize color palettes, font selection, and layout to create a cohesive, visually appealing appearance. c. Develop engaging content – Write informative and entertaining posts about your gardening journey, including tips on design, plant selection, and garden maintenance. Share your photographs and consider creating video content or tutorials to engage your audience further. d. Promote and engage – Engage with gardening communities on social media, join gardening forums, and collaborate with fellow garden bloggers to increase your exposure and interact with like-minded enthusiasts. Conclusion Crafting a unique garden display offers many rewards, from personal satisfaction and rejuvenation to recognition and admiration from others. By capturing your garden's progress and sharing it through a blog, you can inspire, entertain, and educate fellow garden enthusiasts while building a diverse and supportive community. Embrace the creative process, consistently hone your skills, and watch your garden—and your blog—bloom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: She checked PayScale, and its free report that compares her pay with others holding a similar job title said that someone with her experience should be making 50,000 to 60,000. Then she went to see her manager. “I was a little nervous going in, but I had done my research,” Ms. Morrison, 27, said. She got the title she wanted and a raise to within the pay range she suggested. “If I had gone in without the information, the conversation would have been, ‘I feel like I am not making enough money,’ ” Ms. Morrison said. More extensive salary surveys are done for corporations, but a regular employee could not hope to buy the information from any of the other major compensation companies like the Hay Group or Mercer. “We wouldn’t give it to you,” said Iain Fitzpatrick, general manager of the reward information service division of Hay. The compensation companies do not want their information being used against bosses negotiating salaries. “The last thing we want is for a client to say, ‘We just had a conversation with an employee who was quoting Hay data,’ ” Mr. Fitzpatrick said. Unlike Salary.com, which obtains its information from a variety of surveys of corporate human resource departments, PayScale collects the information directly from people seeking the data. If you want PayScale’s salary information, first you will have to tell them what you make. A basic report is free, but the company charges 20 for a more detailed analysis. PayScale, which supplies its data to job listing sites like CareerBuilder.com, Jobster.com and SimplyHired.com, says it uses search engine technology and a rules-based algorithm to match requests for data in a database of 5.5 million profiles. Executives at Salary.com, which provides its data to job boards at America Online, Yahoo, HotJobs.com and Monster.com, take issue with the new approach. Their survey found 96 percent of human resources departments do not trust user-reported data. William Coleman, senior vice president for compensation at Salary.com, said, “People get information wrong.” He said they often did not understand what benefits or bonuses they were getting, so he considered any self-reporting to be suspect. But Joe Giordano, the founder, chairman and also vice president for product development at PayScale, said its information was accurate. “People come onto PayScale with no incentive to lie because they want high-quality information,” he said. The company checks the information for inconsistencies, tossing out extremes. It said that about 50 percent of submissions were not included, but that it got enough, about 300,000 a month, that no single filing could influence the overall result. “We collect more in one day than some companies collect in a year,” said Michael Metzger, the chief executive. It takes about six minutes to fill in its questionnaire. PayScale asks for your title, the number of years in the field and your city. It then asks you to better define your job. If you said software programmer, it wants to know what kind of programmer and what programming languages you know. People in professions with a profusion of titles are asked more questions. Finally, it asks you questions about your employer, your education, and, of course, your salary and benefits. Then it computes the results and displays them on a graph so you can see the range. A senior software engineer in Silicon Valley with 20 years of experience makes 88,531 to 106,364. A benefits claims examiner in Indianapolis, who has been on the job for a decade, makes 41,122 to 54,821. Although Salary.com argues that its paid results are more accurate, its free Salary Wizard tool yields results that can barely differ: for example, a range of 84,289 to 107,711 for the programmer and 40,091 to 52,942 for the examiner. PayScale, which gets about a third of the traffic that Salary.com does, says it has information on jobs not usually found in corporate salary surveys like pornographic film actor (average salary: 63,275), rabbi (average salary: 98,610) and crossing guard (average hourly wage: 9.21), but so far no chick sexers, mimes or bloggers are in its roster. “We don’t get many boiler makers, but we get the jobs that are out there in volume,” Mr. Giordano said. PayScale data also say that a chief executive in New York City averages 248,278. When you stop laughing, it quickly becomes apparent what the big problem with this site is. It is most accurate where it has lots of data. The company acknowledges that it is very good with high-tech jobs, health care and nonprofits because a lot of people from those professions have visited the site and filled out the questionnaire. Only 22 chief executives in New York City have bothered, and none apparently clocked more than a mere 235 an hour. “It is only as good as what people are contributing,” said James Holincheck, a research vice president at Gartner who follows the compensation industry. (Salary.com’s result was a bit more realistic: a range of 417,459 to 1,266,936.) But the sites are meant for the average person, not titans of finance and industry. “It’s like the Kelly Blue Book for compensation,” Mr. Giordano said. Like that reference manual for used-car prices, the salary sites give you a good idea of where to start the negotiations confidently. Persuading the boss you need more money demands more than a report from an online service. You have to think about the kind of company that employs you. A start-up might pay lower salaries because employees have a chance to make a killing on options when it goes public or is sold. Some companies have a policy of high turnover, so raises are rarely in the offing. Mr. Coleman suggests that people think about quality-of-life issues, as well as the money. For instance, sometimes it is easier for an employer to give an additional week of vacation rather than a 2 percent raise. A workweek condensed into four days might hold some value even though you will work no less — and probably will work more. “Money isn’t everything, but it isn’t nothing,” he said.

The idea that Earth is a magnet is far from new. It was first proposed in 1600 by a British physician named William Gilbert. Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

Complete the following sentence. It was important to prepare for the Chemistry exam as it was tough but the Biology was easy so Paul only prepared for the Possible answers: [i] tough exam.. [ii] easy exam..","completion":"The completion of the sentence would be: \\"It was important to prepare for the Chemistry exam as it was tough, but the Biology exam was easy so Paul only prepared for the tough exam..\\" However, to make the context clearer, let's dive deep into this: Preparing for an examination is a crucial task, especially when it comes to different subjects that individually demand specific focus and intensive study. The scenario here describes two subjects - Chemistry and Biology, both of which have different levels of difficulty for Paul, the person in question. Chemistry, considered as a tough subject due to its complex theories and formulas, needed real attention and rigorous exercise in order to get a good handle on. It required Paul to put in considerable effort into understanding the various chemical reactions, atomic structures, and bonding mechanisms amongst other things in order to excel. Adequate preparation in such a case was important, given that lack of understanding and not being able to reason with chemical equations could lead to confusion and poor performance in the exam. On the other hand, Biology was deemed easy by Paul. This could mean that Paul found studying Biology less challenging in comparison to Chemistry. Maybe he found it easier to comprehend its concepts, memorize facts, or understand various biological processes, and so did not see the need to prioritize his time towards preparing for the Biology exam. But to clarify, saying Paul only prepared for the Chemistry doesn't necessarily mean he ignored studying for Biology completely. It could simply mean that he prioritized his study time and efforts more towards Chemistry considering the challenges it posed, while dedicating enough time to revise Biology. In nutshell, given the varying difficulty levels of the two subjects for Paul, it would be sensible to conclude that \\"It was important to prepare for the Chemistry exam as it was tough, but the Biology was easy so Paul only prepared for the tough exam.\\" Here, preparation for the \\"tough exam\\" does not underestimate the importance of the \\"easy exam,\\" but rather defines Paul's strategic approach towards handling his exams based on their levels of difficulty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays.","completion":"To determine which farmer didn't spray plants thoroughly with an insecticidal soap solution, let's analyze the information provided step by step. Step 1: Understanding the problem - Pam and Mary are both gardeners dealing with aphid infestations. - Mary had more aphids and used every method and insecticide available with limited success. Step 2: Analyzing the hint provided - The hint emphasizes that insecticide control of aphids is difficult, and missing small areas can lead to a rapid population recovery. - It also mentions that for small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days might be enough. - An insecticidal soap solution can be effective but must be applied thoroughly, and it only kills aphids on contact, with no residual effect. There is also a risk of plant damage under certain conditions. Step 3: Determine which farmer didn't spray thoroughly with an insecticidal soap solution - Mary used every method and insecticide available; it would be safe to assume that this includes using an insecticidal soap solution. However, the limited success indicates that she might not have sprayed the solution entirely or that some aphids were resistant to the insecticides used. - The information provided about Pam is not sufficient to conclude whether or not she used an insecticidal soap solution. However, it is not mentioned that she had limited success like Mary. Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Mary might not have sprayed plants thoroughly with an insecticidal soap solution, since her methods had limited success and she still had a significant aphid problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Of course not – because there weren’t any. This year, I’m again offering more free jokes for the Oscar show. And good news – my favorite host Billy is Crystal is back for a ninth time. I wrote these especially for him, and I know that he’ll appreciate them. So Billy – please feel free to read, laugh and lift. No strings. Maybe you can give the Fox411 a shout-out if you have time, but no pressure. Our readers will know where they came from, and I guarantee you that the audience (and the world) will be grateful. 1. Good evening and welcome to the 84th Annual Academy Awards, or as I get to call it: “Mission Impossible Nine: Host Protocol.” 2. Security is especially tight, because there are people who want to keep the Oscars from being an exciting, entertaining and magical night. So James Franco is watching the show from home this year. 3. Tonight we celebrate the best drama from 2011. Ironically, much of it occurred while preparing for the Oscar telecast. Hollywood hasn’t seen people hired, fired and replaced so fast since “The Help.” 4. One of the biggest stories of the year has to be the success of “The Artist.” Such an unlikely Oscar contender. No big stars, no color, no dialogue and looks like it’s a hundred years old. It’s like watching this year’s Republican primary. 5. There are so many big stars here tonight, like George Clooney - nominated for best actor in “The Descendants.” In the film, he plays a man whose wife falls into a coma and may never wake up. It turns out that he had just made her watch “Syriana.” 6. “Moneyball” is up for six awards tonight, including best actor for Brad Pitt and best supporting actor for Jonah Hill. The only person not happy was Angelina. Turns out that she had wanted Jonah be their sitter on Oscar night. 7. There’s Meryl Streep, who celebrates her record 17th nomination for her portrayal of Margaret Thatcher in “The Iron Lady.” It’s funny, when she was offered the role of the toughest skirt in 1980’s Britain, she thought she was being asked to play Boy George. 8. Also in the best actress category, Glenn Close for “Albert Nobbs.” If she loses, she’ll tie the record for actress with most nominations without a win. Good news for you Glenn – I don’t know anyone who voted for you. 9. In the best supporting actor category is Christopher Plummer, nominated for “Beginners.” He plays a man who comes out of the closet at the age of 75. It’s his gayest role since Captain von Trapp in “The Sound of Music.” 10. One of the most-talked performances of year has got to be Octavia Spencer’s in “The Help.” Not only is she a great actress, but she’s incredibly gracious. If she doesn’t win, she’s promised to leave the show early to help make pastries at the Governor’s Ball. 11. The hilarious film “Bridesmaids” is up for two awards tonight. It’s about a group of self-absorbed women who plan for a wedding in which everything goes wrong. The working title was “The Kardashians.” 12. Iran has an entry in the foreign language film category. “A Separation” deals with issues like divorce, child custody, domestic violence and manslaughter. Iranian President Ahmadinejad described it as “the best comedy of the year.” 13. As usual, we do expect the show to run late. How late? Let’s put it this way: “Midnight in Paris” could actually be named best picture at midnight in Hollywood. 14. By the time the show is over, all your burning Oscar questions will finally be answered. The only thing we’ll still be asking is, “What was the meaning of ‘The Tree of Life?’”","completion":"This article is about someone named Dr. Oscar who writes funny jokes for the hosts of the Academy Awards, but those jokes never get used on the show.

In fact, we had to borrow money to reach our destination town. Anyway, it was my husband, two boys aged four and two, and myself, seven months pregnant , in an old Volvo station wagon. We had been driving for two days in the middle of winter (that car's heater didn't work), and we had taken a route that was very _ . There was nothing around for miles-no cars, buildings or signs of civilization. Suddenly, our car started losing power and the gauges went all out of order. We saw a light in the distance and managed to roll to a stop in front of this property that looked like a small simple house. Our cell phones had not gotten reception for many miles, and it was freezing outside, so I didn't know if we were going to make it out of this situation alive. My husband got out of the car to see if there was something he could do to get us rolling again, but it was not looking good. A short while later, a man came out of the house and spoke with my husband a bit before inviting us all into his home. He and his wife took us in, fed us, and made us feel at home as we struggled to find some way to get to our destination, which was still a few hours' drive away. We were able to call a friend and get a ride, leaving our broken car behind, but not before the couple gave us food and water for our journey.

Shawn Vancour argues that the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century served to harm the music industry through inadequate representation. Why was the commercialization of classical music harmful to the music industry according the Shawn Vancour?","completion":"To analyze and understand why Shawn Vancour believes that the commercialization of classical music was harmful to the music industry, let's break this down step-by-step: Step 1: Define the issue The issue being discussed here is the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century. Commercialization generally refers to the process of making something profitable or driven by market forces. Step 2: Identify the main argument Shawn Vancour believes that this commercialization was detrimental to the music industry, especially in the context of inadequate representation. Step 3: Delve into the possible reasons for the argument There could be multiple reasons as to why Shawn Vancour feels the commercialization of classical music was harmful, based on inadequate representation: 1. Narrow focus on profit: The music industry may have been more focused on making money rather than preserving or promoting the art form. This could lead to a limited selection of classical works being recorded and distributed, which in turn results in a lack of diversity and exposure to lesser-known composers or pieces of music. 2. Market-driven choices: The focus on creating commercial value could have led companies to prioritize popular or well-established works over lesser-known pieces. This would again result in a narrow representation of the genre's full potential and diversity. 3. Undermining artistic merit: The commercialization could weaken the perceived value or importance of classical music as an art form. When profitability becomes a primary focus, it can overshadow the importance of preserving the cultural and artistic integrity of the music. 4. Homogenization of taste: When commercial forces dominate the representation of classical music, there's a risk that the selection of works becomes more homogeneous, driven by what sells best rather than what's artistically significant or diverse. In conclusion, according to Shawn Vancour, the commercialization of classical music in the early 20th century was harmful to the music industry because it led to inadequate representation of the genre. This claim is based on the idea that the commercial focus on profitability may have limited the exposure of lesser-known composers and pieces, as well as undermined the artistic merit and diversity inherent to classical music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Josh Movie plot: Indra (Jeet) and Rajib (Anshuman) are the thickest of friends studying in the same college. When Indra comes to the city to visit Rajib, Indra notices Rajib's sister, Anu (Srabanti Chatterjee), and is attracted to her instantly. When Rajib visits his home village, Indra visits along with him. Anu, who returns from Singapore, is impressed by Indra, who continually impresses her, based on her tastes. He gets along well with Rajib's and Anu's family, in the meanwhile convinces them that he would make a prospective groom for Anu. Anu's family, mainly her brother and cousin, are involved in regional gangs in their village. When Anu takes out Indra to the temple for a visit, without the knowledge of their brother (Tapas Paul), Anu is then attacked by Rudra's brother Nikhil (Bharat Kaul) gets hold of Anu and threatens to kill Anu. In a swift action of bravery and skill, Indra knocks down Rudra's brother. After this incident, Anu's brother, gives Indra a talk about why things are so violent in the village. He explains how he is a master's degree holder from a prestigious university (Pune) and how his wife is also a master's degree holder in integrated mathematics. Unfortunately, due the nature of the villages, the rivalry is deadly and fatal. He ultimately says, even though the villages are violent, he will remain a noble person, with high ideals.

Indra makes the promise to Anu's brother that he will take up the responsibility of Anu and that he will eventually marry her. In the process, he also becomes a rival of Rudra as he kills his younger brother Nikhil to protect Anu. After the tragedy, Indra and Anu head back to Kolkata city to attend Indra's sister's marriage.

Tools and materials: - Fabric, leather, or synthetic materials - Lining materials - Sewing machine (for stitching) - Hardware (buckles, clasps, metal rings) - Zipper - Strap material - Embellishments or accessories 3. Cut the materials: After choosing the materials, use your design as a reference to cut out the pattern pieces for the backpack. Tools and materials: - Scissors or rotary cutter - Cutting mat - Pattern pieces or templates - Fabric markers or chalk - Pins 4. Sew the backpack: Following your design, sew the pattern pieces together, attaching hardware and other elements as needed. This step requires knowledge of sewing techniques, and if working with materials like leather, you may need specialized tools. Tools and materials: - Sewing machine - Thread - Sewing needles (for hand sewing) - Specialized tools for working with leather (if using leather): Leather needles, hole punch, leather stitching awl, etc. - Thimble and needle pullers (to protect your fingers) - Seam ripper (in case of mistakes) -_CLAMPARATOR=- 5. Add finishing touches: After the backpack is assembled, add any embellishments or accessories for decoration and attach the straps.

News article: Remembering the Air Florida crash, 30 years later Today marks the 30th anniversary of the Air Florida crash in Washington, D.C. In that historically significant accident, Air Florida Flight 90 struggled to lift off after departing from National Airport in snowy and icy conditions. The plane hit Washington's 14th Street Bridge shortly after takeoff and then crashed and sank in the icy Potomac River. VIDEO: 1982 report on Air Florida crash The crash killed 78 people – 74 crew and passengers from the flight as well as four people who had been in their cars on the bridge. Five survived the crash, and their dramatic rescue was captured live by a TV crew that had been stuck in rush-hour traffic near the bridge. Rush-hour traffic began early that day and was unusually heavy following the federal government's decision to release workers early because of the snow. The tragedy left lasting legacies on two fronts. The breaking live-from-the-scene TV reports were – perhaps – a hint of how news would increasingly be delivered to viewers in the modern era. But, more important, many industry experts say the crash spurred the adoption of new safety protocols that have dramatically enhanced aviation safety. THE WASHINGTON POST: 30 years after Air Florida crash, skies safer than everTHE WASHINGTON POST: Air Florida survivors reflect on crash that changed their livesTHE WASHINGTON POST: A crash's improbable impactTHE WASHINGTON POST: See the Post's coverage from 1982 The Washington Post, which has a series of excellent pieces on the crash's 30th anniversary, writes: While most air disasters quickly become historical footnotes, aviation safety experts say few crashes have left a legacy as sweeping as Air Florida Flight 90. Though some of the lessons may seem simple, such as communication and management skills, it helped break down an authoritarian cockpit culture dominated by captains. Over time, the principles learned from the disaster gradually migrated to other modes of transportation and into businesses, even hospitals. In a separate article on the story, the Post adds: There are at least three reasons that in 2012 your plane shouldn't be covered with ice: better chemicals to keep the ice off, stricter regulations and better training for ground and cockpit crews. \\"All three of those have evolved significantly over the last 30 years,\\" Tom Hendricks, senior vice president for safety, security and operations at Airlines for America, says to the Post. (Read the full version of that compelling report on that in the Post). THE WASHINGTON POST: Crash of Air Florida Flight 90 The Post also runs an interesting recap on the survivors. Among the many interesting anecdotes from the story is one involving flight attendant Kelly Duncan, the only crewmember to survive the flight. She tells the Post writes that as she was floating in the Potomac, she remembers seeing people on the bank. She says at first she became angry they weren't helping – even though, in hindsight, there was little they could realistically do. Another survivor – Joseph Stiley, now 72 – tells the Post he can't definitively tell what memories are actually his – or ones that stem from seeing the crash after-the-fact on TV. \\"I remember coming out of the airplane. I remember the [rescue] helicopter. . . . I remember the ambulance. I remember seeing the lights in the hospital. I remember a lot of other things related to the Air Florida crash, but I don't know how much of that was because of the coverage,\\" he tells the Post. And, of course, there's the story of Lenny Skutnik, a bystander who ultimately jumped into the river to help the survivors. One eyewitness – WTOP radio reporter Dave McConnell – says he'll never forget. He had been covering an event in downtown D.C. when he was told to head to the bridge. \\"I was absolutely shocked to see the bodies that had been taken from the icy waters... I think that was the most disturbing scene that I had ever witnessed,\\" McConnell says in a WTOP story. He adds: \\"What happened to those people, what happened out on the banks of the Potomac, that happened here in Washington, it's something that I don't think I'll ever forget.\\" NEW BOOKMARK: Add Today in the Sky to your favorites TWITTER: You can follow me at twitter.com/TodayInTheSky What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The news article marks the 30th anniversary of the Air Florida crash in Washington, D.C., which occurred when Air Florida Flight 90 struggled to lift off in snowy and icy conditions and subsequently crashed into the 14th Street Bridge and the Potomac River.

Question: I have a new situation: Different wavelength electromagnetic radiations have different uses. John is a physicist. He needed to find appropriate wavelength electromagnetic radiations for his experiments. To that end, he selected three electromagnetic radiations, microwaves, infrared light, and visible light. He noted microwaves as case A, infrared as case B, and visible light as case C. But I can use this background: Infrared (IR) light is electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, which corresponds to a frequency range between 430 and 1 THz respectively. IR wavelengths are longer than that of visible light, but shorter than that of microwaves. Infrared may be detected at a distance from the radiating objects by \\"feel.\\" Infrared sensing snakes can detect and focus infrared by use of a pinhole lens in their heads, called \\"pits\\". Bright sunlight provides an irradiance of just over 1 kilowatt per square meter at sea level. Of this energy, 53% is infrared radiation, 44% is visible light, and 3% is ultraviolet radiation. What is an answer for this question: Which wavelengths would be longer, case B or case C? Answer:","completion":"The wavelengths of Case B (infrared light) would be longer than Case C (visible light). Infrared light has a wavelength range between 0.7 and 300 micrometers, while visible light has a wavelength range between approximately 380 to 750 nanometers (0.38 to 0.75 micrometers). Since infrared light has longer wavelengths than visible light, Case B has longer wavelengths compared to Case C."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Premise: \\"There was a column of mere padding about \\"The Styles Poisoning Case,\\" but nothing further. \\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"\\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column was an incredible piece of investigative journalism.\\"?","completion":"If the premise \\"There was a column of mere padding about 'The Styles Poisoning Case,' but nothing further\\" is true, it tells us several things about the hypothesis \\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column was an incredible piece of investigative journalism.\\" Let's analyze these implications in detail. 1. Lack of depth and substance: The fact that the column is described as \\"mere padding\\" suggests that its content lacks depth and substance. In other words, the column may not offer any fresh insights, new discoveries, or critical analysis of the case. For a piece to be considered an incredible piece of investigative journalism, it would typically need to delve deeper into the subject matter, uncover new information, and provide in-depth analysis that goes beyond superficial observations. 2. Insufficient information: The phrase \\"but nothing further\\" implies that the column did not expand beyond basic or preliminary information about the case. Investigative journalism is characterized by extensive research, document examination, and interviews with various sources to gather and verify accurate information. The premise implies that the column did not meet these criteria and offered little substantial information about \\"The Styles Poisoning Case.\\" 3. Lack of impact: A hallmark of exceptional investigative journalism is its ability to bring attention to previously unknown or unexplored aspects of an issue, ultimately leading to public interest, policy changes, or further conversation. In this case, the premise suggests that the column did not advance the understanding of the \\"Styles Poisoning Case,\\" indicating that it may not have the impact typically associated with outstanding investigative journalism. 4. Potential focus on sensationalism: The inclusion of \\"mere padding\\" in the description of the column may also imply that the column contained irrelevant or sensational information designed to attract readership, rather than focus on the facts of the case and solid investigative work. Exceptional investigative journalism should be built upon accurate, fact-based reporting and should not rely on sensationalism or exaggeration to draw attention. 5. Questionable credibility: As a result of lacking depth, offering insufficient information, and potentially relying on sensationalism, the credibility of the column may be called into question. Excellent investigative journalism maintains high standards of accuracy, fairness, and professionalism that contribute to its credibility and trustworthiness. The premise suggests that the \\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column may not meet these standards. In summary, if the premise is true, it significantly undermines the hypothesis that \\"The Styles Poisoning Case\\" column was an incredible piece of investigative journalism. The column, as described in the premise, lacks the depth, substance, and impact typically associated with high-quality investigative reporting. As a result, it is unlikely that the column entails the hypothesis of being a remarkable piece of investigative journalism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

She is unable to forgive him for abandoning the family and leaving her mother to a hard life and early death. This situation changes when Pesh-Chidin and a dozen of his followers (who have left the reservation) pass through the area, ritualistically killing settlers and taking their daughters to be sold into sex slavery in Mexico. Among those captured is Maggie's eldest daughter, Lilly. Maggie's rancher boyfriend Brake Baldwin was among the settlers killed. The U.S. Cavalry refuses to help retrieve the captive women as its resources are tied up conducting forced relocation of captive Native Americans. This leaves Maggie, her father, and her younger daughter Dot alone in tracking the attackers. The group unexpectedly meets up with Kayitah, a Chiricahua, and an old friend of Jones, who also happens to be tracking the attackers with his son Honesco, because among the captives is a young Chiricahua woman who is engaged to Honesco.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra? ? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the Gänsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the Gänsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important Gänsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man—a thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".","completion":"The name of the person that Reinhard Keiser was directly instrumental in securing their post in the Gänsemarkt orchestra is George Frideric Handel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The incident occurred during the funeral of a youth who died in the hospital Saturday night after he was allegedly beaten by members of the Indian paramilitary Central Reserve Police Force during violent protests last week. The family of 25-year-old Rafiq Bangroo said CRPF troopers struck him on the head with gun butts, causing a fatal skull injury. The CRPF has denied the allegation, saying Bangroo died after he was pelted with stones. Bangroo's body was handed over to relatives. As it was being carried for burial Sunday, angry mobs charged at a bunker of the CRPF and attempted to burn it, police said. The CRPF troopers manning the bunker opened fire on the crowd. Five people were injured, and one, a 26-year-old man, later died. \\"They tried to torch the bunker after damaging it. Our soldiers opened fire in self-defense,\\" CRPF spokesman Prabhakar Tripathi told CNN. As the clashes started spreading Sunday, Indian security forces were rushed to the area to enforce an undeclared curfew. Hundreds shouting \\"We want freedom\\" joined the funeral procession. Bangroo's death triggered impromptu protests in various parts of the city. Police and paramilitary troops used tear gas and baton charges and fired warning shots in the air in some spots to break up the angry protesters, according to authorities. The Kashmiri separatist group All Parties Hurriyat Conference has called for a Kashmir-wide shutdown Monday to protest the killings. Srinagar has been tense over the past week following the killing of another youth, a 17-year-old student who died June 11 after being struck in the head by a police-fired tear smoke shell.

Question: \\"Which 16th century English composer's works include 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' and the Christmas mass Puer Natus est Nobis\\"\\"?\\" Answer:","completion":"The 16th century English composer whose works include 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' and the Christmas mass 'Puer Natus est Nobis' is Thomas Tallis. Born around 1505 and passing away in 1585, Tallis is considered one of England's most important and influential composers of his time, particularly in the area of sacred choral music. His compositions were created during a period of significant religious transition in England, as the country was going through the Reformation, which shifted the nation's religious practices from Catholicism to Protestantism and back multiple times. Thomas Tallis primarily worked as a church musician and held several important positions during his career. He served as an organist and singer at the Dover Priory before transitioning to a similar position at St. Mary-at-Hill Church in London. In 1540, he became a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, a prestigious post that he held for over four decades. In this role, he composed and performed music for the monarchs of England, including King Henry VIII, Edward VI, Queen Mary, and Queen Elizabeth I. 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' is an elaborate votive antiphon that was composed in the late 1540s to early 1550s. It is notable for its rich polyphony and expansive structure. The piece demonstrates Tallis' mastery of various choral techniques, such as imitative counterpoint and contrasting textures. The text of 'Gaude Gloriosa Dei Mater' is devotional and focused on the Virgin Mary, indicative of the composer's Catholic background. 'Puer Natus est Nobis' is a Christmas mass that showcases Tallis' talent in creating rich and complex choral works. Set to the text of the Latin Gradual and Alleluia for the Feast of the Nativity, this mass is an exquisite example of the composer's ability to fuse together intricate polyphony with the simplicity and solemnity of plainchant. The piece features seven voice parts, utilizing the full range of vocal textures and harmonies available during the time in which it was composed. Tallis' works are renowned for their beauty and spiritual depth and have had a lasting impact on the development of English choral music. Many of his pieces have remained in the standard repertoire of choirs throughout the centuries, testament to their enduring quality and influence. Notable compositions by Tallis include 'If ye love me,' 'Spem in alium,' 'Lamentations of Jeremiah,' and 'O nata lux.' His music bridges the late Renaissance and early Baroque periods, demonstrating the range and adaptability that makes Tallis such a pivotal figure in the history of English sacred music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: Anna Kendrick looked like she was resting in between interviews in a downtown Chicago hotel room on Monday, but the 25-year-old actress, who earned an Oscar nomination for her role in \\"Up in the Air,\\" insisted she was laid out on the couch for a different reason. \\"My hero just texted me ‘happy birthday,' \\" said Kendrick, swooning. Kendrick, who declined to name the texter, put her phone away and sat up for the interview. This left plenty of room on the couch for her \\"Scott Pilgrim vs. the World\\" co-star Jason Schwartzman — not that he needed it. Schwartzman opted to kneel on the floor and lean against a coffee table. It fit his quirky personality, as did his \\"Magnum, P.I.\\"-like mustache. \\"I got to go to Lollapalooza (Sunday),\\" said Schwartzman, 30. \\"… I heard all the bands stay in one hotel and hang out in the lobby together and go to see each other's shows.

But Schwartzman's character, music mogul Gideon Gordon Graves, isn't a stereotypical movie bad guy. Graves comes off as nice and charming at times, even if he is probably faking it. \\"I tried to find a balance between being someone who would be the final bad guy and at the same time not make him overtly predictable,\\" he said. \\"He's passive aggressive as opposed to clearly threatening. He doesn't see Scott (Michael Cera) as a true opponent.

Along the way, he gets advice from his gossip-loving sister, Stacey, played by Kendrick. She was asked to read for the role after director Edgar Wright (\\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" \\"Hot Fuzz\\") saw her in 2007's Unlike some of her co-stars, Kendrick didn't have to swing a sword or throw any flying punches for her role — and that was perfectly fine with the \\"Twilight\\" actress. \\"They worked so hard in these uncomfortable contraptions (for the fight scenes),\\" Kendrick said of her co-stars. \\"I had nothing but respect for what they did. But I was very happy to be sitting in a comfortable chair rather than strapped to a harness flipping around.\\" \\"There were so many harnesses around, it felt like we were in an episode of (HBO's) ‘Real Sex,'\\" said Schwartzman. The fight sequences were exhausting and potentially dangerous, according to Schwartzman, but he and Cera still managed to laugh between takes. Schwartzman, known for his roles in kept thinking that none of his high school friends would have believed he would end up in an elaborate battle scene one day. He's never been in a fight or even close to it, though he did get shoved recently at a Guitar Center in Los Angeles. \\"I opened the door for someone and then bumped into a guy who was staring at the RockWalk memorabilia,\\" said Schwartzman, getting up to re-enact the incident. \\"I said 'Sorry,' and then the guy pushed me really hard with his elbow.

While we release your officers’ information, we will hold no responsibility of the actions of those that see the information.” That information included names, ages, street addresses, email addresses and social media accounts, as well as the names and addresses of officers’ family members. It’s unclear if the information was obtained via a data breach or through publicly available sources, Cincinnati Police Lt. Steve Saunders told Cincinnati.com. The incident that prompted the Anonymous action involved the somewhat contentious details surrounding Gaston’s death. While video of the incident shows Gaston initially on his knees with his hands behind his head as cops approach him, police said he reached toward his waistband for what they believed to be a weapon before they shot him. Video evidence appears to back up the officers’ assertions. After his death, authorities discovered Gaston was carrying a pellet gun designed to look like a real weapon. Anonymous included footage of the shooting – which police had previously released – as part of its video message. “For far too long we have sat idle by letting the gang known as the Thin Blue Line murder citizens of United States without allowing them due process,” the video transcript said. “Well, we have a message to not only the Cincinnati Police Department but to every law enforcement officer.

When Russia attacked the Ottoman Empire in 1853, King Otto of Greece saw an opportunity to expand North and South into Ottoman areas that had large Greek Christian majorities. However, Greece did not coordinate its plans with Russia, did not declare war, and received no outside military or financial support. Greece, an Orthodox nation, had considerable support in Russia, but the Russian government decided it was too dangerous to help Greece expand its holdings.:32–40 When the Russians invaded the Principalities, the Ottoman forces were tied down so Greece invaded Thessaly and Epirus. To block further Greek moves, the British and French occupied the main Greek port at Piraeus from April 1854 to February 1857, and effectively neutralized the Greek army. Greeks, gambling on a Russian victory, incited the large-scale Epirus Revolt of 1854 as well as uprisings in Crete. The insurrections were failures that were easily crushed by the Ottoman army. Greece was not invited to the peace conference and made no gains out of the war.:139 The frustrated Greek leadership blamed the King for failing to take advantage of the situation; his popularity plunged and he was later forced to abdicate.

However, the French government forces Dreyfus to reinstate Clouseau as the Inspector of the Sûreté (as they had been planning to anyway, much to Dreyfus' chagrin) so that he can go to the fictional Middle Eastern nation of Lugash to investigate the theft of the fabled Pink Panther diamond, which has once again been stolen.Clouseau's investigation at the Lugash National Museum, which he nearly destroys with his klutzy ways, lead him to believe that Sir Charles Litton (Christopher Plummer), the notorious Phantom, is re-creating the most infamous heist of his career. Clouseau is delighted at this, and sees this as his only chance to get his revenge on Litton for framing him and temporarily sending him to prison (in the first Pink Panther film). Although Clouseau fails to uncover any leads into the theft, his bumbling allows him to survive several attempts on his life by a mysterious assassin.

His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase.

The university student, 21, pleaded guilty to accessing details of Frances Abbott's scholarship. Newman was sentenced to a two-year good behaviour bond in November. Article:","completion":"Title: Freya Newman Rebuilds Her Life with a Greens Internship: Lee Rhiannon Provides Second Chances Senator Lee Rhiannon of the Australian Greens party recently confirmed that Freya Newman, a university student, has secured a coveted position as an intern in The Greens’ office. The announcement comes after a competitive application campaign that saw more than 160 applicants vying for the part-time, paid position. Newman's tenacity and resilience stood out amidst intense competition, leading to her successful selection. The fact that her starting date is set for April is seen as a testament to both her commitment and the party's faith in her skills and potential. The internship, which was publicly advertised in November, garnered significant attention from a diverse group of candidates. Its attractiveness largely stems from the opportunity to work directly with veteran politician Lee Rhiannon, whose decades-long commitment to public service, social justice, and environmental issues have earned her a place among the country's most respected lawmakers. Newman, who is just 21 years old, spoke about how she knew the opportunity to learn from someone of Rhiannon's caliber would provide invaluable experience. The appointment carries symbolic implications beyond Newman's personal achievement. Only a few months ago, the young university student found herself in legal trouble that could have dismantled her career prospects before they had even begun. Newman pled guilty to accessing private scholarship information of Frances Abbott, daughter of former prime minister Tony Abbott. While the incident arose from a whistleblower attempt to reveal perceived favoritism in the awarding of scholarships, the fallout was significant. Apologizing for her actions and demonstrating responsibility for the consequences, Newman was eventually sentenced to a two-year good behaviour bond in November. However, her actions threw her into the public eye for all the wrong reasons, creating a powerful stain on what was once a promising academic and career trajectory. Newman's opportunity to intern with Senator Rhiannon and the Greens represents more than just a second chance. It's a powerful statement about the capacity of individuals to learn from their mistakes and rebuild their lives, even after public scandals. It's also a bold testament to the Greens' commitment to offering opportunities to individuals regardless of their past, viewing them as more than the sum of their history. Senator Rhiannon’s decision underscores the party's ethos of social justice, which asserts that everyone deserves to experience the benefits of learning and growth, no matter the mistakes they've made in the past. It also demonstrates her belief in Newman’s potential to contribute positively to society and the work of the Greens. By deciding to offer Newman the internship out of a pool of more than 160 applicants, Senator Rhiannon is providing a strong vote of confidence in Newman’s future. It speaks volumes about Rhiannon's faith in Newman's potential to not only learn from her past but also to meaningfully contribute to the Greens' work. In an era where public figures are constantly under scrutiny and a single negative event can taint a reputation, Newman's appointment offers a different narrative. It extends an opportunity for redemption and rebirth, fortifying the idea that falling does not discount one from rising again. And, this part-time gig at the Australian Greens' office may just be the 'Phoenix rising from the ashes' moment in Newman's life. The internship will not erase Newman's past but it will certainly provide her with a platform to demonstrate that she’s more than her mistakes. It’s a crucial step towards re-establishing herself in the public sphere. With Senator Lee Rhiannon's strength to swim against the current, a promising narrative of reformation begins to take shape. The tale of Freya Newman is undoubtedly forming an inspiring chapter in the book of 'second chances'."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the event where Ash Carter was sworn in as Defense Secretary, Vice President Biden was seen placing his hands on Stephanie Carter's shoulders and leaning close to whisper something in her ear. This seemingly innocent action ignited a firestorm of speculation and outrage regarding Biden's ability to control his mouth and hands, particularly with someone as high-profile as the wife of the Defense Secretary. This incident comes as new taunts about Biden's long-standing desire to become president emerged. Critics have pointed out that he has been running for the position since even before some of them could vote, further questioning whether or not Biden possesses the necessary restraint, diplomacy, and professionalism needed for the highest office in the land. In a somewhat related development, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus made light of the situation by poking fun at Hillary Clinton during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Priebus jokingly noted that Clinton wouldn't enjoy speaking at CPAC as there was an 'insufficient croute de te' and 'the lemon wedges were cut quite at the right angle.' It remains to be seen how, or if, these latest incidents will impact Biden's political career and what further challenges he will face in the ongoing quest for the presidency.

A:","completion":"Large waterways can be divided into various types that include both rivers and streams. While rivers are generally larger compared to streams, it is essential to note that they both contribute to the overall structure and function of waterways. In the context of the provided answer choices, the most appropriate categorization for dividing large waterways would be: - Lakes: These are typically large bodies of water that are surrounded by land. They can be either natural or man-made and can accumulate water from various sources, including rivers and streams. - Body water: This term broadly encompasses all types of water bodies, including large waterways such as rivers, streams, lakes, and even oceans. As a category, body water serves as a reasonable way to divide large waterways, as it accounts for the wide variety of water bodies that can be found on Earth. - Oceans: These are vast bodies of saltwater that cover around 70% of the Earth's surface. While not generally regarded as a subdivision of large waterways, they do serve as an essential component within the broader scope of natural water systems. - Creeks: These are typically smaller watercourses that are in some cases, considered minor tributaries of larger rivers. Creek classification can vary, depending on regional conventions, but they can generally be understood as subdivisions of larger waterways. - Streams: These are smaller watercourses that can be tributaries of larger rivers. They often form intricate networks of water flow, connecting various parts of a water system. As an answer choice, streams would be the most appropriate way to categorize large waterways, given their function within broader water systems. Therefore, the best answer for dividing large waterways from the given options would be \\"streams.\\" Although lakes, body water, oceans, and creeks can also be considered components of water systems, rivers being the primary focus of large waterways can be best divided into rivers and their tributaries, which are streams.
