Why is turning a profit on ownership not a good thing?","completion":"The term \\"rent-seeking\\" has nothing to do with a landlord renting out a property. The term is a little antiquated these days. Imagine the era of Adam Smith (18th century) who defined 3 categories of income: wages (from employment), profit (from risk taking), and rent. The later term \\"rent-seeking\\" means using political influence to gain some unearned value, or extra value, using political force (regulations, subsidies, etc). \\"Gordon Tullock originated the idea in 1967, and Anne Krueger introduced the label in 1974. The idea is simple but powerful. People are said to seek rents when they try to obtain benefits for themselves through the political arena. They typically do so by getting a subsidy for a good they produce or for being in a particular class of people, by getting a tariff on a good they produce, or by getting a special regulation that hampers their competitors.\\" - from The Library of Economics and Liberty Examples of \\"rent-seeking\\" today would be Cronyism, where government awards contracts because of the political relationship, rather than best value for money. Hypothetically, if a salary were paid to an unqualified person who provides no value, simply because they were the son of a US President, then the person could be said to be a rent-seeker using his connections."},{"prompt":"Why is abortion such a big deal in America?","completion":"Q: Why is abortion such a contentious issue in the United States? A: Most people will answer this question incorrectly. The democrats blaming evil republicans and the republicans blaming evil democrats. The answer is: Americans never got a chance to decide. Compare this with Britain. Britain passed a law. For better of for worse, for one outcome or the other, voters had their day. Voters had their decision. Legislation was passed. It became a law. One side had its victory, one side was told “no”. Now laws can be repealed. But it still has an air of legitimacy either way until voters decide to take the issue up again as the voting public can or cannot do. America never had this. Americans were robbed by a thief in the night. There is no abortion legislation in America. In 1973, there was no bill that went to committee. There was no Senate co-sponsor. There was no House reconciliation. There was no committee. There was no debate. There wasn’t any of that. Richard Nixon was President in 1973. He didn’t sign the bill. He didn’t veto the bill either. There was no bill. The legislative process was entirely usurped. The lack of a bill or debate is going to add massive amounts of inflamed constituents. Here, watch this video. Note that there is no room for Roe v. Wade in this video:"},{"prompt":"Do soldiers pick up fallen enemy weapons to use if they are out of ammo on their weapons?","completion":"In Finland, during WW2, captured Russian weapons and ammo came in very handy indeed. Without them, the country would have been lost. Only stinking rich or damn stupid armies can afford to not pick up enemy weapons. In the beginning of Operation Barbarossa, the Germans captured millions of Russian Mosin Nagant rifles, which they sometimes scrapped, sometimes just dumped in a hole in the ground and covered with dirt. Using lousy Communist guns was just beneath them, but a few years later, the guns could have been used to equip the Volkssturm, in stead of wasting the already limited resources producing ersatz rifles. Unsurprisingly, Germany was occupied. Around the same time, the Finns were capturing truckloads of the same rifles, many of which had only been fired once and were in practice in mint condition. The rifles were issued to the men, as was the captured ammo, with the result that the Russians were killed with guns and ammo they themselves had made. Tokarev pistols, Nagant revolvers, SVT semiautomatic rifles and Degtaryev light machine guns all became extremely popular with the men, because they were surprisingly good. Captured Russian artillery and tanks also turned out to be great weapons. Finland didn’t waste resources making guns that could be captured from the enemy at no cost whatsoever, so of course, Finland didn’t get occupied. At the end of the war, Germany had only a fraction of the guns it had in the beginning, whereas Finland had more hardware than ever. In the end, we made peace, turned the captured Russian guns against the Germans and started capturing some more hardware. I think it’s safe to say, Finland was the only Axis country that came out of the war with more hardware than it was able to use. So, the rule of thumb is, never let a good gun go to waste, unless your country happens to be called USA. If you’re American, just fire your gun once, throw it away, ask for a new one, fire it once and repeat procedure ad infinitum. The military industrial complex will thank you for losing guns."},{"prompt":"What are the characteristics of a genuine person?","completion":"First listen everyone and then put her or his point of view Always busy with work Not more engaged with people"},{"prompt":"it really true that the Chinese government is implanting their people with monetary microchips?","completion":"Are you talking about science fiction?

It was called MTR Karnataka food festival. It had 6 counters and each catering to different cuisines of Karnataka. Did you get that, Karnataka, one single state can offer 6 different cuisines. This is one of many reasons why Karnataka is not well known. We have diversity that even Kannadigas can feel like foreigners in their own land. One may have heard of Kerala dish, Andhra meals, or Gujarathi meals, Rajasthani meals etc. but you never have heard of Karnataka meals or any Karnataka dish. This identity crisis is one of the main reasons why Kannadigas are least known among South Indians. India has 4 metros, one for North, South, East and West. Madras or Chennai took that position for south. Bangalore is the most cosmopolitan city in India but it made a mark a bit late (after the IT boom). We welcome people from all over India and people live here peacefully (apart from one or two stray incidents). People need not learn Kannada to live in Karnataka. A lot of times, Kannadigas go out of their way to speak other languages. When it comes to dressing sense, There is no one single attire that can define Kannadigas. South and North Karnataka people wear dhoti in different ways. The traditional sari is worn in 3 different ways. When it comes to music, south Kannadigas prefer Carnatic whereas north Kannadigas prefer Hindustani. We do not have a classical dance form of our own. Although a lot of people practice Bharatanatyam, it is from TamilNadu. We do have ‘Yakshagaana’, but when one sees the pictures, it resembles Kathakali. Karnataka is one of the few states in India that has beach, waterfalls, rivers, rain forests and rain barren areas, hills, and what not. Even in Geography, there is not one thing that can define Karnataka. In south of karnataka there is red soil whereas in north karnataka there is black soil. Karanataka grows both rabbi and kharif crops in abundance. It is this diversity that makes it difficult for a non-kannadiga to define Karnataka or Kannadiga. It is simply the most diverse single state in India."},{"prompt":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","completion":"For me it is to go to Heaven forever and avoid being in Hell forever - I found this reading the Quran.

The guy came up and said “Do you have a radar detector?” (They are illegal in Ontario). I answered truthfully, “Yes”. Then he asked if it had gone off. Again, I answered truthfully, “No”. “Excellent!” the dude said. “My colleagues were on top of the bridge you just passed, testing their new laser guns. The got you at 170. I’ll tell you what, how about I write you up for 149 kmh and confiscate your radar detector?” “Oh, that sounds more than fair” was my response. And I paid my fine and that was that. Note that at the time, the penalty for being more than 50 kmh over the limit was a very substantial fine and optionally an appearance in court. So the guy was absolutely doing me a favour, and I knew it. Hence the reason I did not fight it. Since then, Ontario has changed the law so that if you are doing more than 50 over, there is an automatic on-the-spot 14 day suspension and vehicle impoundment.

It looks as though it belongs to the note to the right of it, but it actually belongs to the note in the previous bar (to the left of it, as always with dots).

Here, I will outline effective strategies to help you bid farewell to lower back pain once and for all: Proper Posture: Maintaining good posture while sitting, standing, and walking is essential for a healthy back. Avoid slouching and make a conscious effort to sit up straight with your shoulders back and your spine aligned.Regular Exercise: Engaging in low-impact exercises like swimming or walking can strengthen your back muscles, improving their flexibility and overall support for your spine.Stretching: Incorporate stretching exercises into your daily routine to release tension in your lower back. Focus on hamstrings, hip flexors, and quadriceps, as tightness in these areas can contribute to back pain.Ergonomic Setup: Ensure your workspace, whether at home or the office, is ergonomically designed. Use a chair with proper lumbar support, position your computer screen at eye level, and keep frequently used items within easy reach.Lift with Caution: When lifting heavy objects, always use proper lifting techniques. Bend at your knees, not your waist, and avoid twisting while lifting.Weight Management: Excess body weight can strain your lower back. Maintain a healthy weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise to reduce the burden on your spine.Stay Hydrated: Drinking plenty of water keeps your spinal discs hydrated, promoting their shock-absorbing capabilities and reducing the risk of back pain.Supportive Sleep: Invest in a quality mattress and pillow that provide adequate support for your spine during sleep. Avoid sleeping on your stomach, as it can strain your back.Stress Reduction: Chronic stress can contribute to muscle tension and exacerbate back pain. Practice relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness to alleviate stress.Seek Professional Help: If your back pain persists or worsens, don't hesitate to consult a healthcare professional or a physiotherapist. They can diagnose the underlying cause and create a personalized treatment plan. By following these guidelines and making small adjustments to your lifestyle, you can effectively manage and prevent lower back pain, leading to a more comfortable and active life."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to get discounts on hotel rooms?","completion":"You may find different methods to get low prices at hotels but the best way to get good prices at hotels is the on-line way.

Although Google developed both frameworks, there are numerous distinctions between them. The main differebce among Angular Vs Angular JS is that AngularJS depends on JavaScript, while Angular depends on TypeScript. These two front-end, open-source frameworks for building dynamic web applications and SPAs share a number of similarities. However, let's also examine their differences. What is Angular? Angular is the most powerful front end framework which has gained lot of fame since its beginning. It was launched by Google and it has helped various Multi national companies in growing and expanding their business the recent time Angular has come up with version 15 by keeping a goal to build scalable application in mind.

The fragrance of Perfume lasts longer than Eau de toilette and cologne and the fragrance of Eau de toilette lasts longer than Eau de Cologne. Fragrances come bottled in different forms like- perfume (Parfum), Eau de Parfum (EDP), Eau de Toilette (EDT), Eau de Cologne (EDC) and Eau Fraiche. What makes them different from each other is the concentration of oil in alcohol and water present in them. I have arranged the perfumes in the order where the number 1 lasts for the longest time (lasts up to 8 hours) and the number 5 lasts for the shortest time (less than 2 hours). Perfume (Parfum)Eau de Parfum (EDP)Eau de Toilette (EDT)Eau de Cologne (EDC)Eau Fraiche The detailed features of these fragrances are given below: Perfume (Parfum) Out of all the fragrances, Perfume is the most expensive form of fragrances. It is the most concentrated and lasts longer as compared to the other fragrances. It is formulated with 20 to 30 per cent of pure perfume essence. This is why it is the first choice of people who love long lasting perfumes. Obviously, nobody would want to carry a bottle of perfume and spritz it after every hour. A single spray or application of any perfume can last a whole day. It is also the best option for people with sensitive skin as it contains the least amount of alcohol as compared to the other fragrances. The alcohol in perfumes tends to dry out the skin. So the lesser the alcohol the better it is for the skin. 2. Eau de Parfum (EDP) Although you may think that perfume and Eau de Parfum are the same but they are actually different. Eau de Parfum is a unisex fragrance option. It contains 15 to 20 per cent pure perfume essence and that is why can last up to 5 to 8 hours. They are much cheaper than perfume and that is why loved by many. In fact, even Princess Diana’s favourite perfume was an Eau de Parfum. It has a better stay than Eau de toilette, eau de cologne and Eau Fraiche but cannot stay longer than perfume. 3. Eau de Toilette (EDT) This is a light fragrance option which is formulated with 5 to 15 per cent pure perfume essence mixed with alcohol. It generally lasts for just 3 hours. It is best suitable for the workplace when you don’t want a too strong fragrance which could disturb your colleagues being over the top. 4. Eau de Cologne (EDC) In North America, this term is used for masculine scents. It has a fresh and light fragrance. It is generally made up of two to four per cent perfume oils mixed in alcohol and water. It usually lasts for just two hours. So you need to reapply it and carry along with you. 5. Eau Fraiche This is the most diluted fragrance option out of all. It has just 1 to 3 per cent of perfume oil mixed in alcohol and water. It generally lasts for just one hour so you need to keep it handy for re-application. It does not contain a high amount of alcohol. It mostly contains fragrance and water. Get To Know About The Three Types of Fragrance Notes Which Can Help You In Choosing The Most Suitable Perfume: The Top Notes These are the lightest notes of fragrances. When you spray a perfume you will immediately smell these top notes. But they are also the first notes to fade away before the other notes. Hence you can say that these notes stay for the minimum time. So any fragrance which you see in top notes will only be there for a short period of time. So never make your final decision of buying a perfume based on the top notes because they are not gonna last for long. However, they are important because they make the first impression after the spray and smoothly transition into the heart of the fragrance. Most common top notes are citrus (orange, lemon, bergamot), herbs (lavender, clary sage) and light fruits (berries, grapefruit). 2. The Middle Notes Once the top notes disappear after evaporating what we can smell are the middle notes. They are also called the heart notes as these are the heart of the fragrance. They last for a longer time as compared to the top notes and also influence the base notes. These notes are mostly pleasant. Usually, these have fruity or floral tones. The fragrances which are in middle notes are- geranium, nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon, ylang-ylang, lavender, rose, lemongrass, jasmine, neroli and coriander. 3. The Base Notes These notes get mixed with the heart notes and make up the fragrance which stays for the longest. These notes will stay till the fragrance of your perfume will last even when the top notes will fade. They usually have fragrances of vanilla, amber, patchouli, sandalwood, cedarwood, oakmoss and musk. So next time when you’ll be buying perfume, you should read about its form and notes too."},{"prompt":"want to use C++ to learn Machine Learning instead of Python or R, is it fine?","completion":"You can if you want. I've done it, still do. The advantage of doing it in c++ is speed of course. Another advantage is that you develop a more intimate understanding of the algorithm because you end up having to write tons of it yourself. It can come in handy when you need a solution that runs quickly in practice. On the other hand, there are benefits to using other languages like Python for example. If you know C++ then Python will be very easy to learn. The python machine learning APIs are more likely to work out of the box without issue, and they are going to be significantly easier to use. The reason is that there is a much larger machine learning community that uses Python than there is that uses c++. So it will be easier to find implementations of the latest and greatest learning algorithms in Python. Also parsing, plotting and scraping data is much easier in Python than c++. You also have the option of using multiple languages. For example, you can take advantage of the machine learning community and use Python to prototype and do the learning, then use the output in a c++ algorithm. For example, optimize the weights of a neural net in Python and use the weights in a c++ program (like a game for example). My suggestion is to go with what you prefer. Go with the one that interests you the most. If you have a specific c++ project in mind then use that. But always keep an open mind about Python and don't let the idea of slowness blind you to the advantages, because you will likely be able to do more experiments of more techniques in less time than you would in C++. Thats a pretty good speed up."},{"prompt":"w do I start a successful YouTube channel and become a YouTuber?","completion":"Hey.

Do they just let this powerful person walk around untrained and dangerous, maybe fall to the dark side?","completion":"Alright so I'm pulling this from the EU and 1–6 but untrained force users are not supposed to have advanced force techniques. It was supposed to take a lot of dedicated practice to be able to do something as advanced as levitation. So to answer the question, it didn't matter. Tons of people weren't caught by the Jedi,especially in non republic world's like tatooine. And even on republic world's, how many parents would give up their child. Most people's abilities manifested in Spidey sense type powers and mild precognition. Much how Anakin's showed. He couldn't levitate anything at age 10. If he had never met qui gon he probably would have become a famous pod racer. Pre cognition plus mechanic skills would be invaluable. An untrained person who fell to the dark side would be of little threat and probably no more dangerous then a crime Lord or even a typical villain with a blaster. And if they became a threat, the lack of training would mean an average Jedi could take care of the problem. It was supposed to be some mind blowing thing for Luke to be able to pull a lightsaber from the ice with the force. He only had one hyperdrive trip with Obi Wan to train with a teacher, plus whatever other training he did on his own after the death star. I believe the time frame was 3 years? Anyway it was luke freaking Skywalker. Rey and Ben solo are blood strong and they are the reincarnations essentially of the light and dark of the force so at least their strength is somewhat explained. But random kid slave force pulling a broom isn't supposed to be a thing. Remember Hans words. He thinks the force is non sense and Luke got lucky with the training deflections."},{"prompt":"Can a Jew become a nonJew?","completion":"Can the mentally ill become better ?

Morbid obesity occurs when one's weight interferes with general health or usual activities and has been caused by an excessive amount of body fat as well as poor eating habits over a long period of time. In the United States, someone who is 5'7\\" would be considered morbidly obese if he or she weighed more than 203 pounds. This weight is determined by using the body mass index (BMI). A BMI of 40 or higher is considered \\"extreme\\" obesity; thus, someone who has a BMI of 40 or higher would be considered morbidly obese. The likelihood of developing problems caused by excess weight increases with age and is higher in women than men. It is difficult to be a morbidly obese person because it is not easy carrying around that much extra weight. Someone who weighs 40 percent more than normal or has 100 pounds or more of excess weight would have problems moving normally, finding clothes that fit well, and being comfortable in most chairs and cars. The excess weight also puts a strain on the heart and the body's respiratory system. In addition, surgery is often required when people who are extremely obese need treatment for health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. Morbid obesity does pose an increased risk for certain diseases such as cancer and arthritis. In fact, treating these medical problems can be difficult if the patient is obese because some medications may not be as effective in these patients. If someone weighs more than 203 pounds, he or she would have difficulty carrying around that much weight. The excess weight would also put a strain on the heart and respiratory system. Surgery is often required when people who are extremely obese need treatment for health conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure. In fact, treating those medical problems can be difficult if the patient is extremely obese because some medications may not be as effective in those patients. Finally, morbidly obese people could have an increased risk for certain diseases such as cancer and arthritis. What's it like to live as a morbidly obese person? The first thing you'll notice is your weight. The excess pounds make it difficult, if not impossible, to move normally, find clothes that fit well or be comfortable in most chairs or cars. It also puts a strain on the heart and the body's respiratory system. Then there are problems caused by surgery: Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesn't because of the patient's weight. And dealing with it may be difficult because some medications don't work as well for those who are extremely obese. Morbid obesity can increase the risk of certain diseases such as cancer and arthritis, and sometimes treating those health problems can be tough when you're extremely obese. The first thing someone would notice if they were morbidly obese is their weight. If someone weighs more than 203 pounds, they would have difficulty carrying around that much weight and it would put a strain on the heart and respiratory system.

In addition, morbidly obese people may have an increased risk of certain diseases such as cancer and arthritis. Finally, dealing with it can be difficult due to the patient's weight. It is vital that someone who weighs more than 203 pounds gets help for their excess weight; otherwise, they could develop health problems or even die. A study by the American Cancer Society found that those who were obese, as well as overweight and active, had a greater chance of premature death than people who had a normal weight and were not overweight or active. Being extremely obese may also cause certain health problems such as diabetes and high blood pressure; thus, treatment could be difficult because some medications don't work as well when someone is extremely obese. Morbid obesity increases one's risk of certain diseases such as cancer and arthritis; thus, treating those medical problems can be difficult if the patient is extremely obese. Dealing with it may also be tough because you're carrying around that much weight.

Sansa, for example, also smiled when she took out someone who used to brutalize her.","completion":"You are confusing book/show canon (which for the early seasons are pretty much the same) with a show only invention. I personly have issue with how Dany took Viserys' death because it is horrible. Yes, he abused her, but he wasn't always like that (show canon omitted that completly). He raised her, the told her stories of Westeros. The fact that she does not even suggest a different kind of death is cruel. And in the later books she somehow can still think of him with a little bit of fondness. How does that add up with her behaviour when he is killed? As for Sansa smiling when Ramsey is torn apart can't say I am particulary fond of the writing of the show, especially with how much they made someone who looks like Sansa but at her core is someone different. Blame the show writers. And if you want to compare that with the book canon Sansa: at the Purple Wedding, when Joffrey begins to choke and she fully realises what is happening and she has to flee - she cries because she feels sorry for him, despite the fact that he abused and insulted her, that he beheaded her father. Because it was a cruel death."},{"prompt":"What is the oxidation state of each element in Febr2?","completion":"That’s either Groundhog’s day or FeBr2. FeBr2 must be iron (II) bromide.

Listening to 60s pop/rock I'm impressed by how many instruments seem to fit into the mix compared to when I use synths in a DAW.","completion":"The simple truth is that an acoustic instrument has a more complex soundwave. Synthesised sound waves are simpler in structure and by default more boring. However, there are exceptions. A good example is David Sylvian's keyboard sound on 'A Pocket Full of Change.' He worked on the sound for months, merging several sonic components to structure a full and much warmer sound than is usually associated with standard synth sounds."},{"prompt":"Without appealing to emotion or using ad hominem attacks, how can I convince conservatives that gun regulation is a good thing?","completion":"You could always wait for hell to freeze over."},{"prompt":"Why are people able to get up on time and work hard for other people but struggle with doing it/working for themselves?","completion":"Because they are “other” driven; it is harder to work for yourself when that is the case."},{"prompt":"My manager said she is not able to keep my position anymore but asks me for a resignation letter.

There seems to be a significantly larger portion of engineering students in India than in the US. Is the perception of engineering different? If so, why?","completion":"The answer to this question is rather very simple. Students in their school life don't know what they want to do. They do not explore or seek new opportunities. All they do is what is asked of them (and sometimes forced) by their parents, relatives or friends. Lack of counselingMajority of schools in the India do not provide an option of career counseling (which I think is a must for students in high schools). The only way students come to know about different jobs and career options is through their family members (and well most of them are again Engineers or in Medical professions) The biggest proof of this is:After students qualify exams like JEE exam for the IITs and AIEEE exam for NITs and IIITs (the best engineering colleges in India) - in their choice of subject/streams they want to peruse they list down all the subjects in all the colleges in order of the ranking of the colleges. I have seen students who have applied for Computer Science, Electrical, Mechanical, Civil, Chemical everything from the best IIT or NIT. Just give them the good college, they don't care about the subject. Family PressureThe orthodox Indian family want their children to take safe decisions. If their is a choice between say becoming a Pilot and earning a huge salary and comforts but with a risk of failing to become a pilot all together and becoming an average engineer and living a very average life with a modest salary. They would want him to choose the latter because with that his future is secured (according to them). The students are never given a chance to develop their passions or follow their hearts."},{"prompt":"For prochoice folks: If a man's wife or partner learns that she is pregnant and wants an abortion, should the father get a say in the decision if he wants to support and be there for the child?","completion":"Here’s the problem. There are only two people in this equation. If one says Yes, and one says No, there is no tie-breaker. So the tie-breaker has to be the woman—it’s her body that will be, at best “inconvenienced” and at worst, in serious pain and misery, and her body that will need either surgery or hours of painful labor in order to push a baby out through her vagina. So she gets the final say.

If you are in an apartment with thin walls or have thin walls in a house with kids around especially I would say a smaller caliber or even a shotgun with those nonpenetrating shotgun shells that I was sold 3 or 4 years ago when I bought a shotgun for home defense. As for a handgun, it would be up to you to decide if you are trained enough to have a “go big or stay home” attitude or “I’m not really sure of myself so…” If it is the latter, I would ask someone like the local gun store. Most of those guys care about their customers enough to not just be in it for the sale, or at least that has been my experience so far. Personally, I went with a little bit of all-around my first time. I had a shotgun with apartment loads, a Desert Eagle .50cal (was on sale at a gun show), a Walther PPKS for concealability, and a modified AR-15 pistol which was also on sale, and with the instruction, I know how to properly use it. I’m of course out of practice now since I’m officially homeless and can’t have them here in the shelter/program. However, I will never sell them or give them away to be rid of them. Sorry to be vague, but without knowing you and your level of training and exterior circumstances I don’t believe in giving advice like that.

You get pregnant and abort the child is no different from you not getting pregnant to begin with. The act of getting pregnant and aborting it is morally neutral. Some will argue but it’s murder!!!!

They might include house pets who have been abandoned or [LINKED_TEXT: got lost] [URL: https://petcentral.chewy.com/pet-microchip-works-worth/], as well as cats who are semi-cared for by one or more residents. All such stray cats are at least partially socialized, approaching people for food, meowing or even purring. But what about feral cats? What Is a Feral Cat? There are stray cats, and then there are feral cats. What is a feral cat? Feral cats have lived their whole lives outside with no real human contact. They think people are large predators and act accordingly. Seeing a cat living outside in cold weather, or in a heavily trafficked area, can be heartbreaking—so much so that you may start thinking about adopting a feral cat. [LINKED_TEXT: Domesticating feral cats is not for the faint of heart] [URL: https://www.petmd.com/cat/care/challenges-taking-street-cats]. But depending on the cat’s age (the younger, the better), personality and experiences on the street, socialization may be possible. But make no mistake—even in best case scenarios, it will take time and patience. “The sociability level of the outdoor cats who show up in our lives truly runs the gamut, with a variety of factors—most of which remain a mystery to the person who invites a cat indoors—playing a role,” says Peter J. Wolf, national cat initiatives analyst for the [LINKED_TEXT: Best Friends Animal Society] [URL: https://bestfriends.org/], a national animal welfare organization. Determined to try to give feral felines a home? Here’s advice on whether and how to tame a feral cat. First Things First Do not approach a cat that seems sick (no matter how sorry you feel for him) or if they are acting out of the ordinary. A cat who always bolts if you get closer than 30 feet suddenly showing up at your back door has not decided he loves you—it’s far likelier that he has rabies. In situations like this, call local animal control. If you are bitten or scratched, go to a doctor to have the wound checked and treated. Start With Reasonable Expectations “When I’m asked whether feral cats can become pets, I always reply, ‘That depends on what you mean by pet,’” says Wolf. He explains that a feral cat might bond closely with their “one person,” but will forever run from everyone else. “Of course, her circle of human friends might be widened with increased exposure to others, especially if those involved are willing to be patient. Socializing an adult feral cat… requires reasonable expectations.” A feral cat, Wolf emphasizes, might never become a lap cat, no matter how much love is showered upon him. If that’s what you have in mind, then adopting from a shelter is often a better idea than making an attempt at domesticating feral cats. As a rule, shelters do not put feral felines up for adoption, so adopting a feral cat from an organization is not generally an option. How to Tame a Feral Cat One word: [LINKED_TEXT: cat food] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/b/food-387]. Food is how wild cats became domesticated in the first place: they figured out that hanging around humans equaled regular meals. So successfully taming a feral cat in your neighborhood will begin by establishing a routine around food. Feed the cat at the same time and in the same spot every day. Don’t make eye contact with him when you see him; cats can take that as threatening. Sit or stand quietly nearby and just ignore the cat as he eats. Once that’s going well, you can talk to the feral cat in a calm, soft voice. The hope is that the cat will start to trust you. Once you sense that he does, move the food a little closer to you each day. Of course, offering a few [LINKED_TEXT: cat treats] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/b/treats-391] along with food can’t hurt. [LINKED_TEXT: Halo Liv-a-Littles 100% Wild Salmon Cat Treats ] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/halo-liv-littles-grain-free-100-wild/dp/29209]are a great option because they are freeze-dried, which means they can be broken up easily. Don’t attempt to touch the feral cat until you are at least fairly confident, judging from his day-to-day reactions to you, that he’ll allow it. If he backs away, stop and wait a few days before trying again. Take care not to make sudden movements. Let him sniff your finger before trying to stroke his cheek. Once the cat seems comfortable with touch, then you can move on to petting. If this is success, you can try gently picking him up. Be prepared for weeks of diligent effort, if not months, to get to this point. Before bringing the cat into your house, especially if you have other cats, you must take him to the veterinarian for a full checkup and vaccinations, and of course, to be neutered or spayed. You’ll need to have built up enough trust with the cat to be able to [LINKED_TEXT: get him into a crate for the trip] [URL: https://petcentral.chewy.com/positively-trained-teaching-your-cat-to-be-comfortable-in-a-carrier/].

Install a few small safe places, like [LINKED_TEXT: cat trees and towers] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/b/trees-condos-scratchers-456]. The [LINKED_TEXT: Frisco 72-Inch Cat Tree] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/frisco-72-in-cat-tree-brown/dp/129327]has two built-in private snoozing spots, as well as plenty of opportunity for climbing and checking things out from above. For small spaces, the [LINKED_TEXT: Frisco 28-Inch Cat Tree] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/frisco-28-in-cat-tree/dp/155158] does the trick, while still providing a hideout spot. Being able to hide in his own space will help your cat relax. Respect your cat’s safe places and keep your interactions brief until your cat seems comfortable with his new surroundings. Aside from his hiding spots, your cat will need, of course, a [LINKED_TEXT: cat food bowl] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/b/bowls-dishes-1425] and water bowl (the [LINKED_TEXT: Necoichi Raised Cat Water Bowl] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/necoichi-raised-cat-water-bowl/dp/146196] is marked on the inside, so you can be sure your cat is drinking enough during her first days inside), and a [LINKED_TEXT: cat litter box] [URL: https://www.chewy.com/b/litter-boxes-413].

Under what circumstances is a feral cat better left outside to fend for himself? “It’s tricky,” admits Wolf. The mindset of wanting to rescue a cat simply because he’s living outdoors can result in community cats taken from a neighborhood where they’re cherished (often with more than one household caring for them). And then there’s the fact that there are cats, in some circumstances, who do just fine living outdoors. Wolf has been caring for four cats on his patio for more than 5 years, yet has never touched any of them. “I don’t know that these cats would want to be indoors. They’ve got a pretty good gig, after all: food, water, shelter, the company of one another and plenty of the kind of enrichment that comes from being outdoors. Yes, there are risks—on balance, though, I think my decision is best not only for them, but for me and my own indoor cats.” While Wolf allows that he might reconsider his stance if, for instance, one of the cats became injured, his best advice is this: “Proceed very slowly, and remain mindful of what’s best for the cat.”"},{"prompt":"Why did the army get rid of digital camo?","completion":"It proved to be crappy in practice and was replaced by better systems."},{"prompt":"What is something that you will never do?","completion":"The tipping culture in the U.S. for two reasons: The service is mediocre.

What does a typical day look like? What are their responsibilities? What do they do to grow their company every day?","completion":"Here's what a day in the life as CEO was like for me during an extremely stressful time: My heart is beating too fast, and it won’t slow down. It’s 3AM, and I can’t sleep. Again. I get out of bed, and I walk to my office. I am shivering even though the temperature in the house is 72 degrees – Nerves. I turn on the computer, and I check my email. Dammit! No email from the new investor like he promised. Why can’t these guys do what they say they are going to do? Why?!? 3:30AM: I head back to bed. At least I didn’t wake up my wife. Maybe, now I can get a little sleep before the alarm wakes me. 5AM: The alarm goes off. I had just fallen asleep, and now it goes off! OK, get up and go workout downstairs. The exercise will do me good. I am shivering as I walk downstairs. 6AM: Finish the workout. Shower, shave, have my protein shake, read the paper, and answer some emails. 7AM: I kiss my wife and daughter goodbye, get in the car, and head to work. Even the bad days are good, but I don’t know how good this one is going to be…yet. Steve calls. It’s always good to talk to Steve. We talk about what’s going on his life for a change. It’s a good distraction. 7:30AM: Starbucks. You’ve gotta love it – a Starbucks as part of a gas station. You can fill up your gas tank and your internal caffeine tank at the same time. Genius! 7:45AM: In the office. I respond to emails and make some phone calls. 9AM: Meeting with a potential investor, a legend in the VC industry. He says to us, “I hate high-margin businesses!” That might be the stupidest thing we’ve ever heard raising money. I just smile and continue with our presentation. There’s no hope in hell we’re getting his money. 10:30AM: Phone call with another investor. “Brett, we should have a term sheet for you by the end of the day.” How many times have I heard that? “Great,” I respond. 11AM: Operations meeting. Dave and Shoba are just killing it. Demand keeps increasing, and we are meeting it. The feeling of starting something, nurturing it to grow, and seeing customers buy your products is indescribable. Watching your team and fellow employees feel empowered to make things happen is a great feeling. I need to secure that funding, so they can be fully rewarded for their great work! 12PM: I really want to talk to someone inside the company about my fears and concerns. It’s oh so tempting when you are down, but you can’t go there. I’ve got to take a walk, leave the building, or do something. I can’t share my worries with the employees. I decide to go for a walk around our “campus”. It’s 75 degrees outside and I am still shivering. I wish the shivering would go away. It won’t. 1PM: Traffic meeting. Review with Mary, our PR person, the status of our various advertising and marketing campaigns, and our collateral development. The beautiful thing about today’s world, unlike the bingo-card world I started my career in, is that you can measure everything – and we do! Oh, how I love it! Website traffic is rising. Sample requests continue growing at a high rate. Design wins are increasing, and so is revenue. Mary and I eliminate the ads that aren’t converting, schedule new ads, collateral, videos, and blog posts. 3PM: Company meeting. Remember, Brett, you need to say what don’t mean as well as what you do mean. The team will fill in the blanks if you don’t. The meeting goes well. I update everyone on the status of the fund-raising, sales, and new product introductions. The team, as usual, had great questions. 5PM: I’m in my office. Someone on the executive staff let me know that a member of his team was worried because I frowned when he asked a question about how sales were going. “I frowned? I don’t remember that.” I was laughing, but it was a sober reminder: Every word, every gesture, every frown, every time you raise your voice, every time you leave the office early, every time you leave the office late, every time you arrive at the office early, every time you arrive at the office late, everything you do is analyzed by the employees. “I’ll say something about that next time I speak to the team.” Next time. 5:45PM: I check my email. There it is. Subject: Term Sheet “Brett, My Partners and I are pleased to present to you this term sheet….” Euphoric, I print out the attached term sheet. I walk out of my office and scream, “YES!” at the top of my lungs. I then jump 2 feet into the air, vastly outperforming my vertical leap at the draft combine. (Yes, that’s a joke.) Not bad for a 40-something year old, I think to myself. I start reading through the term sheet. Oh, please. Why did you add that term? Why! Another problem. Why can’t anything be straightforward? Why?!? How are we going to solve this? I call our lead investor, and we agree on a strategy to solve the problem. It should work if the new investor is reasonable. That’s a big if in VCland. I have to find a way to get this round closed. You are responsible, as CEO, for the lives and wellbeing of your employees and their families. It’s not about you. It’s about them. I have to find a way. 7PM: I pack up my briefcase and head home. Traffic usually thins out when I leave the office after 7PM, but I check Waze just in case. Good. I can take 880 to 280 to get home tonight. 7:30PM: Home. My wife, daughter, and I have dinner. My wife and I help our daughter with her homework after dinner. 9:15PM: My daughter just went to bed, so I catch up on email and work that needs to get done. 11PM: Bed. I know I will fall asleep quickly. The question is will I stay asleep? 3AM: I wake up from my nightmare: we couldn’t close funding. My wife is sound asleep next to me. I am shivering even though it is 72 degrees. I hate the shivering. God, do I hate it. I get up and go to my office, and turn on the computer to check my email."},{"prompt":"My son gets a slip home every day from his teacher that needs to be signed because he gets in trouble.

This would require more volume for carrying same amount previously in 1000 Rs dominion. Now 2000 Rs covers up twice of 1000 Rs; lesser volume & lighter for more corruption.

Amount for replacing the currency, GDP falling down (with government trying to cover it up with manipulated formula for GDP) & >99% return of old notes indicate / imply that this whole exercise was futile. All objectives, which was declared publicly before, during and after demonetization was a failure as this government never talks about corruption, terrorism, black money, fake notes (bjp leaders were caught printing it were expelled), cashless economy, rising prices, jobs lost due to DeMo, unemployment, etc. On the contrary, the government has given contradictory statements that all in queues are black money holders & all money in Swiss bank accounts is not black money."},{"prompt":"What are the safest countries to travel in Africa?","completion":"I'm in Zimbabwe right now.

Here are some methods that may contribute to this: 1. Balanced meals: When individuals consume meals that are balanced and include a combination of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) along with fiber-rich foods, they tend to feel more satisfied and full for longer periods. Including sources of lean protein, whole grains, healthy fats, and plenty of fruits and vegetables can help promote satiety. 2. Adequate hydration: Staying properly hydrated throughout the day can help manage hunger. Sometimes, feelings of hunger can be confused with thirst. Drinking an adequate amount of water or other non-caloric beverages can help reduce the urge to snack between meals. 3. Mindful eating: Practicing mindful eating techniques can help individuals become more aware of their hunger and fullness cues. By eating slowly, savoring each bite, and paying attention to the body's signals, they can better gauge their satiety levels and reduce the likelihood of feeling hungry between meals. 4. Intermittent fasting: Some individuals who eat once or twice a day may follow an intermittent fasting (IF) schedule, which involves extending the time between meals. During the fasting period, the body adjusts to using stored fat for energy, which can help suppress hunger. It's important to note that intermittent fasting should be approached with caution and under the guidance of a healthcare professional, as it may not be suitable for everyone. 5. Adequate calorie intake: Although people eating one or two meals a day might consume fewer meals, they generally ensure they meet their daily caloric needs within those meals. By consuming sufficient calories and nutrients in a condensed eating window, they can feel satisfied and less likely to experience hunger between meals. 6. Habituation: Over time, the body can adapt to a particular eating pattern, and the sensation of hunger between meals may diminish. By consistently eating at specific times and sticking to a routine, the body can adjust its hunger signals accordingly. It's important to note that individual experiences may vary, and these strategies may not work the same way for everyone. It's crucial to listen to your body, prioritize your nutritional needs, and make adjustments that align with your overall health and well-being. Consulting with a registered dietitian or healthcare professional can provide personalized guidance based on your specific circumstances."},{"prompt":"What do I need to know about the University of Toronto?","completion":"University is an amazing experience.

Mathematics is not inherently racist, and why should anyone change the way they teach mathematics. Discussing whether black people should have to take mathematics competency tests comes under politics, it is certainly not a topic within mathematics. I have always been taught to keep politics out of my lessons. If I am to teach mathematics, that is what I will teach, and nothing else.

The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental law of physics that states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with perfect accuracy. This is because the act of measuring the position of a particle disturbs its momentum, and the act of measuring the momentum of a particle disturbs its position. Even if the two people do not talk to each other, the act of measuring the particle's position will still disturb its momentum, and the act of measuring the particle's momentum will still disturb its position. This is because the two measurements are not independent of each other. The Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is a fundamental law of physics, and there is no way to get around it."},{"prompt":"the US, is it better to send your kid to a public or private school? Are private schools better than public schools?","completion":"It depends on several factors such as location, resources, and the specific needs of each student. However, in general, private schools tend to have more resources, smaller class sizes, and more experienced teachers than public schools. Additionally, private schools can offer a more individualized approach to education and may have a more rigid curriculum. However, [LINKED_TEXT: private middle school near me ] [URL: https://www.scajax.org/about-us/]Jacksonville, FL also tend to be more expensive, and not all families can afford to send their children there. On the other hand, public schools serve a much wider range of students, including those with special needs, and typically have more diverse student populations. Public schools are also generally funded by tax dollars and are therefore more accessible to families with limited financial resources. Additionally, public schools are often held to high standards of accountability and are required to administer standardized tests to measure student progress. In conclusion, both private and public schools have their own unique advantages and disadvantages, and the best choice for a student will depend on their individual needs and the resources available to their family."},{"prompt":"Why is Six Sigma unable to save companies from bankruptcy?","completion":"Hey Ram! Thank you for asking this question. First of all, though almost all but not each problem can be resolved using Six Sigma. It is not a magic stick that one call roll over and everything will be fixed. It takes time to bring changes. Bankruptcy has multiple reasons, perhaps more or less few hidden reasons to save the promoter’s interests. One of the core reasons is that company is not doing good financially, may be due to cost overheads, unstable processes, uncertain revenue, etc. The question is what exactly Six Sigma is? It’s merely a consolidated & comprehensive approach to address core quality issues through a set of tools & techniques being in use for over 6–7 decades mainly invented by Japanese. Fitting those hundreds of tools into a methodology was done by Motorola and called it as Six Sigma. The success of Six Sigma is not in the theory or the methodology itself but in the execution of it, perhaps PROPER EXECUTION. If any company does not execute it the way it should be then it is not the fault of Six Sigma but that of the company. Logically speaking, if one apply Six Sigma at the RIGHT TIME, it can also save the company to go bankrupt. There are many examples where Six Sigma has resolved financial problems of the businesses through its fundamental activity of improving quality of products, services or processes of a business which ultimately resulted into customer satisfaction, reduced costs, increased revenue & profits and I never saw a company in profit went bankrupt.

There is NO education system in the U.S. An education system takes into account how the brain functions. We have two brains. A literal side and a cognitive side. Most people tend to favor one side. It’s just like being left or right handed. Finland may be the only country that trains both sides. They do an hour of literal learning, then an hour of practical application (cognitive). (This also forces cross communication between the two halves, think ambidextrous for the brain, ambibrainious…;-) Our so called educational system only supports and trains the literal side. As you progress up the educational ladder you become more literal. The majority of today's problems are due to Literal stupidity (Playing with words). Yes, you can become more “stupid” with more education. But, it’s not what you think. When you hear the words, “I need more data”, “Let’s see the study” and the twisted knife “Peer Review”. You are most likely dealing with an Literal Idiot. Literals need “LOTS” of data to make a decision, but then, depending on their “belief”, they will actually reject the overwhelming data. Rather than “thinking” Literals will use their elevated layer of “I R educated” to put down anything that goes against what they “believe they know”, but in reality, they can be quite clueless. The Medical profession is one of the biggest offenders of justifying what they “believe” they know with Literal-ism. A full cognitive like myself can, with a single point of data, draw a conclusion and be correct the majority of the time. Until we start training BOTH sides of the brain, dump multiple testing, understand that comprehending concepts and practical application is more important than the retention of useless data, we will continue to slide into the morass of literal educated stupidity."},{"prompt":"What are some dark secrets of Bipasha Basu & Karan Singh Grover?","completion":"Here are some secrets of Bipasha Basu and karan singh grover….

(ie. the strength of the joint was dependent on the elastomer not the bolts), this was to allow the building to flex in high winds as all high rise buildings are designed too, by one system or other. In my opinion as a retired engineer there would of been more than sufficient heating to degrade the elastomer and that combined with the deformation of the beams themselves, putting stress on those joints, was more than sufficient to start the collapse!! The elastomer would of started to fail at a much lower temperatures than the temperatures that deformed the beams. Essentially the joints did not have the strength of a welded, hard bolted or riveted structure so any comparison is not possible. The failure of the elastomers combined with the deformation of the beams then allowed the building to pancake down as it did end of story... There was a good article in Scientific America on the construction I would suggest all the conspiracy theorists should read the article and direct there thoughts to how the perpetrators got control of four planes, even allowing for the lackadaisical security of the time and the fact that the building was failing as a result of deterioration of the elastomer joints, before the attack’s!!!’ Let’s face it, it was an insurance job to avoid the massive cost of the remedial work needed to make the building sound, simple as that, the people killed were collateral damage, sad to say RIP…."},{"prompt":"What is the best thing I can do before I die?","completion":"Put an example of integrity in front of the world.

Let's look at the core business prospects a bit more closely. Alibaba is a marketplace, which does not own the inventory of the merchandise sold, and merely connects buyers and sellers together. On the other hand, Amazon is a re-seller that owns the inventory and supply chain of its merchandise and sells directly to the customer. Consequently, Alibaba operates a business with much less overhead than Amazon which explains the wide difference in both the company's margins. Amazon's profit margin (net income as a percentage of sales) is lower at 4.1% (as of 2019) versus 23.3 % (fiscal 2019 ending March) for Alibaba. aspects.

Dear [LINKED_TEXT: Mahrukh Zaim] [URL: https://www.quora.com/profile/Mahrukh-Zaim-2] It’s you who seem to be talking from the stone age. We have inherited nothing from you. Every country has its own specialty, Pakistan has its own, Bangladesh has its own as well. We dont need to do or produce all those things you mentioned, and it does not have to as well. It is not until long back when almost nothing was coming from Pakistan or India since its embarkment in garments sector in 1983, but ALL from China, Taiwan and Korea. The cotton and knitting garments in Bangladesh is just a recent revolution that created mainly by some giant retailers like H&M who created the trend and then Pakistan and India got a new opportunity to feed this Bangladesh market. Because Bangladesh has no cotton, and had no knitting background. You should be happy for that. Because we buy your cotton and ship to Europe and America in bulk. And today we have more than a million Indian expats and Pak technicians working in Bangladesh and remit billions of dollars to their countries. Because you are more experienced in printing and cheap things. The fact is, you have skills, Indians have expertise and Bangladesh has manpower—altogether it is our subcontinental achievement. Yes, Bangladesh is poor and the West is generous enough to give us preferential access—unlike you who try to invent every opportunity to pretend to be superior and hinder others’ way to growth. But You are no way superior as a nation, but probably as country—thanks the donation you ever got from the West, especially from the USA, for a long time due to your geopolitical location that the West needs to keep under their grip. Bangladesh is poor and we do not feel ashamed for that, because we have been historically screwed up by invaders and one of them is your country. It was our ancestors’ plain but stupid trust in your founding fathers and joined hands with them to create a country of Pakistan of two wings. And your culprit ancestors took the chance of that stupid trust to screw us. But we have given your ancestors a good lesson on our soil and had them walked out handcuffed and head down, even though with help of India. India is big and greater than you, and has influences in Bangladesh, true. But one thing is clearly visible: they have not hindered our progress that we have achieved so far. If it were You, Pakistan over the border, I have no doubt that you would not allow us to grow and, instead, would put your terrorists in to destroy this country. Thanks God!! Oil your own machine, man, your just falling behind because of your bigotry. Try to come out of it and really work hard, at least for your people who have been suffering ever since 1971. Don’t get envious of others who are working just to make their life better, not to remain worse like yours. Wake up, man, we wish God bless you. I have come across this question and the answers seemingly long after the debate has cooled down. But I feel to tell the folks, especially the Pakistani ones here who answered the question favoring Pakistan, that you are pretending to hide the fact and, rather, undermining a country that evidentially is doing better than yours. Look at the history when Pakistan tactfully enclaved then East Bengal (present day Bangladesh) at the partition deal in 1947. East Bengal was a land thousands miles away by distance, millions miles away by culture and another thousand miles away by the prospect of becoming a richer country than yours. And that potentialt was the reason why Pakistan would wish to enclave East Bengal. And in deed, later the West Pakistan economy became largely dependent on the East. I would recall, the destruction and damages Pakistan caused to then East Pakistan ( now Bangladesh) till 1971 was like destroying the backbone of a prospective and prosperous nation. The degree of humiliation by your predecessors to the people regardless of men and women, adults and children was just bestial! Let me bring you to the backyard, which you might have never known or have forgotten. You may never know why Bangladesh ever fell behind you and why it will go ahead of you again. Bangladesh has a glorious history of rich past, dating back to the pre-middle age and a pathetic history of being made-poor at the post-middle age.

And due to the British plunder, Bengal started to fall and was pushed in to poverty for the first time: deindustrialization started and famines caused. The consequence was the two major famines in Bengal ( look - [LINKED_TEXT: Great Bengal famine of 1770 - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Bengal_famine_of_1770] and [LINKED_TEXT: Bengal famine of 1943 - Wikipedia] [URL: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengal_famine_of_1943]) and Bengal became a poor province of the British empire.

Look at the present condition. The pace Bangladesh has maintained in its progress in areas of industrial, economic, education, infrastructure and international trade is much over that of Pakistan.

In the restaurant business, we most certainly do not want to make anyone sick. The problem is, too many people claim to have ridiculous, fake allergies, causing many in the restaurant business to become a bit cynical. People with fake allergies do a disservice to those who truly have allergies that in some cases are potentially fatal. Here are a couple of examples why we can become cynical. Recently, when soft-shell crabs were in season, we brought live soft-shell crabs in to run a special. We have two regular customers, they don’t know each other, who have claimed to be highly allergic to shellfish, not just bivalves, but shrimp and crab as well. We’ve known them for years, and they both have been extremely adamant about their allergies. We ran a feature dish, fried soft-shell crab sandwich with a cajun remoulade. Imagine our surprise when we suddenly ‘cured’ the shellfish allergies of two customers in less than 4 days. Ahhh the whole gluten thing. There is a difference between having Celiac’s disease or other forms of legitimate gluten intolerance vs. making a lifestyle choice. People who have a legitimate gluten issue can experience many adverse symptoms, including intense pain. Then there are those who claim to be severely gluten intolerant, who won’t eat fries cooked in a fryer that has been used to cook breaded items, or make a fuss over every last item on the menu while washing down their meal with three pints of Hefeweizen. This is ridiculous because they would have adverse reactions to the wheat beer if they truly had a severe gluten issue. The most ridiculous single ‘allergy’ I witnessed happened recently. A customer claimed to be ‘severely allergic to onions’, her words, not mine. There are people who are allergic to onions. This customer, however, also ordered a basket of onion rings and ate just the breading while discarding the onions.

Quality over quantify. The biggest gun most people have heard of and still fear are the nine 18 in 46 cm Type 94 main guns on the humongous battleship Yamato, which were the largest guns ever mounted on a warship. They fired shells eighteen inches in diameter, had a range of 17 miles (27 kilometers). They were so big that when they were fired, all of the anti-aircraft gunners had to go below decks so they would not be killed or wounded by the blast. Even her 24 five inch guns, mounted in 12 turrets, could destroy targets nine miles away. By contrast, Iowa class battleships had 16 in guns which could hit targets 20 statute miles or farther away. What most people, even those on Quora apparently STILL don’t know, and nowhere in the wikipedia article [LINKED_TEXT: Yamato-class battleship ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamato-class_battleship]is that Yamato was fought to a tactical draw and strategically defeated and turned back by a task force of toy ships known as \\"Taffy 3\\", comprised six [LINKED_TEXT: escort carriers] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escort_carrier], three destroyers, and four [LINKED_TEXT: destroyer escorts ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Destroyer_escort]whose mission was to provide air support, not attack ships. Their main mission was to simply stay alive when their own protection against ships, Halsey’s fast carrier force had run off to attack a fleet of carriers deliberately sent as a suicidal decoy. This left Taffy 3 to be “accidentally” left as a suicidal decoy (No American Admiral would deliberately do this…) , which worked like a charm though it was no fun to be on the American team on this day. They were armed with nothing bigger than the 3 Fletcher class destroyer (5 gyro stabilized computer directed) and 3 Butler class destroyer escort (2 manual) [LINKED_TEXT: 5\\"/38 caliber gun ] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5%22/38_caliber_gun]which could punch 1″ of deck armor at 10 miles which means it could not even scratch the 16 inch side armor on the Yamato. A DE isn’t even fast enough to outrun a battleship. It’s not how big or far the gun fires that counts, it is whether you hit anything that matters, and that’s the reason we still have destroyers (which are pretty much cruisers now) but not battleships. Yamato is credited in the initial stages of this battle when Yamato engaged enemy surface targets for the only time in her career, hitting several American ships.

But the ships in Taffy 3 were only hit when they were in 5 in gun range. The USS Johnston stayed afloat for nearly 3 hours with damage after she started zigzagging to avoid gunfire from Yamato. Imagine that. The might Yamato with its own fleet of destroyers took 3 hours to sink the first ship that attacked them. Gunfire computers on the Yamato were largely manual, so they could only solve for hitting a ship sailing in a straight line from a ship that was also sailing in a straight line. All the US ships had to do was change course or sail towards splashes to spoil the solution. On the other hand, Americans had figured out how to shrink their electronic analog gun computer to fit onto a destroyer and fit it with a gyro and radar so that when the sight was set onto a ship, the guns would deliver hit after hit, even as they were dodging incoming shells. While it could not sink a cruiser or destroyer it could knock out or wreck all kinds of hardware on deck and kill and demoralized lots of people when the USS Johnston turned around for a suicidal daylight torpedo and 5 in gun attack and a torpedo took out the bow of a cruiser. The DE Sammy B Roberts had manual aiming but when they were trading shots with a cruiser and grenade tossing range, they didn’t need much aim, and the seemingly worthless single tail stinger of a escort carrier was even thought to have hit a torpedo on a cruiser. If you’ve seen my Taffy 3 / Samar posts together, you’ll know that I’m still the only person who has called for naming the next generation F-35 carriers after the Gambier Bay, and the next destroyers after the Johnston and Sammy B Roberts and their crews to replace ships originally named for hero ships that have been retired. 7/2018"},{"prompt":"What's on your playlist recently?","completion":"As long as you love me the good or the ugly~ % SHOOT! ,, ITZY ☆ Friends ,, Vmin % Ditto ,, NWJNS ☆ Every Kind of Way ,, H.E.R % Her Way ,, partynextdoor ☆ Skin ,, Sabrina Carpenter % Girls ,, aespa ☆ Vengeance ,, BIBI % Blind ,, SZA ☆ Cupid ,, Fifty Fifty % Like Crazy ,, Jimin ☆ _WORLD ,, Seventeen % Flower ,, Jisoo ☆ Shooting Star ,, XG ~Shoot take a panorama~"},{"prompt":"w are wildfires able to cause so much damage before being controlled?","completion":"Have a look at this Australian fire, and please let us know how we should control it."},{"prompt":"Could my WiFi toothbrush be hacked?","completion":"There’s an old saying: The “S” in IoT stands for “Security.” XKCD has an opinion: [LINKED_TEXT: Smart Home Security] [URL: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0oph63xv4UgkGUmQ5O4e6xieeEzsliZcQrITOAphqqCXsEQ/viewform] Everything that is connected can be hacked, it’s just a question of the effort-to-reward ratio for hacking.

Experts claim that the visual quality of premium and inexpensive HDMI cables is the same. More than only stereo audio and video are sent over the HDMI protocol from your device to the TV. Up from 10.2Gbps in HDMI 1.4, HDMI 2.0 systems can carry data at up to 18Gbps, enabling the transmission of 4K video at 50/60 frames per second. HDMI cables' greatest adversary is their length. In order to properly transmit the signal across greater distances, particularly those of at least 25 feet, the cable's quality must be better. This does not imply that you should overpay for a cable. You may get away with almost any undamaged cable constructed to basic HDMI specifications for 3-6 feet. In certain circumstances, it is better to choose the least expensive choice. Although more costly HDMI cables could survive longer, they shouldn't provide any audible or visual advantages over less expensive HDMI connections. Paying extra for an HDMI cable that doesn't improve the image quality is a scam. So, if a salesperson attempts to upsell, respectfully correct him and continue with the transaction. It's not necessary to spend a lot of money on pricey HDMI cables, even if they are vital for transporting audio and video data from your device to your TV. You may enjoy the same excellent image and sound without spending a fortune as long as the cable you pick complies with fundamental HDMI requirements."},{"prompt":"w do you determine if a function is continuous on a graph?","completion":"If the graph of function has no cut i.e the graph is made without letting our hand being raised the graph is continuous Eg.

Can someone explain it in simple words?","completion":"Because the Mac address is the physical address of your network card. It is what switches keep in their table/list to know where to send a packet . Kinda like an postal address it will not move(easily) and directs a packet home to you. While an IP address is more like an landline home phone. It belongs to your address and is faster and easier to look up and deliver the information than mailing it to your home address as long as you are in the phonebook. The IP can also at any point be replaced just like a phone number suddenly your up might belong to another Mac and you have a whole new one it all depends on if you released your ip and requested a new one from the DHCP. So the idea is for a Mac address to be static and unchanging while the IP is supposed to be dynamic based on the network you belong to so that the IP can be registered to your mac (don't mistake my use of dynamic I this as not a static IP.) Ofcourse in is a lot more complicated than that and to someone that knows networking well it is even a somewhat bad metafor.

The true sign of something dangerously wild within her is the addition of all these details of cruelty in her past.

Infectious diseases kill over 17 million people a year - [LINKED_TEXT: Infectious diseases kill over 17 million people a year: WHO warns of global crisisNearly 50,000 men, women and children are dying every day from infectious diseases; many of these diseases could be prevented or cured for as little as a single dollar per head, the World Health Organization says in The World Health Report 1996, published today. At least 30 new diseases have emerged in the last 20 years and now together threaten the health of hundreds of millions of people. For many of these diseases, there is no treatment, cure or vaccine. \\"We are standing on the brink of a global crisis in infectious diseases. No country is safe from them. No country can any longer afford to ignore their threat,\\" the Director-General of WHO, Dr Hiroshi Nakajima, says in the report. The report warns that some major diseases, such as cholera, malaria and tuberculosis are making a deadly comeback in many parts of the world, despite being preventable or treatable. At the same time, many new and highly infectious diseases such as HIV/AIDS and the notorious Ebola haemorrhagic fever - both of which are incurable - are emerging to pose additional threats. Fears are growing over a possible food-chain link between bovine spongiform encephalopathy (\\"mad cow disease\\") and a variant of the incurable Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, due to an infectious agent that attacks the human brain. Meanwhile, antibiotics and other life-saving drugs used against many diseases are rapidly losing their effectiveness as bacteria and other microbes develop resistance to them. For example, doctors worldwide are losing some of the most useful and affordable antibiotics against the two principal bacteria which cause pneumonia, the major cause of death in children. The World Health Report 1996 - Fighting disease, fostering development, published by WHO, states that infectious diseases are the world's leading cause of premature death. Of about 52 million deaths from all causes in 1995, more than 17 million were due to infectious diseases, including about 9 million deaths in young children. Up to half the world's population of 5.72 billion are at risk of many endemic diseases. In addition, millions of people are developing cancers as a direct result of preventable infections by bacteria and viruses, the report says. \\"The optimism of a relatively few years ago that many of these diseases could easily be brought under control has led to a fatal complacency among the international community. This complacency is now costing millions of lives - lives that we have the knowledge and means to save, yet that we are allowing to trickle through our fingers\\" Dr Nakajima says. \\"The socioeconomic development of many nations - their prospect of a better future - is being crippled by the burden of these diseases. Other countries are paying a huge price in lost foreign currency income from food trade and tourism as a result of epidemics of cholera, plague and other diseases.\\" \\"The world has lost sight of its priority to reduce poverty through better health and foster development by fighting disease.

Much of what is proposed by climate alarmists can be soundly debunked if we employ some basic historical/geological/paleontology data and knowledge: we know that the Earth’s climate is driven by very long cycles, also localised shorter ones. The hottest year in recent history was in 1936, remember the ‘dust bowl’ in the midwestern United States, well at this same time great droughts, and unusually hot summers were being recorded. Terrible floods, bushfires - these took place regularly throughout the 1800’s and earlier 1900’s. Much of the historical data is being obscured on official websites, they prefer to take their reading from a more convenient time, so that excessive heating can be ‘proven’ by comparing the variations without the pesky reality of previous heat showing up. This is the problem: we have green-billionaire lobby groups and funding sources calling the tune! The science has become a running dog for powerful groups in our society. Yes climate is changeable , we know that our planet has undergone significant extremes, Ice Ages, ‘little ice ages’, cooling periods and warming periods. All without humanity being around, all without industrial output being present. We need to separate the real truth from the political convenience, we need to question all sources and not just accept these claims of climate change, it is well known that the current campaign is one of ‘carbon taxation’ and anti-human policies, these are being imposed on us all in ever-increasing draconian forms. Always apply critical thinking, don’t quote dogmatic pronouncements as if they are absolute, that is not how science works; we have to always review what we think we know, but more importantly to recognise what is political/social propaganda, we are approaching a time where ‘Green’ philosophy is eroding true science, where extreme social policy will be imposed on us all if we do not stand up and call it out, carbon taxation is ludicrous, our entire planet’s ecosphere is based on the ‘carbon cycle’; C02 is not a problem, greenhouse gasses actually do not exist. Our climate is driven by the sun, electromagnetic processes. Industrial pollution is a problem, I know this, you know this, but this is not causing ‘climate change’, the climate follows its own cycles, they are macro in nature, humanity has very little influence in the big picture."},{"prompt":"w can I recognise fake Facebook profile?","completion":"There are many solutions for How can I recognise fake Facebook profile This is exactly most of the people are searching every higher than the internet.

How long could they sustain the war?","completion":"USA will be defeated by Russia alone with little support from China. Don’t believe that ? You will see it not in 2025 but in 2017. How ? Remember Vietnam War. Mahabharata war was won by Pandavas who had 7 Lakh soldiers against 11 Lakh soldiers of Kauravas. USA is a war monger nation who makes war for economical reasons. All these other countries will go to war only if there is no other choice but once they are in they will be deadly. Why ? Because their manpower and intelligence is much more efficient. Even though USA spends a lot on military and has got most sophisticated weapons but one mistake is all that will change the course of war. USA will be protecting the skies with missile shield but the enemy will come by sea ( Russia has nuclear submarines that went undetected near US borders) and one computer system hack of US defense or one secret information received by the enemy, that is all what would be needed. USA economy is terribly inflated and unstable. Russia economy on the other hand is very stable( It has gold based currency, whereas US has printing press). Even though it spends so much on everything most of it goes in to the drain, like they spent to elect Hillary Clinton. For how long war will sustain, I think it will last only few days at most and USA would be completely annihilated. Why the war is likely in 2017. See below Three incidents are pointing towards this. Across Russia, forty million civilians and military personnel just finished up emergency drills aimed at preparing the general population for nuclear or chemical weapons attacks.[LINKED_TEXT: Russia is preparing for nuclear war] [URL: http://www.businessinsider.in/Russia-is-preparing-for-nuclear-war/articleshow/55055737.cms]Putin’s telling to Journalists. \\"You people in turn do not feel a sense of impending danger, this is what worries me.

It's true that having a competitive programming talent will help you stand out from the crowd, make your resume look better, and give you an advantage over other candidates when applying for jobs or other employment prospects. You should be aware that many well-known tech corporations, such as Facebook, Google, Amazon, and others, give candidates' competitive programming talents a lot of weight and sometimes even hire them after finding them through various competitive programming competitions. What is Competitive Programming? Competitive programming is a practice that involves addressing a variety of real-world programming issues while adhering to strict time, memory, time & space complexity, and other constraints. The goal is to improve your programming, data structures & algorithms skills. You must use your choice programming language to create an optimal solution to the provided programming problem within the allotted time frame, and your code must pass all necessary test cases. The best part is that you get to compete against a variety of bright minds from around the globe and develop not only your programming or DSA skills but also other abilities like logical and analytical thinking, problem-solving, time management, breaking a problem down into manageable pieces, and many other abilities. The difficulty with most people, especially college students or beginner-level programmers, is that they don't know the appropriate and successful way to get started with competitive programming, which many of you would've already known even if you weren't competitive programmers. As a result, in this answer we will talk about the best strategic techniques that will undoubtedly make it easier for you to begin competitive programming. Programming Language Your top priority should be to choose your favorite programming language and master its syntax, foundations, and implementation. Along with the necessary sophisticated concepts, like the STL library in C++ or Big Integers in Java, you need to familiarize yourself with built-in functions, conditional statements, loops, etc. There are many languages available that are appropriate for competitive programming, including C, C++, Java, Python, and many more. However, C++ is typically preferred more for competitive programming by people due to its quicker execution time. Nonetheless, you can choose any of the relevant languages based on your preferences and convenience. You can easily learn and get command over the targeted programming language via using various standard online resources like Coursera or YouTube playlist available over the web. Data Structures and Algorithms Then, here comes the core aspect of Competitive Programming i.e., Data Structures & Algorithms. The DSA fundamentals must be learned in order to begin your journey toward being a Competitive Programmer. What you need to know is that while some people will tell you that learning DSA is not required in order to get started with CP and can be done along the way, I strongly advise that you at least brush up on the basics of DSA, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, searching, sorting, time and space complexity, etc., before beginning to solve problems and participate in competitive problems. This will give you the confidence you need to solve the majority of the problems. You won't be able to come up with an optimized, effective, and perfect solution for the given programming challenge if you don't have a solid understanding of data structures and algorithms. I will strongly recommend taking proper courses like Logicmojo live course as there you will discover appropriate quality resources, most cheap online courses, live classes, and much more to help you learn and master Data Structures and Algorithms. Resources To start learning about data structures and algorithms, students should pick a reliable site where they may attend video lectures and take their competence assessments at regular intervals. Courses: Logicmojo, Educative, Algodaily Live classes of Logicmojo help me improve my competitive programming. Its live classes which takes 4–7 months to improve your coding skills in CP. Books: Grokking Algorithm, you can use this book as a reference during your preparation Websites: Use websites like for GeeksForGeeks for solutions to any problem you face. Practice It's time to put your newfound knowledge into work and begin solving problems after understanding the programming language and DSA ideas. To begin practicing, you can use any common platform, such as Leetcode etc. If I specifically discuss Leetcode, it is highly recommended, especially to beginners, due to its user-friendly interface, a sizable collection of problems structured in an orderly fashion, multiple difficulty levels as per the applicants' preferences, strong integrated development environment, etc. It's best to start with solving problems at the beginner level furthermore if you are at some institute such as Logicmojo, they have assignments and class work which are designed in a structured manner to slowly uplift your level of problem solving. At first, you could struggle to solve even simple problems, but don't worry about it. You should persevere and not give up. Coding Contests After sufficient practice, you are now prepared to evaluate, validate, or present your competitive programming abilities by participating in a variety of prestigious coding competitions. Undoubtedly, engaging in these coding challenges or competitions as frequently as you can is the best method to develop into a great competitive programmer. These programming challenges are periodically organized on a number of platforms, including Codeforces, Leetcode, CodeChef, HackerRank, etc. You must compete against multiple other competitive programmers located all over the world on these platforms where numerous code challenges are held on a weekly or monthly basis. You must find the best solution possible to the given problem within the allotted time frame. Also, one of the best strategies that you must remember is that once the challenge gets over, try to solve those problems again (or go through the editorials/solutions) that you failed to solve during the challenge. Final Thoughts Data structure and algorithms are considered the foundation of computer science and have changed how man used to operate in development and engineering. Finally thanks for reading so far and good luck with the programming contest. Happy Coding!!!"},{"prompt":"Would you do the same thing to Chris Rock if you were Will Smith?","completion":"No. I know how to behave in front of others and I can take a joke…"},{"prompt":"What genetic malformation does Megan Fox have?","completion":"Megan Fox is an iconic actress best known for being extremely beautiful rather than being a good actress. As a result, she has been made fun of a lot over the years. However, there is one bodypart of hers, that has undergone more scrutiny than others, and that is her thumbs. Her thumbs are shorter and stubbier than other thumbs. This is a result of a genetic condition called brachydactyly, which is more disparagingly referred to as “toe thumbs”. Brachydactyly is typically an inherited trait resulting in shorter bones in the fingers and/or toes. It literally means “short finger” in Greek. Fox happens to have type D, which results in smaller “clubbed thumbs” while the rest of her fingers are normal. It doesn’t really affect Fox much. It’s just an abnormality that she has, which is easily covered up through camera trickery and CGI."},{"prompt":"f slavery wasn't abolished in 1865, how long do you think it would have lasted after 1865?","completion":"I don’t know. It was already economically obsolete. The problem was that it was part and parcel of a way of life into which a class had woven it’s self-esteem. And they took the (justified) berating by abolitionists as an insult, and insults mean something to people who fancied themselves aristocrats. Also there really was a practical problem: it would release large numbers of unskilled workers on the market while bankrupting potential employees. Really this was their own fault. George Washington was not always nice (remember the teeth) but once he concluded that emancipation was a moral necessity he essentially converted his plantation into a trade school so that his slaves would be viable workers when manumited. That could have been done on a larger scale but instead the plantation classes made their system more and more rigid to bolster a system which was not only immoral but did not really produce as much as one dependent on free labor would have. In fact much of the policies of the slaveowning classes were foolish economically and socially but make perfect sense from the premise that the goal is to bolster the system of slavery. For instance a lot of the reason for the Civil War itself was fear that the Slave States would be soon outvoted in Congress and the Senate because of the number of Free States outpacing them."},{"prompt":"What food is just impossible to eat in a civilized manner?","completion":"Sami Shah: you can’t look cool and eat a mango.

Platforms like Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing allow you to create and self-publish e-books. With effective marketing and a captivating book, you'll be earning top draw royalties. Social media management is another way to cash in online. Offer your services to handle social media accounts for individuals or businesses. Many small ventures are willing to pay someone to handle their social media presence. Lastly, let's play the \\"What did they say?\\" game. Online transcription is a cool gig where you transcribe audio or video files for businesses or individuals. Platforms like TranscribeMe or Rev are your allies here. You'll be earning some dough for every audio minute or hour transcribed. Grab your headphones, activate transcript mode, and let the money flow! Remember that, making money online takes time and effort. Choose something that aligns with your skills and interests and be ready to put in consistent work. Success won't happen overnight, but with persistence and a sprinkle of humour, you'll get there."},{"prompt":"Why are prepaid expenses considered a liability?","completion":"They are not and you should find another source of information.

Bandwidth is the amount of data your connection can pass in a period of time (usually measured in some multiplier of bits per second Kilo/Mega/Giga). Latency is the round trip time between two nodes on a network. This is usually measured in milliseconds. When you have a 1Gbit/s, 100Mbit/s, or even 20Mbit connection to your ISP, getting a set of files (images, html, css, java, whatever) from a web server where the total size is measured in Kilobytes will not usually take long. Some things that take additional time and make the experience “feel” faster or slower are things like the TCP negotiation of the HTTP connection, the TLS Handshake that happens when you connect to a website over HTTPS and, for a lot of web sites, the myriad of DNS queries that need to happen for you to connect to all the hosts involved in serving you that web page. The vast majority of end-client DNS queries are answered from the cache of an iterative resolver. Think 8.8.8.8, OpenDNS, 1.1.1.1, the DNS servers your ISP gives you via DHCP option 6, or DNSMasq running on your wireless router. It’s usually not that a particular DNS server is “faster” than another. It’s that the operators of large DNS infrastructure have the resources to put end point DNS servers close to end users, usually using Anycast. Let’s compare some large public resolvers Cisco Umbrella (formerly OpenDNS): dig @208.67.222.222 www.google.com | grep -i \\"query time\\" ;; Query time: 22 msec Google’s resolver: dig @8.8.8.8 www.google.com | grep -i \\"query time\\" ;; Query time: 25 msec Cloudflare: dig @1.1.1.1 www.google.com | grep -i \\"query time\\" ;; Query time: 10 msec So, from the network I’m on at the moment (not my usual network), Cloudflare’s DNS servers are “faster”. This is probably mostly because they’re “closer” to me, network-wise, and therefore it takes less time for the query to get there and the answer to get back. The difference between 10ms and 25ms probably isn’t noticeable by itself, but when the loading of a web page depends on that 10 or 25 millisecond process happening 15 or 20 times, it’s noticeable. It “feels” snappier. When I’m at home, these results are different. Cloudflare is still lower latency, but not by much, and 8.8.8.8 is much quicker to respond than Umbrella. I don’t use any of those, though. I have a pair of DNS resolvers in a rack in my basement that I use. Latency for me to get to those is usually around 1ms. However, check this out: dig @localhost www.google.com | grep -i \\"query time\\" ;; Query time: 0 msec I’m on a MacBook Pro, and I have a local copy of BIND that I started up. The fastest network is the one where you don’t even have to leave your own machine. That result is from the second time I looked up google’s IP. The first time it took 115ms, because I had to do all of the lookups to get to google with a blank cache (look up com, look up google.com, look up www.google.com, cache all the interim results). I have run with a local DNS resolver before, but it can “feel” slow, because you don’t have the advantage of having a bunch of pre-cached results due to all of the users who have done lookups on the server before you."},{"prompt":"What are some plastic surgery masterpieces?","completion":"Bollywood Celebrities Bollywood have advocated for beauty and have set a different standard for it.

That will cost the exporter a couple of thousand pounds every trip. That will make the lorries late in reaching their destinations, and therefore lat loading up for the return trip. Even if the UK abandons all checks on incoming goods, and abandons all tariffs, that can only be a temporary measure. Sooner or later they will have to be reimposed, and that will mean further delays. Empty shelves in the shops. The EU will impose tariffs on goods entering the EU, making British exports more expensive. The manufacturers who can will relocate to the continent, because they would sooner sacrifice a market of 67 million, rather than one of 446 million. Others will go out of business.

A sharp bullet is more aerodynamic and offers better penetration. This is from Wikipedia and is a pretty interesting and informative article.

Oats contain beta-glucan, a type of fiber that's been shown to help lower cholesterol when eaten regularly.1 Need another reason to dig in? Oats are also rich in phosphorus, magnesium, iron, and zinc. Oats can also: Improve immunity Contains antioxidants (may reduce inflammation) Support digestive healthOverall, oatmeal is a healthy choice. If you are looking to reduce your added sugar intake, choose plain oatmeal and sweeten your bowl with fresh fruit, cinnamon, and nuts. Greek YogurtThis tangy, creamy type of yogurt is loaded with calcium. It boasts plenty of protein to keep you feeling full throughout the morning. Your best bet: Choose a plain, nonfat or low-fat variety, add some fruit to give it some sweetness and flavor (and a dose of added nutrition). and some chopped nuts or a tablespoon of nut butter for healthy fat. GrapefruitGrapefruit made the healthy breakfast list because it's packed with vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, and lycopene. Lycopene is an antioxidant that has been shown to lower the risk of stroke.4 The high-fiber content of grapefruit doesn't impact blood sugar levels since it can't be digested. Making this fruit an excellent choice for those with diabetes who monitor their blood glucose levels. But check with your healthcare provider first if you take any medications, as grapefruit and grapefruit juice can interfere with some prescription drugs. The yellow fruit—especially when it still has a touch of green—is one of the best sources of resistant starch, according to a review.6 Resistant starch is a healthy carbohydrate that resists digestion and has been shown to improve post meal blood sugar levels and increase feelings of fullness. \\"Slice it up and add it to cereal or oatmeal,\\" advised Giovinazzo. \\"It will add natural sweetness, so you may not need additional sugar.\\" Thanks to a healthy dose of potassium, bananas are a particularly good choice for people with high blood pressure. That's because potassium is an electrolyte that helps lower blood pressure naturally. EggsOnce shunned for being high in dietary cholesterol, eggs are actually a healthy source of protein and nutrients like vitamin D. One large raw egg contains 6.3 grams of protein and two micrograms of vitamin D, among other nutrients.Eggs do contain cholesterol. However, a study found that those who ate eggs did not have an increased risk of heart disease. In fact, they even had an 11% lower risk of developing heart disease. Almond ButterDon't eat eggs or dairy? Almond butter is an excellent alternate source of protein (at about 7 grams in 2 tablespoons).11 And it's filled with monounsaturated fat, which is a good substitution for saturated fat. WatermelonAs its name suggests, watermelon is an excellent way to hydrate in the morning. One slice of watermelon contains about 9.2 ounces of water. The juicy fruit is also among the best sources of lycopene, averaging nine to 13 milligrams in a cup and a half of watermelon. Lycopene is a nutrient found in red fruits and vegetables that may prevent atherosclerosis, or hardening of the arteries, which can lead to stroke, high blood pressure, or heart attack."},{"prompt":"What is a candid picture?","completion":"Candid photography This photography is really special and natural one, as in this photography object don’t have an idea from where or which angle a picture is going to be clicked.

Here are some steps to get started: Learn a programming language: If you haven't already, choose a programming language and become proficient in it. Commonly used languages in competitive programming include C++, Java, and Python.Study data structures and algorithms: Data structures and algorithms are the building blocks of competitive programming. There are many resources available online to help you learn them, such as online courses, textbooks, and tutorials. I would recommend “Problem Solving in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java” by Hemant Jain as a good resource to start with.Practice, practice, practice: Competitive programming is all about practice. Start with easier problems and work your way up to more difficult ones. There are many online platforms where you can practice, such as Codeforces, HackerRank, and LeetCode.Participate in contests: Once you have some practice under your belt, try participating in contests. This will give you a sense of how well you're doing and where you need to improve. Some popular contest platforms include Codeforces, Topcoder, and Google Code Jam.Learn from others: Finally, don't be afraid to learn from others. Join online communities, such as forums and Discord servers, where you can connect with other competitive programmers and learn from their experiences. Remember, becoming proficient in competitive programming takes time and effort. Don't get discouraged if you don't see progress right away.

I can only speak for myself but there was more than one game that I had enough and simply turned that game off. It’s almost as though the refs really don’t care if the calls they make are correct or not because they just figure that someone will correct them. Another egregious error that I saw at least a dozen times was when the ball had not been snapped when the play clock had clearly reached “0” and the play was allowed to continue with no penalty being called.

Given such an asteroidal habitat, I’d be snug as a bug in a rug, with nary a worry about impacts from rocks that could hole a constructed space colony."},{"prompt":"What are some travel tips for an Indian visiting Bhutan?","completion":"Carry your Indian Voter ID for Indian & Passport for Foreign nationals. make photocopies of 6 and 6 Passport size PhotographsPlease do not carry 1000, 2000 & 500 INR Currency its Banned in Bhutan.Reach to Bagdogra Airport/Hasimara Railway stn in between Sunday to Thursday.

She was very nice most of the time, quiet, and at first, she seemed without problems. Most of the residents were wondering why she was there. But three hours after she arrived, she ripped off a heavy bandage on her arm and banged it against the wall several times until blood spurted from a deep wound that probably should've had stitches. Mackenzie was a severe self-harmer. She reopened the wind every day, sometimes multiple times. She dug her finger up to the first knuckle into it. One time, she bled so much that all the residents had to stay in their rooms for two hours while the staff cleaned up the blood that was on the walls and floor. We weren’t allowed in the laundry room for two days because there were so many bloody towels and sheets that it took that long to wash them all. “Hedda” was a twelve-year-old girl who seemed much older. She intentionally sought out and used the other residents’ triggers. She was separated from all the residents until she was kicked out three weeks after she was admitted. Until then, the entire unit was on lockdown- we had to stay in our rooms, only coming out for therapy or meals, which we ate two at a time. “Kenna” was a twelve-year-old girl who had been severely abused since the age of five. She was like a wild animal at times, hissing and growling and scratching people with her fingernails. She even bit staff, and often spit at anyone within range. Once, she drew “666” on every wall she could reach in purple crayon accompanied by pentagons. Yeah, so these were all terrible things I saw in a teen psychiatric unit."},{"prompt":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","completion":"His film is definitely going to be a hit and this guy named Sushant Singh Rajput has done a fantastic job.

So people go get a husky puppy without knowing what they’re getting into. Not knowing what kind of work goes into turning that cute little furball into your good dog. From my limited experience… huskies don’t seem to be great family dogs. They’ll tolerate others, but they seem to be one-person dogs. They are highly intelligent, seriously. They are energetic, seriously. Inside dog? They require a lot of grooming, seriously. You’ll still have prodigious amounts of dog hair around your home. They are a handful.

Eventually the man got into his truck and sat there for a bit, while his girlfriend continued to yell at him through his open window; eventually he hit the gas, which caused her to tumble away from his truck. The guy peeled out and swung his truck around which prompted me to go out to the road, pistol in hand. I gave her one hand to get her up and told her to get out of the road. Once she did, I did the same thing. At which point he hit the gas hard enough that by the time he was at the y intersection he was already at about 40MPH, which was maybe 100 yards away. Was he going to run her over? Hell if I know. He sure stopped cold once he saw the muzzle pointed at him though. I also promptly left, why?

If a country’s military is conducting live fire exercises, they will file a Notice to Mariners and a Notice to Airmen closing a section of the ocean and air space. Those areas are not legally closed, but ships and aircraft are advised of the danger of navigating through the area during the period specified. No penalty can be enforced, however. There are also international regimes governing straits such as the Dardanelles, the Straits of Tiran, and many others. Ships are permitted free passage through this straits. On occasion countries controlling those straits have closed them in violation of international law. There are gray areas. A country’s territorial waters extend to twelve miles from its coast. The country has absolute sovereignty over this zone. A country also has an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending to 200 nautical miles (the approximate extent of the continental shelf). Within the EEZ ships may conduct innocent passage, but may not conduct exploration or operations such as fishing, or any other exploitative activity. All these are governed by the UN Law of the Sea Treaty, which the US has not signed, for bizarre reasons. Some specific issues, such as individual straits’ regulations, are governed by other treaties. China refuses to recognize the right of free navigation through the South China Sea, claiming it is a Chinese possession bases on an ancient Chinese tradition. This is not recognized in international law, however, China is fortifying islets in the Sea, and has created artificial islands there which she is also fortifying.

While they share some similarities, there are key differences between them. Here's a breakdown of the dissimilarities: 1. Composition: Granite is an igneous rock primarily composed of quartz, feldspar, and mica. It forms when molten magma cools and solidifies deep within the Earth's crust. Marble, on the other hand, is a metamorphic rock that forms when limestone undergoes intense heat and pressure over time. 2. Appearance: Granite is known for its granular texture and speckled appearance. It typically features a wide range of colors, including whites, grays, pinks, blues, and blacks, with varying patterns and veining. Marble has a more uniform appearance and usually exhibits prominent veining, giving it a classic and elegant look. It comes in various colors, such as white, gray, beige, and black. 3. Durability: Granite is highly durable and known for its resistance to scratches, heat, and stains. It is suitable for high-traffic areas and can withstand the rigors of daily use. Marble, while still relatively durable, is softer and more porous than granite. It is more susceptible to scratching, staining, and etching from acidic substances. 4. Maintenance: Granite requires minimal maintenance. It is relatively easy to clean and only requires periodic sealing to maintain its protective barrier. Marble, being more porous, requires more care. It needs regular sealing to prevent stains and etching. Additionally, marble surfaces should be cleaned with mild, pH-neutral cleaners to avoid damaging the stone. 5. Applications: Granite is commonly used for kitchen countertops, bathroom vanities, flooring, and outdoor installations due to its durability. Marble is often preferred for applications that prioritize aesthetics, such as fireplace surrounds, bathroom accents, and decorative features. It is less commonly used for kitchen countertops due to its susceptibility to staining and etching. 6. Cost: The cost of granite and marble can vary based on factors such as color, rarity, quality, and origin. In general, marble tends to be more expensive than granite due to its luxurious appearance and limited availability of certain varieties. When choosing between granite and marble, it's essential to consider factors such as intended use, desired aesthetics, maintenance requirements, and budget.

Yes, he claimed to be, and partially was, a whistleblower regarding NSA surveillance (and more importantly, retention) of US citizens’ phone, internet, and other personal information. His problem was that he released far more information than that, especially about US overseas intelligence operations, and naively entrusted all this to a foreign journalist looking to make his name in media, as well as the totally anti-American organization of Wikileaks. And whether the squeamish in this country still subscribe to the antiquated notion that “gentlemen don’t read other gentlemen’s mail” or not, the US was outed about its surveillance of foreign allies, while most people in this country do not realize that even our allies spy on us every day. The other part often overlooked is that the disclosures, even if not about our specific intelligence activities in enemy countries (which is still unclear to the general public), much of the foreign intelligence information released probably revealed so-called “tactics, techniques, and practices” used by the US to collect intelligence, making the efforts against our enemies that much more difficult, if not, in fact dangerous, for US agents and assets."},{"prompt":"ve you ever found out your kid wasn’t yours by getting a paternity test?

They take about 5 minutes to move across the sky. Often, if you watch them long enough, they will pass into the shadow of the earth (sunset from their vantage point) and that instant, they wink out and you can no longer see them. There are websites that provide predictions for when and where they will be visible from your location. With a little preparation, you can often see half a dozen or more per hour. I've never tried to view a CubeSat; I expect they are too small to be bright enough. But most decent sized spacecraft in low earth orbit are fairly easy to spot."},{"prompt":"Why is Lord Nelson considered as one of the most loved leaders of the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars?","completion":"Ultimately it comes down to the ‘Nelson Touch’, which contrary to what has been said elsewhere has bugger all to do with tactics and everything to do with leadership. Nelson had a particular knack for inspiring his subordinate officers, and giving them orders that were simple to understand while outlining what is overall intentions were. So in the heat of battle they could make educated decisions as to what to do to help the overall plan even without being able to see signals; “No man can do wrong if he lays his ship next to the losest enemy” is a rather simple concept even the dimmest of Officers could understand. (Yes, I may be slightly misquoting there). Basically ‘If you are not sure what to do find the nearest enemy ship and attack it’. If you think Captains didn’t need to be told this think again. Up until this point it was far from unusual for some ships in fleet actions to end up sailing up and down taking potshots at enemy ships at range. Or basically avoiding combat because they hadn’t been specifically ordered otherwise. Nelson invited the Captains of his fleets to dine with him, during which he would outline what his intentions in the case of a battle would be depending on the disposition of the enemy fleet. By the time they sighted a fleet, and were in a position to attack, his Captains didn’t need to be told what to do. They knew what to do, and were trusted to use their own intuitive and judgement to respond to the specific situation without needing micromanaging from the Flagship. In terms of tactics he was bold and aggressive, best summed up by Admiral William ‘Bull’ Halsey some 150 years later; “Strike fast, strike hard, strike often.” A quote that is rather understandable from Admiral Halsey when you add another one; “[Admiral Nelson's counsel] guided me time and again. On the eve of the critical battle of Santa Cruz, in which the Japanese ships outnumbered ours more than two to one, I sent my task force commanders this dispatch: ATTACK REPEAT ATTACK. They did attack, heroically, and when the battle was done, the enemy turned away. All problems, personal, national, or combat, become smaller if you don't dodge them, but confront them. Touch a thistle timidly, and it pricks you; grasp it boldly, and its spines crumble. Carry the battle to the enemy! Lay your ship alongside his!” However one thing Nelson wasn’t was revolutionary tactically. People often mistakenly claim that Nelson’s breaking of the line at Trafalgar was some revolutionary and unknown tactic. It wasn’t. Nelson was simply the first to carry out such a maneuver with considerable success. Breaking the line had been a dream for some time, and had been attempted before and even succeeded once or twice. If sometimes by accident rather than intent. It is also overlooked that Admiral Villeneuve, Nelsons opponent at Trafalgar not only predicted that Nelson would attempt to break his line, but where he would try to do so. He warned his Captains to expect this in fact. Quite why he failed to correctly counter this once the British Fleet was cruising towards him isn’t known."},{"prompt":"What does an IITian's resume look like?","completion":"Can’t remember.

I have been told by reliable sources that many ISIS fighters were treated for their wounds in Israeli hospitals. Also when ISIS fighters were driven out of an area they were allowed to leave peacefully. They were not rounded up and put in internment camps. So it is very clear that we know almost nothing about ISIS, who they are connected to, why they were supported, what they were supposed to accomplish, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera as Yul Brynner used to say.

You have to understand the north Korean mindset. If China decided to try and force NK to do something, they would actively refuse it. If China stated that NK had to do something or they would attack NK, NK would arm their nukes and get ready to fire them. And that is against China, their streongest and closest ally. They will not be pushed around by anyone and if anyone tries, they will be hit as hard as NK can hit. But China and Russia know this really well so China does not ever demand NK to do anything. They don’t stop NK from using nukes either. What they do is that they explain their position, their worries, their fears and asks for NK’s help in allaying those fears. Becasue they treat NK how NK expects to be treated, with equality and erspect, they always listen and do what their friend needs them to do. But they expect reciprosity from China and they get it too. If they go to China for money, there is no threat to it and no trade of this favor for that. They simply ask and it’s given.

In the world of investment, a variety of trading strategies have evolved, catering to different groups of trades. Today, for any asset segment, you will find four main types of trading strategies, namely day trading, scalp trading, swing trading, and positional trading. If you are planning to enter the market, then you need to pick up a style of trading that suits your trading personality. Normally, traders select one trading strategy and stick to it, but crossovers also happen, mostly in using technical indicators which are widely used and forms the base of technical trading. If you are a novice investor, it can take you a fair amount of time to understand each trading type. To make it easier for you, in this article, we will discuss position trading vs swing trading, the two common forms of long-term trading. If you Want to Learn Swing Trading and Positional trading First you should Learn Price Action Trading. Most Valuable Video. Swing Trading Swing trading is directional trading, where the trader tries to take advantage of short-term price movements. In swing trading, traders get involved in deals that span over several days or weeks. Unlike day traders, they trade infrequently and don’t close their position at day end. They hold onto their position and wait for a larger profit to emerge. They take a bigger risk for bigger profit and therefore, sometimes swing traders trade also against the market trend. They use market indicators and technical analysis to predict changes. When an asset enters the overbought or oversold area, the swing trader takes the opportunity to plan a trade. One difference between positional trading and swing trading, the latter has more trading opportunities than the former. Positional Trading The duration of positional trading is closer to long-term investment. Position traders enter into deals that can last for weeks and even months. However, in investment, the investor enters only a long position, but in positional trading, traders enter into both short and long positions. With this trading strategy, traders avoid the daily gyration that day traders undergo. Positional traders use an array of fundamental and technical analysis, trading indicators, and patterns to eliminate daily noise. On the fundamental level, positional traders rely on industry and company information to form a decision on their asset. They pick stocks that they believe will grow significantly over a period. They spend a lot of time in finding assets that worth their attention. Making The Decision In the discussion of position trading vs swing trading, often the question that arises next is which one is a better style of trading. Both trading styles focus on making a bigger profit by identifying assets with momentum and following a market trend to strike a deal when an opportunity arises. Traders adopt a style based on risk-taking ability, the time they want to invest, and also on market volatility. Before you initiate a trade, check the market condition for the asset. Both styles suit investors with long-term plans. However, swing traders would trade more frequently than position traders. You can adopt a swing trading technique if you aim at generating cash-flow.

However some tend to be standard across the board. Lying to a partner about important things and keeping secrets from them can be a form of betrayal, as it undermines trust and honesty in the relationship. Disrespecting your partners boundaries, wishes and feelings can also be easily tagged as betrayal as it shows a lack of care and consideration of your partners well-being. Abandoning a partner at times when they need support or leaving them in a time of crisis can be seen as betrayal. Manipulating your partner and trying to control their actions or decisions in an unhealthy way can also be a form of betrayal as it undermines their autonomy. To state the obvious Cheating itself is very easily termed betrayal because it shows a blatant disregard for the relationship as well as all the above. Usually most of these can be prevented through communication. Its one of the most important things in a relationship, and it usually means being upfront about your needs, boundaries and expectations and also hearing your partners perspective. Also building and maintaining trust is crucial for any healthy relationship. This means being honest, and following through on your commitments. Cheating can only be prevented by the parties themselves and can be very discrete at times.

When we went to pick it up they said I had ordered two orders of two. I only had enough cash for one of the orders. I only wanted one order of two pizzas. I asked what would happen if I didn’t take the second order of pizza. They told me they donate to a community food bank of some sort. Of course it made more sense for me not to get the pizza, FREE or otherwise. I checked when I got home, I had only ordered one order, and only had a single confirmation email. I was stoked to see that the policy was to give it to the needy/homeless when possible. I am unsure if this is a legitimate policy, because I remember the hesitancy of Jamba Juice and Circle K/Tosco Corp. both of which did not allow prepared food to be removed from premises unless paid for due to liabilities. I hope there is a policy in place that helps the broader community appropriately. So in a sense, while it wasn’t done in the criminal way, that’s my take on what happens when someone “orders” a pizza, and doesn’t pay. They offered for me to take it, but I thought it better suited in the homeless shelter/food bank."},{"prompt":"What's the most creative way you've seen someone discipline their children?","completion":"Sorry, John, but something I did about 25 years ago is the most creative and simple thing I can think of… My son was around five or six. His mother had moved about 90 miles away and had returned to the area on the condition that I would allow him to live with her most of the time. Then, she moved again (not so far) and I did not try to keep him with me, but I saw him often. One evening, on our way to my place from picking him up at his mother’s house, we were at the grocery store. He saw something he wanted while we were checking out. I said, “no, not today.” His lip started to quiver and he seemed to be going into some default behavior he had learned with his mother that got him what he wanted (I think her feelings of guilt had a lot to do with it). With love and kindness oozing from every word I said, I told him that when he whined or cried for something, I would automatically not be able to give it to him. However, if he did not like ‘no’ for an answer, he could always ask again and explain why he thought he should have his way. Then, I might change my mind or I might not. He never again whined or cried for what he wanted. He did, though feel his power to negotiate. His development went so well that a few years later, after I received a small windfall, I told him while at a Target store that he could pick out something for himself. He chose a big boombox. We put it in the cart. A few minutes later, he said something like, “dad, let’s put this boombox back, I really don’t need it.” I was floored. But, what I figured out - and maybe I don’t have it right - is that he felt he could get what he needed by simply explaining why he needed it and being honest about it. He felt his power and confidence with his father.

Tamarind’s been a steadfast favourite on London’s Indian fine-dining scene for a while : old-school, elegant and the first restaurant to win a Michelin star.

Points are generally more flexible than miles, and can be redeemed for various rewards like gift cards, merchandise, or statement credits. Points also tend to have a higher value per redemption than miles. On the other hand, miles are more useful for frequent travellers, as they can be redeemed for flights, hotel stays, and other travel-related expenses. Miles may also offer higher redemption value than points when used for travel. Ultimately, the worth of credit card rewards depends on how you plan to use them. If you're not a frequent traveller, points may be a better option for their flexibility and higher redemption value. However, if you travel frequently, miles may be more valuable to you because they can offset travel expenses.

In one respect the answer is no because the waves concerned are electromagnetic waves. Not electric waves or magnetic waves, Electromagnetic waves. See this picture of an electromagnetic wave? It’s totally wrong. There aren’t two orthogonal waves present. There’s only one wave present. An electromagnetic wave does NOT consist of an electric electric wave [LINKED_TEXT: E] [URL: https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=electric%20wave%20e&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwihlbm4w4_mAhWltXEKHexzC9QQ_AUoAnoECA4QBA&biw=1280&bih=894#spf%3D1575034158776] and a magnetic wave [LINKED_TEXT: B] [URL: https://www.google.co.uk/search?biw=1280&bih=894&tbm=isch&sa=1&ei=Lh3hXaqNNY_zgQb6zIX4Dw&q=magnetic%20wave%20B&oq=magnetic%20wave%20B&gs_l=img.3..0i24.22734.26158..26504...0.0..0.75.650.12......0....1..gws-wiz-img.......0j0i8i30j0i8i10i30j0i67j0i8i7i30j0i30.yAHw1ZssZ_0&ved=0ahUKEwiq3LG8w4_mAhWPecAKHXpmAf8Q4dUDCAY&uact=5#spf%3D1575034187137] orthogonal to one another. The so-called electric wave is merely the spatial derivative of the real wave. The so-called magnetic wave is merely the time derivative. See the Wikipedia [LINKED_TEXT: electromagnetic radiation] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Electromagnetic_radiation&oldid=831476647#Derivation_from_electromagnetic_theory] article and note this: “the curl operator on one side of these equations results in first-order spatial derivatives of the wave solution, while the time-derivative on the other side of the equations, which gives the other field, is first order in time”. To get some understanding of this, imagine you’re in an orange canoe at sea, riding over a 10m tsunami. As this wave approaches, your canoe tilts upward. The degree of tilt denotes E, whilst the rate of change of tilt denotes B. The degree of tilt increases along with the rate of change of tilt because the wave is sinusoidal. When you’re halfway up the wave, both are at a maximum. Then the tilt starts to decrease, until you’re momentarily at the top of the wave. At this point your canoe is horizontal and has momentarily stopped tilting. Hence this is a place where E and B are zero, even though the potential is at a maximum. Then as you go down the other side, the situation is reversed. We can plot it like this: Note though that the top portion of the picture is showing you the wave, not the bottom portion. The bottom portion is merely plotting the spatial and time derivatives of the real wave. In another respect the answer is yes because in a strange sort of way, the neutrino is a magnetic wave. That’s because electromagnetism can be likened to twist and turn, and because a magnetic field is a spin field or turn field or rotor field. Don’t forget that an electron goes round in circles in a uniform magnetic field, and that people use the word “rot” in electromagnetism. William Gilbert knew this in 1600.

To emulate a neutrino you need a pair of pliers. You need to twist that washing line, then let go. A rotational wave zips down that washing line. Twang! That’s my take on it anyway.

Avoid tapping too hard, as this can damage the gauge or cause the needle to overshoot the zero mark.Reconnect the gauge: Reconnect the gauge to the system or device it was measuring and turn the source of pressure back on.Confirm zero reading: Check to see if the gauge is reading zero again after reconnecting it to the system. If it is not reading zero, repeat the above steps until the gauge is properly calibrated. It is important to regularly calibrate and maintain pressure gauges to ensure accurate readings and reliable performance. If you find that your gauge is not returning to zero or is consistently showing inaccurate readings, it may be time to replace the gauge or have it professionally calibrated."},{"prompt":"As a nurse, what was the most extreme example you have seen of a patient with addictive behavior?","completion":"After observing nurses discarding opiates and benzodiazepine syringes into a sharp box, one of our addicts tore a sharp box off the wall to get at the meds inside.

While I don't have specific information about a particular product or program with that name, I can give you some general pros and cons of approaches designed to manage blood sugar. Here they are: Pros: Blood sugar control: Following a smart blood sugar approach can help individuals with diabetes or prediabetes maintain stable blood sugar levels. This can contribute to overall better health and reduce the risk of complications associated with high or unstable blood sugar. Weight management: Some smart blood sugar approaches focus on a healthy, balanced diet that promotes weight management. By controlling portion sizes, choosing nutrient-dense foods, and limiting added sugars, individuals may be able to achieve or maintain a healthy weight, which can positively impact blood sugar control. Increased energy levels: Stable blood sugar levels can help prevent energy crashes and provide sustained energy throughout the day. By avoiding extreme fluctuations in blood sugar, individuals may experience improved energy levels and better focus. Education and awareness: Many smart blood sugar programs provide educational resources and support to help individuals understand the impact of different foods on blood sugar levels. This knowledge empowers individuals to make informed choices and develop healthy eating habits. Cons: Lack of scientific evidence: While some smart blood sugar approaches may be based on sound principles, it's important to note that not all programs or products have been rigorously studied or supported by scientific evidence. Some claims may be exaggerated or based on anecdotal experiences rather than scientific research. Restrictive diets: Some smart blood sugar approaches may require significant dietary changes or restrictions. This can be challenging for individuals, particularly if they have specific dietary preferences or restrictions. Strict dietary regimens may also be difficult to maintain long-term. Individual variations: Each person's body is unique, and what works for one person may not work for another. It's important to consider individual factors, such as metabolism, lifestyle, and any underlying health conditions, when adopting a smart blood sugar approach. Consulting with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian is advisable. Overemphasis on blood sugar: While blood sugar control is important for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes, solely focusing on blood sugar levels may overlook other aspects of health, such as cardiovascular health, nutrient balance, and overall well-being. A comprehensive approach that considers multiple health factors is generally recommended. Remember, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian before starting any specific dietary program or making significant changes to your diet, especially if you have underlying health conditions. They can provide personalized guidance and help you make informed decisions about managing your blood sugar.

On February 2nd, 2020, a 22-year-old girl named Sabrina Harooni was brutally beaten to death by her boyfriend Nicholas Alexander Forman in Gilbertsville, Pennsylvania. She had been dating him for seven months. She would stay over at his place three or so times a week. That night she saw the Super Bowl with him, then went home with him in an Uber. After she joked about a text message from an ex-boyfriend, Forman flew into a rage in the car. She said “You’re scaring me,” according to the driver. The driver dropped them off at Forman’s place but stayed parked outside for a while. He heard Forman screaming at Sabrina for a good ten minutes. But he just left. The next morning Forman brought Sabrina’s body to the emergency room. He claimed she had been severely beaten by three girls she’d argued with at a bar and given her address to for a faceoff. Forman’s lying texts to a friend: But a search of Forman’s phone showed photos of Sabrina lying face-down on the floor in his apartment. Police also found a 13-second video of Forman screaming at a bloodied and unresponsive Sabrina: “This is what a cheating liar gets. You hear me? Cheating fucking liar.” A reporter filmed Forman as he was getting arrested. Forman is smiling and calm as a cucumber. He denies any wrongdoing to the arresting officers. When the reporter asks him about the video, Forman gives him the finger and curses him out. Perkiomen Township man charged w/ murder after beating death of his girlfriend.

She was also an extremely beautiful girl who had barely just exited her teens. YouTube comments by people who claim to have known Forman say he was a very “shady” drug dealer and addict with a history of domestic violence. At the time he murdered Sabrina, he was also on probation for drunk driving and resisting arrest. Apparently, his family is quite wealthy. Sabrina could easily have been with any man she wanted. How on earth did she end up with a bottom-feeder like Forman? Not just with him — she was clearly enough in love with him that she followed him home and into seclusion even after he flew into a rage and terrified her over a misinterpreted joke. It cost her her life. As a Middle Eastern ex-Muslim, I find something like this to be my worst nightmare. I’m a very strong believer in the liberation of the Muslim woman and I despise the slavish restrictions put on a daughter’s life by the typical conservative Muslim household. But I don’t want stories like Sabrina’s to be the result. Sabrina was completely Americanized — even her first name would tell you that — and she was given an upbringing to match, and complete freedom which she combined with superficial dating preferences and very poor judgment in men. Her family was so liberal with her that they didn’t even know she had a dangerous live-in boyfriend. They had never heard of Forman before he was introduced to them as her murderer. Liberating our daughters should not mean letting them stray completely with their peers, become unrecognizably Americanized, adopt a foolhardy lifestyle, and fall into evil company. Just like boys, they must made aware of the world before they step out into it. But they must be much better-prepared, because they are more vulnerable. Sabrina Harooni didn’t even weigh 100 pounds. May her spirit rest."},{"prompt":"What happens when a title search doesn't find an HOA associated with a house that is being purchased then the HOA president claims the title search company made a mistake and the house belongs to the HOA?","completion":"The HoA president doesn’t have a say in it.

Though the video I linked extended the scene for comedic effect, it was just looped."},{"prompt":"What do British conservatives think about such things as gun rights, ending abortion, ending gay marriage, and restoring the death penalty?","completion":"To add to the existing excellent answers, what surprises me as someone who lives in the UK is the belief that these areas of policy have some link that means a party would seek to distinguish itself from others by having a unique stance on all of them. There is, of course, the general trend that the left and right have a different view on the balance between individual freedom and collective responsibility with the right favouring the former and the left the latter, though this is stronger in questions of economics than for life in general. For all that the right are not fascist and the left are not communism. Of those policies, allowing abortion and gay marriage is actually allowing individual freedom rather than restricting individuals because some of the rest of society doesn’t like what they do so, if anything, you would expect the right, which is where the Conservative Party operates, to be in favour of the right to choose an abortion and the right to choose your partner freed from restrictions over what sex that partner can be. In practice, though, the left share this view too and these things are not matters of great debate here in the UK. Supporting a right to carry a gun does seem a slightly more right wing idea but, in practice, UK public opinion is sufficient in favour of gun control and against a proliferation of guns that no party is going tp relax gun control. We find living free from the fear of being shot a greater freedom than that of carrying a gun. The death penalty is slightly different in that many people in the population express a desire for it but politicians of all parties are mainly against it. It isn’t considered a civilised way to run a country especially when there is the possibility if making mistakes and having the state execute people who turn out to be innocent. Another factor that maybe relevant is that, although the UK does not officially have separation of the church and state, which I think the USA does, religion plays less of a part in UK politics than it does in the USA - our Conservative party is not the “puritanical party”."},{"prompt":"What are some little known benefits to leasing a vehicle rather than purchasing?","completion":"It depends on price and terms.

Then again original video of his retirement with the low voice of dravid says, It is 16 years since I played my first Test match for India and today I feel it is time to move on. Then comes the major photos of Rahul Dravid’s entire career 1st with his some childhood photos then debut photo then some of his major innings photos(vs aus 2001, vs aus adelide, vs pak, vs ban fractured jaw, as a captain, his 3rd six vs eng in his only T20 with commentry 3 sixes on a row etc etc) and important one is his wicket keeping photo that should be in that frame, stepping down from captaincy after world cup loss, and finally ending with my 2 fav. Photos rahul dravid vs eng. Batted all the innings that pic of paternerships and last photo Lords test century celebration of Dravid pumping his hand. This should show on big screen in a way that one photo will be shown on the middle of the screen then goes to the back ground then next photo comes to the middle of the screen and then goes to background like that all photos should be arranged like a wall with some commentry like solid defence, look at the intensity in his eyes, the wall that will never break, etc etc and last with some intense voice THE GREAT WALL OF INDIA when last 2 photos shown on big screen.

You don’t think George McGovern would have embraced Medicare for all and the Green New Deal? What the Democratic Party has not experienced in the recent past is the current trend toward ideological purity, inflexibility, and populism. In the past, Democrats were willing to work toward a goal and accept compromises (compromises among themselves and across the aisle) that brought incremental, positive change. That is how civil rights legislation was achieved. Democrats stayed on message and let society catch up with the necessity of increasing the rights and liberties of groups that were disadvantaged and discriminated against. It is why interracial marriage is no longer illegal. It is why gay marriage is no longer illegal. Quite frankly, on these issues Democrats just outlasted the radical sons-of-bitches who were opposed to minorities, women, LGBTQ, and all people having equal rights (excuse my insensitive language, but I’m old and words fail me for those SOBs). It’s a battle to be sure, but history and time is in the favor of progressive values. Today, it appears some Democrats are looking for a Savior to make it all happen during one presidential election. Here’s a clue: there is no savior and, in the long run, congressional elections and elections for state legislatures are equally, if not more, important. As we saw in 2008 and 2012, winning the presidential election may make Democrats feel good, but it doesn’t mean they can affect lasting change. Why is it the polls show the majority of people in the US today would accept Medicare for all and better gun regulations, yet that legislation cannot move through Congress? Why is it most Americans support a woman's right to choose, but state legislatures are passing laws attempting to restrict that right? It is because Democrats have lost elections in Congress and in state legislatures throughout the country. Democrats are focused on ideology and instant gains. Consequently, we have a Republican president appointing conservative judges to the Supreme Court, and a Republican majority in the Senate whose leader thinks he doesn’t have to compromise because Democrats will keep losing elections in the state legislatures and the House. We have Republican state legislatures trying to restrict abortion. If the Democrats could get their act together and win a majority in both houses of Congress, or at least enough votes that some Republicans would be willing to compromise with them, things could get done. If Democrats could win more seats in state legislatures, the blatant Republican gerrymandering that took place over the last two decades could be counteracted and we wouldn’t gave to spend time challenging the silly “bathroom laws” and restrictive anti-abortion legislation some state legislatures pass. It’s not about how liberal the Democratic Party is, it’s about the big picture. It’s about having enough unity and sense to allow differences within the Party. It’s about realizing that some Democrats are corporate executives and business owners, and not preaching that all corporations are evil and greedy. It’s about realizing that some Democrats are hunters and gun owners. It’s about knowing that policy objectives, like access to healthcare for everyone, can be achieved in various ways, regardless of what you call it or what “model” it follows, if any. It doesn’t matter if the label says social democracy, Democratic socialist, or capitalist-social democracy with a cherry on top. It’s the issues. Ideology may direct focus on the issues, but it should not direct the strategy or execution necessary to achieve the legislation necessary to address those issues. It is true that the GOP’s radical base has moved that party farther right than ever. However, just moving the Democratic Party “farther left” is not the answer. What does that even mean? I don’t know of any Democrats who would not accept universal healthcare, better firearms legislation, or better regulations to protect the environment. I don’t know of any Democrats who want to overturn Roe v Wade, do you? How much do we have to agree on ideologically to be united enough to win elections? Perhaps this tendency toward being uncompromising and impatient is a reaction to the Republican base being dominated by inflexible far-right groups and evangelicals who eschew compromise of any kind. I understand. However, Democrats need to stay on message, work together, and not castigate and exclude each other over over the finer points of progressive/liberal ideology. When it comes to defeating the far-right base controlling the Republican Party today, Democrats need to unite, get their act together, and outlast those sons-of-bitches."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between granite and marble?","completion":"Granite and marble are both popular natural stones used in construction and decorative applications, but there are significant differences between them.

Is it as bad as his previous books?","completion":"Initially I was not interested to read this book, thinking it’s gonna be one of those usual but with twists love stories which it usually turns out to be. But I was interested by the prologue of it. This book will definitely interest you more if you are ready to accept the fact that never love anyone too much. Like any other stories of Chetan Bhagat, this book is definitely with a twist, but unexpected ones. Keshav, who is an Alumnus of an IIT and thinks himself a loser as he broke up with the love of his life, graduating with lesser grades and no job but ending up as a tutor in Chandan tutions, preparing IIT aspirants to crack the JEE exam along with his friend Saurabh, whom he meets as a colleague proves himself to be a great friend in this. Together they solve the murder case of Zara (the love of his life with whom he broke up years ago). Zara, who had moved on after break up getting along with Raghu, who is a successful IIT graduate, setting up his own company was having that perfect life. She was about to get engaged to him and almost about to marry. On her birthday night, Zara texts Keshav asking him how he could forget to wish her on her birthday. That text from Zara won’t let Kehsav sleep in peace and sets to leave to her room (Room number 105). With all the efforts, after years of break up, going to wish his ex on her birthday is surprised or more of shocked finding out that Zara is dead. He finds it really hard to digest the fact of her death. Keshav along with Saurabh tries to solve this case even though they had to drop the plan of investigating further on this case, as they were getting into huge troubles. Keshav did find evidences and suspected several people to be the murderer of Zara like her professor Mr. Saxena(her guide), Safdar(her dad) , Sikander (her step brother). But it turned out that they were all innocent. At the end Keshav and Saurabh finally find out the murderer who happens to be the close friend of Zara who is Faiz (family friend, and a reputed military officer). They plan for the family meet so that he can expose the killer in front of all. But there is a twist about who the killer actually is. Now another interesting part of the story, apart from knowing who the real killer is that was the text really sent by Zara before she died? Or was it the killer? It’s even amazing to see how an IITian who thought was a loser in his life, turns out to be a detective just to find out the killer so that Zara’s soul can rest in peace."},{"prompt":"w do I create a customized WordPress website?","completion":"WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) that allows you to create a website or blog from scratch, or build upon an existing site.

In electricity, when the circuit breaker senses too much flow (amps) it snaps open and stops the current flow. Short circuits in electricity is like opening all the water valves as far as you can and letting all the water pour through the pipes. If you get too much water you have a flood. If you have too many amps for the wires, the wires start to get hot. That can cause a fire.

He tells you all you really need to know if you are willing to experiment and learn by doing. Read the rest of this answer if that does not give you enough to get started or you are so timid that you need a road map to start anything. It’s acceptable to be timid; a lot of people are not self-starters with music and don’t have the confidence to try new things without knowing what the result will be. Following are some details Ronald left out because, perhaps, they don’t really matter to confident people. Musicians with natural ability usually don’t need to learn “rules” before composing music because they have already, effortlessly, absorbed these guidelines in the course of learning to sing and play musical instruments. They are shown how to produce certain sounds, quickly learn what they sound like, then reproduce them at will when they “know” that they will “fit right”. This knowledge is merely an internalization and acceptance of the accepted practice as “right”. Musicians often describe their use of such discrimination in ethereal, semi-mystical terms, usually something like “feeling the flow” or “going where the music takes you” or “getting into the groove”. To many, though, such explanations are meaningless because they don’t explicitly tell you what to do. When you ask the guru what exactly one is supposed to do, you may get a non-answer like, “Oh, I don’t know. Just let your muse guide you.” The trouble is that most of us don’t have a divine inner voice that directs us to play certain notes or chords. We have no idea what they are talking about. We whine, “Just tell me what chords to play!” And so, one gets a lead sheet that lists the chords to play for that piece. You play the chords in time with the melody. You or someone else sings the lyrics. Now what? You still have no idea why those chords sound “right” with that song. You know it has something to do with the stated “key” in which the piece is set, but any explanation you elicit is too complicated for you to use and you still don’t know why you’re doing anything. Fortunately, the simple explanation for what “sounds right” and what “sounds weird” exists. Novices usually are not apprised of this idea because their guru feels that it is “obvious” and does not require explanation. Instead, the novice is directed to learn voluminous tables of letter names of tones, some followed by sharps (♯) and flats (♭). That’s the hard way. It can be a lot easier. What the querent seems to be alluding to in using the term “valid” is whether or not certain chords “sound right” or “sound good” when used as accompaniment for melodies set in scales other than the usual major and minor diatonic scales that predominate in Western classical music. That criterion, subjectively assessed euphony, is mainly a cultural artifact. Simply put, if they use those chords in the music to which you habitually listen, then it “sounds right”. If you don’t routinely hear music of that sort, it may “sound weird” or “discordant” or just “bad”. Such assessments are entirely arbitrary and specific to a cultural milieu. That said, however, there is one simple way to guarantee that a chord will at least not be discordant: Build the chord using only scale degree tones. Really. That’s all there is to it. “Discordant” means that the chord contains one or more tones that sound “wrong”. The idea of “wrong” is that said tone “does not fit” in the context of the individual notes and chords sounded in proximity to it. The oddball note or chord, i.e., a tone, or chord containing a tone that is not a scale degree, sounds out of place. Is that simple enough for you? If you wish to strictly follow the musical form that defines the scale you are using, then the deviant tone “sounds wrong” and possibly “bad”. If you like the sound produced, but a note’s pitch is, or a chord contains, a tone that is not in the scale defined for the key signature on the score for the piece, then the piece is probably something more sophisticated than a simple folk tune. It may be jazz, blues, “highbrow” European classical music, avant-garde modern music (e.g., John Cage), non-European music of any sort, or even garage-band thrash metal. Every such genre has its own rules and norms. These norms require the use of accidentals (the musicological term for non-diatonic-scale tones) noted in scores rendered using standard Western musical notation. So, given that one is trying to use something other than a diatonic scale for a musical piece, what chords can you use? We’re circling back to the original question, to which the answer is, “No.” Chord progression charts you are likely to find will be constructed with the assumption that you are employing a diatonic scale. If you try to “sledgehammer” a set of chords, from a chart organized by major key diatonic scale tonic, over a different type of scale with the same tonic, you will have a lot of accidentals. If two scales are different, and they have the same tonic, then some of the tones in one scale will not be present in the other. That is by definition. It’s possible for two different scales to be coincident, that is, one scale is a subset of the other, but only if the two scales have different tonics. It is possible, and often convenient, to use a major (Ionian mode) diatonic scale chord chart to figure out a set of chords to use with a different diatonic scale. The trick is to know which Ionian tonic’s set of chords to use for the other type of diatonic scale’s tonic. The common example is to calculate the relative major (Ionian) tonic of an equivalent minor (Aeolian mode) scale. (“Equivalent” here means that the two scales use the same seven tones.) The usual example is A minor and C major. Rather than get balled up in the circle of fifths and why it explains everything, we are taught to raise the minor key’s tonic by three semitones. One can delve into the idea of key signatures all you want, but if you just want to know what chords to play for a minor key, then counting three semitones up is all you need. Curiously, instructors seem to always present this information by talking about the Ionian scale first, telling you that you can find a major key’s relative minor by descending by three semitones. This kind of music establishment backward thinking boggles my mind. If you are using Ionian mode, then you already know which row or column of the chord chart to use, the one labeled with the same name as the key in which the piece is set. (Duh.) What you need the three-semitone rule for is ascend in pitch to the relative major’s tonic from the tonic of the minor key given. Again, DUH! The “relative” calculation can be applied to the other five classical modes beside Aeolian that are not Ionian. In all cases, we need to ascend or descend by the right number of semitones from the tonic of the stated mode’s scale to the tonic of the equivalent (you know, same seven tones) Ionian mode scale. A surprising number of musicians don’t know about this and only calculate relative major and minor scale tonics. For anything else, they will just memorize sets of chord names and the progression that employs those chords. This is harder to do than memorizing the offset in semitones for each mode from Ionian mode. Since the twelve tone names wrap for each octave, it’s just as easy to calculate an offset of n semitones in one direction as 12-n semitones in the other direction. Here are the offsets for each of the six modes’ tonics to the tonic of the equivalent Ionian scale. Ionian - 0 (major)Dorian - +10/-2 (Salsa, anyone?)Phrygian - +8/-4 (extremely rare, mainly for simulating “exotic” music)Lydian - +7/-5 (occasionally found in jazz)Mixolydian - +5/-7 (more often than you would guess in pop and folk music)Aeolian - +3/-9 (minor)Locian - +1/-11 (No one uses this, ever.) There is actually an easier way to do this, but it entails memorizing the circle of fifths, the magic sequence that integrates the entire system of key signatures, modes, scale degree tones, chords and chord progressions. But, the question was about which column or row of your chord chart to use when you need a set of chords to play in some diatonic mode other than Ionian with a given tonic. If you just memorize these six offsets, you will be able to count up or down from the stated tonic and use the chords indicated for the equivalent Ionian tonic. Easy-peasy. Music instructors are fond of explaining this offset scheme in terms of the diatonic scale degrees, which is a more complex calculation, and it boils down to counting semitones anyway. Guitar players can do this more easily than keyboard players by counting frets from the target mode’s stated tonic on a string, going the required number frets (i.e., semitones) from it, and then determining, “What tone is that?” This scheme only works for the seven modes of diatonic scales. If you are using any other type of scale, you must forget about chord charts showing sets of chords for diatonic scales and revert to the simpler model of using only chords whose component tones are scale degrees of that scale. I answered this question because I was struggling to come up with some better chords for an original arrangement of the song Misirlou. My research revealed that the song uses the maqam hijaz kar, also known as the Byzantine scale. I could easily figure out what tones were scale degrees, but figuring out the full set of chords composed of scale degrees was tedious and I gave up. Fortuitously, an internet search yielded this web site that showed everything I need to know.

Kids at times give mind blowing advices. Incident 1. This happened a year ago. We were watching the movie named as 3 idiots, there was a scene where Aamir Khan helped a lady deliver a baby. My daughter asked me how he went inside the blanket empty handed and came out with a baby. She asked me,” How did the baby come out of that lady's stomach?”. My son and my daughter looked towards me expecting an answer. My daughter asked me,” Are there eggs in her stomach and did the baby come out of the egg?” I asked my daughter to grab her science book and I opened the chapter on mammals. We forgot the movie and muted the TV and I showed them the pictures of mammals and I told them that just like mammals there are oviparous animals. I told them that human beings are mammals and hence we can't lay eggs and that just like cow, goat, giraffe we too give birth straight to our mini versions. My daughter questioned me again,” But, how did he take the baby out of her stomach”. I said that he didn't take the baby out but instead the baby came out naturally. She asked me,”But how?” I asked them if they have seen a cow give birth to a Calf. They both shouted an yes. I asked them how the baby calf had came out. My son said,” from where the cow drops cow dung and passes susu(urine)”. I said,”Exactly!” My daughter asked me again,” I know how a cow gives birth amma(mom). I am asking about the woman in the movie”. I said,” She is a mammal too just like a cow or a goat”. My daughter blinked not understanding and my son hit his forehead with his palm and said,” Aiyoo…Sanju, if cow gives birth from where it susus(urinates) obviously even she would have given birth the same way”. I sat open mouthed listening his explanation. I didn't get this logic when I was 20 years old and ended up getting scolded by the doctor for asking her how come a baby that big come out and from where(facepalm). My daughter put on a yucky expression and asked me if they were born the same way. I told them that there are other methods ‘manual methods' when something doesn't work out naturally and I showed them the 9 inch Caesarean cut and told them that they were pulled out from my stomach by tearing it a bit(yes, I did say it in a dramatic voice.. hehehehe) (As I am typing this I suddenly remembered Macduff from Macbeth. This is what happens, my mind just drifts away ;-p) Incident 2: This happened recently when my daughter was staying at my mom's place and me and my son were watching a Tamil flick and there comes an Ad of Zivame. My son turned towards me and asked me what it was. I said,” you say Arjun. I think you know” He said,” girls wear it inside their clothes Amma(mom)”. I said,” hmmmm”. He then asked me,”Do you wear it too? But why doesn't Sanju(his sister) wear it then?” I pulled out the strip and casually said,” yes, I do wear it and Arjun are there small girls in the Ad? It is for elders Arjun and also it's one's personal choice too. It's one's wish to either wear it or not”. He said,” Why should only elders wear it?” I said,” You used to roam naked in the house when you were 2 years old. Do you do the same now?” He wailed,” Ammaaaaa(moooooom) I have grown up now and I feel shy to walk around naked. What mom, you don't even know this?” I then told him that everything depends on time and that there are different stages in life to do certain things and to wear certain things. Just like he will start getting a moustache one day, girls too undergo certain changes and hence they might feel comfortable wearing certain types of clothes and that we must respect each other's choices. He nodded his head agreeing and we both went out to the car shed to play football. On a lighter note. Whenever my mom asks me not to put my son in boarding as she fears that he might learn unnecessary things at a young age from other kids my mind voice will be “I will be happy if this fellow doesn't spoil anyone's mind with such questions”. Kids ask tons of questions everyday and sometimes I stammer to give proper answer to them. I am careful to give educative and informative answers without making it sound awkward or which builds unnecessary curiosity in them. If anyone think of it as an easy job, ask the parents of 2 curious kids, they will better answer as to how difficult it gets at times to answer their questions without picking a cane to teach them lessons.

Timothy might be right. After all, he knows nutrition. The BMI was implemented to categorize a person's weight, not to make medical recommendations. For that, get a doctor. But if you want to know how the medical profession feels about your weight, use their BMI. You didn't mention your age, so here is another for teens and children. [LINKED_TEXT: BMI Calculator for Child and Teen] [URL: https://www.cdc.gov/healthyweight/bmi/calculator.html] Regardless of what the BMI was originally created for, today it is used by the medical profession to categorize weight. If it offends you, talk to your doctor about it. In some cases BMI is not accurate, and is not used. When you look at some athletes they will not be overfat, but BMI will classify them as overweight. Not sure how you would explain that for an underweight person, but talk it over with your doctor. Maybe together you can come up with a credible reason. Timothy does make some really bad mistakes about BMI in talking about the most physically fit people in the world, the athletes. Even though not that many are outside of the ‘normal’ BMI range, the medical profession doesn't use BMI on elite athletes. Timothy would have a great deal of trouble naming even one elite runner that has an overweight BMI. Usain Bolt, being the most elite runner has a ‘normal’ BMI, as do the others he is competing with. Again, elite athletes are not using BMI, so especially don't expect Olympic weightlifters to concern themselves with it. However, if you have seen them, you would see many also have an exceptionally high amount of body fat. So saying weight lifters are in ‘peak physical condition’ might be a bit of a stretch. That some are considered obese by BMI might be a fair assessment. Christian Renaldo is another great example of why you don't use BMI on elite athletes. Even though he was named the fittest man in the world, at 6′ 2″, and 184 pounds he is ‘normal’ according to BMI. BMI does not take into account that he is a professional footballer that trains for 3–4 hours per day, five days a week, and only looking at his height and weight calls him ‘normal’. Normal is NOT to train, at all. With 86% of Americans saying they never exercise, that is 'normal', not up to 4 hours per day, and 5 days every week. So the more distant a person is from the norm, strangely, the more likely they are to get a ‘normal’ from BMI. The big exception being with elite weight lifters, and models. If you have had a chance to look you would have seen the average for models is around 17.5–18. In the end it is your body. If you are concerned why the medical profession would consider you slightly underweight you can always ask. But, just because the BMI doesn't give you the answer you want, I would not ignore it. It is an indicator, like blood pressure, or blood sugar, that your doctor can explain the risks to you. From that, you can determine if you are underfat, under muscled, or of low bone density."},{"prompt":"When will liberals realize that the reason Trump is so successful is because he represents everything liberals hate?","completion":"What do you know about “liberals”?

I can’t say I’ve known a ton of ENFPs, but the people I’ve encountered whom I read as being ENFPs generally fit the following: Are naturally, genuinely friendly. And I don’t think most people are. With some people, you get a feel like they’re specifically trying to network, or it’s otherwise professional-related. With most people, it’s more like, “This is what I’m supposed to do”. With many people, you know it’s fake, or you figure out at some point that it is. I know a lot of “smile in your face, talk behind your back” people. And not that ENFPs never talk behind anyone’s back, because they do. But I’ve found that it’s more like, “I don’t mean any harm, but this is just true”. With them, they’re not friendly because that’s society’s etiquette rule, like everybody else, or because they see you as a potential business contact or because you work together or whatever—that’s just how they are.I think it’s really hard for them to dislike or hate a person, and it seems like it does have to be earned. This is especially interesting with the women, because women generally are very good at disliking/hating other people for no real, legitimate reason. But ENFP women give props where props are due. They’re not threatened by you for no inarticulate reason—if they see something good in you, they’ll tell you and compliment it. They see the good.The flip side of that is I don’t think they always see the bad or when something’s not working with someone socially, and it can be hard to deal with people like that because you can’t really tell them anything where that’s concerned (meaning they don’t listen when you point out serious flaws in others). But in general, it’s not so much that I feel like they accept everybody (because I don’t know that I ever have really been accepted by one) as it is I feel like it takes a lot for them to be like, “Okay, I don’t like this person,” or to start just trashing you behind your back with more than just “I’m stating facts” / “I’m teasing” intent behind it.They’re the type most likely to say stuff about uplifting people, supporting people, sticking together, we’re all equal and all of that stuff that I usually find to be complete bullshit and is almost always complete bullshit when someone else says it…and actually mean it and think it and act like it. And this, along with the genuine friendliness and my last bullet point (which really are kind of different ways of saying the same thing, I think), might be the biggest reason why they’re so likeable and popular—it’s the fact that most people get the vibe from them that they are genuinely thinking and acting like we’re all “the same” or all “a community” and supportive or whatever nonsense. And that can lead to issues if they really can’t recognize and respect how you’re actually not the same, how the world is not just one big community, that you’re never going to get everyone to support everyone else and all of that. But being ahead of everyone else on this is admirable and attractive anyway. They have a fun-loving side. Sometimes at the expense of getting down to business, which can be irritating. But it’s like how babies, kids and dogs can be irritating a lot of the time, i.e. they’re still cute 90% of the time instead of them annoying you so much that you want to cut ties. Hard to stay mad at because, even if you don’t consciously think it, you know they don’t really mean any harm…and also because of the irresistible light that comes from their personality most of the time.They appear to be naturally good at stuff that most people aren’t. And it can differ from ENFP to ENFP. But they’re the people I usually watch and am like, “How are you so good at that??” or “How did you do that??” Always mesmerizing to watch them in these moments.They talk to everyone as if they’re already friends. Which is kind of an example of a “how are you so good at that” thing. They hardly ever seem uncomfortable with anyone new—or, really, with anyone—which is why it’s kind of interesting to read from many ENFPs that they act shy or are quiet around their love interests."},{"prompt":"Can you show me your shirtless body (only boys)?","completion":""},{"prompt":"What’s your best advice for a 17yearold turning 18?","completion":"Wearing makeup is an option based on what you feel like for the day, not to impress someone else or to fit in.

Aloe vera has soothing and moisturizing properties that can benefit the skin. It can help hydrate the skin, reduce inflammation, and promote healing. However, it's important to note that everyone's skin is unique, and some individuals may experience adverse reactions or allergies to aloe vera. To ensure safety, it's recommended to perform a patch test before applying aloe vera gel to your entire face. Apply a small amount of gel to a small area of your skin (such as the inner forearm) and leave it on for 24 hours to check for any adverse reactions. Additionally, if you have sensitive skin or are prone to acne, it's best to choose an aloe vera gel that is specifically formulated for the face and labeled as non-comedogenic (won't clog pores). Lastly, be cautious if you are using aloe vera gel that contains other ingredients or additives, as they may not be suitable for overnight use. Always read the product label and follow the manufacturer's instructions. If you have any concerns or questions, it's advisable to consult with a dermatologist or healthcare professional."},{"prompt":"Who is the most vile and heartless villain in comics?","completion":"I'll show you a villain who manages to be both realistic and unrealistic at the same time, a villain in a position of power, a villain which most people don't even know about, underrated character from a comic who's currently underrated and “old\\". God's will himself, Pope Innocent XLII: (Grendel Omnibus TPB 3(part 1)) If you look at him under the civilians's point of view, Innocent seems to be a charismatic and caring leader, with his sweet words coming from the lord Almighty himself: He represents God’s will. Being the Pope and the most powerful man on Earth, all of his actions are seen as beneficial to others and purely altruistic. While his rival, Grendel, is the will of the Devil: Grendel wishes to overthrow Innocent's government, Grendel is completely demented, uncharismatic and downright demonic: However, Grendel is seemingly more “heroic and admirable” than Innocent, because Grendel doesn't lie about what he wants and what he's willing to do, he doesn't hide that he isn't good, he doesn't hide behind social masks, Grendel is his face. Innocent looks good on the surface. Inside, he's a snake: With a eyes who burn like Hell itself: Innocent is completely narcissistic and doesn't accept when people don't treat him as he sees himself: Innocent doesn't mind mass murder if it fits his objectives: Innocent is completely blind to the people's suffering: He doesn't care about them or their feelings, he doesn't care about children: If you don't share his beliefs or don't treat him with respect, this is what happens: And those who don't survive the torture are thrown for a crocodile to eat: Innocent is a perfect example of what happens when you leave a fox in charge of taking care of the chicken, a devil in charge of a church……Literally: (Grendel Omnibus TPB 3(part 2)) Innocent isn't just an evil, narcissistic bastard, the hole is much deeper. And he's a VERY known enemy for Grendel readers, he's Tujiro: (Grendel Omnibus TPB 2(part 1)) As Tujiro he was also one of the creepiest guys I've ever seen: Initially, he just had this creepy vibe that one might thought it would be just a performance of his…..But that changed when he got personally involved on a child's disappearance: Tujiro hunted down innocent children, took their eyes as trophies: Drank from their blood, and he cherished every minute of their suffering: Tujro is a monster, a devil more perverse than Grendel ever managed to be, an uglier entity than Argent the Wolf: This is a monster who has been hunting down men, women and children for more than hundreds of years, who ended up becoming the most powerful man on earth, and used his money and resources for his own selfish desires, like rendering the entire planet cold and dark, with the exception of the church: (Grendel Omnibus TPB 3 (part 1)) He's one of the most evil villains I've ever seen, and I daresay THE most evil villain I've ever seen. And unlike many others I've seen in both comics, movies and books, he feels almost real. His time as Tujiro could be compared to the Butcher of Rostov: His time as Pope Innocent could be compared to Vlad the Impaler: He feels like the same kind of twisted evil we have seen throughout the years, and that only makes him scarier to me."},{"prompt":"Atheists, take a look around.

It cannot have a one-sentence answer. It will be a good decision depending on the priorities and the expectations you have from the car. What is leasing?

Celtic languages and Latin also existed side by side for around 500 years with the native leadership adopted Latin rather than a completely new leadership imposed over the population. In Britain the Anglo-Saxons did their own farming so even where they took over regions with Celtic speaking farmers they had those Anglo-Saxon farming terms around to influence the Celtic speakers. That said, upland shepherding in northern England preserved a system of counting sheep that appears to have been a survival of Celtic referred to as yan-tan-tethra. There may have been other survivals prior to the industrial revolution that died out with the changing of technology and changes to farming. The Normans introduced a lot of words into English while they were in the ascendancy and Anglo-Norman French was the language of the upper classes for 300 years.

There are a number of regiments who wear their ceremonial uniform when guarding Buckingham palace and other sites but make no mistake - they are fully trained soldiers and they are authorised to use their bayonets if threatened. They will have had special training for the guard duty too. Others I am sure will post exact information about the troops that form the guard regiments, and that includes the household cavalry (their ceremonial uniform includes the metal breast plates and metal helms with the white plumage) as front line troops they are a mechanised unit with APCs and light tanks who have served with valour in a number of places.

This is what he did. 47 seconds video… He hid in the engine of this private jet in a bid to get to his desired destination. He had no fear of falling. Maybe he never thought he would be discovered. Thinking of doing something like this gives chills. He was arrested by the Ivorian military airbase. It shows the extent some could go to see their desire come through.

She has always been a survivor, but this is the first time she has experienced such a devastating loss. It is likely that her character will be changed forever by this experience. In the short term, Sharon is likely to be consumed by grief. She may lash out at those around her, or she may withdraw into herself. She may also struggle to cope with the practicalities of life without Keanu, such as raising their son, Dennis. In the long term, Sharon's character may become more hardened and cynical. She may lose her faith in people, or she may become more ruthless in her pursuit of her own goals. She may also become more protective of Dennis, and she may be less willing to trust others with his care. It is also possible that Sharon's character will be redeemed by Keanu's death. She may realize that she has been taking life for granted, and she may become more determined to live her life to the fullest. She may also become more selfless and compassionate, as she tries to help others who are grieving. Only time will tell how Keanu's death will affect Sharon's character development. However, it is clear that this is a major turning point for her, and it is likely that her character will be changed forever by this experience. Here are some specific ways that Sharon's character development could be affected by Keanu's death: She could become more ruthless and self-serving.She could become more protective of Dennis and less trusting of others.She could become more cynical and lose her faith in people.She could become more compassionate and selfless.She could become more withdrawn and isolated.She could become more determined to live her life to the fullest.

Reason he doesn’t like sand? It’s because Tatooine is where he and his mother were slaves, not because it simply gets everywhere. Losing Qui-gon is something he’s thought about a lot. The one who brought him out of slavery, fought for him to be a Jedi, and was quite frankly more capable of handling Anakin than Obi-wan was gone. After being a Jedi Padawan for awhile he had a vision of his mother in trouble, so he went to Tatooine to save her, and his mother died in his arms. Then he got revenge and murdered every single tuskan in that village. He felt like an outsider, judged for being himself as a youngling who came in at a late age. Mace Windu minded him with suspicion, and never truly agreed with the decision to train Anakin. He always was much more human than other Jedi. Since he came to the game late, he never really forced down his passions, his love for people, his genuine caring and ability to make deep emotional connections. He constantly needed to pretend to be something he wasn’t around Jedi to seem like he fit in like the rest.Obi-wan and Anakin had a rocky relationship. They genuinely loved each other, but raising Anakin as a Padawan was difficult for Obi-wan. Obi-wan was too harsh, and Anakin rebelled too much. Their relationship didn’t truly blossom until Anakin was faced with the responsibility of a Jedi Knight, and when they were equals, they really fit together very well. Palpatine kept an open door policy for Anakin, making time in his own schedule for whenever Anakin needed him. Their relationship was like a father and son, on top of being good friend, and Palpatine allowed a safe environment where Anakin could speak about what was bothering him without judgement, unlike the Jedi. Palpatine used these conversations to weaponize Anakin’s thoughts over many many years, and undermine and demonize the Jedi in subtle ways. Fear of losing Padme was the final straw. Padme was Anakin’s anchor. They would talk to each other via holocomm whenever they had the chance, go on secret dates, talk about the war. Padme became an important part of Anakin’s mental health, and the thought of losing her was unbearable. So when Palpatine finally revealed himself, saying he could save Padme, there was a true conflict. Do I choose the Jedi, or Padme? In the end it was desperation that drove Anakin to the Darkside. It wasn’t an easy transition to the Darkside, it was a move of desperation. As he said, “I can’t live without her.” Palpatine held Anakin in the palms of his hands, and Anakin would dance to any tune Palpatine told him to because Anakin was afraid, and he was desperate."},{"prompt":"What is a proxy, and how can I use one?","completion":"An proxy is an intermediate server between two devices on a network.

How on earth did Tesla manage to pull this off, while other companies including Google have been trying to do it for years?","completion":"It’s not actually “Google” anymore - it’s “Waymo”. The parent company “Alphabet” split the self-driving car stuff from the Internet business - and the self-driving car group are called “Waymo”. WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TESLA & WAYMO? Waymo have converted existing cars to “self drive” as urban taxi cabs. They rely heavily on three things: Having a VERY high resolution map of the entire driving area, frequently updated to account for things like roadworks, potholes, changes in signage, etc, etc.Limiting the cars to only drive in a very small area (a few square miles) that can be adequately mapped.Not driving over about 45mph. The cars rely on “LIDAR” to understand the world around them - which makes it difficult to see things like roadsigns and road markings - which is why it needs such accurate maps. Tesla build their own cars - they (ironically) use very low resolution Google maps for turn-by-turn instructions - but use eight color/low-light-level cameras to get a 360 degree view of the street. This enables them to drive anywhere - even where there is no map. HOW DID TESLA PULL IT OFF? Waymo is an AI company with interests in cars. So they purchased a few hundred cars and (at some cost) converted them to add powerful AI computers and sensor systems. Then they recruited a bunch of human drivers to drive them around to collect the all-important “driving data” needed to train their AI software.Tesla is a car company with interests in AI. So they built their own cars, with AI computers and sensors built in during production - then they sold the cars for a profit and the people who bought them collected training data for free! As a result: Waymo’s collected driving data is limited to maybe 100 million miles of driving data - mostly restricted to a handful of downtown areas where they operate their taxi services…and collected from a small pool of human drivers over maybe a decade. Doing this is extremely costly.Tesla’s collected driving data comes from about 2 million cars that they have on the roads of the entire world - being driven by ordinary people doing their ordinary driving. With an average driver covering 1.200 miles per month - Tesla are able to collect 2.4 BILLION miles of driving data every month. Not only is this NOT costly - it’s actually profit-making. It’s actually even worse than that - a Waymo car has huge and horrible modifications - so it looks like this: And nobody is going to want to buy a car like that - so their training data isn’t representative of what would ACTUALLY be available to a practical self-driving car. But Tesla’s AI is learning to drive cars that aren’t just similar to the ones that will be practical self-driving cars - it’s learning on the EXACT cars it’ll be drivingL Do you see that tiny black triangle just above and behind the front wheel? That’s a Tesla camera. If you look carefully, you can see a small circle on the top of the “B-pillar” behind the side windows? that’s another camera. There are more looking out through the top of the windshield and a couple more innocuous ones around the back of the car. There are eight of them in all. The ultrasound sensors on the bottom edge of the bodywork are too small to see in this photo. They are small circular features - identical to the ‘backup sensors’ that most modern cars have on the back bumper. THE IMPORTANCE OF REAL WORLD DATA: Suppose you consider driving on a country road in a part of the world where there are wild deer…a large percentage of the USA is like that. How can you train a car to handle a deer “encounter”. Well, if you’re Waymo - you can’t because there aren’t any deer in any of the downtown areas where their cars operate…but suppose they did send out a few hundred drivers to drive country roads for 40 hours a week? At 60 mph - they’d get maybe 100,000 miles per week. Within a year - they’d have a about two lifetimes of practical human driving. Now - how many deer encounters does that represent? I don’t know about you - but I’ve had only a couple of serious deer encounters in my 50 years of driving - so for all of that expense, so even if they concentrated all of their efforts on driving in deer-laden countryside - I doubt Waymo would collect more than a few dozen encounters. But Tesla get about 2.4 billion miles of driving per month - 25 billion miles per year. That’s about 50,000 human lifespans of driving per year…and tens of thousands of deer encounters. Why do you need so many video’s of deer running across the road? Well, you need it happening at high speeds and low speeds, daytime, dawn, dusk and night. Deer probably behave differently in the rutting season or when the momma deer are protecting their foals - then weather probably matters - maybe deer cross more in snow than in rain? Does it matter whether you are the only car on the road or the traffic is denser? Does a lone deer behave differently from an entire herd? Do males and females behave differently? Young and old deer? Who knows? So 2 speeds x 4 times of day x 4 seasons x 5 different weather types x 5 different traffic densities x 3 different group sizes x 2 genders x 3 age ranges… that’s 14,400 different possible things that could affect how a deer crosses the road (or not). So if you AI sees a deer - how does it learn how the animal will behave? It has to learn by seeing many, MANY deer encounters. Tesla can collect 14,000 deer encounters in a matter of months. Waymo could keep trying for 100 years and still not have enough data. Waymo claim that they make up this difference using simulation data. So they pay a bunch of guys like me (I work in simulation) to make computer graphics of all sorts of realistic deer models doing various things. But the trouble is - simulation engineers have no clue what’s going on in the brains of deer…so we correctly simulate the characteristic ear twitch (or whatever it is) that predicts a deer is going to run out in front of you? No! We do not. So simulation data isn’t going to work. But hundreds of thousands of deer encounter videos should be enough to allow the AI to learn what factors make it safe to drive past a deer - and what requires hard braking or lane changing or whatever. Hence, Tesla can train their cars to handle deer better than any human driver - to become a deer behavior specialist of world calibre. DO THEY ACTUALLY DO THIS? It seems so - in one interview I watched, one of their AI guys said that their cars have been learning to recognize dogs (and they do - you can see a cute doggy graphic pop up on the display when you drive past one). Their AI has learned to recognize dogs that are on a leash, under control of a human from stray dogs that are just wandering around. It knows to take more care around an uncontrolled dog than is necessary if it’s on a leash. This is just like the deer problem. The AI has to become fairly good at predicting what crazy thing some dumb old dog will do…and it has. CONCLUSION: Many people claim that Tesla are 10 years ahead of the competition…and that, in my opinion, is a vast under-estimate. Since no other company has even STARTED to collect driving data from every single car they sell - they cannot possibly have enough driving data to compete in the AI realm. Since Tesla have been doing this for 10 years now - they must, therefore, be 10 years ahead."},{"prompt":"w do you imagine life in 100 years?","completion":"Like the Garden of Eden with only spiritual people. 🤔💗😇"},{"prompt":"Could Superman literally knock out a human heavyweight boxer with one flick from his finger?","completion":"This a trap, right?

But [LINKED_TEXT: facial recognition] [URL: https://shuftipro.com/blog/facial-recognition-technology-behind-the-curtains/#Facial-Recognition-Technology-and-How-Does-It-Work] is much better - it scans multiple characteristics at the same time, filtering out the identity thieves quickly and easily. Iris scanning examines the uniqueness of your eyes, liveness detection feature captures unique movements and gestures, and 3D depth perception can figure out the contours and edges of your face. Besides, every single user has around 100 passwords and they’re usually hard to remember. So, instead of going through the ‘forgot password?’ process it’s much easier and faster to use your face or fingerprints. Thanks for asking!"},{"prompt":"Are there any disadvantages in using robots?","completion":"Sure…but it’s complicated. Let’s imagine that someone invents a robot that can replace humans in a fast-food restaurant…and I’m going to pick one of the most well-known robot - Boston Dynamics’ “Spot”… This little robot is about the size of a large dog - and costs 75,000 - I suspect that’s WITHOUT the robot arm on the top - which is an optional extra. You’ll also need to program it to do the actual job. So I’m going to say that MAYBE 100,000 would suffice…certainly it’s not going to be much cheaper than that. According to Zippia - a human fast food worker gets paid an average of 11 per hour. i’m going to round that down to 10 to keep the math simple. So you could employ a human for 10,000 hours for the price of our robotic worker. An average worker does about 2,000 hours work per year - so the robot will pay for itself in 5 years…assuming it doesn’t need too much maintenance and doesn’t wear out in that time. For a large fast-food company - that might not be a terrible deal. You need thousands of these robots - so you can afford to invest a lot of money in customizing the software - you can design new equipment specially for the robot to use, etc, etc. But for a “Mom & Pop” diner - this is impossible. Investing 100,000 in ANYTHING is incredibly difficult - and a pay-back time of 5 years until it starts being cheaper than hiring a person is way too long. But worse still - the robot has to somehow be taught every subtle nuance of the job. If the customer says “Hold the lettuce” - then maybe the bot can cope with that. But “Can I have hot-sauce instead of mayo on the chicken and no pickles on the burger?”…that’s going to be tough for the robot to deal with. At Tesla’s investor day recently - it was estimated that Tesla’s new humanoid robot could cost 20,000 - and that’s getting down into the realms of the possible. With a payback time of just ONE year - it starts to look more feasible. If enough small fast food places would see that as attractive - then maybe a larger company will design software for that specific market and amortize the cost over MANY small businesses. So the key here is the cost of these devices - if someone could make a robot that could do the job for 10,000 then a six month payback time would be compelling to nearly every restaurant. No doubt robots lack the flexibility of humans - if a customer spills an entire cup of soda onto the floor - a human can grab a mop and bucket and without any training - deal with it. Adding that sophistication to a robot would be VERY tough. However, with that human flexibility comes fallibility. Humans get sick and don’t turn up for work. If that’s the guy with the keys to the restaurant - then your business doesn’t open on time. If someone quits mid-shift then chaos ensues and lots of customers get pissed at you. Robots are reliable…they have limited skills - but they perform them well every time. CONCLUSION: Sure - there are situations where robots are an incredibly valuable thing for a business - but mostly in LARGE businesses. For small operations, one or two human employees are zero investment - and can ensure much better reliability."},{"prompt":"Which was the more crucially important or decisive battle in WWII, the Battle of Kursk or the Battle of Stalingrad? Why & how compared in importance?","completion":"An important point that most arm chair strategists ignore, but gaining control of the air involves thousands of individual combat missions and both output and quality of aircraft so its understandable that the war is simplified for the ignorant. Stalingrad was symbolic and with losses of 250,000 and a whole Army group devastating for morale. Kursk was on an altogether greater scale and Soviet losses were overall greater than those of the Wehrmacht but stopping this huge German offensive was every bit as important for Soviet morale as Stalingrad and marked IMHO the beginning of the end.

The latest GDP reports account for the most sluggish growth in a quarter in the past six years. Indians anticipated the pockets to deepen and their economy to bloom and not see a slowdown when they seated Narendra Modi, for the second time, into the office of the Prime Minister. Banking Sector exemplifies the effects of the slowdown The increased demand for credit lured banks to increase interest rates which in turn enlarged the number of bad loans. Due to this surge in defaulters of credit, banks were left with no choice but to tighten-up their line of credit, which is a prominent reason that credit isn’t available easily in the market today.

It was harsh, shouty, rapid music made by four or five angry seventeen-year old amateur musicians. It produced a few classics (e.g. Teenage Kicks, Anarchy in the UK) but it tended to be quite generic. I personally got tired of listening to rants by lippy teens as I gradually ceased to be a lippy teen myself. Punk also expressed a particular moment of generational angst at the dawn of the neoliberal paradigm. It doesn’t neccessarily speak to later generations of teens. Disco, its arch-enemy, has aged much better. In addition, those who stayed in the music game quickly grew bored with the tight constraints of the original amateur genre and often produced better music as a result. The best Clash and Fall albums are Sandanista (1980) and I Am Kurious Oranj (1988) respectively.

[LINKED_TEXT: Mythbusting 101: Organic Farming > Conventional AgriculturePeople believe a lot of things that we have little to no evidence for, like that vikings wore horned helmets or that you can see the Great Wall of China from space. One of the things I like to do on my blogs is bust commonly held myths that I think matter. For example, I get really annoyed when I hear someone say sharks don't get cancer (I'll save that rant for another day). From now onward, posts that attack conventionally believed untruths will fall under a series I'm going to call \\"Mythbusting 101.\\" Ten years ago, Certified Organic didn't exist in the United States. Yet in 2010, a mere eight years after USDA's regulations officially went into effect, organic foods and beverages made 26.7 billion. In the past year or two, certified organic sales have jumped to about 52 billion worldwide despite the fact that organic foods cost up to three times as much as those produced by conventional methods. More and more, people are shelling out their hard-earned cash for what they believe are the best foods available. Imagine, people say: you can improve your nutrition while helping save the planet from the evils of conventional agriculture - a complete win-win . And who wouldn't buy organic, when it just sounds so good? Here's the thing: there are a lot of myths out there about organic foods, and a lot of propaganda supporting methods that are rarely understood. It's like your mother used to say: just because everyone is jumping off a bridge doesn't mean you should do it, too. Now, before I get yelled at too much, let me state unequivocally that I'm not saying organic farming is bad - far from it . There are some definite upsides and benefits that come from many organic farming methods. For example, the efforts of organic farmers to move away from monocultures, where crops are farmed in single-species plots, are fantastic; crop rotations and mixed planting are much better for the soil and environment. My goal in this post isn't to bash organic farms, instead, it's to bust the worst of the myths that surround them so that everyone can judge organic farming based on facts. In particular, there are four myths thrown around like they're real that just drive me crazy. Myth #1: Organic Farms Don't Use Pesticides When the Soil Association, a major organic accreditation body in the UK, asked consumers why they buy organic food, 95% of them said their top reason was to avoid pesticides . They, like many people, believe that organic farming involves little to no pesticide use. I hate to burst the bubble, but that's simply not true. Organic farming, just like other forms of agriculture, still uses pesticides and fungicides to prevent critters from destroying their crops. Confused?

[LINKED_TEXT: Introducing the New 'New Warriors'] [URL: https://www.marvel.com/amp/articles/comics/introducing-the-new-new-warriors] I’m just going to say it: this is a horrible idea. Let’s just start with the obvious; this is probably going to offend the exact people they are trying to ‘represent’. The same twins who say this about themselves… “All twins are psychic, but we’re psychic-er.”… also say that their names are… “a post-ironic meditation on using violence to combat bullying.” I have never, in my life, met any teenager who used the words, “post-ironic meditation”. And as an identical twin, I want to say to Daniel, “You’re a moron. All twins aren’t psychic.” Right off the bat, I think the whole team is an exercise in “missing the point”. What this seems to be is the writer, Daniel Kibblesmith’s, tongue-in-cheek retort towards critics of the comics industry over the last 7 years or so… and NOT any form of real, authentic character creation. In short, it’s basically as if Daniel said, “So you want to accuse of us at Marvel Comics of being Social Justice Warriors? FINE! The New “New Warriors” are going to be the EMBODIMENT of Social Justice! Any ethnicity but white? Check! LGTBQ+ representation? CHECK! Obese character included to guard against accusations of fat-shaming? CHECK! Non-binary gender pronouns? CHECK! Dude who wears pink to fight gender stereotypes? CHECK! This is a terrible way to write a characters, let alone comics. The main underpinning I issue I see with these characters is that they are VERY gimmicky and one-note. It’s like making a “black” character… here’s Avery Brooks on the subject: Each of these characters is made with a similar gimmick in mind: let’s use a name based off of words that are thrown around the internet right now! Heck, let’s make one guy have superpowers that are basically just a SUPER POWERED version of GOOGLE! We’re geniuses!!! Seriously, one of these characters has the mighty power of having a magical backpack. Yes, you read that right: her super power to triumph over evil is a backpack that she can pull items out of… but will it be the item she actually wants?! You might think I’m being sarcastic, but that’s actually how the writers described her. “A regular kid scooped up into the world of teenage Super Heroing. Her “magic backpack” is actually a pocket dimension with seemingly infinite space, from which she can pull out useful or random objects—it’s not always under her control. She claims to get her power from god, but “not the god you’re thinking of.” So who does this remind me of? It reminds me of this: Anyone else remember when Maggot, Marrow, and Dr. Cecilia Reyes became X-Men? No one else does either. They weren’t good characters. Marrow and Reyes are still around, but nothing I’d call featured. They’re the lucky ones. Maggot is just a background extra if he’s seen at all. Marrow had some potential since she had been a morlock and had some history with the X-Men. But she wasn’t exactly the next “Wolverine” like they were trying to make her out to be. In fact, the next ‘Wolverine’ clone that actually DID work for the book was Laura Kinney… an actual clone of Wolverine. Irony. Anyway, this new run of New Warriors feels an awful lot like that. With these New Warriors, I don’t think the audience that Marvel Comics writer’s think will be out there waiting for them will actually be there. Just because someone gets offended by being called a ‘snowflake’ doesn’t mean they will automatically pick up a comic and be a fan of a character post-ironically-meditated-and-named to be made their ‘hero’. It’s really tough to write new characters and have them be good. Right now this book feels more like a writer’s commentary… or rebuttal… about how they’ve been critiqued in the industry for the last few years."},{"prompt":"forgot my Apple ID password how can I reset it?","completion":"If you have forgotten your Apple ID or password, you can follow these steps to recover them: 1.

This is based on a french expression, literally “sitting between two chairs”. Whilst it is true that the QPP is ‘the end of the world’ and we know it, there is not a lot you can do about it. Quora needs to attract new readership, and therefore advertising revenue, as it is not free. There are not enough donations, and therefore the ship is wallowing in a medium to rough sea with little freebord to avoid the waves lapping over the side. The better equipped writers are leaving in quite high Numbers I would estimate, and as such although the boat is getting lighter, it is being left with a crew of lesser capabilities. Proof of the argument is the way that “us” the mediocre writers are getting more readership, and specifically of older content. There is no point in dreaming, Caulfield is a mediocre writer, non conformist and a bit off beat. If I’m getting less answers to read from the top writers, it means there are less and less, oh alright, fewer, top writers still writing. Quora is in the grips of the gravitational well of an “end stage capitalism” black hole, obliged to surf round the edge, all the time being pulled inexorably in. You can’t shut down the QPP, and you can’t let it continue, both will undermine the Financial stability of the site. What a dilemma. Now we understand Dr. Hans Reinhardt’s plight as the USS Cygnus could only move through the black hole, but not retreat from it, risking destruction. Instead he was forced to use massive amounts of power to maintain the ship on the edge. Another poor quality Caulfield parralel. I’m surprised anyone reads my stuff. Can you take the Quora through the black hole and thus save it? Quora needs cash to make it run, this cash comes from advertising and donations? in order to satisfy the advertising you need readership. The notion of payed membership wouldn’t work, neither would Facebook style advertising, it would kill Quora even faster. I honestly cannot see what you can do to pull the metaphorical bunny out of the hat this time. Whilst QPP was a good effort, it was also fundamentally flawed from the start. Let’s face it, it is pretty awful. (If I answer even one question from a QP, I get my feed flooded with a hundred similar questions.) We need some new algorythmns. Quora seems to have backed itself into a bit of a corner with this one. How about floating it and selling shares? If we have to stay in the capitalist expansion model (and we do) then some extra cash is going to have to come from somewhere. Honestly I have no idea how to improve the situation. This is why I’m not a top writer, they “think” differently, which is why they are the top writers. Have you thought about asking them for their opinions? So anyway, sorry about the informal “chatty” tone to my musings, but this is one of the nice things about Quora, I can informally chat with some high level people, which I like, it makes me feel a little bit more human. Getting an upvote from a higher level writer is a bit of Christmass present sometimes, I came on here to test my knowledge by writing, and learn new stuff. Both of which I am achieving reasonably well, but I’m not sure how long I can personally go on with the chewing gum questions flooding the feed. I would like the QPP questions to be flagged as such, so that I can avoid most of them. I sometimes reply to a QPP question even so, as some of them are Worth writing to, but the rest are just rubbish. The ship is kind of wallowing towards the rocks, slowly but surely and we need to lighten the load before hitting the rocks. I would not say that the QPP should be dismantled, but I would suggest that it is seriously modified. The money would be better spent inviting guest writers, or “celebrities” to write for Quora, people love reading stuff from “celebrities” it makes them feel important, especially if they think the writing is addressed to them. Look at history, a person that can carry the crowd with a speach is quickly a leader of men, in this case people coming to the Quora servers, which earns you and advertising click, to read stuff. Quora needs more exposure, but when people come looking, they Don't want to see fifty versions of the same question;- Do you like blue chewing gum Do you like red chewing gum You get my point, that was only two examples. The QPP is flooding Quora and making it visually unnatractive to new readers who come in to see Something picked up from the outside, but are quickly revolted by the insidious crap in the feed. They go away thinking “ah, my mistake”. Perhaps choosable feeds, whereby the QPP is on a page all of its own, this works for other sites. Anyway, I’m watching closely to see what happens next, I’ve got my tub of popcorn and sitting on the edge of my chair. Good luck with your fundamental dychotomy, you’ll need it. Thanks for listening.

A lot! If Bismarck managed to get within sight of a convoy otherwise undetected, havoc would ensue. With her speed of up to 30 knots, she could travel from the horizon to the middle of the convoy in a remarkably short space of time, whilst any ship she could see would be in range of her 15 inch guns. ‘Fast’ Atlantic convoys usually ran at about 10 knots, ‘Slow’ at more like 6 knots: for between 30–70 merchant vessels, there could be as few as four or as many as 10 escorts. The main job of the escorts was to protect against submarines: a mixture of destroyers, frigates, sloops and corvettes in some cases not much faster than the merchant ships. When surface ship aggression was anticipated, convoys were sometimes further escorted by older battleships with some further attendant destroyers: whilst these ships had big enough main guns to damage or sink a ‘Bismarck’, they were not fast enough to chase one and they played more of a deterrent role. But Bismarck was never intended to operate alone. For example on Operation Rhine (Rhineubung), she sailed in company with the heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen and as many U-boats as possible were also at sea in the Atlantic. Similarly, Scharnhorst and Gneisenau sortied together on commerce raids. It was considered (by both sides) relatively unlikely that Bismarck would encounter a whole convoy without warning, and the standard procedure was to scatter the convoy as soon as such contact became inevitable. Scattering would reduce Bismarck’s opportunity to sink as many ships, but the U-boats should then be able to find relatively easy pickings amongst the scattered and unescorted merchants. The best example of such an event involved Bismarck’s sister, Tirpitz and an Arctic convoy. PQ17 was a convoy from Iceland to Russia, sailing in the summer of 1942. Pre-warned by radio intelligence of a likely surface ship raid on the convoy, the Admiralty was suitably alarmed when they found that Tirpitz had left her moorings in a fjord in northern Norway and assumed that she was heading for the convoy: she was actually moving anchorages to meet up with other ships prior to a sortie. Despite the presence of a powerful covering force including two battleships, and despite the convoy having a relatively large close escort group, the Admiralty ordered the convoy to scatter and that’s when the problems started…. There are several excellent books on the story of Convoy PQ17. In brief, the unescorted merchant ships became easy prey for hunting U-boats and for Luftwaffe torpedo bombers based in Norway. Of the 35 merchant ships in the original convoy, only 11 made it to a Russian port. It was a major success for the Kriegsmarine and the Luftwaffe and an enormous embarrassment for the Royal Navy. It caused severe problems for the British with both the Russians and the Americans."},{"prompt":"What did you think of Donald Trump before he became President?","completion":"He was a failed, sleepy scumbag then too."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?","completion":"AngularJS is an open-source framework for front-end web development. Originally, the rewrite of AngularJS was called \\"Angular 2\\", but this led to confusion among developers. To avoid confusion among developers Angular without the \\"JS\\" is commonly referring to Angular 2 version and above. Both frameworks are based on Typescript, a superset of JavaScript. In my opinion, critical differences lie in the development process. Let's check the main differences between Angular and AngularJS. 1. Language Both frameworks use JavaScript, but Angular 2 also uses Typescript on top. AngularJS uses JavaScript; it is dynamically typed and rendered in the browser. 2.Code generator To start working with Angular, you need to create a file structure, set up templates, deploy and test processes, and make other customizations. Angular.js was quite an opinionated framework. The project codebase must conform to predefined modules. 3.Components vs. Controllers AngularJS has controller components that contain the business logic of an element. Developers can use them to determine the state of a feature and customize an interactive response. Angular 2 doesn't have controllers. 4.Two-way binding AngularJS has been loved by many teams for its two-way binding capability because the codebase is updated in two ways. Angular 2 has changed the binding logic. 5.Form validation Although Angular usually uses Typescript, the validation form doesn't differ from AngularJS. 6.Speed AngularJS and Angular are pretty fast.

There is a special category of movie characters who are actually completely incompetent, but no one notices this because they are cool and badass. An example of this is Vincent Vega in Pulp Fiction- he epically screws up literally everything he tries to do in the movie, but people don’t notice because he’s ‘cool’. Amanda Waller is that trope turned up to 100. We assume she is competent because she is presented as competent, but she’s absolutely not, almost everything she does backfires spectacularly. Amanda Waller and her ‘Suicide Squad’ project should not exist, they are demonstrably terrible at what they do. So, the whole premise of the Suicide Squad is that Amanda Waller pulls together a team of expendable Supervillians that will work for the U.S. government ‘off the books’, taking on metahuman threats. Quite how a guy who likes boomerangs or an unhinged girl with a baseball bat is going to be helpful if Superman goes rogue is never really covered. In return for this, the villains get time knocked off their sentence. This goes wrong almost immediately. In the first movie, one of Wallers most powerful villains, Enchantress, goes rogue and destroys Midway city, turning its inhabitants into monsters. The other villains then team up to destroy Enchantress, and duly receive 10 years off their sentence. In the second movie, the Squad is dispatched with the express job of destroying any evidence of US involvement in the capture and weaponisation of a giant space starfish known as Starro The Squad eventually recover the evidence, but instead of destroying it they disobey a direct order to leave the site and instead engage in a highly public and televised battle with Starro, then they use the evidence to blackmail Waller into releasing them all for good. So, just to recap, Wallers Suicide Squad project has so far succeeded in achieving the following: A major city is destroyed and many thousands of Americans died needlessly as a result of Waller losing control of her most powerful asset.In exchange for just barely managing to clear up Wallers mess, the US government is obligated to take 10 years off the sentences of a group of mass murderers.Waller is supposed to be meticulous in ensuring none of the villains can escape, however the child murdering monster known as ‘Weasel’ just plays dead for most of the movie and then escapes into the forest, apparently undetected.This is a highly politically sensitive project - how do you think the families of Harley or Crocs victims feel about the idea that they are now doing dirty work for the government in exchange for decades off their sentences? This has to be EXTREMELY quiet - however in the second film Bloodsports team battle with Starro is international news. Expect some extremely angry letters to congressmen once people figure out that the guy who killed their kid is now running free because of Wallers incompetence.The entire point of sending Bloodsports team in was to ensure that the incriminating evidence could not be used against the US. Bloodsport immediately uses the information against the US to secure the teams freedom and uploads it to an unknown server. This is actually a worse result for the US than it was before, at least originally they knew where the evidence was, and now there’s a bunch more supervillains running free. And even after this, the end credits scene of the second film implies that Wallers Suicide Squad project is not only still active, but they have been tasked with even more important mission objectives (saving the damn world). What the hell kind of operation is this? Who is approving funding for this? These guys literally create far more problems than they solve, they are patently uncontrollable and Waller is not even close to competent enough to manage them."},{"prompt":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","completion":"Diabacure Ayurvedic Pills for Blood Sugar Control is Ayurvedic Medicine & This is Best for product to control Blood Sugar [LINKED_TEXT: www.omniayurveda.com] [URL: http://www.omniayurveda.com/]"},{"prompt":"Whats the #1 thing you always pray for?","completion":"Once Richard Branson rested on the British Virgin Islands.

It is an holistic approach to health that focuses on the body, mind, and spirit. Ayurveda is known as an effective form of treatment for a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Diabetes is a chronic metabolic disorder that is characterized by high blood sugar levels. It is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and certain medications. Diabetes can lead to serious health complications if left untreated, such as heart disease, stroke, and kidney failure. Ayurveda aims to restore balance and harmony to the body, which is essential for proper functioning of the body’s systems. Ayurvedic treatment for diabetes involves a combination of lifestyle changes, herbal remedies, and dietary modifications. One of the most commonly prescribed ayurvedic remedies for diabetes is the use of herbal medicines. These are natural substances that are used to treat the symptoms and root causes of diabetes. The most common herbs used for diabetes management are: • Bitter gourd (Momordica charantia): This herb has been used for centuries to help lower blood sugar levels. It is believed to stimulate the pancreas to produce more insulin, which helps the body to regulate sugar levels. • Gymnema sylvestre: This herb is known to help reduce sugar cravings and decrease cholesterol levels. It is also believed to help improve the production of insulin. • Turmeric (Curcuma longa): This herb has anti-inflammatory properties and is believed to help reduce blood sugar levels. • Fenugreek (Trigonella foenum-graecum): Fenugreek is believed to help improve insulin sensitivity, which can help with blood sugar control. • Amalaki (Emblica officinalis): This ayurvedic herb is known to help reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. In addition to herbal remedies, ayurveda recommends lifestyle modifications and dietary changes for diabetes management. These include: • Limiting carbohydrate intake: Eating a low-carbohydrate diet can help to control blood sugar levels. • Increasing physical activity: Regular exercise can help to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications. • Avoiding processed and fried foods: Eating a diet that is high in fresh fruits and vegetables can help to improve overall health. • Limiting sugar intake: Eating too much sugar can cause blood sugar levels to spike. • Practicing yoga and meditation: These activities can help to reduce stress and improve overall health. Ayurveda is an ancient form of traditional medicine that has been used for centuries to treat a variety of medical conditions, including diabetes. Ayurvedic treatment focuses on restoring balance and harmony to the body through lifestyle modifications, herbal remedies, and dietary changes. While there is no cure for diabetes, ayurvedic herbs and lifestyle changes can be used to help manage the condition and reduce the risk of diabetes-related complications.

Has this tactic ever been used in war?","completion":"In WWII the Japanese were infamous surrendering while concealing weapons and explosives with which to maim and kill as many allied young men as they could in violation of international law. People who do not respect their own lives are certainly not going to respect anyone else’s. Actually this is not so surprising when you consider the million rapes, forcing a million more in prostitution (“Comfort Girls”) for their troops, and using a million more men and women for bayonet practice and other training purposes. . Unit 731, a Japanese biological and chemical warfare research and development unit of the Imperial Army carried out secret human experiments using torture and mass murder by chemical and biological means. They also did experiments to determine the surviveability of young woman used for military forced prostitution, and how many of their soldiers could rape a single young girl before she died. All told this unit most cruelly murdered more than 200,000 civilians and the total of civilians raped, tortured and murdered by the Japanese Imperial Army in violation of international law is in the millions. When Japan as a country admits and accepts responsibility for such horrific crimes I, for one, will accept their apology, but only if they stop crying about Hiroshima and Nagasaki where we dropped atomic bombs of an armed, trained, and ruthlessly determined citizenry willing to kill millions hand to hand or with their own nuclear weapons, the designs and materials for the Germans were supplying them with to use on the allies. This is the oldest BS in the world, making yourself a victim, then any horrible, disgusting act is forgivable. We’re seeing lot of the in the US nowadays.

The situation got so baroque, that for each known particle one must not only posit a new, unobserved particle (squark, slepton, sgluino etc…..) but also at least 105 extra undetermined parameters that were not in the standard model, plus an entire extra “hidden” theory with its own set of particles, where the particles of the third theory are subject to both the known forces and hidden forces…… bizarre also the line of reasoning: in string theory the non-observability of these super-particles becomes an argument for their existence. The tolerance for incompatibility with reality has long passed the baroque and bizarre and resides now in the positively insane range of 10^53–10^103. Gerard d’Hooft, Nobel Prize in Physics 1999: “Actually, I would not even be prepared to call string theory a ‘theory’ rather a ‘model’ or not even that: just a hunch. After all, a theory should come together with instructions on how to deal with it to identify the things one wishes to describe, in our case the elementary particles, and one should, at least in principle, be able to formulate the rules for calculating the properties of these particles, and how to make new predictions for them. Imagine that I give you a chair, while explaining that the legs are still missing, and that the seat, back and armrest will perhaps be delivered soon; whatever I did give you, can I still call it a chair?” Sheldon Glashow, Nobel Prize in Physics 1979: “But superstring physicists have not yet shown that their theory really works. They cannot demonstrate that the standard theory is a logical outcome of string theory. They cannot even be sure that their formalism includes a description of such things as protons and electrons. And they have not yet made even one teeny-tiny experimental prediction. Worst of all, superstring theory does not follow as a logical consequence of some appealing set of hypotheses about nature. Why, you may ask, do the string theorists insist that space is nine dimensional? Simply because string theory doesn’t make sense in any other kind of space. . . . Until the string people can interpret perceived properties of the real world they simply are not doing physics. Should they be paid by universities and be permitted to pervert impressionable students? Will young Ph.D.s, whose expertise is limited to superstring theory, be employable if, and when, the string snaps? Are string thoughts more appropriate to departments of mathematics, or even to schools of divinity, than to physics departments? Richard Feynman, Nobel Prize in Physics 1965: “I think all this superstring stuff is crazy and is in the wrong direction. ……. I don’t like that they’re not calculating anything. I don’t like that they don’t check their ideas. I don’t like that for anything that disagrees with an experiment, they cook up an explanation – a fix-up to say “Well, it still might be true…” and: “String theorists don’t make predictions, they make excuses.” Howard Georgi, who worked on Grand Unification Theories: “I think that group theory, perhaps because it seems to give information for free, has been more misused in contemporary particle physics than any other branch of mathematics, except geometry. Students should learn the difference between physics and mathematics from the start.” and: ”Group theory is a useful technique, but it is no substitute for physics.” With this last statement Georgi hits at the core of the crisis in physics which endures ever since Newton exclaimed in feigned modesty “…. not to feign hypotheses”. Newton: “…..That gravity should be innate, inherent and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at-a-distance, through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else by and through which their action may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I believe no man, who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking, can ever fall into it. So far I have explained the phenomena by the force of gravity, but I have not yet ascertained the cause of gravity itself. ... and I do not arbitrarily invent hypotheses.” (1693) So, Newton hated Leibniz - for many reasons, but also because Leibniz had a hypothesis in place - he hated gravity for acting the way it did - for it undermined Huygens’ wave theory which was essential to his own theory of light and color - and he hated not to be first and/or best: it was the polymath Robert Hooke who pointed Newton towards looking into the centripetal character of gravity, and also suggested an inverse square relation. So, Newton, ever the astute mathematician, grabbed the powerful inverse square law, and then abused his position as president of the Royal Society not only to demolish Leibniz (with his “Commercium epistolicum”), but deal a blow so devastating to any attempt of hypothesizing about gravity, that 300 years later “…there [still] is no model of the theory of gravitation today, other than the mathematical form.” (Feynman) Newton admittedly had no idea what gravity was, and had no intention of trying to find out either, but he claimed a universal validity for his “law”. Inflated domains of validity are always bad science but only too common throughout history: what gave Galileo the right to claim a universal invariance of physical laws to motion? what right did Newton have to claim universality for his gravitational constant? Galileo had no business speculating beyond the 8kts his ships were doing, Newton had no concept of the universe beyond our solar system. What right did Lord Kelvin have to use the word “universal” in the title \\"On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy\\"? Today we know that the universe at large is not organized after gravitational principles, and that there is also no evidence whatsoever that the universe at large is slowing down, losing “steam” so to say. String theory therefore is not only a multidimensional fantasy, it is also an attempt of fitting a suit to an unknown body: without a theory of gravity in place, how can you try to find a mathematical description of such? We don't even know wether we should see gravity as pull or push! If it is pull, it is a tension, if it is push, it is pressure: Newton himself favored the latter view: “[Gravity is the result of] “a condensation causing a flow of ether with a corresponding thinning of the ether density associated with the increased velocity of flow.” as did his friend deDullier, later leSage, Lord Kelvin and Hendrik Lorentz, while Maxwell and Poincare thought otherwise. But nobody actually developed a testable theory of gravity and before that is done, all mathematics is empty handwaving. String Theory’s quest to unify QM and Relativity with what would be called Quantum Gravity is a dead born idea according to Heisenberg: “…that even major modifications of present physical theories would not transform them into the desired new theory, as quite different and novel ideas are required. Secondly, the impact of quantum theory and relativity theory on the minds of those scholars who helped found them during the first half of our century is conceivably such that they are imprisoned by these theories and thus cannot help but reason conformably, that is, in terms of traditional concepts; whereas the need is for a whole revolution of thought, which can only be carried through by nonconformists.... “"},{"prompt":"Why are Siberian Huskies abandoned in large quantities?","completion":"I’m speaking from experience here; because they are a nightmare.

It may be either buying first or short selling. Normally intraday traders book profit in small margins. People are making profit by repeated trades or by trading large quantities. One thing to be mentioned here is intraday trading is high risk involved. The Golden rule of intraday trade is ride with the trend. Hence the first step to make profit in intraday trade is to identify the stock. Intraday charts are the best way to identify stocks for trading intraday. Also one should make a good home work before entering in intraday trade. Home work means, study the historical charts and find out the upward or downward moving stocks. Then see the previous days intraday chart. Find out the support and resistance levels. The better strategy will be buy at previous days support level and short at previous days resistance levels. Also shorting below support level and buying above resistance level are good ideas. Keeping stop loss is very important for intraday trade. Otherwise one will loose heavily. Where to keep stop loss is a very important question. Again previous days intraday charts will help. If one shorted in a stock, keep stop loss at previous days high or days high. Also if bought, keep stop loss at previous days lows, or days lows. Another thing to remember is keep trailing stop loss and revise stop loss when one is in profit. Instead of booking profit, one can keep stop loss for profit and can revise according to upward movement. Normally this will help a lot in intraday trade. The two things to avoid in stock market and particularly in intraday trade is panic and greedy. When one enters in a trade and goes in opposite direction, don’t be panic. Wait some time, keep strict stop loss. If stop loss triggers, don’t enter again. Wait some time and relax, watch the market trend and enter in some other stocks. Another thing to avoid is greediness. Some people will not book profit and wait for more and more profit. But such people will end up in loss only. In intraday trade book profit in every highs. Wait for a dip and enter again if trend sustains. The best time to enter for intraday trade is after 20 to 30 minutes when the market opens. Some people will jump in the market at the opening bell itself. It is risky always. Watch the market in the early trades and find out the trend. First enter in some small quantity, say 25% of the quantity one is intended to buy. Then buy more in the next 10 to 15 minutes. The trend observed is intraday trading is stocks will shoot up till after 45 to 1 hour when the market opens. This is the best time to book profit. Once booked profit in a particular stock, better wait some time and watch the next movement and enter accordingly.

Maybe Safespace can use convoluted logic to argue that sex or sexuality between mutants and non-mutants is somehow prejudice, and Sabretooth can furrow his brows and say “that’s wierd, Greydon said the same thing.”"},{"prompt":"What is social media listening?","completion":"Yes, social media marketing can indeed help your business in several ways: 1.

The 12th house is associated with spirituality, isolation, the subconscious mind, and hidden aspects of life. Here are some effects of having Mercury in the 12th house: Inward Thinking and Reflection: With Mercury in the 12th house, individuals tend to have a strong inclination towards introspection and deep thinking. They enjoy exploring the hidden aspects of their own mind and often find solace in solitude. This placement encourages them to delve into their subconscious and engage in contemplative activities.Dreamy and Imaginative Mind: Mercury in the 12th house can enhance one's imagination and creative abilities. These individuals may have a vivid inner world and a rich imagination. They are likely to find inspiration in their dreams and may possess artistic or literary talents.Intuitive and Psychic Sensitivity: This placement can heighten one's intuitive and psychic abilities. Individuals with Mercury in the 12th house may have a natural inclination towards perceiving subtle energies and picking up on the emotions and thoughts of others. They may also possess a strong gut instinct that guides their decision-making process.Interest in Mysticism and Spirituality: People with Mercury in the 12th house often have a profound interest in mystical and spiritual subjects. They may be drawn to practices such as meditation, astrology, or metaphysics. These individuals have a natural curiosity about the unseen realms and may seek answers to existential questions.Communication through Non-Verbal Means: While Mercury represents communication, in the 12th house, it may manifest through non-verbal means. Individuals with this placement may find it easier to express themselves through art, music, writing, or other non-verbal forms of communication. They may have a poetic or metaphorical way of expressing their thoughts and emotions.Challenges in Expressing Thoughts: Mercury in the 12th house can present challenges in verbal communication. Individuals may struggle at times to articulate their thoughts or may find it difficult to put their ideas into words. It's important for them to find alternative means of self-expression and to be patient with themselves when finding the right words. It's crucial to remember that the effects of Mercury in the 12th house can be influenced by other factors in an individual's birth chart, such as aspects and the overall planetary configuration. Additionally, personal experiences and choices play a significant role in shaping how these influences are expressed in one's life. Astrology serves as a guide for self-reflection and understanding. It is important to interpret the placement of Mercury in the 12th house as a potential influence rather than a fixed outcome. Each person's journey is unique, and self-awareness allows individuals to harness their strengths and navigate challenges effectively."},{"prompt":"there a way to permanently delete files on a computer where even the FBI can't find the info?","completion":"yes, but that depends on the drive type HDD: you’ll need to go over every drive disk with a strong magnetthen you crush every disk with a hammerthen you find some waterstreams at least one for every disktoss every disk in the water.

Why burn the disks? because burning the disks will make the remaining info harder to extract, IT will need to clean these disks, which removes an awfull lot of information on the drives. most of the times, when you are not a high priority target they won’t even try to fix these burned drives for that reason. you can also just override all data on the drive, with idk many many pictures: personaly i would take one like this: just to troll those guys. hope this was helpfull or just fun to read."},{"prompt":"When is the best time to format?

Streamline your space -Before you do anything else, take a few moments at the start of each day to organize and declutter your workspace. 2. Add pops of color or live plants -Color can have a major effect on your mood and productivity throughout the day, said Jenny Gauld, interior designer for office furniture and accessory retailer Turnstone. 3. Decorate your workspace -In addition to adding some color and plants to your workspace, decorating your desk or cubicle with a few personal knickknacks can help you feel more relaxed, which can boost your productivity. 4. Get your most dreaded task out of the way -Everyone has at least one task on the to-do list that keeps getting pushed back because the thought of doing it seems awful. That task is actually the one you should complete first, according to Matthews. Instead of waiting until the last minute to finish it, get it off your plate as soon as possible. 5. Prioritize and delegate your other tasks -Your focus should go to the most important tasks first, so think about everything you do and just how pivotal or trivial each is. If you can, set aside the low-priority items and come up with a plan to delegate or outsource them so you can spend more time on the things that add more value to your position. 6. Turn off your email notifications -Instead of reading every email as it lands in your inbox, try turning off your notifications and check messages only at set intervals. Why? Constant email alerts popping up on your phone or desktop can break your focus. 7. Identify your most productive work time -People vary in terms of when they are most productive. For example, are you a morning person or a night owl? It’s important to identify which hours of the day you feel most alert and attentive, and then dedicate those hours to your most important tasks. This is especially useful if you work remotely and can determine your schedule. 8. Take short breaks -Whether it’s taking a walk, going to your favorite coffee shop, reading a magazine or visiting with a colleague, taking short breaks that are unrelated to your work can make a huge difference in your performance. Your productivity diminishes the longer you go without a break. 9. Move around -Exercise isn’t just good for your body; it can also positively impact your work performance. 10. Write down your daily goals -It’s not always easy to keep track of everything you need to do, so start each morning by writing down your goals for the day. When your focus is broken or you find yourself procrastinating"},{"prompt":"w did you find out about essay writing services?","completion":"As a college student, I often find myself struggling to balance my academic and personal commitments.

Though Facebook has placed some checks now that make it difficult still creating such profiles is not a near-impossible task. Here are some tricks I myself apply to check authenticity of FB profiles. Non human Profile Pictures: Profiles having no actual human photos , Not even in their photo gallery can be a fake profile. Such profiles tend to have various flora and fauna as DP. I even know people who have their pets FB profiles!! these add to FBs user count as they are used fairly regularly . So FB doesn't bother.Celebrity DPs: Profiles with pictures of a known celeb or multiple(yeah it happens) ones can be a fake profile. Real people sometime use celebs pics but they have at least some pics of their own. so check the gallery.Fake Profile Names: Though a name in a culture may sound fake to a different culture but think of some obvious fake names Seymour Butt, Holdin McGroin .. get my drift?Do an Image Search: Do a Google image search of the profile picture, if multiple pictures are found with different names its likely to be a fake profile. not so smart Fake users tend to take pictures from net hence likely to be repeated.Look at their Friend List: Real people tend to have friends belonging to certain circles (like schools, Colleges/Universities they went to. Companies they worked at),but a profile with friends from Afghanistan to Alaska but no group of friends in a certain area is likely to be fake.Tagged Photos: If the profile has photos tagged by other people(not random crap they are tagged but real human tagged in a pic) in group or single photo its likely to be real.Try to get them to talk via phone: Mention in your chat that you want to talk to her over phone and see how he/she responds: A fake user might panic and wouldn't want to and come up with flimsy reasons. I don't claim this is exhaustive nor perfect way to detect a fake profile. Some real people also do that but rarely. I will edit if I find more.PS: In India if a girl connects in FB whom you have never met in real world and she is doing things that are too good to be true , Then it probably is a fake profile."},{"prompt":"Should we be kind to people?","completion":"There are times you should and times you should not as in the case of predators like a malignant narcissist who will take your kindness as weakness and attempt exploite it.

That’s the specific answer to this question but there is a more general answer too. Success in learning to play, even at a basic level, is a relatively long haul, so it's important to pick your battles wisely. It is perfectly acceptable to skip playing ‘difficult’ F chords (at least for the time being) if the chord never crops up in the songs that you like to play. Technical details should never be allowed to interfere with the simple pleasure of playing music. If the chord does start cropping up in songs but you just can’t face the work involved in learning to play it, put those songs to one side and concentrate on broadening your repertoire with more songs that avoid the dreaded F. At some point a song you really like will come along that that makes playing F unavoidable. This is the moment to confront your dilemma. Knuckle down and learn the chord because the song compels you, not because the textbook you’re using, or some Youtuber (or Quora-posting) says so. You develop as a guitarist by learning the technicalities of the instrument.You develop as a musician by playing music."},{"prompt":"Does Canada feel animosity towards the Trump administration for the threats and tariffs of the last two years?","completion":"I certainly do.

Also, we feel the universe started as a singularity, implying sort of a point - but it happened “everywhere”. How? Hmmmm."},{"prompt":"What did the US Government do that was so heinous that it caused Americans to decide they needed an unchecked right to bear arms?","completion":"It wasn’t the US government, it was Charles I and James II. Over a century before the American War of Independence, a showdown between an autocratic English king and an alarmed Parliament escalated into the English Civil War. After that was over there was briefly a restoration of the Stuart dynasty until James II provoked yet another rebellion by Parliament that resulted in the “Glorious Revolution”. It was a century of “interesting times”. What the English people- at home and the colonists who settled North America- took away from all this was that people without guns quickly found themselves without rights. Long before the United States and the Second Amendment, the English Bill of Rights declared the ownership of firearms a fundamental guarantee of the traditional rights of Englishmen (somewhat more limitedly than the Americans). This tradition was strongly preserved in the colonies, while in England itself the right to own and carry guns was infringed by a series of laws intended to prevent poaching- which interestingly might be why several early drafts of the Second Amendment specifically mentioned taking game as one of the reasons for a protected right to own guns; presumably so that dodge couldn’t be done again. What so alarmed the American colonials beginning in the 1760s was that as the ultimate sovereign power of the British Empire, Parliament asserted an authority to pass any laws whatsoever it saw necessary, including laws directly upon the internal workings of the colonies, which up to then had been de facto self-administrating. The colonists, who considered themselves the inheritors of the proud English tradition of civil rights, suddenly to their horror found themselves subjects of the British imperial bureaucracy. The more heavy-handed Parliament became in an effort to make the colonies toe the line, the more the colonists feared that they would end up without any rights that couldn’t be abolished at the stroke of a pen. There was the war of course, and that led to yet another reiteration of the idea that guns in the hands of the citizenry are what ultimately keeps power-hungry governments in check."},{"prompt":"What are some tips for me if I am new to competitive programming?","completion":"In general, competitive programming is a mental sport in which participants demonstrate their problem-solving abilities under a variety of restrictions (that force everyone to think deeply or efficiently). Anyone who participates in competitive programming can improve their methods for solving problems. You will learn how to approach a problem with the best of the best possible ways, you will learn how to analytically think and solve a problem and analyze its space and time complexity. There are a lot of websites you can follow which will help you in your preparation for competitive programming, some of the best includes Logicmojo, GeeksForGeeks, Educative, Algoexpert etc. COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING Competitive programming, as the name implies, is a competition in which a large number of programmers attempt to solve programming puzzles within a predetermined time limit. Choose the coding language in which you are most comfortable writing code because the solution can be written in any language. After that, the solutions will be examined by the online judges. These solutions must successfully complete all of the test cases in order to be accepted (given as well as hidden). Competitive programming basically serves as a test of your technical proficiency along with speed and accuracy. These competitions are used to find the best talent by many large corporations, including Facebook and Netflix. Therefore, you can incorporate competitive programming into your technical interview preparation. Along with some amazing prizes, you stand to win big at the finish line. At the finish line, apart from some fantastic prizes, you stand to win the chance of working with your dream company. ROADMAP Before we begin, we'd like to go over the requirements for competitive programming because entering competitions with the right attitude can make all the difference. Not to mention that you can build on a strong foundation if you have the essentials in mind beforehand. Consider the following as you begin your competitive programming journey: - Be specific about the programming language you'll use for competitions: The simplest but most important action. Any programming language will work, but C++ performs the best. You need a quick language because of time constraints, and C++ is quicker than languages like Java and C because you can use the Standard Template Library (STL) as well. - Begin to feel at ease using a coding website with a user-friendly interface, such as HackerRank, and work through many of the problems there. Why do you want HackerRank? Your confidence will grow as a result of its recommendation system's slow and gradual progression through increasingly difficult situations. - Learn the language's data structures and libraries. For instance, using C++ or JAVA or Python - arrays, strings, LinkedList, stack, queue, recursion, etc. and STL (Standard Template Library) will significantly improve your performance and help you write shorter, more comprehensible code. - Work through at least 40–50 HackerRank questions, and become familiar with the IDE. - When it comes to competitive programming, practice makes perfect: Even though you're probably sick of hearing it, you need to practise, practise, and practise some more! You already understand how complex coding is if you're a software engineer, coding engineer, software developer, or someone else involved in the industry. - Start learning algorithms while participating in competitions; algorithms can help you understand your confusions; however, some algorithms are challenging for beginners to visualize. Algorithms can help you optimize your programme, and they are one of the most important factors in contest rankings because they have a significant impact on your execution time. - Start competing in contests on websites like Codechef and Codeforces, among others. Start with lengthy challenges on Codechef, where you have 10 days to answer 8–10 questions. This is especially beneficial for beginners as it gives them plenty of time to research a problem and find a solution. - Maintain Consistency, exercise patience, and attempt to step outside of your comfort zone by going back to the questions you couldn't answer after each competition. Do them again on your own. If you can't understand it, look at editorials and other people's solutions after the competitions. - For pair programming, try to find someone who shares your desire for competitive programming. By learning from others' mistakes, one can develop their ability to think creatively. ADVANTAGES If you choose to enter a competition, you can anticipate receiving the following benefits: 1. Ace any technical interview to land the position of your dreams: As previously mentioned, many organizations (including Amazon, Facebook, etc.) use these competitions to hire qualified professionals. In addition to boosting your skill confidence, practicing for competitive programming will expose you to more people, which will increase your chances of being noticed. 2. Because of competitive programming, one can become an expert problem solver: Practice makes perfect. Your problem-solving abilities improve as your stack of solved problems grows. Real-world problems that you must solve will also help you hone your analytical abilities. 3. Competitive programming can help you gain a better understanding of software practices: As you practise for the competitions and work through problems, your concepts become clearer every day. As you discover new methods for solving various problems, your understanding of the subject will continue to advance. 4. Competing in programming competitions can help you develop teamwork because many coding contests require participants to work in teams of three or four. It will come naturally to you as you work with people who have different perspectives and backgrounds to help you adapt and become a team player. PREREQUISITE TO START COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING - For competitive programming, pick a good code editor. The next step is selecting the best code editor after selecting an appropriate code language. Writing the code in a code editor will aid in speeding up and improving accuracy as you work on a variety of problems. Popular editors include Pharm & Vim, VS Code, and Sublime Text 3. - Choose the Right Environments to Practice Competitive Programming The best option for newcomers is HackerRank. Its user interface and IDE are among the best. You can easily get around the platform and answer the various questions available to you. Based on their level of difficulty, questions are divided. Its algorithm is one of the best aspects of this platform, which makes it excellent for practicing competitive programming. You can easily download the solutions to correct your logic even if you get stuck on a question and fail several test sets. Try not to consult solutions too frequently, though. Try to push yourself to solve the problem on your own. You will also benefit greatly from working on coding issues. - Start Competing to Get Better at Competitive Programming After a good practice regime of 2-3 months, you can start participating! Apply all that knowledge and get better with each contest. There are several platforms to choose from: o Codeforces o TopCoder o HackerRank o Codechef o Leetcode When competing, if you get stuck on any question, just go over the contests’ editorials as well as discussion forums. Data Structure and Algorithm You are aware of how data structures contribute to a program's efficiency. You can choose the ideal data structure for any problem by having a thorough understanding of data structures. Data structures will boost your productivity, quickness, and play a crucial role in the way you prepare for technical interviews. You should have a solid understanding of some common data structures. Learn about algorithms in depth for competitive programming When you compete, time and space will be two elements that greatly influence your decisions. These two have algorithms in common. Having complete and thorough knowledge can change the game for you because algorithms use a variety of data structures to produce results in the form of outputs. The same holds true for when you prepare for technical interviews. Here are a few data structure and algorithms to get you started: o DSA Foundations - Time & Space Complexity Analysis - Recursion - Divide & Conquer o Basic DSA - Arrays - Linked List - Stack - Queue o Basic Algorithms - Searching and Sorting - Hashing - 2 pointers - Backtracking o Math for Programming - Fundamentals (Binary Exponentiation, Euclidean Algorithm, etc) - Algorithms related to prime numbers (Sieve of Eratosthenes, etc) - Number Theory (Euler's totient, etc) - Modular Arithmetic (Modulo inverse, Chinese remainder theorem, etc) - Number Systems (Balanced Ternary, Gray code, etc) - Linear Algebra - Geometry - Combinatorics - Numerical Methods - Misc. (Fast Fourier transform, Polynomials, etc) o Intermediate Algorithms - String Manipulation - Bit Manipulation - Greedy - Intermediate Data Structures - Trees - Set - Map - Heap o Slightly Advanced Algorithms - Dynamic Programming (DP) o Graph DSA o Advanced DSA - Game Theory - Advanced String Algorithms, Tries - Segment Trees, Fenwick Trees - Suffix Tree, Suffix Array - Heavy Light Decomposition - Disjoint Set, Graph Coloring, Network Flow - Sqrt Decomposition RESOURCES The key to competitive programming is to practise and get better with each competition. There isn't a replacement for that. At first, you will pick up most of the knowledge while you are struggling and searching online. You might need to gradually develop your understanding of various concepts. Although there are few websites who have a structured curriculum for competitive programming few of the best includes: - Logicmojo - Educative - Algoexpert - Interviewbit You may also go through GeeksForGeeks, Stackoverflow and Quora to resolve your doubts. Good problem sets for practice (Intermediate/Advanced): - A2OJ: Problem collections based on Codeforces rating - CSES Problem Set - Tasks - CS Academy COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID IN COMPETITIVE PROGRAMMING AS A BEGINNER These are the common mistakes to avoid in competitive programming as a beginner: - Not participating in contests - All practicing, No learning - All learning, No practicing - Focusing too much on the programming language - Only participating in contests - Solving random questions - Giving up CONCLUSION I hope this answer was helpful to you in some way. Please feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions or anything to add to this article. I'll be glad to answer.

Spock said T’Pring’s plan was logical. _____________________________________ Spock had already accepted his fate. Here’s the script, immediately following Kirk’s “death”; Spock states he is resigning his command and offers no defense for the crime of which he is guilty… SPOCK: Why the challenge, and why you chose my captain as your champion? T'PRING: Stonn wanted me, I wanted him. SPOCK: I see no logic in preferring Stonn over me. T'PRING: You have become much known among our people, Spock. Almost a legend. And as the years went by, I came to know that I did not want to be the consort of a legend. But by the laws of our people, I could only divorce you by the kal-if-fee. There was also Stonn, who wanted very much to be my consort, and I wanted him. If your Captain were victor, he would not want me, and so I would have Stonn. If you were victor you would free me because I had dared to challenge, and again I would have Stonn. But if you did not free me, it would be the same. For you would be gone, and I would have your name and your property, and Stonn would still be there. SPOCK: Logical. Flawlessly logical. T'PRING: I am honored. SPOCK: Stonn. She is yours. After a time, you may find that having is not so pleasing a thing after all as wanting. It is not logical, but it is often true. Spock here. Stand by to beam up. Live long, T'Pau, and prosper.

Are Macedonians Greek (not North Macedonia)?","completion":"First let us see who or what is north Macedonia. That is a political entity that replaced FYROM and is occupying the geographic area of the Paeonians The inhabitants are slavs,that migrated in the Balkans around 600 ad ,and are a mix of albanian and Bulgarian minorities, according to the ancient historians the Paeonians were absorbed by their neighbors by the time of the death of king Pyrros of Epirus. Now a look at ancient greece.That is a scholarly term that was not in use at the time it encompasses, from the myceneans to the roman conquest. The appropriate term would be Hellenic World.That included hellenic city states and kingdoms from Pantecapion in Crimea to Syracuse and Massilia.The question is was the kingdom of macedon part of that world? Absolutely. First off, the argument that macedonia was not a city state does not apply,because the thessalians were hellenes and not a city state but a loose feudal state ,and Epirus was a kingdom with Alexander as king brother to Olympias(mother of Alexander the great) tracing their descent to the famous Neoptolemos son of Achilles. The Hellenic world started with kingdoms as their political organization,like Mycenea,Pylos,Sparta,Ithaka,Athens, etc and progressed to city states with more democratic government, Sparta with 2 kings being stuck in the intermediate phase.Northern Hellenes never went that route,it happens sometimes in the harsh frontiers of civilization, the luxury of civil evolution is just not there. Now religious membership of that group ,the major part of being Hellene was the worship of the gods of Olympus, in daily life and in the Olympic games . The macedonians worshipped the gods of Olympus, as we see from the description by Diodoros of Sicily of the marriage ceremony of Cleopatra to Alexander of Epirus brother of Olympias. 16.92.5] Finally, once the drinking party was ended and the beginning of the competitions fixed for the next day, the crowds rushed to the theater while it was still dark, and at daybreak the procession was drawn up. Among the splendid accompaniments henote paraded statues of the twelve gods extravagantly fashioned with the most magnificent workmanship and wondrously adorned with the gleam of precious metal. Along with these a thirteenth was carried in procession, a statue fit for a god, one of Philip in person, who was displaying himself as enthroned with the twelve gods. In fact we see that in true greek fashion Philip committed Hubris right before his assassination.The participation in the Olympic games of Alexander the first and Phillip the second has been well attested, thus proving their hellenic identity, but that is secondary to what most people ignore,the fact that athletic contests in the hellenic world were an act of worship,something that pious Alexander repeated everywhere his glorious army rested for extended periods of time. Here is Alexander portrayed in the lion skin head of Heracles and in the reverse we have next to the greek inscription of his name the seated Zeus with his eagle. Now another criterion of hellenic origin was language.A lot has been said and argued about macedonian being a greek doric dialect.The young people growing up in greece now dont realize that several dialects that exhisted up until the 80s sounded almost as a different language, notably my fathers cycladic dialect and my friend's cretan. Nonetheless i will approach the argument from another angle.There has not been found a single piece of pottery, burial marker,tablet or inscription on anything that is not in written greek. A nomac nationalist would claim that like turkish ,macedonian used greek characters for its written speach,to which i answer that this would require words that make no sense in greek,like written turkish makes no sense in any latin based language. Everything discovered has meaning, context appropriate too ,in ancient [LINKED_TEXT: greek.So] [URL: http://greek.so/] regardless of how they spoke and pronounced it ,macedonian was greek. Now we cant prove that every single inhabitant of ancient Macedonia was a descendant of hellenes,by tracing their lineage because nobody bothered to do that for families outside of royalty. That was the family tree of Alexander the great descendant of Temenos the Argead, with supporting evidence by many ancient writers and archeological artifacts like the tripod from Phillips tomb posted by Dervenis here in quora,seen below So if the macedonians were non hellenes ruled by a hellenic royal house there would have been revolts,as in ptolemaic egypt,among other archeological findings suggesting a divided society between the nobles and the common people. Instead we have public religious ceremonies thoroughly hellenic as i described above that the common people,soldiers of macedon in Alexanders campaigns are participating.And the ancient writers never described a rebelling group of subjects. So ancient macedonia was a hellenic kingdom,ruled by a hellenic royal house,speeking and writing in ancient greek,worshiping actively the hellenic gods. This question has been tackled by other writers here with many citations,Kosmas,Gaitanas,Dervenis,Detsi and others,i suggest following them and looking at their answers.I tried not to repeat them and offered i hope additional perspectives to the question."},{"prompt":"w do I transfer a Word document to a PDF?","completion":"Both the doc and PDF are the most popular document formats used across the globe.

Is making the first move actually the definition of gender equality?","completion":"If anyone is suggesting that I have not heard it. What they are probably erroneously illuding to is the fact that Bumble only allows women to make the initial contact. So, in essence this removes the traditional male responsibility of making the first move. This DOES NOT eliminate the damsel in distress attitude, because it has nothing to do with it at all. Damsels prey on men’s nature to get what they want using the damsel routine. In no way does this relate to dating, except when she uses that ploy in garnering sympathy from a man she wants to date, but regardless of who initiates she can still play that card. Further, it doesn’t empower women to make the first move, it forces them to. They have no alternative but to do as the site requires or they will be spending their Saturday nights alone. Consequently the site is taking the women from a position of hapless bystander in the dating process, and turning her into the “Princess” free to make selection of men who have been made the hapless bystander by the site’s rules, and have no agency in the process. They are expected to take what they get or nothing at all. How very egalitarian, right? Is making the first move actually the definition of gender equality? No, not really. It is role reversal. Just like all of the horrible film flops that have come and gone where the protagonist, or focus was originally male, and during “modernization” the characters got swapped for the opposing gender. Overboard for instance, or Ghostbusters. True equality doesn’t exclude anyone from anything on the basis of their gender. In terms of a dating site it gives men and women equal access to being able to make the first move. Bumble, in all seriousness, is actually sexist in their rules and approach to making first contact."},{"prompt":"What is a dofollow backlink?","completion":"With Google treating the “NoFollow” attribute as a hint for indexing and crawling as of March 1st, this is a good time to have a closer look at nofollow links, both internal and external, and discuss the benefits they provide, and different ways to use them. In last week’s Semrushchat, we discussed nofollow links vs. follow links (some call them dofollow links). It became very apparent that there is a lot of confusion in the community on a variety of issues related to nofollow, so we decided to break down the basics and provide link-building tips every SEO and link builder should know. What Are Nofollow Links? Google introduced the rel=\\"nofollow\\" option in 2005 for bloggers that were struggling with people using comment spam to try and build links in the hope of ranking for specific keywords, like “wedding invitations.” Since that time, Google has suggested using the attribute paid links (a practice that can get you penalized by Google). The nofollow attribute tells search engines not to follow the outbound link that is being tagged—which is essentially saying that the website does not endorse the link. What a Follow and Nofollow Link Looks Like Nofollow is used in the HTML of your source code. Many CMSs provide a nofollow option when creating links, but if you have to code them by hand, we have some examples for you. Here is what a follow link looks like: <a href=\\"https://example.com\\">Anchor Text Goes Here</a> Here is what a nofollow link looks like: <a href=\\"https://example.com\\" rel=\\"nofollow\\">Anchor Text</a> NoFollow vs. NoIndex: What Is the difference? We have noticed that there is confusion over how to stop Google from indexing a page, so we want to make sure our community knows the difference between nofollow and noindex and what options they have. As stated above, nofollow can be used for individual links. Nofollow also can be added to the <head> of a page which tells search engines to nofollow all links on that page: <meta name=\\"robots\\" content=\\"nofollow\\" /> If you are using this in the hopes that Google will not crawl pages on your own site with this directive, please know that in the past it would be a sign to Google to not crawl a page via a specific link, but that doesn’t prevent Google from crawling a page a different way. And if Google is now treating nofollows as “hints,” then this strategy will not work for you.

Some of the deadliest bullets are in fact made with a small pit in their tip in order to cause them to expand upon impact with the target, making the wound much more deadly ( These are known as hollow-point bullets ).Now military bullets often do have a \\"pointy\\" cone shaped bullet, but this is mostly for aerodynamics ( a streamlined bullet experiences less drag than a round one ).If the goal is to penetrate Armour, then typically the bullets will consist of some heavy penetrator made from tungsten-carbide or uranium, since these materials have a very high density and also mechanical properties that let them penetrate thicker layers of Armour before disintegrating. These materials are also very damaging to the rifle they are fired from, so they almost always have a jacket of a softer metal which is less harsh on the rifle. Upon impact this jacket fractures, and the heavier core proceeds to penetrate the target's Armour."},{"prompt":"w do I talk like a native English speaker?","completion":"Through practice!

Thanks for your inviting. Upscaling video from SD (480p) or HD (720p) to 1080p or 4K or even 8K is possible. Is there a way to enlarge a video while retaining its fine details? How can you raise the quality of a video while maintaining the quality? In recent years, video-editing enthusiasts have often asked the questions outlined above. Fortunately, AI video upscale is a ground-breaking innovation. Videophiles don't have to wait for firms to generate high-definition content; they can do it themselves. AI video upscaling software is expected to become increasingly popular in 2023. If words are too boring for you, you can have a look at this video: AI upscale video is something you may be curious about. A low-resolution image is used in traditional upscaling, and the goal is to boost the image quality by resizing it to higher resolutions. The technique for AI video upscaling is different. A deep learning model predicts a high-resolution video that would downscale to seem like the original, low-resolution movie given a low-resolution video. Here are three tools used by me, and I think them are feasible to upsacle old video quality. If you are interested, you can try them. DVDFab Video Enhancer AI It is hard to beat DVDFab Video Enhancer AI for AI upscale video software. In addition to a simple and user-friendly interface, it provides a wide range of video upscaling capabilities. If you have a video or movie with a low-res quality like 480p (SD) or 1080p (Full HD), you may use this tool to upgrade the quality of the video automatically. No additional configuration is required. AVCLabs Video Enhancer AI How to ai upscale videos? The video enhancement software AVCLabs Video Enhancer AI stands apart from the rest of the competition. An AI-based video is an upscaling program and robust detail-preserving tool that enables users to automatically upscale low-resolution and blurry homemade videos or vintage films from 480p, 710 to 4K, or even 8k. Topaz Video Enhancer AI n intuitive user interface and built-in video-enhancing capabilities make it straightforward to use.

I understand the historical reasons for an electoral college but communication systems are now much better!","completion":"Whenever there's a close election, the losing candidate decries, “But I won the popular vote.” If you look at an election map and compare it to a population map you'll note that there is a direct correlation between the two major parties and their voting tendencies. And more people live in urban areas ( and this continues to grow) than rural. Urban areas have greater need of more government (as reflected in the Democratic party) and rural areas favor less (Republican). Because of this, on a direct vote, the Democrat would win every election and totally disregard the needs of the rural population. The electoral process of the republic virtually forced both parties and their candidates to at least try to address the needs of both."},{"prompt":"Which is the best car brand in the world?","completion":"Oldsmobile F-88 Throughout the ’50s, General Motors hosted auto shows that displayed fancy prototypes and concept cars. But once out of the spotlight, the vehicles were supposed to be destroyed. The Oldsmobile F-88, designed in 1952 and 1953, was one of those dream cars that wasn’t destroyed and is today considered one of the greatest expressions of automotive design to ever come from North America. Only two were manufactured, with one of those now on display at the Gateway Auto Museum. Purchased for 3.24 million, the two-seat roadster with a fiberglass body is the collection’s crown jewel and possibly the world’s rarest automobile. BMC Mini Proof that necessity is the mother of invention, the Mini was created by the British Motor Company in a period of drastic gas rationing in Great Britain in the late ’50s and early ’60s. Despite being just 10 feet long to achieve better gas mileage, the earliest Mini comfortably sat four people thanks to an engine that was mounted transversely, instead of front to back, allowing for more interior room. Since then, the Mini has been the inspiration behind later generations of small and smart cars. Ford Mustang In the first six months of production in 1964, the Mustang was the fastest-selling car in history. It has since become an icon of style and performance among American automobiles, escorting in the “pony car” class of affordable sporty coupes with long hoods and short rear decks. Competitors raced to release their own versions, such as the Chevy Camaro, the Pontiac Firebird, and the Dodge Challenger. In 1964 alone, the Mustang was the pace car for the Indianapolis 500 and won both first and second in class at the Tour de France international rally. The museum is home to a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT 500 Fastback, designed by the legendary car constructor and race car driver Carroll Shelby."},{"prompt":"What is the approximate price of CBD and HEMP products?","completion":"Hemp products are a big craze these days, and everyone seems to join the bandwagon.

However, these are effective only when the hemp products are made from pure & 100% organic hemp extract. This is where the price & quality comes into the picture. There could be many companies & websites that offer hemp products at competitive prices, but there is no way to know if the products are genuine or not. To get genuine hemp products, you need to buy them from a trusted source like Ananta HempWorks. This is one brand that offers all natural & 100% authentic hemp products extracted from the Himalayas in Uttarakhand.

Some were also there, who were stronger than many of the people who fought in the Kurukshetra war, but they did not fight due to some special reasons. So guys, now I am going to list some of the best warriors in the Mahabharata. The criteria is going to be like this:- First, we will talk about the warriors who did not fight in Kurukshetra.Then, we will talk about the warriors who did fight in the war.And finally, we’ll talk about some honourable mentions. So guys, before starting, I would like to say something. I am making this list on the basis of the most authentic TV Serial about Mahabharata, namely BR Chopra Mahabharata, and also on the basis of what my father has read and told me about Mahabharata. So guys, don’t get angry if you don’t agree with the answer, because everyone has their own opinion. So let’s start. Non-Participants in the Kurukshetra War So, here’s the list of those who did not participate:- Bhagwan Shri Krishna Now, I put him in the list of non-participants because I think the question was about physical fights. And Krishna Ji did not fight physically. I don’t even need to say why I put him at no.1. Even if some people have a doubt in this, then I would like to state the following facts:- He is Parabrahma. He is the supreme. That’s why he is the strongest.He killed his mighty maternal uncle, Maharaj Kansa when he and his elder brother, Dau Bhaiya were just teenagers and Mama Kansa was so older than them.He defeated a great wrestler named Chanur.He defeated the mighty King Jarasandha 15 or 16 times in battle. 2. Mahabali Balram Ji Balram Ji was the incarnation of Ananta Shesha. He is the stongest warrior after Krishna Ji.He defeated the great wrestler Mushtik, when he was just a child.he defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling bout many times.He was a great mace fighter who trained another two great fighters of mace, namely Bhima and Duryodhana. 3. Krishna Putra Pradyumna He defeated and killed the demon Sambhara.He is also an avatar of Bhagwan Kamadev.He overpowered both Ganesh Ji and Bhagwan Kartikeya for some time in the Banasur War.He trained Abhimanyu, along with Kritverman, Satyaki, his father, his uncle Balram and his younger brother Samba. 4. Samba The younger son of Shri Krishna.I am sorry that I don’t know any of his feats, so I have to move forward like this. So guys, this was the list of those who did not participate. So now, we will talk about those who did participated in Kurukshetra. Participants in the Kurukshetra War So, here’s the list of those who participated in the war:- Ganga Putra Bhishma Pitamah The following are some great feats of Bhishma Pitamah:- He fought a great battle with his Gurudev Parshuram Ji for 20 days(longer than the battle of Kurukshetra). Finally, the battle ended in a tie after 20 days.He defeated all the warriors on the side of the Pandavas, including Bhima, Arjuna, Satyaki and Abhimanyu. 3. He was so strong that the Pandavas had to cheat to defeat him. 2. Radheya Karna Here are the list of Karna’s feats:- He perfomed all the feats performed by Arjuna at the rangbhoomi in a much shorter time.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling bout more quickly than Bhima.He had got the Vijaya bow of Bhagwan Shiva and most of the Divyastras Arjuna from his Gurudev Bhagwan Parshuram Ji.He defeated many strong kings in the Bhanumati Swayamvara like Jarasandha, Rukmi, Shishupal and Shalya.He was an all-rounder warrior and good in using every weapon just like Arjuna.He defeated so many great warriors from the Pandava side. 3. Kunti Putra Arjun Here are some of the famous feats of Arjuna:- He defeated Drupad in the Guru Dakshina War.He defeated almost everyone in the war at Matsya Kingdom.He had many divine weapons such as Pashupatastra, Brahmastra, Brahmashira, etc.He defeated almost every Kuru warrior in the entire Kaurava side in the Kurukshetra War.Though Arjuna defeated Karna, I placed him below Karna as he defeated him with the help of Shri Krishna and Hanuman Ji. 4. Guru Dronacharya He was the one who trained both the Pandavas and kauravas.He was a great Maharathi, who was a master of all weapons.He killed warriors like Virat and Drupad.He was so strong that only Arjun had the full power to defeat him.He was such a warriror that the Pandavas had to lie to him to beat him, once and for all. 5. Bhima He killed the mighty Jarasandh.He defeated Karna a few times.He killed the 100 sons of Gandhari.He killed Duryodhana in a mace fight. 6. Duryodhan He was one of the greatest mace fighters of that time, as said by Balram himself.He had a great mace fight with Bhima. 7. Ashwathama He fired the Narayan Astra and no one knew it’s counter on the 15th day.He defeated good warriors like Satyaki, Drupad and Dhrishtidhyumna. He was the last commander who led the night attack on the Pandavas. 8. Abhimanyu He fought well with Bhishma Pitamah on the first day but got defeated.He defeated many warriors from the Kaurava side including Dronacharya, Duryodhana, Shalya, Kritverman, Ashwathama and Kripacharya.He was the only one who could counter the Chakravyuha made by Guru Dronacharya on the 13th day. 9. Vrishsen He defeated Drupad and Dhrishtidhyumna.He defeated Yudhishthir, Nakul and Sahadev.He had a great fight with Bhima.He was finally killed brutally in an archery by Arjun. 10. Satyaki He defeated Karna a few times.He gave a really good fight to Dronacharya for a really long time on the 14th day. So guys, these were the warriors who participated and who did not participate in the war. Now, let's talk about some honourable mentions:- DrupadViratDhrishtidhyumnaGhatotkachYudhishthir5 Sons of DraupadiJarasandhNakul and SahadevShishupalRukmiNilaBhagadatta So guys, this was my list. These are my favourite warriors from the Mahabharat. At the end I would like to say:- Jai Shree Krishna!!!! Har Har Mahadev!!!! Thank you."},{"prompt":"Can you do a singing reveal?","completion":"Yes, I believe so. I'm passionate about singing. Singing, for me is a release of any emotional barriers that exist within.

Performance wise, they both trade blows at similar price points. Intel tends to be better bang for buck on low cost slow processors, while AMD make the higher end stuff being slightly cheaper per performance. As a thumb suck rule, for this date. It used to be the other way round a handful of years ago. And there are exceptions to this. For a pure performance aspect, I would rather pick model by model. Even just from a benchmark site like: [LINKED_TEXT: PassMark Software - CPU BenchmarksPassMark Software - CPU Benchmarks - Over 1 million CPUs and 1,000 models benchmarked and compared in graph form, updated daily!https://www.cpubenchmark.net/] [URL: https://www.cpubenchmark.net/]Probably the biggest benefit between these two, is that AMD keeps the same socket design for years on end. Meaning, any sort of future upgrade only requires a new CPU. While Intel (typically) change sockets every 2 years or so - meaning nearly every time you upgrade, you have to buy both a CPU and a new motherboard. Other than that. AMD typically also uses less electricity for the same performance, and thus also doesn’t produce as much heat when pushed to its limits. You can (or could) generally save a bit on cooling systems when you went AMD as opposed to Intel. These days, AMD’s newest 7000 series seem to alter it a bit. They run flat out up to the point where they reach factory setting max temperature. Basically auto-overclocking up to the maximum limits. For people used to the older cool running AMD stuff, this tends to feel uncomfortable. But, when you notice the speed increases this causes, you understand why AMD did it. For AMD’s 5000 series Ryzens and older, Intel had an advantage in AES 512 hardware acceleration (basically the newest encryption standard). AMD needed to perform that in software. But, the new 7000 series also include this. Intel usually also include an iGPU. A pretty low end graphics processor. But, at least enough to display windows. AMD only have a few CPUs which include one of these (usually with a model number ending in G for desktop, H or U for laptop). Of course, if you already have a dedicated graphics card, this is a moot point - those iGPUs are wholly worthless in comparison to even the low end graphics cards."},{"prompt":"Why is #ISRO trending on Twitter?","completion":"Maybe because we are too bothered by the opinion of others or what will people think about us. The one thing today's generation fail to realise is we aren't born to impress. Also life potrayed on social media is not even 1% of the real life. People show only what they want to show on social media. You never know what a person is really going through in their real life. They fail to accept themselves the way they are. The body shaming issue which is so much in news these days, they have all come from the fact of our preconceived notions of beautiful or handsome. We fail to realise that staying healthy and free of disease is most important. Also one very important factor is they aspire for overnight success. The concept itself is outrageous. There is no such thing as overnight success. Even if some people does achieve overnight success, there is still years of hardwork involved which we often overlook. Youngsters these days loves to compare. They are blindly following the trend which goes on. Instead of being a follower, why don't you be your own leader? We crave for attention. We want people to notice us. Even the concept of fun these days is what will look nice on social media. Number of likes on social networking sites, number of people who have viewed the story is the main culprit of anxiety these days. People are afraid of criticism. If you choose to do something different, criticism will always follow. Only you should know in your heart if you are correct or not. Donot sleep with a guilty conscience.

Determine your long-term plan for this asset. 1. Decide where to buy bitcoin There are a few different ways to buy bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including exchanges and traditional brokers. Cryptocurrency exchanges You can purchase bitcoin from several cryptocurrency exchanges. Many charge a percentage of the purchase price. Do your due diligence to find the right one for you. Some of the more popular exchanges include: Coinbase: This is a popular choice for U.S. bitcoin buyers, in part because you can easily link your bank account. Coinbase also offers access to etherium, litecoin and other cryptocurrencies. On each transaction, Coinbase charges a spread (an adjustment in the purchase or sale price of an investment) of about 0.5%, plus a fee. The fee is the greater of a variable percentage based on region and payment type — for example, 1.49% for a purchase funded by a U.S. bank account — or a flat fee that ranges from 0.99 to 2.99, depending on the amount transferred.

(Read our [LINKED_TEXT: Binance.US review.] [URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/binance-us])Gemini: This U.S.-based crypto exchange trades bitcoin, ether, bitcoin cash, litecoin and zcash.

(Learn more from our [LINKED_TEXT: Gemini review] [URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/reviews/investing/brokers/gemini].)Coinmama. This exchange trades in eight cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin.

Grayscale Investments is a digital currency asset manager. Two of its investment trusts — Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (its ticker symbol is GBTC) and Grayscale Ethereum Classic Trust (ETCG) — are publicly traded over the counter, which means you can buy them through many discount brokers. There are fees, and GBTC often trades at a premium, that is, GBTC shares often cost more than bitcoin, even though bitcoin is its only holding. The thinking is that some investors are willing to pay extra to buy bitcoin through a traditional exchange, without needing to worry about wallets and storage. What to know before you buy Have information you may need handy. Setting up a cryptocurrency account takes minutes, but you'll need to provide some information, including your Social Security number and the number to your bank account, debit card or credit card to fund your bitcoin account. Some providers also may require you to have a picture ID. Record and safeguard any new passwords for your crypto account or digital wallet (more on those below). Don’t use a credit card. Although some providers allow you to purchase bitcoin by credit card, making investments by borrowing from a high-interest product like a credit card is never a good idea. » Learn more: [LINKED_TEXT: Is Bitcoin safe?] [URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/is-bitcoin-safe] Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency investments are [LINKED_TEXT: not insured by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation] [URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/sipc-insurance-what-it-does-and-does-not-protect/] for exchange failures or theft, a protection that traditional stock brokerage accounts enjoy up to 500,000. Some exchanges like Coinbase provide private insurance, but that doesn’t protect against individual online breaches like someone stealing your password. Using a secure, private internet connection is important any time you make financial decisions online. Buying bitcoin while at the coffee shop, in your hotel room or using other public internet connections is not advised. » 2. Decide how to store bitcoin Bitcoins can be stored in two kinds of digital wallets: a hot wallet or a cold wallet. With a hot wallet, transactions generally are faster, while a cold wallet often incorporates extra security steps that help to keep your assets safe but also take longer. Hot wallet With a hot wallet, bitcoin is stored by a trusted exchange or provider in the cloud and accessed through an app or computer browser on the internet. Any trading exchange you join will offer a free bitcoin hot wallet where your purchases will automatically be stored. But many users prefer to transfer and store their bitcoin with a third-party hot wallet provider, also typically free to download and use. Why choose a wallet from a provider other than an exchange? While advocates say the blockchain technology behind bitcoin is even more secure than traditional electronic money transfers, bitcoin hot wallets are an attractive target for hackers. As [LINKED_TEXT: Bitcoin.org warns] [URL: https://bitcoin.org/en/secure-your-wallet#online]: “Many exchanges and online wallets suffered from security breaches in the past and such services generally still do not provide enough insurance and security to be used to store money like a bank.” There are many hot wallet providers, offering a range of wallet types. Here are a few: Coinbase: Also a popular bitcoin currency exchange, Coinbase offers free online hot wallets and insures losses due to security breaches or hacks, employee theft, or fraudulent transfers.Electrum: Software that allows your bitcoin to be stored on your laptop or desktop computer.Blockchain: Like Coinbase, Blockchain is an online hot wallet; unlike Coinbase, Blockchain isn’t a currency exchange and is considered a less attractive target for hackers.Mycelium: A mobile-only bitcoin wallet, with versions available for Android or iPhone users. Although some hot wallet providers offer insurance for large-scale hack attacks, that insurance may not cover one-off cases of unauthorized access to your account. » Cold wallet A cold wallet is a small, encrypted portable device that allows you to download and carry your bitcoin. Cold wallets can cost as much as 100 but are considered much more secure than hot wallets. Cold wallet providers include: Trezor: This company offers small, key-size cold wallets ranging from about 80 to 170.Ledger Nano: Designed like a thumb drive, Ledger Nano has cold wallets ranging from about 60 to 120. When creating accounts for your digital wallets and currency exchange, use a strong password and two-factor authentication. 3. Make your purchase After linking your bitcoin wallet to the bitcoin exchange of your choice, the last step is the easiest — deciding how much bitcoin you want to buy. While bitcoin made news in January by cresting past 40,000 for the first time, bitcoin (trading symbol BTC or XBT) can be bought and sold for fractional shares, so your initial investment could be as low as, say, 25. 4. Manage your investment If you like the idea of [LINKED_TEXT: day trading] [URL: https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/investing/how-to-day-trade-safely/], one option is to buy bitcoin now and then sell it if and when its value moves higher.

Anything else out there that are touted as improvements (including carbon fiber frames, BB30 bottom brackets, electronic shifting, etc.) are so narrowly focused to the point that they’re only of real use to the professional racer, who make his living getting down the road 2mph faster than anyone else. I have 19 bicycles at home, every one is a steel frame, split 2/3rds-1/3rd between derailleur drivetrains and internally geared hubs. Of the former, the numbers are equally divided between 1980 and before vintage bikes, and 1981–1995 vintage. Which means I’m dealing with one truly vintage bike with a 2x8 drivetrain and a front derailleur that’s operated by a rod shifter between your legs, three “classic ten speeds” with lugged steel frames, a 2x5 drivetrain operated by downtube shifters with friction levers, a 3x5 drivetrain touring bike of about the same vintage utilizing bar end shifters that ratchet but are still friction operated, three 80’s equivalents also with lugged steel frames, but a 2x6 drivetrain operated by indexed downtube levers, and a 1990’s 21-speed with with a lugless steel frame and indexed shifting controlled by brifters. I’m 70 years old, ride daily, 5 mile minimum on steel framed internally geared hub 3-speeds (my commuter bikes), and on weekends do 20–40 mile rides at 14–15mph average daily on the serious road bikes. Of the above, when I’m in “severe performance mode” the briftered bike is the easiest to ride hard - even though it’s just a basic chrome moly frame with low level (Shimano RSX) components, because of the brifters. I can shift easier, faster, and keep better control over the bike when pushing hard. And that’s not the only briftered bike I’ve owned. My closest venture into “state of the art” was an aluminum framed Fuji with carbon fork and rear stays, utilizing 2x9 Shimano Ultegra, early 00’s vintage. When I moved into a downsized house, I sold off a lot of my collection, primarily the modern stuff, and my real love is vintage. I’ve never been tempted with 10, 11, or 12-speed drivetrains, really feeling that for my needs anything more than 8 gears out back is a complete waste of time that won’t get me down the road any faster than what I have now. Electronic (battery powered) shifting? I’ll find it useful the day a team invites me to ride the Tour de France. Carbon fiber? It looks ugly (I really believe that God intended that top tubes are to be parallel to the road) and I don’t trust it’s ability to survive damage. Steel frames I can unbend. And the two seconds per mile I could gain is useless at my age and riding style. Nope, brifters are the last REAL improvement on road bikes. And the next to the last improvement is Look clipless pedals. I’d have killed for them back in the 70’s. Just prior to that is Shimano Indexed Shifting (what I’m using on those 80’s 12-speeds mentioned above), the basic technological breakthrough that made brifters possible. Oh yeah, I still ride sew-ups. For all those decades of improvements in clinchers, going from 27″ to 700c, they still only 95% as good as the cheapest sew-up. And when you’ve been messing with them for 50 years now, it’s easier to change a roadside puncture that way than using clinchers."},{"prompt":"x^{2}+y^{2}=2","completion":"This is a system of equations: [math]begin{cases} x + y = 2 x^2 + y^2 = 2 end{cases}[/math] EDIT: Something felt wrong about how I originally solved this, so here's my correction Let's solve for a variable in the simplest equation: [math]x + y = 2[/math] [math]y = 2 - x[/math] Next, plug that into the other equation: [math]x^2 + (2 - x)^2 = 2[/math] Now, simplify and solve for x: [math]x^2 + (4 - 4x + x^2) = 2[/math] [math]2x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0[/math] [math]2(x^2 - 2x + 1) = 0[/math] [math]2(x - 1)(x - 1) = 0[/math] [math]2(x - 1)^2 = 0[/math] [math]x - 1 = 0[/math] [math]x = 1[/math] Now, plug this back into either equation: [math](1) + y = 2[/math] [math]y = 1[/math]"},{"prompt":"Can you analyze the potential risks and benefits of a company expanding its operations into international markets?","completion":"Expanding operations into international markets can bring both risks and benefits to a company.

While I can provide some insights, it's important to note that I'm an AI language model and not a mental health professional. There are several factors that could contribute to the higher rates of depression in this generation. One significant aspect is the increased awareness and understanding of mental health issues. In the past, mental health problems were often stigmatized or misunderstood, leading to underreporting or misdiagnosis. Today, there is more recognition and acceptance of mental health struggles, which could contribute to higher reported rates. Another factor is the fast-paced and highly connected nature of modern life. With the advent of technology and social media, people are more connected than ever before. However, this constant connectivity can also lead to feelings of isolation, comparison, and information overload, which may contribute to depressive symptoms. Moreover, societal and economic pressures, such as financial instability, academic stress, and the competitive job market, can take a toll on individuals' mental well-being. The current generation faces unique challenges and expectations, which may contribute to increased rates of depression. It's important to remember that depression is a complex condition with multiple contributing factors, and it can affect individuals regardless of their generation.

We had a 12 year old girl present to theatre for a lap appendix - a laparoscopic procedure that some folk call “keyhole surgery”, and often its done to reduce the scar tissue so the girl can wear a bikini later in life without being embarrassed by the scar. Many do it because its less risky to the patient.. whatever.. but the end result is the same, its just that one uses a lot more gear than the other so the theatre setup is different. Anyway, the patient has low markers across the board but pain still nine out of ten and not vomiting…. and no “guarding” reflex where if you go to touch the abdomen, your hand is pushed away.. she is lying on the bed with knees up. The anesthetist is convinced the kid is faking, but the surgeon isn't.. and so we go ahead… As soon as the first incision is made, a slightly yellow-green ooze comes out of her belly… the laparoscopic aspect is abandoned, and this now becomes emergency surgery. She had a ruptured appendix with a bellyful of hot pus, and a now, very worried crew, hoping the bowel was OK and then organising fresh sterile saline to wash out the pus. The anesthetist was shocked… and she just said well. she learnt something today… that the sickest kids dont always look sick.

So there is no way Modi can celebrated Ramadan. The P.M. is busy and can not celebrate every festival with the Army, it would also distract the Army. However he realizes that army men live away from family and need at least one occasion which they can celebrate in style. He picked Diwali as it is a Hindu festival and he is a Hindu himself and Diwali is also the biggest festival of India and appeals to the most number of people. It is not just celebrated by Hindus but by all sections of the society, in a way it is a secular festival in today’s India even as it has Hindu roots. Diwali is also an Indian festival unlike Eid which originated from Arabia and is only connected to India because a section of the Indians follow the same religion. Diwali on the other hand is celebrated by different sections of Indians for different reasons. For my family Diwali is not Lakshmi Puja, it is Kali Puja for us, for some it is the homecoming of Ramachandra after his victory in Lanka, for many it is Lakshmi Puja. Modi does celebrate Muslim festivals with Muslims when ever he has the time."},{"prompt":"w do people who eat only once or twice a day manage to not feel hungry between meals?","completion":"People who eat only once or twice a day without feeling hungry between meals may be able to do so for a few different reasons.

Am I missing something very obvious?","completion":"The North, through Sansa. The story which he would have spun was shown in the episode where he returned to Vale without her. He said that he was attacked and Sansa was captured. Then he would have manipulated Sweetrobin to hand over the armies to him so that he could rescue Sansa from the Boltons. Royce: Last time I saw you, Baelish, you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers. LF: Indeed I was. Royce: And yet not long ago, we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell. LF: On our way to the Fingers, we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men. Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting. It is, of course, easier said than done. LF has no way of knowing that Ramsay would murder his father and if Roose lived, he was far too cunning to face the armies of Vale in an open field. They would withstand the siege in the castle and how would LF defeat them then is anybody’s guess. The show circumvented all of these factors in a neat package with a bow of the dramatic-last-minute-entry of the Vale army to win the day.

More Australians joined ISIS than Americans, despite America having about fifteen times as many people as my country. But we have a lot of data about the kind of people who went over there, which we can use to draw a rough category of the kind of people who were attracted to the Caliphate’s extremist theocracy. Almost all the people who went to join ISIS from Australia, about ninety percent, were born in Australia. This does not include those who have been here since a very young age. They were also almost all from a small handful of suburbs, especially in Western Sydney. This means that the problem is not one of immigrants, because they all grew up here. What this means is that my government, and the government of Western nations facing similar issues, must take responsibility for allowing these terrorists to go overseas. These are our citizens, so we must deal with them. For those that can be prosecuted for war crimes, possibly a significant majority, a system should be set up to return them to Syria and Iraq, where they can be dealt with by the authorities in those countries according to the laws of the land where they carried out these crimes. For the others, they should be prosecuted under whatever terrorist legislation is available, but kept segregated from other prisoners so that they are not in a position to recruit and manipulate people in jail for other, far less serious crimes. Most of all, we must put pressure on Turkey, as that country openly aided and abetted the recruitment and travel plans of these terrorists, and in some cases armed and equipped them. With ISIS being defeated, Turkey has re-equipped, retrained, and rearmed them, and is using them as a proxy force to ethnically cleanse the north-west of Syria of Christians, Kurds, Yazidis, Assyrians, and other groups, with many of these ex-ISIS fighters being foreign fighters even now. In order to stop the flow of terrorists from Western countries into the region, we have to target the state doing the most to help them."},{"prompt":"What is the best ayurvedic medicine for diabetes?","completion":"[LINKED_TEXT: Madhunashini Jamun Plus Diab Care PowderMadhunashini Jamun Plus Diab Care Powder is a unique blend of the best Ayurvedic Herbs to improve your metabolism and inturn help control your Blood Sugar Levels.

Let’s start with some basics: Most cosmologists do, in fact, believe the universe is infinite. This is based on a number of factors but one is a logical extension of fundamental principles of physics. It goes like this: The Cosmological Principle is derived from the Copernican principle and it implies that the entire Universe is isotropic and homogeneous. Isotropy means the Universe looks the same to all observers and the Universe looks the same in all directions as viewed by any particular observer. Homogeneous means that the average density of matter is about the same in all places in the Universe and the Universe is fairly smooth on large scales. Now imagine that you (Observer A) are on Earth and look out and see the universe as we now see it. We can see out to about 13 billion light years (BLYs) from Earth. Let us suppose you are looking in the direction of “Y”. Now imagine a second observer (B) that is 10 BLYs away in direction “Y”. He also is looking in direction “Y” - i.e. the opposite direction from Earth. According to the Cosmological Principle, he will see exactly what observer A sees. The universe he sees is also isotropic and homogeneous. Now imagine another observer (C) that is 10 BLYs away from B in direction Y. According to the Cosmological Principle, C will also see exactly what observer A and B sees. The universe he sees is also isotropic and homogeneous. Since each observer, by definition, sees a universe that is isotropic and homogeneous, if you keep moving in the same direction and adding more and more observers, you never come to an “end” of the universe….meaning that the universe is infinite. Realize how far infinity is. There is no end….ever. If you traveled at light speed for trillions of years, you still would not be halfway. An infinite universe simply never ends. Now let’s look at the Earth. Everything on earth is made up of atoms. Lots of them. Beyond our ability to count them, BUT - it is a finite number. It has an end to it. It is theoretically possible to count all of them. Today, those atoms are arranged in a specific manner to give us the reality we see around us. Suppose you wanted to rearrange those atoms. How many different ways could they be rearranged? The number would be stunningly large. It would, however, be a finite number but very large. It is not an infinite number. Think about it like this. You have three boxes A, B, and C. You can arrange them in any manner possible - ABC, BCA, CAB, ACB, BAC, CBA. There are only 6 possible arrangements of a set of 3 boxes. If I had two sets of 3 boxes, there would still be only 6 possible arrangements of each set of 3 boxes. Even if I had a trillion set of 3 boxes, there is still only 6 possible arrangements of each set of 3 boxes. It turns out that the different arrangements of atoms that makes up matter is like this. Even if you have an infinite amount of atoms, there is still only a finite number of ways that the atoms can be arranged. Scientists estimate there are at least 9 people in Earth that look exactly like you. That is because there are just so many different ways that different eyes, noses, mouth, etc can be arranged to make a face. In a world of 7 billion people, 9 others have the same face as you. In fact, scientists estimate that there are 10^80 (10 followed by 80 zeros) number of atoms in the whole observable universe. The number of permutations and combinations of this number is the factoral of 10^80. To give you an idea of how big that is . . .10^3 (1000) factorial has 2,568 digits. The number of zeros at the end is 249. It is very large but it is not an infinite number. If you traveled away from earth, into infinite space, you would pass a lot of planets and stars. If you traveled far enough (a really long distance), you would eventually see every possible arrangement of every possible atom that makes up every planet and star. Since space in infinite, there still would be a lot of space in front of you and if you traveled far enough (a really, really long distance), you would eventually see a planet that looked very similar to earth but perhaps with a slightly different arrangement of its atoms. You would have traveled a long distance but space is infinite so if you could still continue to travel far enough (a really, really, really long distance), you would eventually come across another planet that looked like earth with yet another slightly different arrangement of all of its atoms. Since space is infinite, this would never end. Infinite space is so large that it is much larger than all the possible combinations of all of the possible rearrangements of all of the atoms on earth. In fact, out there right now, are trillions of planets that are exactly like earth but are slightly different in every way that is possible….and then there would also be exact duplicates. If you say this cannot be - that that would take too many planets…then you are putting a limit on infinity and by definition, that is not possible. Space is either infinite and all this is possible or it is not infinite. If you say it is not infinite then the Cosmological Principle and the Copernican principle are invalid which would invalidate all of our known science about the universe and cosmology. You can’t have it both ways. The truth is, we don’t really know for sure if the universe is infinite or not. We have no way of confirming that one way or the other. Just as we have no idea what existed before the big bang or what, if anything, exists “outside” of our visible universe, i.e., multiverses?. We have, however, adapted certain definitions that may or may not prove to be limitations to our thinking. However, those same definitions contribute to some interesting extrapolations. Personally, I think just beyond what we can see - out past 14 million light years away from us, it is all filed with blue Jello. Ha Ha, you laugh but prove me wrong.

The next thing my friend does was really not what we expected as he was a studious and a shy guy by nature and rarely did he reciprocate. Fellow passengers watching this joined in with the man and not did they request but actually ordered to vacate the place, as we all were young and could not understand the situation tried to respond in a similar manner and we backed our friend stating we would not vacate the place as we got the seats first. Quickly the whole compartment turned against us and few started to abuse so we had to take a step back and not only did we have to vacate one place but all the six. We didn't understand what had we done but we saw something unusual as all the people occupying the seats got up and vacated the place for the once standing. Later few stations ahead there was a group of men who explained what had happend to us. He stated that it is an unwritten rule in local trains of Mumbai that once the train completes an hour all those who are siting need to vacate their places for the once who are standing as it is more than 2 hours journey till Lonavala and people work for more than 8 hours a day and travel for more than 4 hours a day.

I guess a 1:6 teacher to student ratio is pretty good, but are the teachers better at teaching or is it just something that the affluent can brag about?","completion":"The main advantage of the non public schools is that, on balance the parent/s are more engaged in the outcome. One of the most notable facts about educational outcome is not so much the progress (or lack thereof) made from Sept til May as measured by the standardized tests. It is the amount of RETENTION (or lack thereof) between May and Sept. Almost ALL sudents show some loss of skills and knowledge over the Summer, but those with more engaged parents and more structure REGRESS LESS and RETAIN MORE over the Summer break than those that get less attention and structure. Every year students start the school year on an uneven basis with some starting each year having lost less ground in skills and knowledge and some more. The first weeks of every school year recap and recover the material of the previous year then the new material is introduced. Those that LOSE LESS (and RETAIN MORE) over the Summer struggle less with the new material and have more classroom success, get more positive attention and have less stress. As each school year proceeds some students have to work harder to keep up and school is less enjoyable and more like work with less enjoyment of achievement and as the years continues the students realize that some others are ahead while they are behind. This process repeats every school year. By the time a student reaches 7th or 8th grade they have become accustomed to either succeeding and enjoying learning at school or viewing school as an increasingly difficult place to be. As the curriculum advances in High School many of those that have fallen the furthest behind start to lose interest and disengage, attendance starts to fall and the distractions of puberty get in the way of school success Private schools tend to have a student body more likely to have access to activities and programs over the Summer that reduce REGRESSION and increase RETENTION. Things like day camps and church camps and programs and library Summer reading and book clubs and day trips to museums and parks all serve to engage kids minds and reinforce skills they picked up during the school year. Private schools are much more orderly environments than public schools and students report much less stress and fear than public schools and private school teachers report much less student disruption than public school educators. But even public school students progress from Sept to May. Even students in the most under resourced and most disorderly of public schools show adedemic progress over the school year. So there is proof that learning is happening and students can and do progress even in the “worst” public schools. The difference in student achievement over time appears to be what happens from May til Sept. Or, what does not happen."},{"prompt":"What do you think of the 3/21/22 CBC report that the NDP has agreed to keep Trudeau's Liberal Party in power until 2025?","completion":"I’m fine with it. As others have pointed out, the NDP will give the Liberals stability as well as the progressive nudge they need. And it’s high time the parties worked together. I hated it when the NDP followed the Conservative lead of making snide comments about Trudeau’s hair instead of focusing on what they could offer. Many Canadians are ABC voters like me, especially since the Conservative Party has chosen to follow the GQP down the rabbit hole of power for power’s sake and responsible governance be damned. If Jagmeet Singh and/or a couple of his shadow cabinet can score some real cabinet positions out of it, it would give them better leverage in future elections."},{"prompt":"w would you describe each Stray Kids member in one word?","completion":"—深い i’ll try to make this as accurate as possible, but my vocabulary is very limited. i think. bangchan - fragile ; vulnerable 🌼 although chan is one of the strongest leaders out there, and of course the most caring, i think that’s what makes him fragile and/or vulnerable. the fact that he has to hold up all of skz, has to deal with all the haters and every other thing can be detrimental to his self esteem. chan deals with a lot, but still manages to smile. that’s admirable. a song i’d use to describe him would probably be anymore by somi. lee know - inexplicable ; extroverted 🌼 sometimes i feel like minho’s persona of being “savage” might actually be forced. minho’s a bit confusing to me, because at one point he may be “inexplicable” (someone who’s more quiet and mysterious (?) - or he may be extroverted and start taking ownership of han’s butt. but who knows? a song i’d use to describe him would probably be fever by enhyphen. changbin - strong ; attentive 🌼 changbin is a beautiful person. he get’s a lot of hate though, most of the time it’s for the way he looks. yet he stays strong and like bangchan, is able to put on a smile which seems very real. he’s also really attentive, he pays close attention to things, kinda like seungmin. he listen’s very well. a song i’d use to describe him is gogobebe by mamamoo. hyunjin - persistent ; people pleaser 🌼 hyunjin is an extremely hard worker, and he puts a lot of effort into things. i haven’t really seen much of an emotional side from him, except maybe that time in 2019. but when he did that, it kinda proves that he will work for stays to stay. he’s someone who will work to reach his goal. a song i’d use to describe him is last waltz by twice. felix - secretive ; positive 🌼 felix is always smiling and kind of just radiates this positive vibe. his smile is so beautiful and he’s just so fluffy and cute. but sometimes i feel like he may be hiding something. is that just me? sometimes i feel like he’s hiding something or how he really feels for the sake of stays, but…there’s nothing really wrong with that. a song i’d use to describe him is oh my god by gi-dle. jisung - adorable ; sensitive 0R strong 🌼 okay, but does anyone else think that han is one of the cutest in stray kids? his cheeks are so adorable and unique :DdDdDd. anyway, we all know about han’s anxiety attacks. suffering from anxiety can be a really big thing, and han is still going strong and thriving. a song i’d use to describe him is icon by twice.

(>:)) jeongin - thoughtful ; mature 🌼 even as a trainee, jeongin was respectful, calm, and mature. he wasn’t even an adult yet. he’s also very respectful towards people, and i think that he cares for his members a lot. although he doesn’t show it, i think that if something happened to one of the members he would be the first one to react. a song i’d use to describe him would probably be shoot by itzy. —literally, just 呼吸."},{"prompt":"f you are a medical worker, have you ever experienced a patient full out faking?","completion":"After nearly 30 years in medicine, I’ve seen my share. The most memorable was when I was a paramedic and I received call for a person having seizures. The person had a history of them, but the presentation didn’t add up. The movements just didn’t look like a typical seizure, and the postictal (the state of consciousness just after a seizure) state wasn’t right either. Nevertheless, I’d seen too many suspected fakers turn out to be in serious trouble, so I proceeded as though it was real and loaded the patient up for transport. En route to the hospital, the patient “seized” out of the restraints. I waited for the activity to stop, and leaned over to re-apply the restraints. At that moment, the patient experienced another “seizure,” and kicked me, breaking my clavicle.

Why don't the UK people be less racist and welcome Meghan Markle?","completion":"What the F do you know about the UK sugar?"},{"prompt":"w would you rank all of the MCU film villains, including Mysterio?","completion":"Spoilers may be included for whatever the latest MCU movie is. I’ll be ranking them based on two things: development/interest and performance. That said, let’s get started. Dreykov: I can not believe that they actually managed to make a more bland, basic, boring villain that Blonsky. I had to look him up because I couldn’t even remember what his name is. He might be the most basic, mustache twirly, evil for the sake of being evil villain I have ever seen. Also the twist with Taskmaster was garbage and I saw it coming a mile away. I’m not even including Taskmaster on this list because there wasn’t enough there to even really consider her a character. Kro I take back what I said, I can’t believe they managed to make two villains worse than Blonsky, and in the same year no less. The only reason I’m including Kro is complain honestly, he doesn’t have much more character to him than Taskmaster. Even his death was dumb. It feels like they were shooting the finale and realized that they hadn’t dealt with him yet so they had to find a way to kill him off. And building him up as so strong (I mean he killed Gilgamesh) and then to kill him off with two moves was so stupid. The only decent thing to come out of him was giving Thena some motivation. Emil Blonsky/Abomination I feel like it’s because a lot of people completely forget that The Incredible Hulk is in the MCU, myself included. And its villain is no different. The most I can usually recall about Abomination is that he’s basically an uglier Hulk and I flashback to that stomach wrenching shot of Blonsky pretty much turning into a ragdoll: Malekith So, I like this movie. I don’t really mind Malekith. We’re given his backstory, it “makes sense.” It is cliche, but still. I put most of the onus of his “failure” on the writers. I know a lot of people would say that it’s bad acting but I think it’s… bearable. I understand that Christopher Eccelston is supposed to be a really good actor(I can’t testify to this I haven’t seen much with him) and I think a lot of this dislike for this performance comes from his background as a stage actor. There’s a pretty big difference between the theatricality of theater characters and the more subtle sides of a movie or tv character. This feels like a very theatrical and over the top character and it feels rather out of place in this movie.(Also, among the MCU villains(many of which have actually been much better than people will admit), a good villain would still rank on the lower end of the scale) Anyways, that’s enough defending Malekith. Erik Stevens/Killmonger Killmonger is garbage. The only reason he’s even this high is because Michael B. Jordan gave a killer performance. Everything else about him is trash. Ego Man this pains me because I really like Kurt Russel and I feel like he gave a really solid performance here. But part of what makes a villain good is that we can relate to them, that we can understand their goals and motivations. We just really don’t have that with Ego. Sonny Burch Again, we have something that pains me. I loved Walton Goggins’s performance here, it was one of the highlights of the movie for me. I just didn’t find his character to be very interesting. Ivan Vanko/Whiplash He was actually a pretty interesting villain. And Mickey Rourke gave a… uh… an interesting performance. I wouldn’t say it was bad, just… well… very different. I feel like where this went wrong is with the people behind the scene trying to put too much in the movie and not ironing it all out. Ava Starr/Ghost I don’t know what it is about Ava Starr, but I’m just not a huge fan of her. Her backstory was fine, and Hannah John-Kamen gave a fine performance. I just didn’t find her very… well… anything. Darren Cross/Yellowjacket Darren Cross isn’t necessarily a bad character. He’s well established and Corey Stoll gives a really enjoyable performance. But he’s literally a carbon-copy of Stane. Johann Schmidt/Red Skull So, most people would probably rank Schmidt lower than I have, but I really enjoyed him. He did exactly what he was supposed to, to highlight why Erskine chose Steve instead of say, Hodge, who likely could’ve become another Schmidt. Also, I love Hugo Weaving and I think he gave a really good performance. Ronan So, there’s really one main reason that I like Ronan. I’m not considering Lee Pace’s performance because while I did enjoy it, it didn’t have much of an influence on my enjoyment of the character. The main reason that I like Ronan is that he really feels like Malekith done right. He’s got a vendetta, he even wants to use an Infinity Stone to settle said vendetta. But beyond that, they’re both rather dry and over-the-top dramatic. Where Ronan succeeds and Malekith fails is in who they’re being villains for. Ronan is a villain for the Guardians of the Galaxy. They’re goofy and irreverent, so Ronan’s dry theatricality contrasts very well with them. On the other hand, Malekith is there with the version of Thor that feels almost Shakespearean(insert Tony’s line from the first Avengers movie), and they seem to clash. Ronan is Malekith done right. Justin Hammer So yeah, a lot of people really don’t like Justin Hammer. Honestly one of the best things about him is that he’s so unlikable. He’s really only this high because of Sam Rockwell giving a hilariously great performance. Pretty much any time he was on screen, I was laughing. Obadiah Stane/Iron Monger Stane is a great character. We understand his motivations. Is he the stereotypical greedy businessman villain? Absolutely, but like how Red Skull was the perfect villain for Captain America, Stane is the perfect counterpart to Tony. They’re two sides of the same coin. Yon-Rogg My enjoyment of Yon-Rogg comes primarily from the twist in his movie. We start out thinking he’s on the hero’s side. After all, he’s played by Jude Law, the hero’s hero, I mean he played young Dumbledore. And the character who we think is the villain is played by Ben Mendlesohn who is probably best known for playing great villains. Jude Law plays a great “villain trying to play the hero,” which was one of the best performances of the movie (even if that’s not a very high bar). The Grandmaster Let’s be honest, the main reason everyone loves the Grandmaster is because of Jeff Goldblum’s performance. He’s hilarious and it feels like he’s having a great time in this role. Hela Hela is very understandable villain. She’s a product of more of Odin’s A+ parenting. She had bigger ambitions than Odin and he couldn’t control her. So what does he do? He locks her up. For so long in fact, that Thor(and apparently no one else currently alive in Asgard) didn’t know about her. It’s understandable that after being imprisoned that she’d be pretty mad. And Cate Blanchett brings all of this to life expertly in a cold, menacing way. Trevor Slattery/The Mandarin Oh yeah, it’s time for quite the unpopular opinion. Contrary to almost everyone else on the internet, I thoroughly enjoyed Iron Man 3’s version of the Mandarin. He was terrifying when he was on camera and the exact opposite behind the scenes and I loved the twist. And Ben Kingsley played both the Mandarin side and the Trevor Slattery side wonderfully. Edit: And now he’s back in Shang-Chi and just as great as ever. Aldrich Killian I see Killian as the perfect example of almost what Tony’s sort of thing is, “you create your biggest enemies.” Tony created this villain without realizing it and it came back to bite him. It exemplifies that your past can come back to bite you even if you’ve changed. Thanos Thanos takes the “noble motives with extreme methods” to new… well… extremes. We can understand his motivations but disagree with his methods. Josh Brolin also gives an excellent performance. Winter Soldier I will say that this is one character who gets by a lot on pure atmosphere and menace. Everything about him from the way he fights to the way he walks makes him feel like a terrifying unstoppable force. Also he’s got one of the best themes in the MCU. Quentin Beck/Mysterio Further showing Tony’s thing about creating enemies, they can even come back after you’re gone. And he’s a very relatable and understandable villain. He’s just a disgruntled employee who is( understandably) angry at Tony. Xu Wenwu/The Real Mandarin I thoroughly enjoyed Shang-Chi and Wenwu was a big part of that. He was great villain and his relationship with Shang-Chi and Xialing is what really made him great. And Tony Leung perfectly sold both the sympathy and the menace of his character. I especially love the scene in the picture above. Kaecilius Kaecilius is yet another villain who’s understandable. He’s mad at the Ancient One for her hypocrisy. In the end, he’s not actually wrong in that anger, he just takes it way to the extreme. I feel like there’s more to my liking of him than just having understandable anger, but I can’t really think of much else to it. Alexander Pierce Here we have another villain that could be absolutely right. I’m not a parent, so I can’t even come close to being able to imagine going through what he describes with the terrorists taking prisoners, one of which was his daughter. His wanting to be more proactive in dealing with threats is completely understandable for someone who has been through that. But, he falls where all relatable villains fall. He takes it way too far. He wants too handle said threats before they have the chance to be a threat. He was the perfect way to introduce Cap to the new morally gray world. He was the perfect challenge to Cap’s “the punishment comes after the crime mindset.” And Robert Redford sells us on Pierce’s ideology with absolute conviction. Adian Toomes/Vulture Toomes is a great villain in the same way that Scott is a great hero. At the end of the day, he’s a family man. They would do anything for their families. That’s like the pinnacle of sympathetic villainhood. Loki The classic over-shadowed younger brother. We understand exactly where he comes from and he got a wonderful redemption arc and now he’s not a villain anymore. Ultron Another one that gets a bit of hate. I honestly don’t get why everyone hates him so much. He was the perfect villain for them at the time and we actually see his idea that the Avengers cause destruction carried on in Civil War. And he’s the literal case of Tony’s creating your own enemies thing. And James Spader is perfect for the role. Helmut Zemo Zemo just might be the smartest villain yet. He knows he can’t beat the Avengers himself. And I don’t think I need to mention his extremely understandable motives. All around just a great villain. Of all the MCU villains that have survived their respective movies, I’m definitely the most excited to see him return. Edit: Now he’s back and it was great. I had some issues with Falcon and the Winter Soldier, but he was not one of them. They used him perfectly."},{"prompt":"w do I cut a halfcircle in wood?

However, of late the proportion of actually thought-provoking questions has been taking a precipitous decline, and I can only surmise that this is an unintended side effect of the Partner Program. I don’t want to do someone’s middle school math homework for them. I can very easily name a song title or even construct an entire paragraph without using the letter ‘A’, but have no interest in doing so. I am happy to answer one question about the relative merits of Justin Bieber and the Beatles, but seeing 100 such questions becomes incredibly tedious. And in general, if a question is something that the submitter could simply have answered with 20 seconds on Google, I feel it is superfluous on Quora.

Even the leadership after independence did not have right values, instead of devoloping a society with character they allowed nepotism, shotcuts to prosper in power.

In the case of the RSA asymmetric key algorithm, encryption is normally faster than decryption because one of the reasons probably the most popular community key exponent of 65537 has been chosen is the fact that it has only two 1 bits which speeds the calculation. Considering that the personal key exponent is computed within the secret, it willn’t have the residential property of a small number of 1 bits."},{"prompt":"Can you tame an older feral cat?","completion":"Yes, if it WANTS to be tamed… Some realize life is sooooooooo much sweeter with humans providing shelter, warmth, and food."},{"prompt":"Why is the microwave oven harmful to food?","completion":"The use of microwave ovens to cook food has been a major source of debate for decades. While some people believe that microwaving food is dangerous and can cause health problems, others believe that microwaves are a safe and convenient way to quickly prepare meals. While both sides can agree that microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, there is no scientific evidence that food prepared in a microwave oven is bad for your health. To understand the potential health risks associated with microwaving food, it is important to understand how microwaves work. Microwave ovens use high frequency radio waves to heat food. These waves penetrate food and cause the water molecules in it to vibrate, generating heat and cooking the food. Microwave ovens are designed to contain these waves, and the radiation emitted from them is non-ionizing, meaning it does not have enough energy to cause chemical changes in the food or the environment. One of the most common concerns about microwaving food is that it may cause the food to become toxic. However, there is no evidence that microwaving food causes it to become toxic. In fact, research has shown that microwaving can actually help to preserve the nutrients in food. For example, a study conducted by the Harvard School of Public Health found that microwaving broccoli preserved 97 percent of its vitamin C content. Another concern is that microwaving food can cause the release of harmful substances, such as BPA, phthalates, and dioxins. However, these are not released from microwaving food. In fact, research has shown that the levels of these substances are much lower in microwaved food than in food cooked using traditional methods. There is also a concern that microwaving food can cause it to become “radioactive”. However, this is not the case. While microwaving can cause the food to become slightly radioactive, the levels are so low that they pose no health risks. Finally, some people believe that microwaves can cause cancer, but this is also not the case. While there is some evidence that exposure to high levels of non-ionizing radiation can increase the risk of cancer, the levels of radiation emitted from microwave ovens are too low to cause any harm. Overall, there is no evidence that food cooked in a microwave oven is bad for your health. While microwaving food does not provide the same nutritional value as traditional cooking methods, it is safe and can help to preserve the nutrients in food. Therefore, microwaving food can be a convenient and efficient way to quickly prepare meals. Please support my work by upvoting this article.

Self affirmation, positive mantras, buying yourself little treats, learning to say “no” to people, listing your good qualities, asking friends what makes them like you, learning to accept compliments, are a few things to do. You were trained not to love or respect yourself. Doing loving and respectful things for yourself will habituate you to them and you will eventually believe you deserve good things ."},{"prompt":"w are leprechauns and fourleaf clovers related?","completion":"Honestly? It comes from the two being symbols of Ireland (separately). Then used together as symbolS of Ireland ( like on a packet of lucky charms). The two have separate history’s - the four leaf clover being the “extra leaf” more than the reveared three leaf shamrock ( which isn’t a clover) of Irish trinity ( clovers also generally have three leaves, but it’s rare to find one that has more). so it a bit an annomoly and a “bit more” therefore special. ( the first mention of it as a luck charm was in the 1600’s so it’s connection to st Patrick May have been an added story later). Some folk traditions assign a different attribute to each leaf of a clover. The first leaf represents hope, the second stands for faith, the third is for love and the fourth leaf brings luck to the finder. A fifth leaf represents money, but there is no meaning as yet for the sixth leaf and above. Some reports claim six to be fame and seven to be longevity, though the notions' origination is unknown. Others say that four-leaf clovers granted the power to see Faires. the leprechaun comes from the old folk tales and fairy beliefs of that land. the leprechaun being a more prominent than many other types of fairy’s because it is said that he was once the sun god lugh who was worshiped in Ireland during its pagan times, but started loosing power as Christianity arrived, becoming nothing more than a fairy ( however, belief in these fairy’s were extremely strong, even up to the early 20th century - you should read into that if your interested). So he’s a powerful symbol of the past and mischievous character and delights in being so, Which suits the Irish temperament and adds to the stereotype, so it’s both a blessing and a curse. He’s also a great figure for storytelling, which is beloved pastime in Ireland (also known as bardic traditions- which is supposedly Druidic in origin). First mention of a leprechaun was in the medieval times. The first guy there is talking a lot of ultra religious nonesense and his bigotry is showing. Not only that, but he’s spouting myth and legend mixed in with complete inaccuracies ( st Patrick and the pagans actually liked each other in the end by all accounts, before the Roman church came over to Ireland - before st Patrick, - many pagan chieftains gave land for churchEs to be built - such as queen Macha of Armagh, so Christ was already an accepted religious figure by then… this suggests that Rome took the Irish population by force rather than gentle conversation / persuasion ). Also st Patrick never killed a leprechaun - the belief of the pagans were gods, not fairy’s. Belief in fairy’s and gods seperated by at least a good few hundered years apart. Other symbols of Ireland are never really used as much, such as the triple spiral, or much of the Animanistic Celtic knotwok found in the book of Kells, the Iron Age torques, or the pin of Tara, all of which are well known and symbolic, but never used as much seeing as they don’t stereotype the Irish as much as the other two and show a much more enlightened population. The two are separate symbols in general but separated by over 1000 years. linked by the belief in fairy’s in Ireland and used by those wanting to show simple general symbols in Ireland that a lot of people can understand."},{"prompt":"w do I get my neighbor to accept the survey staking of our shared property line that is in dispute? He won’t trust it because I paid for it and he thinks the surveyors are wrong.","completion":"Walk over to your neighbor's house. Kindly have a conversation with them about establishing accurate property lines so both of you or any future neighbors can be friendly. Ask that each of you pick 5–10 surveyors, and both agree on one and split the cost. True story. Surveyors make mistakes. About 20 years ago, my wife and I wanted a fence put up in our backyard. We hired a local surveyor. He staked the lines, put up a fence, and we were sued a couple of months later for trespassing and property damage. If I remember correctly, 25,000. We were young, and that was big money to us back then. We called the surveyor. He had a call with the neighbor's surveyor and realized he had made an error. He wrote us an agreement to pay for all damages and move the fence. And here is where it got interesting. He died a week later, and his wife told us to piss off. She wanted to sell the business and move on. So we sued them to stall a sale until she honored her husband's wishes. 2 years later, a settlement was reached between all parties, and we moved on. Our great relationship with our neighbors was never repaired. It cost us about 2500 in the end out of pocket, but the wife made good on moving the fence and repairing the damage to the neighbor's yard. She refused to cover attorney fees.

Here are some of the best ways to invest money: 1. Stock market: Investing in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) allows you to become a partial owner of companies. Research and choose companies with strong fundamentals and growth potential. It's essential to diversify your portfolio to spread the risk. 2. Bonds: Bonds are fixed-income securities where you lend money to governments, municipalities, or corporations in exchange for regular interest payments and the return of the principal at maturity. They are generally considered less risky than stocks. 3. Mutual funds: These are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a diversified portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other assets. They are managed by professionals and offer diversification and convenience. 4. Real estate: Investing in real estate can be done through buying properties for rental income or investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs). REITs are companies that own and manage income-generating properties, providing a way to invest in real estate without directly owning properties. 5. Index funds: These funds track a specific market index (e.g., S&P 500) and aim to replicate its performance. They offer broad market exposure, diversification, and typically have lower fees compared to actively managed funds. 6. Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs): Similar to mutual funds, ETFs pool investors' money and invest in a diversified portfolio of assets. However, they trade on stock exchanges like individual stocks, providing flexibility and liquidity. 7. Diversification: Spreading your investments across different asset classes (stocks, bonds, real estate, etc.) and geographies can help reduce risk. Diversification allows you to potentially benefit from different market conditions. 8. Alternative Investment: There are multiple alternative investment options available nowadays that can provide opportunities for potentially higher returns compared to traditional investments. Alternative investments encompass a wide range of assets beyond stocks and bonds, such as real estate, bonds, commodities and venture capital. Alternative investments are known for their potential to deliver attractive returns, but they also come with increased risks and complexities. These investments often have different risk-return profiles and may be less regulated than traditional investments. It's important to thoroughly research and understand the specific characteristics and risks associated with each alternative investment option before committing funds. One significant advantage of alternative investments is their ability to diversify a portfolio. By including assets that have low correlation with traditional investments, such as stocks and bonds, investors can potentially reduce overall portfolio volatility and enhance returns. However, it's crucial to strike a balance between risk and reward and allocate an appropriate portion of the portfolio to alternative investments based on individual goals and risk tolerance. In summary, alternative investments can offer the potential for higher returns compared to traditional investments, but they also carry increased risks. Diversification and thorough research are essential when incorporating alternative investments into a portfolio. Seeking professional advice can help navigate the intricacies of alternative investments and ensure alignment with your investment objectives. Make sure to choose the authentic alternative investment platforms like as jiraaf who provide four types of investment such as corporate bonds, venture debt, invoice discounting and asset backed leasing.

It is responsible for the red colour of red blood cells or blood. It helps red blood cells transport oxygen from lungs to body through arteries. It also transports carbon dioxide (CO2) from around the body back to lungs through veins. About 70 percent of your body's iron is found bonded to haemoglobin. When iron intake is chronically low, stores can become depleted, decreasing haemoglobin levels. When iron stores are exhausted, the condition is called iron depletion and produces iron deficiency Anaemia. For men, Hb levels below 13 g/dL are considered low. For women, Hb levels below 12 g/dL are considered low if not pregnant.Abnormally high or low Hb can cause symptoms like exhaustion, dizziness, or shortness of breath."},{"prompt":"Was there ever programming being done in machine code?","completion":"Sure.

You have a protective/restraining order against you and I am sure you understand what that means - it is a court order signed by a judge forbidding you from having any contact of any type for any reason with the named person. You recognise in your OP that this is in “direct violation” - and you intend to make this direct violation at the wedding in the speech that somehow you think you are entitled to make on the basis presumably of being the father of the bride. You do realise you can be arrested just for breaching this court order right? But you are intending to do it in front of loads of witnesses, at a wedding, probably with video cameras present too. Were you even invited to the wedding? No. Father you may be, but take the absence of that invite as a pretty big clue that you are not welcome. As for your apology speech, well-rehearsed or not, expect massive embarrassment, you being strong armed or side-lined by any number of “ushers” “groomsmen” and the like, and floods of tears and/or anger from your daughter. You can also also expect police to arrive perhaps before you even finish your speech. You do understand that your daughter didn’t get this court order against her own father, just coz she was bored one Wednesday afternoon, or had some minor spat with you? If you absolutely think you must do something, and I am telling you now that it’s a bad idea, then after a really good think about it all from your daughters point of view, then send an anonymous gift 1 month after the wedding and if you absolutely must then a letter with your speech in it 3 months later.

I went to town buying them gifts. I did not buy terribly lavish gifts as they were extremely careful with money (wealthy, but frugal in the extreme) and would have considered that to be vulgar and ostentatious. Rather, I thought about what I knew each person would truly be delighted to receive. In addition to my ex-husband’s parents, his aunt was also going to be with us. From New Zealand, she had just moved to a very prestigious British university as a visiting lecturer for a year, and she was greatly looking forward to her first British Christmas, seemingly. After lunch, we sat down to open the gifts. I had bought separate gifts for each person from not only me, but from my husband so we had placed quite a number of gifts under the tree. His parents had bought for us as a couple, however, and so had his aunt. Two small parcels awaited us. I opened the gift from his parents first. It was a small, telescopic umbrella. I suspected it was not new, but more than gently used. It rains a lot in England so I determined that it was, at least, practical and was fulsome in my thanks. The next parcel was tiny. I wondered if perhaps it might be a small piece of jewellery or a traditional trinket from New Zealand? No- it was a stainless steel tea spoon from Woolworths. Again- it looked less than new and less than pristine. A tea spoon. One tea spoon. I am still shaking my head about that one."},{"prompt":"What are the best ways to invest money?","completion":"1.

For a scholarly discussion of the archaeological evidence of the Old Testament, see On the Reliability of the Old Testament by K. A. Kitchen (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 2003). The Bible is not the only place that we find a flood story. The Sumerian Deluge story, dated to the 3rd millennium B.C., with its Sumerian counterpart of the biblical Noah (Ziusudra), and the Akkadian Gilgamesh Epic, dated to the end of the 3rd millennium or beginning of the 2nd millennium B.C., both have flood stories with similar details (though others very different) of the events of the flood. The Akkadian version is found in old Assyrian and old Babylonian versions. Three separate, VERY ancient flood narratives claiming to be historical accounts would seem to suggest, from a purely historical standpoint, that the flood actually happened, though some of the details were remembered differently. Since we learn from the account in the Bible that the long life spans plummeted immediately after the flood and tapered off, it is not surprising that the Sumerian Deluge story says that after the flood, Ziusudra (aka Noah) prostrated himself before his gods and was given “life like a god.” Lines 259 and 260 of the Sumerian Deluge story address \\"Ziusudra the king\\" as \\"the preserver of the seed of mankind.\\" Those who argue for a local flood, do not take it from any of the ancient texts. Their bias is clear here. See also line 157, \\"a flood . . . to destroy the seed of mankind.\\" You can read the Sumerian and Akkadian accounts in Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament (3rd edition w/supplement) edited by James Pritchard (New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1978), pp. 42-44 and 72-98. There are two other important ancient accounts or mentions of the flood: (1) The Atrahasis Epic (with Atrahasis [aka Noah] as the hero of a global Flood, a Flood sent because of man's wickedness) and (2) the Sumerian King List. The Sumerian King List is significant, because it lists kings who lived before \\"the Flood swept over the earth,\\" and kings who lived after the Flood (Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts Related to the Old Testament, pp. 104-106 and 265, respectively). The point of sharing all of these accounts is that they evidence a variety of very ancient recollections of a global flood. Floods in the Euphrates River happened from time to time and would not warrant extraordinary accounts like these. The accounts clearly describe some monumental event that happened in human history, and it was recorded by different, very ancient people groups. This is evidence that should not be ignored."},{"prompt":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?","completion":"What rules are to be followed in order to do intraday trading?

It doesn’t and this is a minor problem. Not a large problem as there aren’t a lot of people who just go to the doctor for company. You might argue that these people have a mental issue. in which case isn’t the doctor the right place to be? In Canada there is a limit to how many patients a doctor can bill the government for so doctors aren’t running up huge bills seeing patients that have no problems. Instituting user fees would mean that many people who need treatment will not get it. So it is better to have a few who do not need treatment get seen than have one person who really needs treatment not get it. It is a different world view up here.

The Romans would call the area where the nations they controlled were the imperium Romanum, or the Roman military power, i.e. the area where this military power had influence. (Imperator means “wielder of the military power.”) So you had Roma, then Italia, then the imperium Romanum, which was an informal name, much the way Mare Nostrum was the Mediterranean Sea, but really just a description of the sea rather than an official name. Imperium turned into empire as we know it, so we call it the Roman Empire; we then call the Byzantine Empire such not because they named it that way but because historians did so as to distinguish it from the Roman Empire as it had been. Constantine moved the capital from Roma to Nova Roma, then changed the name to Constantinapolis. By the way, compare this to the British Empire. It was not called London, of course, and the whole area was not called Britain. The empire part of the name is the same sort of description—wherever the military influence of Britain holds.

It has many potential applications and is already being used in areas such as healthcare, finance, and manufacturing.Quantum Computing: Quantum computing is a type of computing that uses quantum-mechanical phenomena to perform operations on data. It has the potential to solve problems that are currently impossible for classical computers to solve, such as breaking encryption codes.Space Exploration Technologies: Technologies related to space exploration, such as the development of reusable rockets and spacecraft, are some of the most advanced ever invented.

How can you simultaneously retain possession of Universalism heresy while also teaching the exact opposite in Vatican II and China?","completion":"What no one knows is that due to the fact that few, if anybody, knows the Catholic Church's history and function, nor can anyone fathom the Mind of the Almighty, so an amazing variety of human events are free to occur. Our Lady of Lasalette arrived in September of 1846 with Her burying Her Face in Her Hands and wailing. She had been pleading and begging the Holy Trinity for mercy because of our ancestors’ Sins. What “sins,” you ask? Oh, humongous things like (1) working on the Sabbath, a sin the Curé of Ars, a Doctor of the Church, Saint John Vianney said was like men carting their souls to HELL; (2) cursing and using the Holy Name of Jesus to do so; (3) going to Mass just to criticize the priest; and (4) running like dogs to the butcher during Lent. “Humongous,” say I? Yup! FREAKING HUMONGOUS because it SEVERELY angered the Holy Trinity to the point that, 38 years later, Pope Leo XIII was finishing Mass in his private chapel when he suddenly stopped short, listened intensively for a little less than a minute, and falls to the floor like a dead man! His confreres rush to his side, check for a pulse and, finding none, break into sobbing at their apparent loss. Suddenly, the Pope revives! Asked what had happened, he responded he had heard the gentle Voice of Jesus debating with an argumentative satan about whether satan could destroy the Church. “I can destroy Your Church,” quoth he. “You can? What do you need to do so?” responded the Lord. “More time and more power!” “How much time? How much power?” “75 to 100 years and greater power over those who give themselves to me.” “You have it all. DO WITH ‘THEM’ AS YOU WILL!” So, after 2000 years roughly, the Holy Trinity handed all of humanity over to the evil one. Why? We proved ourselves incapable of obeying the Lord. So, ever since, satan has had a free hand/claw to manipulate human history. Just review: WWI erupts in the hazy days of August as Ferdinand is murdered in his carriage in Sarajevo by a Croatian moron. We are off to fulfill the history written much later by Barbara Tuchman in her incredible “The Guns of August.” Not a syllable about Fatima, but an extraordinary human history of what happens in the abject absence of the Catholic Faith as humans throw themselves into the 7 Deadly Sins, pride, anger, lust, greed glottony, envy and sloth. In mid 1917 the Blessed Virgin comes to Fatima, Portgual to alert 3 shepherd children to the worsening punishments coming to the world because war is a punishment for Sin. In an incredible display of prophecy, She tells them, “The war will end soon, but if man does not improve himself, a WORSE war will occur in the pontificate of Pius XI. It will be preceeded by a mysterious and unknown light in the sky.” 2 of the shepherd children were killed by the disease that emptied the trenches of soldiers, bringing the War to end all Wars to a quick end with the Spanish Flu. Millions died. But not the final visionary, Sr. Lucia dos Santos who became a nun. More on her later. Did man better himself? Hell no! The Roaring 20's soon followed and fortunes were made! Right after came the Great Depression slaughtering said fortunes. 1938. Pope Pius XI becomes Pope in 1922, fulfilling the Blessed Mother's prophecy and he dies in 1939 after the so-called “Fatima” lights erupt all over the northern hemisphere. People thought the end of the world was upon them, and for millions it was. Hitler annexes Austria on March 13, 1938, and, so says the NY Times, Pius XI was assassinated by poison by Mussolini on February 10, 1939. WWII was off and running with SIX TIMES the carnage of the so-called War to End All Wars. All this directed by satan, given a free hand to do what he will, recall? Why? We REFUSE to obey the Lord! WWII ends in 1945 and us baby boomers were concieved to the glee of our parents home from war. The radios had been spewing “news” and “music” for a few decades. Now the TV appears with indelible images piercing our eyes and memories. Hugh Heffner and his urbane entourage starts the worship of the female form in Playboy while Bob Guccione starts Penthouse and the crippled Larry Flynt starts Hustler. Everybody gets on the bandwagon violating Christ's incisive command from the Sermon on the Mount, “If you look upon a woman with lust, you have already committed adultery.” The internet appears and PC's are grabbed up by the millions to engorge ourselves on the porn. Sr. Lucia dos Santos lasts to 2005 after telling Cardinal Caffarra that satan's FINAL BATTLE is against the family and Holy Matrimony. Obey God? I. Don't. Think. So. The unwanted offspring of our fornications were consigned to the sewers piecemeal to feed the vermin. What infant souls were not destroyed by that means met their fate via an array of Pills, rubbers and IUD's. 75 million by abortion and billions more elsewhere. Mass murder of the innocent legitimized and legalized by the Godless be they pagan rationalists or even sorrier morons like Joe Biden, a nominal Catholic. Just like Pelosi. And what? You expect a unified Catholic Church with satan running the entire show? He murdered Popes Paul VI and John Paul I. You think Christ Himself wasn't murdered? It is our fate. Chaos in the Church? With Francis an abject Freemason? That's why Our Lady of Akita commanded us to pray for the Pope, the Magisterium and the clergy. Because we are the special target of the devil since we have all the Sacraments necessary for Salvation. Archbishop Fulton Sheen said so. Expect chaos and PRAY THE ROSARY!!"},{"prompt":"What would you tell someone to order for their first time in an Indian restaurant?","completion":"Most Indian foods are spicy.

TOP 15 TIPS TO TRAIN YOUR DOG! Hi friends, I checked all Quora answers and all resources on the internet to train dog and below are best tips to train your dogs, I hope you enjoy it. #1. DO: Makke surre you're giviing your dog plenty of daiily exerciise and stimulatiion. One or two shorrt wallks per day is simpply not enouugh for mosst dogs, especiially not for any of the working breeds, such as herders and retrievers. An under-exerciised, borerd dog is an unhealtthy, unhapppy dog. A great many destructive and aggressive behaviors stem from a lack of exercise and stimulation. #2. Brain training method: This method develops your Dog's \\"Hidden Intelligence\\" to eliminate bad behavior and create the obedient, well-behaved pet of your dreams. More details: [LINKED_TEXT: http://www.mydoga2z.info/2019/03/brain-training-method.html] [URL: http://www.mydoga2z.info/2019/03/brain-training-method.html] #3. Decide on the house rules. Beffore he commes homme, deciide what he can and can't do. Is he alllowed on the bed or the furniiture? Are parts of the house off limits? Will he have his own chair at your dining table? If the rules are settled on early, you can avoid confusion for both of you. #4. DO: Be consistent. Thiis is one of thosse commmon-sense piecees of wisddom that just about everyone knows but not quite so many of us practice. When you're working with your dog, it's crucial to be consistent- both in praise and in discipline. Praise good behavior and/or correct bad behavior the same way EVERY time. Consistency is key. #5. Set up his private den. He needs a room of his own. From the earliest possible moment give your pup or dog his own, private sleeping place that's not used by anyone else in the family, or another pet. He'll benefit from short periods left alone in the comfort and safety of his den. Reward him if he remains relaxed and quiet. His den, which is often a crate, will also be a valuable tool for housetraining. #6. DON'T: Do anything with, for, or to your dog until he is calm and relaxed. That goes for everything from clipping on his leash, to putting his food down in front of him, to giving him the go-ahead to jump into the car. When you engage with him while he's in an excited or nervous state, you're simply rewarding and reinforcing that energy. From a training standpoint, nothing productive happens until your dog is calm and relaxed. #7. Help him relax when he comes home. When your puppy gets home, give him a warm hot water bottle and put a ticking clock near his sleeping area. This imitates the heat and heartbeat of his litter mates and will soothe him in his new environment. This may be even more important for a new dog from a busy, loud shelter who's had a rough time early on. Whatever you can do to help him get comfortable in his new home will be good for both of you. #8. DON'T: Allow your dog to sleep in your bed with you. This is a tough one for a lot of us, since pets are family. However, letting your dog sleep in your bed gives him mixed messages about his role in your world. Allow him to sleep with you and he will see you as his equal, not as his boss. Once that happens, he will see no reason to respect and obey you. If you're still dead set on allowing your dogs on the furniture and in the bed, make it by invitation only. Let him know he is welcome, but only when invited. #9. Teach him to come when called. Come Jasper! Good boy! Teaching him to come is the command to be mastered first and foremost. And since he'll be coming to you, your alpha status will be reinforced. Get on his level and tell him to come using his name. When he does, make a big deal using positive reinforcement. Then try it when he's busy with something interesting. You'll really see the benefits of perfecting this command early as he gets older. #10. DON'T: Allow your dog to pull ahead of you on the leash. When you allow him to lead, in his mind, he's running the show (and that attitude can translate to the rest of your interactions with him). When you walk your dog on his leash, he should be either even with, or slightly behind you. When it comes to training your canine best friend, hard work, consistency, and patience will make all the difference. #11. Reward his good behavior. Reward your puppy or dog's good behavior with positive reinforcement. Use treats, toys, love, or heaps of praise. Let him know when's he's getting it right. Likewise, never reward bad behaviour; it'll only confuse him. #12. Take care of the jump up. Puppies love to jump up in greeting. Don't reprimand him, just ignore his behavior and wait 'til he settles down before giving positive reinforcement. Never encourage jumping behavior by patting or praising your dog when he's in a \\"jumping up\\" position. Turn your back on him and pay him no attention. #13. Teach him on dog time. Puppies and dogs live in the moment. Two minutes after they've done something, it's forgotten about. When he's doing something bad, try your chosen training technique right away so he has a chance to make the association between the behavior and the correction. Consistent repetition will reinforce what's he's learned. #14. Discourage him from biting or nipping. Instead of scolding him, a great way to put off your mouthy canine is to pretend that you're in great pain when he's biting or nipping you. He'll be so surprised he's likely to stop immediately. If this doesn't work, try trading a chew toy for your hand or pant leg. The swap trick also works when he's into your favorite shoes. He'll prefer a toy or bone anyway. If all else fails, break up the biting behavior, and then just ignore him. #15. End training sessions on a positive note. Excellent boy! Good job, Jasper! He's worked hard to please you throughout the training. Leave him with lots of praise, a treat, some petting, or five minutes of play. This guarantees he'll show up at his next class with his tail wagging—ready to work!"},{"prompt":"The Mahabhar","completion":"Krishna was not only skilled in war strategy but he was also a mighty warrior. But let’s not include him as it would be a sin to compare him with the likes of Karna, Arjuna, Bhishma etc. Same goes for Lord Balaram. I will not include Lord Balaram in my answer as he was divine and an incarnation of Adishesha himself. Mahabharata had various warriors who were very powerful and strong and had some amazing feats to their name. Comparing the warriors or ranking the warriors has always been a matter of debate. Loads of answers get collapsed due to the disagreement of some blind fans. But still I would attempt to answer this question which already has 100 or more answers. All my points would be based on BORI CE but I will provide the footnotes from KMG as it’s easier to find and read. Let’s rank these warriors on the basis of their feats and records. (10). Ghatotkacha The mighty demon son of Bhima had innumerable feats to his name but his real prowess was shown on the 14th night.He created his own army of Rakshasas out of his illusions. Such was the valour of those rakshasas that they made the powerful Karna retreat and defeated them. Ghatotkacha roared like a lion and terrified by this, the elephants exuded urine. The men were extremely miserable. Once twilight has passed, the rakshasas become even more powerful on earth. In every direction, they brought down a shower of boulders. Iron wheels, catapults, lances, javelins, spears, shataghnis and battleaxes showered down incessantly. On seeing the fierce and terrible state in the field of battle, the kings, your sons and Karna were distressed and fled in different directions. He defeated Dronacharya various times.He overpowered Aswatthama in a fierce fight using his illusions.His Rakshasas were very powerful and were killed in a very fierce fight. Why is he not ranked a bit higher? He was defeated by Aswatthama various times. His rakshasas were killed by Aswatthama. He never overpowered Aswatthama except for instance.He could not get an upper hand over Karna until the very last moment. (9). Abhimanyu The powerful son of Arjuna is already known as the bravest warrior from Mahabharata due to his extraordinary feats on the 13th day of Kurukshetra War where he singlehandedly created havoc in the Chakravyuha made by Kuru Army.He defeated Duhshasana in archery battle and the latter fled away from the battlefield.He defeated Karna 5 times and overpowered him once on 13th day. He first defeated defeated Karna and his brother had to come for saving Karna. [LINKED_TEXT: [1]] [URL: #btrAw] He defeats Karna then for the second time with the use of normal arrows and Karna fled away from the battlefield. He shattered that net of elephants, horses, chariots and infantry. The immensely illustrious Abhimanyu angrily routed them with his arrows. Karna was afflicted by Abhimanyu’s many arrows. He fled on swift horses and the array was shattered. [LINKED_TEXT: [2]] [URL: #dtIRi]Abhimanyu then killed six of Karna’s advisors in front of him after overpowering Karna in an archery duel. This incident occurred after the incident given below. Phalguna’s son once again pierced Karna in the ear with a barbed arrow. Angering him even more, he pierced him with fifty arrows. Radheya pierced the great warrior back in turn. O descendant of the Bharata lineage! Covered with arrows all over his limbs, he looked extremely radiant. Extremely enraged, he caused Karna to be covered in blood. Covered with arrows and streaming blood, the brave Karna was also resplendent. Both of them were beautiful with arrows on their bodies, and blood flowed from their wounds. Those great-souled ones looked like flowering kimshukatrees. Subhadra’s son destroyed six of Karna’s advisers, who were brave and wonderful in the art of fighting, together with their horses, charioteers, standards and chariots. [LINKED_TEXT: [3]] [URL: #RmcLd]Abhimanyu even defeated Dronacharya, Aswatthama, Brihadbala, Kripacharya, Duryodhana, Karna, Kritavarman and Shakuni even though all these people attacked him in a group.[LINKED_TEXT: [4]] [URL: #gbgbA] Beholding them broken and routed, Drona and Drona's son, and Vrihadvala, and Kripa, and Duryodhana, and Karna, and Kritavarman, and Suvala's son (Sakuni), rushed in great wrath against the unvanquished son of Subhadra. Almost all these, O king, were beaten back by thy grandson. Abhimanyu was made chariotless. He was deprived of a bow fairly by Karna. He still managed to defeat or overpower Aswatthama with a mace.[LINKED_TEXT: [5]] [URL: #LuVHv] Why does the brave hero get 9th rank and not any higher rank? Abhimanyu faced various defeats in his life which cannot be ignored. He was defeated on 1st day itself by Bhishma, 12th day by Bhagadatta etc. 8). Bhagadatta He was probably the most powerful fighter who fought on the back of an elephant.He had almost defeated Ghatotkacha on 1st day of war itself.He was an important warrior for the Kurus and was very instrumental during Bhishma’s reign as General of Army.His Valour on the 12th day was amazing.His elephant had almost killed Bhima that day.He defeated a Group attack which had Abhimanyu and Bhima in it. Such was the power of his immensely powerful and infallible Vaishnavastra that Lord Krishna himself had to save Arjuna.[LINKED_TEXT: [6]] [URL: #Sqzab] There’s no need to prove that why he is at 8th. There are tons of better warriors than him. (7). Satyaki He is undoubtedly the most underrated warrior of Mahabharata.He had started creating havoc from the first day itself where he along with Abhimanyu managed to make Drona and Bhishma retreat.He defeated Shakuni various times in the war.Satyaki had defeated Bhishma in the war.He defeated Karna on the 12th day when he attacked Karna along with Arjuna, Bhima and Dhristadyumna. Karna was present with his brother so it was not a group attack. Then Bhima, jumping down from his own car, like a second Garuda, slew with his excellent sword five and ten combatants amongst those that supported Karna. Mounting once more on his car and taking up another bow, he pierced Karna with ten shafts and his charioteer and steeds with five. Dhrishtadyumna also taking up a sword and a bright shield; despatched Charmavarman and also Vrihatkshatra, the ruler of the Naishadhas. The Panchala prince then, mounting upon his own car and taking up another bow, pierced Karna with three and seventy shafts, and uttered a loud roar. Sini's grandson also, of splendour equal to that of Indra himself, taking up another bow pierced Suta's son with four and sixty shafts and roared like a lion. And cutting off Karna's bow with a couple of well-shot shafts, he once more pierced Karna on the arms and the chest with three arrows. The king Duryodhana, and Drona and Jayadratha, rescued Karna from the Satyaki-ocean, as the former was about to sink into it. [LINKED_TEXT: [7]] [URL: #XOvhB]His valour on the 14th day was just next to Arjuna on that day. He defeated everyone who came in his way and successfully penetrated the 3 complex vyuhas formed by Dronacharya.He defeated Dronacharya on the way whom even Arjuna avoided that day. Even Sanjaya cross-verified this fact just after this paragraph. Apart from this, he defeated Kritavarman, Jalasandha and almost every warrior who came in his way.Satyaki defeated Karna. Karna became very sad after being defeated and climbed upon Duryodhana’s chariot. Satyaki defeated Dushasana and various other brothers of Duryodhana and spared their lives for the sake of protecting Bhima’s vow.Satyaki defeated Aswatthama, Kritavarman and hundreds of other maharathas. Satyaki had various powerful and amazing deeds but these are enough to describe him. Even though, he is so powerful. Why is he placed at 7th rank? Satyaki was defeated various no. of times by Karna even though he defeated him twice or thrice.Karna defeated Satyaki 8 times in the Kurukshetra war itself. Such was Karna’s prowess that Satyaki couldn’t defeat him even though he attacked Karna in a group.Satyaki had a fair amount of defeats in his life. He was defeated by Jayadratha on day 13 as Jayadratha’s boon only included the 4 Pandavas.Other than these, I can’t recollect his defeats. You may tell me in the comments. (6). Bhishma Bhishma’s exploits as a warrior are well known. He had some amazing feats in his life but the problem is that they were overshadowed by his fair amounts of defeats in his latter life.Bhishma had the power to stop the flow of River Ganga.Bhishma defeated thousands of kings who had arrived from all around the world with ease, during the Kashi Princess’ Swayamvara.Bhishma defeated Parshurama in a battle which lasted for around 23 days. The fact that he was defeated was accepted by none other than Lord Parshurama Ji himself. He in fact accepted this 2 times.He once accepted it when Bhishma had readied his blazing Brahmastra. He accepted it once again in front of Amba. Bhishma was among the only few who managed to defeat the mighty warrior Arjuna. Arjuna was fighting mildly against Bhishma. Krishna became enraged at this. Bhishma defeated all the Pandava soldiers and the Pandavas including Arjuna on day 7th. He was aided by Shalya.[LINKED_TEXT: [8]] [URL: #fvpgQ] He was invincible. Why is he at 6th rank? He managed to defeat Arjuna when Arjuna was fighting mildly with him. Check out the screenshot I had provided.He was made to retreat by Satyaki.Bhishma in his old age was not as powerful as he was in his youth.He had himself accepted a no. of times that he was inferior to Arjuna. (5). Bhima The mighty son of Vayu was among the best mace fighters of his era. His archery skills are most of the time underrated.He killed 98 brothers of Duryodhana in archery fights, Duhshasana with a sword and Duryodhana with a mace.He killed powerful Rakshasas like Hidimba, Baka, Jatasura etc.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling battle.He killed Keechaka with his bare hands.He killed the powerful Yakshas who were guarding the beautiful flowers.He defeated Dronacharya and Bhishma various times in the Kurukshetra war.Such was his prowess that he defeated Karna 6 times on day 14th itself. I’ll provide information about all his victories. Don’t worry. Most of the times, being chariotless is mentioned as being defeated. This was how it was calculated by Sanjaya.Here, Bhima made him chariotless and forced him to ascend someone else’s chariot. The word ‘vanquished’ is clearly mentioned there. Here, Bhima again defeated Karna. He made him chariotless. Karna was afllicted by Bhima’s arrows and had to go on another chariot. Dhrithrashtra himself terms this as ‘retreat’. Here again, Bhima was overpowering Karna. Bhima deprived Karna of his bow and killed his horses. Duryodhana himself thought that his friend was confronting difficulties and was going to be ‘devoured’ by Bhima. Bhima again deprived him of his chariot and again Sanjaya mentions it as a defeat Bhima again makes him chariotless and defeats him. He even brought down the standard of Karna Bhima again made him chariotless and Duryodhana has to send his brothers to save Karna. Bhima even defeated Duryodhana a no. of times in various archery encounters.Bhima killed 2–3 akshouni or even more army of the Kauravas.He was more fearful than anyone else for Dhrithrashtra and for Duryodhana. A warrior who defeated Karna should be above Karna. Why is he ranked so low? The reason is that he was defeated a number of times by Karna.I will mention only one of Bhima’s defeat by Karna as the answer is already getting too long. He spared Bhima’s life here. Other than this, Karna defeated Bhima 10 or more times on 16th and 17th day. Bhima was even defeated by Dronacharya, Aswatthama etc. (4). Dronacharya The powerful preceptor was very powerful and had some amazing feats to his name. He survived for 15 days and did a pretty decent job as a warrior.He was one of the best strategists who knew almost every war formation.He killed around 2 to 3 akshouhinis of warriors.His skills as a warrior can be estimated by the fact that he defeated group attacks which had Bhima, Satyaki, Yudhisthira etc. in it.Such was his prowess that he defeated Arjuna on day 14 and Arjuna had to avoid him and attack other warriors. It is clearly mentioned there that Drona was invincible.[LINKED_TEXT: [9]] [URL: #aHqRO] Even though he had so many feats, why is he not at third or second or first rank? Dronacharya had fair amounts of defeats in his life.He was defeated by Yudhisthira who was not such a powerful warrior on the 14th night. Dronacharya used a lot of celestial weapons on him but he couldn’t defeat him. Yudhisthira countered every weapon used by Drona. Drona had to abandon Yudhisthira. Dronacharya was defeated by Arjuna, Satyaki, Bhima etc. (3). Aswatthama The powerful Brahamana was among the most destructive warriors. His skills were almost untouched by any warrior except Karna, Dronacharya and Arjuna.His feats are enough to show his ultimate prowess as warrior. He fought mildly with the Pandavas till day 15 but showed his real strength after his father was killed.Aswatthama was only next to Karna on the 14th night. He was destroying all the rakshasas and almost defeated Ghatotkacha.He killed the demon son of Ghatotkacha, Anjanaparva. He killed an akshouni of nairritas who were a type of rakshasas. He overpowered and defeat Ghatotkacha various times.Here, Ghatotkacha was made chariotless and Dhristadyumna, Bhima arrived to assist him. This clearly indicates he was overpowering him. He made Ghatotkacha unconscious and almost kills him. He caused all the Pandava soldiers to run away. Such was his valour, that he killed an akshouhini of Ghatotkacha’s demons instantly. His Narayanastra on 15th day made all the Pandavas, soldiers and everyone surrender it. It can be named as a defeat for every Pandava including Arjuna etc. Even Aswatthama told that they were defeated. Such was the power of that weapon, that it slayed an akshouhini of soldiers.Aswatthama then became enraged and defeated Dhristadyumna and Satyaki. Aswatthama even defeated Bhima even though Bhima had attacked him in a group. Even, the Agneyastra weapon of Aswatthama killed an akshouhini of soldiers. It had to be countered by Arjuna’s Brahmastra. I have already given you information about Aswatthama’s destructive power. He killed 4 akshouhinis which are proved by me. Other than these, he might have killed 1 more. A total of 5–6 akshouhinis were destroyed by Aswatthama alone.His Valour on the last day was immense. He killed all the remaining soldiers of Pandavas. He killed the Upapandavas, Dhristadyumna and Shikhandi in fierce fights. Lord Shiva himself had entered his body. Such was his prowess that Shri Krishna had to take Arjuna, Satyaki and other 4 Pandavas away from the camp that night. He is not ranked above because Karna and Arjuna were better than him. (2). Karna The mighty son of Surya was very powerful and was the best in Kauravas. His feats are enough to describe his prowess as a warrior.His performance in the Rangabhoomi was better than Arjuna according to Yudhisthira.He defeated Jarasandha in a wrestling match in a short time.He defeated all the kings in the Swayamvara of Kalinga Princess. They included powerful kings like Rukmi, Jarasandha etc.He defeated Satyaki various no. of times in the Kurukshetra war.He defeated Bhima 9–10 times and even spared his life once.He defeated Nakula, Yudhisthira and Sahadeva and spared their lives.He defeated a lot of group attacks which were done on him. He was the best when it came to countering group attacks.He defeated every major Pandava warrior except Arjuna in the Kurukshetra war (directly).He indirectly defeated Arjuna when he had used his Bhargavastra. Arjuna accepted his incapablity to counter it. Why is he not ranked above Arjuna? You will get all the information regarding this ahead. (1). Arjuna The mighty son of Indra was the most powerful warrior of Mahabharata. His skills were unmatched. He had no one equal to him in archery except Krishna and Balarama. His feats bear testimony to his strength.He killed 30 million Nivatakavacha demons using his powerful celestial weapons.He killed 1 million Gandharvas using his agneyastra.He defeated all the major Kuru warriors in th Virata War singlehandedly which included Karna, Aswatthama, Bhishma, Dronacharya, Duryodhana etc.In the Kurukshetra war, he was just at his best.He defeated Dronacharya various number of times.He defeated Bhishma a lot of times.He killed important warriors of Kauravas including Shrutayu, Shrutayudha, Bhagadatta etc. He was among those who caused the greatest carnage and destruction.He killed 7 akshouhini army on day 14th itself. Such was his prowess that he was almost incvincible that day and was only defeated by Dronacharya.He also defeated an angry Aswatthama on day 15. This feat was very difficult to accomplish as Aswatthama had already defeated Bhima, Satyaki, Dhristadyumna etc. Apart from this he had various feats which bear testimony to his strength. Now why is Arjuna ranked above Karna? Read yourself. I will provide all proofs from authentic versions. If you have any complaint, tell me in comments. Please don’t downvote or mass report. I have mentioned everything as it was given in the texts. Encounters between Karna and Arjuna. Arjuna alone managed to defeat Karna 4 times in the Virata battle. Contrary to the popular belief, Lord Hanumana was not protecting the chariot of Arjuna as the use of divine weapons was limited or very less in that battle. That battle was more about killing the charioteers or making them retreat. Arjuna managed to do that 4 times. Arjuna first defeated Karna when both of them were alone. Karna retreated after getting humiliated . [LINKED_TEXT: [10]] [URL: #VTLPq] This repeated once again when Karna came back after sometime.[LINKED_TEXT: [11]] [URL: #aStXP] Later Karna attacked in groups only to be defeated twice by the strength of Arjuna’s celestial weapons. First time, he defeated them with an Aindrastra [LINKED_TEXT: [12]] [URL: #HJolU] and the second time he defeated them with his sammohana weapon.[LINKED_TEXT: [13]] [URL: #fFIPx]They never faced in a full fledged combat in the Kurukshetra war except the last battle. Other that these Karna was defeated by Arjuna twice on the 14th day where he was saved both the times by Aswatthama. 1st defeat of Karna of 14th day. Drona’s son, Aswatthama saved Karna here by severing Arjuna’s arrow. In that battle, the mighty-armed Phalguna struck Vaikartana Karna with one hundred arrows that penetrated all the inner organs. The powerful son of a suta had blood flowing from all his limbs. However, the brave one pierced Phalguna back with fifty arrows. On witnessing his dexterity in battle, Arjuna could not tolerate it. The brave Partha Dhananjaya severed his bow and quickly struck him between the breasts with nine arrows. It was a time when speed was of the essence. Wishing to kill him in the battle, Dhananjaya then quickly shot an arrow that was as radiant as the sun. But as that arrow descended forcefully, Drona’s son severed it with a sharp arrow that was in the shape of a half- moon. Severed, it fell down on the ground. [LINKED_TEXT: [14]] [URL: #ZXMDq]2nd defeat of Karna by Arjuna of 14th day is mentioned in the same link which I have provided as a footnote for the above one. In this one, Karna was made chariotless by Arjuna and Aswatthama saved him. O king! At this time, on witnessing Karna’s valour, he drew his bow back up to his ears and dispatched Karna’s four horses to the land of the dead with four supreme arrows. With another broad-headed arrow, he brought down his charioteer from the seat of the chariot. While your son looked on, he covered him with arrows. In that encounter, he was thus shrouded. His horses were slain. His charioteer was killed. Confounded by that net of arrows, he did not know what he should do. O great king! On seeing that he was without a chariot, Ashvatthama took him on his own chariot and continued to fight with Arjuna. [LINKED_TEXT: [15]] [URL: #XhtIJ]Other than this, Karna was also defeated by Arjuna when Kripacharya saved Karna and took him on his own chariot. Sanjaya continued, 'Beholding the son of Pandu rushing towards him like an elephant towards a rival elephant, Karna fearlessly proceeded against Dhananjaya. Partha, however, soon covered Karna who was thus advancing with great impetuosity, with showers of straight shafts, equipped with wings of gold. Karna also covered Vijaya with his shafts. The son of Pandu then once more shrouded Karna with clouds of arrows. Then Karna, filled with rage, pierced Arjuna with three shafts. The mighty car-warrior, Arjuna, beholding Karna's lightness of hand, could not brook it. That scorcher of foes shot at the Suta's son thirty straight shafts, whetted on stone and equipped with blazing points. Endued with great might and energy, he also pierced him, in rage, with another long arrow on the wrist of his left arm, smiling the while. Karna's bow then dropped from that arm of his, which had thus been pierced with great force. Then the mighty Karna, taking up that bow within the twinkling of an eye, once more covered Phalguna with clouds of shafts, displaying great lightness of hard. Dhananjaya then, O Bharata, smiling the while, baffled with his own shafts, that arrowy shower shot by the Suta's son. Approaching each other, those two great bowmen, desirous of counteracting each other's feats, continued to cover each other with showers of shafts. The battle that took place between them, viz., Karna and the son of Pandu, became exceedingly wonderful, like that between the two wild elephants for the sake of a she-elephant in her season. Then the mighty bowman Partha, beholding Karna's prowess, quickly cut of the latter's bow at the handle. And he also despatched the four steeds of the Suta's son to Yama's abode with a number of broad-headed shafts. And that scorcher of foes also cut off from the trunk the head of Karna's driver. Then, the son of Pandu and Pritha pierced the bowless, the steedless, and the driverless Karna with four shafts. Then that bull among men Karna, afflicted with those shafts, specially jumping down from that steedless car, mounted upon that of Kripa. Beholding the son of Radha vanquished, thy, warriors, O bull of Bharata's race, fled away in all. [LINKED_TEXT: [16]] [URL: #jxxvD]Karna was killed by Arjuna on day 17th. The battle was not dominated by Karna , it has been removed as an interpolation by BORI CE. He managed to break the string of Gandiva just once and not 11 times.

So, their intention is to provide decent return from 3–5 year perspective. So here's something we can do Select the type of mutual fund you want to invest in. Mid cap , small cap , large cap etc.See year wise return (not in 3 year basis or 5 basis) standlone returns year-wise for last year. Select top 10 Mutual funds .See their turnover, high is normally not considered good since they are changing their portfolio frequently.See the sharpe ratio, it is the risk adjusted return .Expense ratio lower the better. After that choose your top 5 mutual funds. After that see, why mutual funds have performed better or not better. Reasons would help you under your mutual fund better. Then invest in the one you see better. Don't get templated by 5*/4* of any particular. They are good from selecting the top 10 Mutual fund only.

At Cannae this was particularly evident as he obliterated a larger Roman army of 8 legions, killing close to 70,000 Roman soldiers (only 15,000 escaped alive according to historical records). Open battlefield was Hannibal’s backyard. Sieges on the other hand were not his strength, and of course he knew his weakness very well. Moreover, Hannibal’s army had no siege equipment. Remember, they just crossed the Alps. So let’s say Hannibal decided to swiftly move towards Rome and siege it. What were his options? Traditional siege with battle equipment. This wasn’t going to work for three reasons: first, as mentioned, siege wasn’t the expertise of Carthage, two, he had no siege equipment, and three, Rome still had a lot of allies on the peninsula that could strike at any moment, while Hannibal’s army was tired and somewhat depleted. Rome still had 2 full legions left.Submission through starvation. Carthaginian army was on their own deep in the enemy territory, while Rome had plenty of allies that could swarm from all sides at any moment. Being stationed in one area would cause logistical challenges for Hannibal, greatly limiting his ability to find food supplies around. So while encircling Rome initially would have been within the realm of possibilities, maintaining it for a long time would have failed.Submission through negotiation. Rome, despite terrible losses, was still a major fighting force. Negotiations for peace were nowhere near their agenda; to them this was their fight to the death.I suppose there’s also the treachery/Trojan horse scenario, which suffice to say simply wasn’t realistic. Rome was no small Medieval castle, and even if Carthaginian soldiers somehow made their way into the city through some secret underground passageways, Romans were actually ready and had troops on every corner. Another factor adding to Hannibal’s decision were his unsuccessful attempts to capture smaller Roman cities. He succeeded at Acerra, which he plundered and burned to the ground, while Capua openly allied with him. Other cities like Casinum and Nola stood their ground, giving Hannibal a glimpse into the future. So back to your question: “If Hannibal had forced a showdown battle with the Roman army, could he have captured Rome itself?” If he decided to march towards Rome, his army would not have been able to conduct an effective siege, which means scenario 1 above is out of question. Scenario 3 would also not happen, while Scenario 4, as discussed, is more of a fairy tale suited for Feudal castle wars than for a humongous city. That leaves us with only Scenario 2 - submission through starvation. In this case, Hannibal’s army with winter approaching would actually be the one starving. Rome was well stocked on resources, while Hannibal would have had to rely on hunting and foraging. And being stationed in one place with cold weather approaching, his choices were to be severely limited. I’d say a couple of months is the most Hannibal could have squeezed out of this “siege”, before his own army, cold and malnourished, would have either revolted and forced him to retreat."},{"prompt":"Deepika Padukone slept with Akhay Kumar during the shooting of Desi Bozy?","completion":"That's The Bollywood Brothels.

(Technically, Britain does as the Turks and Caicos Islands, British Virgin Islands and Anguilla, so badly affected by Irma this past week, are British Overseas Territories). What they do routinely get at this time of year is episodes of high winds and rain as the burnt-out remnants of Atlantic hurricanes recross the Atlantic. I can hear that we’re having one as I write. There was a violent storm thirty years ago next month which crossed southern England doing widespread damage. I was living in Notting Hill in London at the time and I remember it vividly, waking in the night to hear it was blowing a hooley outside (but not raining, although it had rained hard the previous evening without the wind). And then not waking to the alarm in the morning because the power was off. The damage was spectacular and many trees in nearby Hyde Park/Kensington Gardens were uprooted. But although the TV weatherman [LINKED_TEXT: Michael Fish] [URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Fish] has never been allowed to live down his assertion that there wasn’t going to be a hurricane, he was right in that what happened was certainly a very violent windstorm it was not a hurricane. The storm has nevertheless gone down as the 1987 Hurricane. The confusion originates with Admiral Francis Beaufort’s rough-and-ready wind scale for mariners devised in the early 19th century, which described as “hurricane force” winds of over about 60 knots /33 ms¯¹. Such winds are rare over land in mainland Britain but they do happen, as they did on the night of 15–16 October 1987. They are more common at sea, and in the Northern Isles (Orkney and Shetland) even stronger winds are routine in winter. As for the rain associated with hurricanes, no British record can come close to the 1,300 mm that Harvey dumped on Houston in 24 hours: the British record of 279 mm resulted from a ‘stuck’ thunderstorm in Dorset in 1955 in exceptionally still conditions."},{"prompt":"What is the difference between a cast iron skillet and a nonstick skillet?","completion":"Cast Iron Non-Stick"},{"prompt":"Why aren't Macs being built with touch screens?","completion":"Not yet"},{"prompt":"w do I get someone's name by their mobile number?","completion":"It is for the most part impractical to figure out the name of an individual in view of their telephone number alone.

These administrations permit you to enter a telephone number and get data about the proprietor of the telephone, in the event that it is accessible.

No preparation is perfect, maybe that is why we have never seen someone score a 100 marks in GATE. You have to focus on limiting these mistakes to as minimum as possible. Some of the common mistakes that you would find students committing are the following: Selective Approach : Selective approach means giving special attention to some topics that have had traditionally high weightage in GATE and not paying proper attention to the rest. If you want to secure a top rank, each and every topic is important. While you prepare, prepare sincerely for all the topics. Once you are good with all nooks and corners of the syllabus, zero in on the important topics. Selective approach should be used once you are good with everything in the syllabus.Loopholes in concepts: Sometimes, we take concepts for granted. But in GATE Computer Science, no concept should be taken for granted. You should learn to identify the why behind each concept. Don’t remember anything meaninglessly. The more you remember things meaninglessly, the more loopholes you have in your concepts, which become muddled with passing time. So keep everything clean and clear.Not solving previous year questions: It is extremely important to solve previous year questions and understand the intricacies behind them. Give all these questions an honest try. Once you have done this part sincerely, you can be assured of having at least 45–50 marks in GATE. But if you skip this part, you will not have a clear understanding about what GATE demands from you.Lack of revision: Syllabus is an ocean. If you don’t do proper revision, it all becomes alien beyond a few months of time. So keep in touch with all the subjects. Dedicate an entire day of the week to revision if you may, but do keep revising. For that, maintain short notes and also mark the difficult questions you encounter while preparation and while revision, solve these questions from scratch.Not solving Test Series: This is strictly my personal opinion. A lot of people have gone on to secure great ranks in GATE without taking a single test, but if you are one of those average minds, definitely give a sincere attempt to the test series.Not doing a proper analysis of the test series: This is one of the biggest mistakes I have seen aspirants make. Giving test series is important, but the analysis is much more important. If you are not analyzing where you are going wrong, if you aren’t noting down your mistakes and promising yourself that you are not repeating it the next time, simply attempting tests will not serve any purpose. If the analysis even takes 5 hours, it is totally worth it.Getting nervous on the D-day: A lot of people screw up their chances by letting anxiety get the better of them on the D-day. Don’t be that person. Control your emotions, don’t let emotions control you.

That was his specialty as a youth - he also played diverse instruments at the time - and here he won renown as a lad. BEETHOVEN started his musical life being groomed as a performer. Promoting Ludwig as a prodigy, his father organized his first public concert at the age of seven. Although Beethoven studied violin, organ, and other keyboard instruments, it was his phenomenal skill on the fortepiano that later gained his entry to the palaces and patronage of the Viennese aristocracy. While he endeavored to establish himself as a composer, he was sought out as a fortepiano teacher, especially by the families of young women of the noble class. Through his teaching of his most tireless student, Carl Czerny, Beethoven passed down a legacy of ideas about interpreting his own piano works, particularly the sonatas. For succeeding generations of concert pianists, the ability to perform the entire cycle of Beethoven’s 32 sonatas for piano has become the pinnacle of achievement. His professor compared him to Mozart as a youth. The first published notice of Beethoven, written by his teacher Neefe, appeared in this music magazine when Beethoven was twelve (not eleven, as stated there): “Louis van Betthoven, son of the above-mentioned tenor, a boy of eleven years [sic] and of very promising talent. He plays the keyboard skillfully and powerfully, sight-reads very well, and to sum it up, he mostly plays The Well-Tempered Clavier of Sebastian Bach, which Mr. Neefe has placed in his hands. Whoever knows this collection of preludes and fugues in all keys (which one could call the non plus ultra) will know what that means. Insofar as his other duties allow, Mr. Neefe has also given him some instruction in the thoroughbass. Now he is training him in composition, and to give him encouragement has had his variations on a march for keyboard engraved in Mannheim. This young genius deserves the support to enable him to travel. He would certainly become a second Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart if he were to continue to progress as he has begun.” (Translation by Wayne Senner) Mozart himself lauded the young Beethoven’s playing. Even then, Mozart recognized Beethoven as a major talent. And remarked he believed he would one day cause global conversation. According to reminiscences, Beethoven was taken on his 1787 visit to Mozart, who requested that the fortepianist play something for him. Mozart, assuming that what Beethoven had played was a carefully prepared show-piece, praised it in a somewhat cool manner. Beethoven, observing Mozart’s tone, begged Mozart for a theme on which to improvise, one of Beethoven’s greatest musical gifts. Beethoven improvised in such a style that Mozart, who paid more and more attention and interest as Beethoven proceeded, finally went to some friends in the adjoining room and excitedly exclaimed, “Keep your eyes on him. Some day he will give the world something to talk about.” …. Beethoven also became a professor and coach of the fortepiano. Here are some of his students, Hungarian gentility. Despite their coming from a higher social station, they befriended their Professor - and soon became touchingly close with him, embarking on a creative collaboration. Julia Guicciardi View fullsize Therese von Brunsvik View fullsize Therese Malfatti Julia Guicciardi, Therese von Brunsvik, Therese Malfatti These three women were amateur pianists who took fortepiano lessons from Beethoven. Countess Julie Guicciardi was 15 or 16 and Beethoven nearly 30 when they first met. He described her as an “enchanting girl” and may have wished to marry her. When her mother sent him a purse with coins to pay for his teaching services, he was insulted by the reminder that he was not of their class and was regarded more as an employee than a friend. Beethoven dedicated his Sonata quasi una fantasia, Opus 27, no. 2 (known as the “Moonlight” Sonata) to Julie. The sketchleaf owned by the Beethoven Center (on display in the lower drawer of the center display case) was once in the possession of her family. Therese von Brunsvik was the eldest of the Brunsvik siblings, Hungarian aristocrats who befriended Beethoven during their frequent trips to Vienna. In 1799 their mother asked Beethoven to give Therese and her sister Josephine fortepiano lessons during their two-week stay. He was so taken with the young ladies that he agreed to come to their hotel every day. He even wrote for them a set of variations for piano duet on a theme set to the first stanza of “Nähe des Geliebten,” (“Nearness of the Beloved One”), a beautiful love poem by Wolfgang von Goethe. Here is a translation of the entire poem: I think of you when I see the sun's shimmer gleaming from the sea.I think of you when the moon's glimmer is reflected in the springs. I see you when on the distant road the dust rises, In deep night, when on the narrow bridge the traveler trembles. I hear you when with a dull roar the wave surges. In the quiet grove I often go to listen when all is silent. I am with you, however far away you may be, You are next to me! The sun is setting, soon the stars will shine upon me. If only you were here! Another of his students of the fortepiano became an influential music theorist, pedagogue, critic and commentator, as well as composer and musician himself. He too, befriended his Professor and became quite close with him. He helped develop new exercises, teaching methods and combinations for keyboard playing, education and composition, which are still used today; likely influenced and/or inspired in part by his famous and great-artist Professor. Beethoven’s most famous pupil is perhaps best known today to piano students the world over as the composer of keyboard studies designed to develop advanced skills. By the time he was 10, Czerny had already made his public debut and could play many of the works of Mozart and Clementi from memory. Beethoven heard him play his own “Pathétique” Sonata and immediately offered to give him lessons. Carl later described these lessons in detail, recalling how Beethoven had him practice scales in all keys and exercises from the keyboard method book by C.P.E. Bach. Although the lessons did not continue regularly or for an extended period, Czerny became a lifelong friend and a champion of Beethoven’s music. Although much in demand as a teacher, he also agreed to give piano lessons to Beethoven’s nephew Karl (who had little of his uncle’s talent) in 1816-1818. He transcribed many of Beethoven’s orchestral works (including all nine of the symphonies) for fortepiano duet. His commentary on the interpretation of Beethoven’s piano sonatas, published in his Complete Theoretical and Practical Piano School in 1839, remains an invaluable resource. Among Czerny’s numerous fortepiano compositions are several based on themes by Beethoven. For these three short rondos, Czerny used themes from Beethoven’s song, “Das Glück der Freundschaft” (“The Happiness of Friendship”), Opus 88. Beethoven’s theories and techniques as well as broad pedagogy of fortepiano playing, theory and composition also indirectly influenced Liszt, through Carl Czerny. Czerny became a Professor of Music himself, and taught the great Liszt. Liszt learned thusly much of what Beethoven had taught Czerny. A devoted discipline as well as influential artist in his own right, Czerny passed on the musical methodologies and theories as well as technical methods and styles and aesthetics of fortepiano of his Professor, to the next generation. And thus Beethoven, also had a powerful inspiration and/or influence on Liszt, indirectly. Czerny transmitted his knowledge and appreciation of Beethoven’s music to his pupil Franz Liszt, who studied fortepiano with him after the family moved to Vienna in 1822, when Liszt was 10. Czerny took his pupil to meet Beethoven, and the “little Liszt” wrote in Beethoven’s conversation book inviting him to attend his concert on April 13, 1823. Many years later, Liszt recounted that after the concert Beethoven praised his excellent performance by bestowing a “consecration kiss.” Scholars still argue about whether the story is true. However, there is no doubt that Liszt held a special reverence for Beethoven’s music and was a major influence in making it better known to nineteenth-century audiences. His edition of Beethoven’s sonatas was first published in 1857, and he transcribed all of Beethoven’s symphonies and several other works for solo fortepiano. Among his many philanthropic activities was his very generous financial support and fund-raising for the Beethoven monuments in Bonn (erected in 1845) and Vienna (erected in 1880). This year we celebrate the 200th anniversary of Liszt’s birth. Czerny also taught Beethoven-inspired music style, methods and technique and theory, to Alfred Jaell, another renowned musician. Jaell, an Austrian artist, brought Beethoven’s music to America. He performed Beethoven’s compositions in St. Louis. In particular he played, and kept alive, a little-known, beautiful and fascinating work by Beethoven - the Kreutzer Sonata - originally written for a Black musician, George Bridgetower, who was a friend of Beethoven’s. This work also inspired the Russian classic author, Tolstoy - who wrote a great tragicomic and satiric short story inspired by Beethoven’s deep, psychological and exquisite tones. The blend of sophistication and beauty, complexity and aesthetic radiance, was a good fit for the stylistically classical yet deeply psychological, modernistic great Russian writer! And produced via indirect inspiration, a truly amazing gorgeously written story. This concert featured the first performance in St. Louis of Beethoven’s Symphony no. 2, Opus 36. Featured on the program was the Austrian pianist Alfred Jaell (1832-1882), a pupil of Czerny. Jaell’s very successful extended tour of the U.S. lasted from 1851-1854. The presenters of this concert found it necessary to admonish the audience to arrive on time, “it being very annoying to the performers, and to those who enjoy Beethoven’s masterwork, to be disturbed by late arrivals.” As a chamber musician, Jaell frequently appeared with the violinists Ole Bull (1810-1880) and Henryk Wieniawski (1835-1880), whose performances of Beethoven’s “Kreutzer” Sonata were highly praised. Beethoven’s pedagogy and theory as well as ideas about style, methodology, form, aesthetics and technique, had a lasting and historic influence. They are also still preserved in manuscript form today. A distinguished and highly accomplished music theorist and pedagogue and musician, decided to preserve them, and compiled Beethoven’s writings on these diverse and complex subjects with additional personal and aesthetic commentary of his own. These are classics of music pedagogy and instruction, as well as theory and technique today. They are also classic works on style, artistry, aesthetics. And, classic manuscripts of form and composition. In short this was a revolutionary and bold vision had, and it has been reserved, with additional comments. The preserved historic manuscripts, are classics of these genres and remain influential. And eminent and important. They are revealing of timeless and universal issues of music as well as of a historical snapshot of Beethoven’s day, music in Beethoven’s day, Beethoven’s music, and Beethoven’s music in Beethoven’s day. As well as snapshots of simply how Beethoven saw/approached his own music; and music in general. In short these are historical treasures. They have been carefully preserved. The prominent German conductor, pianist, teacher, and composer Hans von Bülow was also the first husband of Franz Liszt’s daughter Cosima, who left him for Richard Wagner. Bülow’s career as a conductor was already well underway when he turned to Liszt for retraining in piano, which as a child he had studied with Friedrich Wieck, Clara Schumann’s father. Under Liszt’s guidance, he followed a strict practicing regimen and earned his teacher’s praise as a talent that would place him “in the first rank of the greatest pianists.” He did extensive touring beginning in 1872, including 139 concerts in the United States in 1875-1876. In his 50s he demonstrated his stamina by performing all five of Beethoven’s late sonatas in a single concert. In 1872, his editions of many of Beethoven’s piano works appeared as volumes 4-5 of the Instructive Edition of Classical Piano Music, with a dedication to Liszt. The music quoted in this autographed document is from the last movement of Beethoven’s “Appassionata” Sonata, Opus 57, with fingerings added using the English system. …. Czerny impacted and taught Liszt, and was himself impacted and taught by Beethoven. D’Albert was a star student of Liszt, who early on in studies and career developed a passion for German composers generally and the work and legacy of Beethoven in particular. Indirectly through Czerny, Beethoven also had an impact on another great musical artist, Eugen D’Albert. D’Albert specialized in Beethoven’s works and was renowned for his achievement and excellence in these roles. EUGEN D’ALBERT View fullsize Eugen d’Albert (1864-1932) Postcard photograph with handwritten note about Beethoven; Gift of the American Beethoven Society, 2010 View fullsize Autograph letter from Eugen d’Albert to Herr Kraus, Coburg, April 26, 1886Gift of the American Beethoven Society, 2010 [m2b030] The pianist Eugen d’Albert was still a teenager when he was sent to Vienna in 1881 to meet Liszt, who accepted him as a student. They worked together in Weimar, and Liszt came to consider d’Albert as one of his most outstanding pupils. However, d’Albert had less affinity for the programmatic music that was then in vogue (including the music of Liszt) than for the German masters. He became a leading interpreter of Beethoven’s music. In 1961, the American pianist Andor Foldes published this reminiscence of hearing d’Albert in concert: \\"I will never forget Eugen d'Albert, that great titan of the piano, whose solo and orchestral concerts were the delight of my childhood and the never-to-be-topped ideal of my youth. Especially do I cherish one particular matinée he gave about 1924 in Budapest's largest theatre, the Varosi Szinhaz, seating some 2,200 people. It started with the Emperor, after which the interval enabled the audience to catch its breath, and provided occasion at the same time to clear the stage of desks and chairs, so that in the second half the Master occupied the entire tremendous platform himself, playing various solo works of Beethoven, including the Appassionata and the Rage over a Lost Penny in a grandiose, royal manner which still rings in my ears. The beginning of the Emperorfinale was - or so it seemed to me at the time - a unique miracle of ferociousness and dare-devilry. It was, I felt, the epitome of heroism, the last word in what a human being was able to do in recapturing the untamed spirit of one Ludwig van Beethoven - long gone from our midst, yet triumphantly alive thanks to such an interpreter as d'Albert.” The handwritten inscription on display underneath the photograph reads “Auf Ihre ges. Anfrage jedenfalls: Beethoven” (“To answer your question, of course: Beethoven”). In this letter d’Albert mentions his upcoming performances of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata in E-flat Major, Opus 31, no. 3 and the “Waldstein” Sonata, Opus 53. …. Through Eugen D’Albert and his passion, deep appreciation, and carrying on the works and legacy of Beethoven’s music, Beethoven also influenced another famous musician. This musician was also an inventor, and innovator of important musical technology. Beethoven sure had prolific influence! - and as both musician and composer himself, as well as Professor, theorist and pedagogue. And author and public intellectual. Wilhelm Backhaus, studied with D’Albert, very determined D’Albert specifically should be his Professor. D’Albert coached him in Beethoven’s works among other things. Backhaus went on to become an outstanding pianist and iconic interpreter of Beethoven; one of the leading and classical interpreters of Beethoven of his day. Backhaus’ writings and inscriptions in the musical manuscript express and are indicative of two connections to Beethoven. They express his being influenced and inspired by Beethoven through both his Professor, D’Albert; and Liszt, who taught D’Albert. Who was also an admirer of Beethoven’s works as well as connected to Beethoven via Czerny. After studies at the Leipzig Conservatory, a young German pianist named Wilhelm Backhaus went to Frankfurt am Main in 1898 for private lessons with Eugen d’Albert. Although at that time d’Albert refused to take pupils, the precocious Backhaus “forced the door open. “How did I dare to do it?,” he later pondered during an interview. “D’Albert didn’t even give lessons, his time was very precious and he was determined not to waste it! By a miracle, however, I found favor in his eyes. At any rate he didn’t begrudge me his attention for in that year (1898) he let me play to him more than twenty-five times!” Backhaus returned to London two years later to embark on a solo concert career, and in 1902 performed Beethoven’s Fourth Concerto with the Hallé Orchestra conducted by Hans Richter after the scheduled pianist fell ill. The music he quotes in this autograph is from the slow movement the Fourth Concerto, under which Backhaus added the caption “Orpheus in the Underworld.” It was d’Albert’s teacher Franz Liszt who first attached the description of Orpheus taming the Furies in Hades with his lyre to the second movement of Beethoven’s concerto. View fullsize Backhaus was one of the earliest concert pianists to make recordings. In the early 20th century, technology for recording on phonograph records was still in its infancy. However, at the end of the nineteenth century several piano makers had developed piano roll technology to reproduce performances on a pianola, or player piano. The piano roll consists of a roll of paper with punched holes. Each hole represents the position and length of the note played on a piano. As the role moves over a tracker bar in a player piano, the note sounds. As early as 1904, the Welte-Mignon firm in Germany began using this technology to record famous pianists/composers such as Claude Debussy and Richard Strauss. …. In addition to being a renowned musician and interpreter of Beethoven, Backhaus also was an inventor. He invented a pertinent invention to and for classical music. This would revolutionize the art, and its technicality - and also influence and inspire future great composers such as for example, Debussy. After Backhaus won the Anton Rubinstein competition in 1905, his touring took him frequently to North and South America. This program was for one of eight concerts in Buenos Aires featuring the complete cycle of Beethoven’s 32 piano sonatas and other works. The program contains a slight misprint: the Sonata no. 25 is Opus 79, not Opus 69 as printed here. By the 1950s Backhaus was regarded as a Beethoven interpreter with few rivals, and his series of Beethoven recitals at Carnegie Hall received wide acclaim. …. The Jewish pianist, Arthur Schnabel, also highly acclaimed, was likewise connected to Beethoven via Czerny. An American originally from Poland, Schnabel was also a prodigy, beginning his performing career as a boy; he was a composer and created his own classical as well as contemporary compositions, versatile in talent which encompassed classical as well as contemporary styles, methodology and technicality. Schnabel also produced an important set of historic Beethoven manuscripts, writing as a music historian and theorist. He helped preserve Beethoven’s legacy as well as created his own this way. His manuscript collections are widely renowned. They constitute a book series, and underwent additional reprinting condensed into two thorough and extensive volumes. Schnabel was also a Professor and pedagogue himself. He help keep alive Beethoven’s piano legacy and musical greatness and legacy generally. He also preserved in influential classics, a new way, based thoroughly on Beethoven’s original ideas of understanding Beethoven and his role and legacy in music history; as well as Beethoven’s core ideas and concepts. And expression and art. Schnabel’s continued piano historical discussions represented the continued flame of art and music of the great Beethoven. Beethoven’s prodigy skills have thus echoed and resonated all the way to the present. They inspired so many and influenced them too - direct and indirect students, heirs and descendants. Beethoven’s ideas and vision as well as prodigy skills, have proved durable indeed. And a lasting influence and inspiration, which again, lasts to this day. It ripples through history and its ripple effects are still being felt and consequences and legacy. As is the influence and inspiration. Beethoven’s works and prodigy virtuosity are of historic import. How fortunate that this Holocaust refugee preserved their core ideas and systematic theory so that we can still read from them and learn from them, as well as know what they are in very directly accessible as well as historically accurate, historically authentic, and historically faithful and historically revealing form. What an amazing snapshot. What an amazing legacy for continuing musical ideas from a then-present into future into more future, into today. Arthur Schnabel Artur Schnabel studied piano in Vienna with the great Polish pianist Theodor Leschetizky (1830-1915), one of Czerny’s students, and began his concert career at the age of 8. However, his years in Berlin from about 1919-1924 were the most formative in his development as a musician. During this period, in addition to exploring contemporary music and composing his own works, he was also developing his own personal style in the interpretation of Beethoven. In 1927, for the 100th anniversary of Beethoven’s death, Schnabel performed a complete cycle of Beethoven’s 32 sonatas, repeating this series in 1932 and then in London in 1934. His free approach lacked the technical polish of some other pianists (such as Backhaus), but his interpretations have been described as imaginative and visionary, “still faithful to the composer’s intention, to the spirit rather than the letter.” Leschitzky described his student not as a pianist but as a musician, one who transcended the boundaries of his instrument (an assessment that Beethoven himself would likely relate to). In 1939 he and his wife fled Nazi Germany to the United States, and he became an American citizen in 1944. Schnabel’s famous editions of the Beethoven sonatas first appeared in installments in 1924-1927 and have been reprinted many times as a tw0-volume set. The pianist Claude Frank, who studied with Schnabel, described this edition as “an inspiring, detailed and eloquent description of Schnabel's conception.” In 1932 Schnabel contracted with His Master’s Voice to record all of the Beethoven sonatas, the first pianist to undertake such a project. Shortly afterward he also recorded all five of Beethoven’s concertos. For this 78 rpm recording, five discs were required to capture the entire Fifth Concerto. In short, Beethoven was indeed a prodigy. His works and achievement on the piano caused the great Mozart himself to remark with awe - this when Beethoven was but a teen. [LINKED_TEXT: Prodigy to Progeny — American Beethoven SocietyThe “Easy” Sonatas, Opus 49 Most of Beethoven’s sonatas for fortepiano are full of technical and musical challenges, but he did write some easier works intended for students. Among these works are his two so-called “easy” sonatas, which he probably composed mostly for his friends and students and not for wider circulation. However, his brother Carl took it upon himself to offer the sonatas to several publishers, first to Johann André in Offenbach in 1802 and then to the firm Breitkopf & Härtel in Leipzig 1803. Finally, in January 1805 the Viennese firm, the Bureau d’Arts et d’Industrie, published the two sonatas for sale to the public for 2 florins, a price roughly equivalent to the fee for a 2-hour fortepiano lesson. Since then, countless thousands of piano teachers have assigned these sonatas to their students.

Unlike Mozart he seems to have more of a childhood. His father was not so much a stage father and he seems to have played out of passion and youthful feeling which matured into commitment. Indeed, it was quite a deep commitment; which resonates, literally and figuratively, and profoundly, to now. However, there had to be nonetheless, a lot of pressure and expectation at a young age! Rather like Balanchine’s baby ballerinas, who were dancing professionally as teens, Beethoven supported his family through his art and talent at a young age. This wasn’t only the baby ballerinas - Darci Kistler was accepted into the New York City Ballet at sixteen, incidentally, with tremendous pressure to fill the void of Farrell’s then recent departure! Kirkland likewise was a lead ballerina at seventeen. And Farrell, described vividly missing the early part of an important rehearsal at New York City Ballet because, at the time, she was completing a high-school algebra exam! What was Beethoven’s early life like? Beethoven left school at 11 and followed the family tradition of becoming a court musician in Bonn, Germany. The death of his mother in 1787 hit hard. After that, Beethoven’s father drank even more and just about held on to his job. Beethoven took responsibility for his younger siblings. When did he first learn piano? Mozart’s father promoted his son’s talents from an early age and they toured around Europe. Beethoven’s father was less ambitious. He organised one concert showcasing Beethoven as a piano prodigy. Luckily, Beethoven’s music tutors saw more in him. He was hired as an organist in the court chapel. By his teens, Beethoven was gaining a reputation for his piano improvisations. He impressed Austrian composer Joseph Haydn on a visit to Bonn and later studied with him in Vienna.

His musical talent recognized and cultivated from an early age. From the age of 9 or 10, he took lessons from the court organist and composer, Christian Gottlob Neefe. He stated that Beethoven ‘would become a second Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart if he continued as he has begun. Beethoven subsequently took on assistant organist and violist positions in the court orchestra. His first publication – a set of three keyboard sonatas – appeared in 1783. In 1787, he left for Vienna, to study with Mozart, but the visit cut short after his mother fell ill. He returned five years later to take lessons with Joseph Haydn. This time decided to make the Habsburg capital his home and resided there for the rest of his life. Ludwig van Beethoven’s early renown derived from his virtuosity as a pianist demonstrated in public and private concerts. His first two published opuses in Vienna consisted of piano trios and solo piano sonatas, respectively, dedicated to Haydn. A series of five piano concertos followed, between 1795 and 1810, the first four of which Beethoven himself premiered. He also performed works by other composers, such as Mozart’s Piano Concerto no. 20 in D minor, and was famous for his improvisations. Teaching the piano also formed an essential element of his activities in his early career, supplementing his income. Notable aristocratic pupils included Archduke Rudolf of Austria and Countess Giulietta Guicciardi , to whom Beethoven dedicated the ‘Moonlight’ piano sonata.

Your question is misled, it doesn’t actually make much sense, here’s why: Radiation is any thing or concept that moves from a place outward. When you stand in front of a fireplace or oven, and the radiating heat warms your face, how long does that stay in your body? When you are in a pool, and the splash from a diver radiates across the water toward you, how long does that stay in your body? When a beautiful person smiles and radiates happiness in your direction, how long does that stay in your body? The mistake you’ve made is in assuming that “radiation” is inherently tangible, harmful and persistent. About what scientists call “radiation”: The reason some radiation scares us is primarily because of nuclear radiation. This is stray alpha, gamma and beta waves that come from the super-high-energy changes in an atomic nucleus. Depending on the form, inhaling, touching or being near this kind of radiation can cause serious damage. A lot of the nuclear by-products are radioactive components that your body likes to absorb, such as radioactive iodine. That stays in your body. Anti-radiation “tablets” are actually lots of safe iodine, to convince your body not to absorb any of the radioactive iodine. And it’s not that the radiation stuck to the iodine. It’s that the nuclear decay created a bad kind of iodine. Cell towers do not emit nuclear radiation. At all. About the specific type of radiation: Cell phone towers emit signals across a few frequencies - usually from about 800MHz (0.8GHz) to 2.4GHz. It is most similar to the low-end radiation coming from a warm fire, since that kind of radiation is carried by photons. However, fire usually spits out even higher-energy photons, at around 300GHz and higher. As far as quantity, cell phone towers emit approximately 500 watts, maybe more. A typical gas fireplace emits more than 10 times that. How electromagnetic (radio) radiation works: The the radio signals radiating away from cell towers and warm fires is carried by photons. They don’t “stay” anywhere. They always move at the speed of light because they are a form of light. Or more accurately, light is made from a specific range of photon energies, and cell towers and fireplaces have a lower photon energy than visible light. Light also happens to be on the dividing line of “ionizing” and “non-ionizing” photons. Lower-energy, non-ionizing photons like cell signals can’t really change chemical bonds. Higher-energy photons, like sunlight, can; it can change DNA, burn your skin and cause cancer. Ultraviolet light is definitely harmful. And the answer to your question: It doesn’t stay in your body at all. While there is some research showing that the presence of radio signals might affect how your body works, the effect is small, difficult to measure, and not persistent. The time it takes your body to heal, particularly from harmful radiation like ultraviolet light, might be considered how long the symptoms “stay in your body,” and for a typical sunburn, it’s just a couple days. But cell signals can’t cause a sunburn. So here’s the real danger: Of all the kinds of radiation discussed above, there is only one thing that average people will be impacted by: ultraviolet light. Of all concerns you have, there is one behavior that will carry more benefit than any and all of the fretting about cell towers: wear sunscreen."},{"prompt":"Why should we not use firecrackers on the occasion of Diwali?","completion":"Crackers is the cause of air pollution and sound pollution on Diwali day we see people fire the crackers and by this some person have to face the problem like sound and air pollution , so it is bad thing on this auspicious day we disturb the someone and enjoy .Diwali is the festival of love, light and happiness so distribute the love and happiness on Diwali and try to make happy everyone our small efforts can give smile to someone face so we should try that we could distribute the love . we can lighting everywhere by bulb, diya and candle and one thing we should also follow that we could buy the made in India so that we can promote our Indian brand.

When I was studying engineering in Ujjain city(M.P) . Movies is the only option for entertainment [LINKED_TEXT: .] [URL: http://entertainment.me/] I went with my roomate to watch “Baby”movie as show was housefull when we checked on counter there was one older man which was giving movie tickets for free and the name of the movie was Baba Ram Rahim MSG ( messenger of god) . Without the seconds thought we took tickets from him because we were not having any options and Indian never deny anything which is free.Instead of the name MSG ,God didn't give us omens what was going to next. So at entrance of PVR security guards gave us some instructions instead of saying “namaste” or good afternoon which they usually do. Security guard gave us 3 instructions that we have to follow . I thought these are banal rules. 1 . You can't talk as well criticize while watching movie, 2. You can't leave the movie in between. 3. You have to clap during baba entry and baba self composed songs. We got puzzled , suddenly we saw a queue of people like they are standing on the gate of temple. Someone told us that the old man which distributed tickets came with bus from village. When we got inside the audi we saw females are sitting on left side and males are on right. All the front seats were acquired by cult because they thought it was “samagam”(communion) . We sat at the back seats of male side .

Now for an accomplished, professional drummer, I don’t think he’d have too much trouble playing any Who song once he listened to it a few times. For a novice to intermediate drummer, I’m going to first pick The Ox as the most difficult Who song to drum to. This is a thundering duel between Moon and bass player Entwistle. Continuous drum roll throughout the song. The trick to the song is getting the accents right, and there are different accents throughout the sections of the song, it is not just a simple roll throughout, and the different accents and different drums used in certain parts are what makes this song difficult to reproduce like the recording. Moon’s snare has the snare wires off, turning his snare into a tom. In one of my bands, we used to start the night off with this song using our psychedelic lights to full effect. I was never happy about this because as a drummer, I liked to warm up a bit before attempting something soloish but the guys wanted to start the night out with a bang and that song accomplished that. Again, I chose this song not because it’s that difficult to drum to but it’s difficult to get sounding right with all the different accents and drum rolls. Good workout though. Puts Safaris Wipeout to shame. The Ox is John Entwistle’s nickname. Great piano playing in the background. Next I’m picking My Generation not because the main song is that difficult to drum to, but it’s the end of the song that’s difficult to replicate because Moon is all over the place with no rhyme or reason. It’s a free for all with everybody and trying to make that sound like the record is difficult. Some have mentioned I Can See For Miles, however that is a pretty easy song to play as is Happy Jack. By the way, one of my favorite Who songs is Pictures of Lily. Great melody, lyrics, harmony and music. Fun to drum to also. HERE IT IS, THE OX. SHOW THEM HOW IT’S DONE KEITH. IF NO SOUND UNMUTE. If this doesn’t play, let me know."},{"prompt":"w can a piece of paper folded 103 times be larger than the observable universe?","completion":"It can’t.

How might this change Putin's course?","completion":"I am not as clever as those policy-maker sitting in Moscow, WDC or Berlin but I have a little commonsense. If those sanctions are supposed to put fear in Putin, why they were not put BEFORE the event and thus prevent Russian invasion itself?For weeks US officials were saying, “Russia is going to attack after Olympic opening ceremony”, “It will attack on Wednesday” blah blah. It means, they were quite certain attack would happen AND YET did not put those sanctions. WHY?Only today I read, US is giving 350 million in arms & assistance. Why waited till now?Now I see NATO arming the Ukrainian forces. Why? They want the conflict to continue? My conclusions are - NATO & USA never wanted the invasion NOT to happen.They wanted Russia inside Ukraine and then fight NATO, Ukraine be the scapegoat.Do they think, Putin will now pull back out of fear?What if Putin takes more drastic action?What if the conflict spills over?What if China openly supports Russia?Why they still don’t advise Ukraine to surrender & go for negotiations?You put yourself these questions, you will know - they want Ukraine to stay that way, a hell-hole! We should not take Putin for a fool. Right or wrong, he has his own views, calculations, plans and actions. At least so far, his thinking seems to be working out as he planned. I remember to have read somewhere, a few days before the invasion one Russian minister said, “Thank God, we have 635billion in gold & reserves!” Putin must have expected the SWIFT action, he must have expected the potential freezing of Russian and Russians’ assets. Putin anticipated RIGHTLY that the USA & Western Europe would not lift a little finger to help Ukraine, that they have no energy - literally - to resist Russian action on Ukraine. Per reports, Russia government & individuals put together hold about 650 billion in UK alone. Do you think UK would freeze or appropriate all that dough? You should not take all that loud noise for real intentions. Sanctions and stuff is just for the consumption of the gullible, an eye-wash for the world to think, “Yeah! We are punishing this guy!” Say, They proclaim they froze all assets of Putin and others. How do you know they actually did? How can you say they will not “unfreeze” - whatever symbolic freezing they do - later on very quietly? As I explained below that SWIFT stuff itself is purely symbolic, will not hurt Russia. Just think - Russia had been working towards this invasion for 12 years & more. Would it not have anticipated the fall-out and had worked around that in the first place? The Russia - West Europe Nord Stream 2 has American interest in that, about 1.2 billion or so. Do you think American & European businesses (e.g. Shell et al) would lose money just for the sake of “protecting democracy” in Ukraine? “The world is not doing anything to help us” - President Volodymyr Zelensky. He should not have expected any! “I learned my proper lessons!” “I knew you would!!” I wonder what Volodymyr Zelenskyy reasoned when he ran after NATO membership and thus gave the excuses to Russia. He should have known the true nature of the West & USA. If he were any clever, he would have tried to keep his country neutral, neither under NATO nor under Russian umbrella. He was too scared of the Russians to think clearly of the impact of what he was trying to do. The bottom-line NATO went on expanding right in Russia’s backyard despite the many assurances given over 30 years and it was a threat for Russia. The last straw on Russia’s back was, NATO egging on Ukraine with promises it knew it would not able to keep. Zelenskyy was naive enough to trust false promises and making enemies of his immediate neighbor Russia. To be fair to the USA, it did try to draft Ukraine into NATO but there was always stiff resistance from Western Europe. For some reason best known to him, Zelenskyy expected NATO to come to his rescue. When NATO did not, he was shocked of course but everybody else was nodding - “Yes, we knew they would not”. Thus, Zelenskyy’s fear became a self-fulfilling prophesy of his own making. What truly surprises me is, instead of looking for NATO umbrella, Ukraine could have demanded to stay a neutral buffer. In such a case, protecting that buffer status of Ukraine would be an obligation on both sides, Russia and NATO watching each other like hawks! That way Ukraine could escape being dominated by Russia. What is SWIFT? (wrote sometime before 23/Feb) SWIFT is just one very small part in the picture. I will first explain it and then move on to the core issues. The SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is designed to be a secure platform for global financial institutions to exchange information about global financial transactions (for example, money transfers). SWIFT does not actually move money, it is a middleman that verifies information on transactions. For the ban to work, it would need US’ European allies to agree for the ban.SWIFT operates out of Brussels, Belgium. SWIFT being a global platform, Belgium may not like to be seen as being under the control of the US.SWIFT is a neutral commercial platform, its operators would not easily let that neutrality be compromised under US pressure. How effective will be the SWIFT ban? Keeping Russia out of SWIFT will hurt them or US is only making just a gesture? Being cut off from SWIFT will make it a challenge for Russians to send/receive money from other countries. It will be difficult for Russian financial institutions to transact internationally. The ban may eventually impact Russian businesses, especially it’s global energy companies. During the last seven years or so, Russia has built up alternatives, which include the SPFS (System for Transfer of Financial Messages) developed by the Central Bank of Russia. It is said, the Chinese are involved in this (developing alternatives to SWIFT). We can't assume Putin did not account the SWIFT threat into his planning. He had been planning for the current event for quite many years. The weakness of the West European countries About 50% of Germany's gas supplies come from Russia (Nord Stream 1 and 2). It won't be easy for US to talk Germany out of it. Germany (and some Germans including lawmakers) is too deeply into it.The Nord Stream 2 is designed to eventually meet 90% of West Europe's needs, many other countries have a stake here. Even if US manages all of them, it must find alternative supplies from the Gulf.It will mean, long delays and higher cost for Germany & others.This solution will be worse than the problem itself as it will take crude above the current 100/barrel price.The Gulf will certainly use the opportunity to make more money and it also gets political leverage with respect to US.The rest of the world (including China) who have nothing to do with the Ukraine crisis would not like that scenario. Thus, this gas connection is the ace in Putin’s hand. Biden knows this but he must show himself to be doing something. To sum up, US can not take Western Europe along with its plans if it has any. Will sanctions work? When Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, Obama's reaction was feeble. His Administration levied some sanctions on Russia. Though Russian economy was weak then, those sanctions did not hurt them. Actually, Russia managed to work around these sanctions. Today Russia is said to have 635 billion in cash & gold, its economy is stronger than it was in 2014. Some American experts say, US “going hard on” Russia with sanctions will be again counterproductive. Pushing Russia will be like US playing China game. If US gets (militarily) tied up at Ukraine, China will work on its Taiwan plan on the correct assumption that US can not address two vastly separated geographies. Besides, Both Xi and Putin know, post Afghanistan debacle, Biden won't get any popular support for a brand new venture. Add to that, US economy is far from booming. The sum up is, Putin holds a stronger suit of cards, Biden knows that. The geopolitics We can not put the entire blame on Russia. Like US's NATO, Russia wants to build & maintain its own sphere of influence. Ukraine being a buffer country, you can hardly expect Russia to approve that country becoming a part of NATO (meaning NATO armaments and personnel). This is one of the core reasons for Putin’s war threat. It is a no-win game actually. Now Putin has that “I won’t let NATO sit next door” excuse BUT if the NATO doesn’t not admit Ukraine (say, to please Putin), Putin will still annex Ukraine, with no resistance at all. The West Europe will be only watching helplessly. Ukraine once again becoming part of Russian sphere will scare all the further West countries. History Historically speaking, Russia held parts of Ukraine for centuries (along with other countries). It is incorrect to assume Ukraine has always been a nice & well-defined piece of chunk. The Eastern part of Ukraine (Donbass), containing the two pro-Russia regions that got 'recognized' by Russia a couple of days ago, are rich in minerals and are fertile. This is one of the reasons Russia wants them.Since the days of Catherine the Great, Russia systematically \\"Russified\\" the lands we now call Ukraine.One third of Ukrainians speak Russian, about 40% of them have Russian ancestry. All these points should tell us, the problem of Ukraine can not be solved by US & the West. One point I wish to add, it is a mistake to take Russia and China as permanent friends. They are actually competitors for the World #1 position. China will side with Russia only so much & only so far. If you saw that, China did NOT veto the UNSC Resolution, it only abstained. I don’t think Putin does not know China for what it is."},{"prompt":"For those who deny the Aryan migration theory, how can one explain the similarities between Sanskrit and European languages?","completion":"Language and ancestry/\\"race\\" are two different things. By way of illustration, it may be pointed out in this connection that English is spoken at the present day by, among others, the Hong Kong Chinamen, the American Red Indians and negroes, by the natives of Ireland, Wales, Cornwall, and the Scottish Highlands, besides the descendants of the ancient Britons, the Jutes, the Angles, the Saxons, the Norsemen, the Danes, and the Normans in England, but all these peoples cannot be classified in the racial sense simply as Englishmen. Similarly, the varied types of humanity who are Aryan in speech cannot all be regarded as representatives of the “Aryan race”, that is, if we accept the theory of an “Aryan race”, which Virchow, by the way, has characterized as “a pure fiction”. (author’s emphasis) Max Müller in his closing years, faced this aspect of the problem frankly and courageously. “Aryas”, he wrote, “are those who speak Aryan languages, whatever their colour, whatever their blood. In calling them Aryas we predicate nothing of them except that the grammar of their language is Aryan. . . . I have declared again and again that if I say Aryas, I mean neither blood, nor bones, nor hair, nor skull; I mean simply those who speak an Aryan language. The same applies to Hindus, Greeks, Romans, Germans, Celts, and Slays. When I speak of these I commit myself to no anatomical characteristics. The blue-eyed and fair-haired Scandinavians may have been conquerors or conquered, they may have adopted the language of their darker lords or their subjects, or vice versa. I assert nothing beyond their language when I call them Hindus, Greeks, Romans, Germans, Celts, and Sla[v]s, and in that sense, and in that sense only, do I say that even the blackest Hindus represent an earlier stage of Aryan speech and thought than the fairest Scandinavians. . . . To me an ethnologist who speaks of an Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar.” Aside from random chance, West Asians (“Europeans”) do not descend from Aryans, regardless of which language they speak, and they know it. They either don’t know their origins, or are hiding them: The desire to have ancestors as illustrious and grand as possible can be found with all European peoples. The Romans believed their ancestors to origin from Troy.The medieval Spanish aristocracy put emphasis on their superior Visigothic blood which not only made them different from their subjects but also put them above them.The French continue to become chronic schizophrenics as soon as they are to decide whether they are descendants either of Vercingetorix and the Gauls (Celts) or of Charles The Great (Charlemagne) and the Franks (Teutons).Some English seemingly not satisfied with their mix of Briton, Anglo-Saxonian, Viking and Norman predecessors still found it necessary to have one lost tribe of Israel driven to their coasts in order to make sure they have even older and religiously more important ancestors.Now the Germans meant to see the roots of their own history in the changes caused by the very migration of the peoples that had caused the illustrious ancestors of their neighbors. Considering that even Tacitus mentioned that the Teutons were “of pure blood”, not at all mixed with other races and (therefore) authochtone, there seemed to be hardly any reason to doubt their Northern European origin.When the Church needed a relation to the bible, Ashkenaz, one of Japhet’s grandsons, was found who discovered a way to Northern Europe and thus established the Teutons even within this frame. Especially during the time of Reformation one was proud to be different from the degenerated and corrupt Roman world. [4] Essentially, they are inventing their origins as they go along. It is a peculiar habit of western Asian (“European”) culture that continues today. In academic discussions, such efforts should be seen as nothing other than absurd. Under Christian influence, Europeans claimed biblical heritage. Soon, another group came from the heart of Asia- the steppes- and they, too, had a claim to biblical lineage. They were the Khazarian converts to Talmudic Judaism. (If you’ve noticed, most Ashkenazi Jews hail back to areas in or around the Eurasian steppes- the same location as Khazaria). The fact that they were racially similar, but culturally distant from these arriving Jews compounded the problem settled Europeans had had with Jews from pre-Christian days (Roman Empire). So they expelled them hundreds of times. And they looked for a new, non-Biblical heritage to attach themselves to.

A fault occurs when the current increases because a short circuit allows the current to flow through a shorter circuit without flowing through the load. the circuit breaker is installed in the circuit to protect the conductor from overheating. when the current increases due to this short circuit the circuit breaker operates (pops) to protect the conductor from damage.

Our hotel was ground central for people going to the convention, it was very weird. I’d heard of bronies but had never encountered them. Seeing an adult male in a pony costume drinking White Russians at the bar was…different. My wife and I sat in comfy chairs and watched the parade. To be fair, at one point, I struck up a conversation with a normal looking woman at the bar. I asked her what she thought of the participants. She was there for the convention. She told me that her daughter was severely autistic, and My Little Pony is very popular among people with autism. The people who put on the convention are very good at accommodating their needs.

What terrible answers that paint a false narrative. I’m using this answer to call you guys out. Anyone who defends Will Smith or Jada is a joke. Chris Rock’s job is to be a comedian. He’s meant to make comedy and jokes out of things, places, events, and people. That includes Jada. She’s not immune to a joke. And here’s the thing. If you actually look at the footage, you can clearly see Will Smith laughing along with the joke. It’s until Jada gives the stink eye that Will reacts. With the recent videos that have been resurfaced, it’s not surprising. Jada mentally abused Will Smith. That’s no secret. She decides to have a relationship with a rapper who’s friends with her son… yeah… and then the video of Will Smith basically begging Jada to stop is just another sign of that. The only reason he stays with her is because he does believe in multiple chances and wants to stay faithful. It’s not bad, but if I were in his shoes, I would divorce her immediately. Anybody who acts like Jada should not be in a relationship. Simple as that. Will Smith’s break down in the Oscars reflects that. It’s sad, but even that doesn’t excuse him from anything. So making the excuse that “he was simply defending his wife” is a pathetic cover up.

Reason? Just so that they don’t have to deal with opposing opinions. Simple as that. Don’t believe me? Look at their comment sections. Oh yeah, they disabled them. It shows that they know what their intentions are and that deep down, they know Will Smith was in the wrong. It would’ve made sense if Chris Rock came up to them in the street and started teasing and poking fun at Jada for no reason. But he’s on stage now. He’s in his profession. And he’s going to make jokes. If you can’t take a joke, live with it. But it most certainly does not excuse one of walking up and slapping said comedian.

Its design is stunning and symmetrical. The theme rooms are covered in fine detail and color, as well as extravagant and exclusive chandeliers and artworks of art. 2. Antilia, Mumbai, India. Estimated at 82 billion rupees (£906million) This could be the most luxurious home in the world. While constructing a 27-story house within one of the poorest areas of the globe might seem a bit boastful and naive, Makes Ambani (India's richest man) is not convinced. The house is 400,000 square feet with 27-foot ceilings. It is now known that the structure can withstand an earthquake that could be deadly. 3. Villa Leopolda, Cote D’Azure, France. This estate of 50 acres includes a large greenhouse and a pool house. It also has an outdoor kitchen and a guest house. The property is the home of Lily Safra, a Brazilian philanthropist! Comparatively to other properties, it doesn't offer the same amount of value, in terms of value, despite its price. It is however located in a tranquil, stunning rural area of France which means that it's worth the EUR661million (£567million) could be well worth it! 4. Villa Les Cedres, French Riviera, France. The 18,000 square foot villa is a true royal paradise. It was built for King Louis XIV of Belgium in 1830, the royal style is still a part of the house, where it is filled with stunning masterpieces of art, exquisite antique furniture, and luxurious bedding. Additionally, the house has 14 bedrooms and a swimming pool that is Olympic size, and a ballroom. It also has a library that holds 3,000 books and a stable large enough to house 30 horses!

Four Fairfield Pond, New York, USA. We were sure that New York would pop up at some point - this property of 63 acres is home to Ira Renner, owner of the Renco Group (a holding investment firm in the field of auto manufacturing and melting). The house has three bedrooms and 29 beds, glowing swimming pools, a 91-foot dining area, and its private energy plant, the house is certainly a costly one! What's more? It's a fantastic piece of land for people who love to be active and athletic It also has a basketball court, a bowling court, squash courts, and tennis courts... Wow! 6. Ellison Estate, California, USA. In the Woodside is this 200 million (£151million) estate that is owned by Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle. Due to its price, it holds 10 distinct properties, including an artificial lake as well as a tea house and bathhouse and all have a stunning lodge-like style inside and out. With fireplaces made of stone, comfortable velvet couches, and wood pillars, this property is the perfect wooden house with stunning views of the lake. 7. Palazzo di Amore, California, USA. It's not a surprise to learn that the most costly house on the planet is located in Beverly Hills. Jeff Greene, a successful estate businessman and an American politician is the owner of this gorgeous property that is truly the perfect holiday destination. It is home to 13 bedrooms and 23 bathrooms tennis courts, a massive swimming pool that features waterfalls along with a 27-car garage, and even a movie theater and ballroom! The thing we like about this home is that every house has its own individual style. It is valued at 195 million (£147million) it is surely one of the most expensive luxury homes. 8. Seven The Pinnacle, Montana, USA. This gorgeous house is the biggest property within the Yellowstone Club (a private ski and golf club for the extremely wealthy). This home does not only have a stunning, lodge-style design both inside and out, it is situated in an area in which there are either lots of green or plenty of snow so that you'll get the idea of both!

Charged Battery weighs slightly more than uncharged. When it is charged, it has more energy than when it is uncharged. This means when the battery is charged it will weigh slightly more than when it is uncharged. The formula, E=mC^2 gives relation between energy and mass. that gives, m = E/C^2 When you plug in your charger... you actually store potential energy in the battery and hence as you charge, you put in an extra energy and hence, an extra mass. Considering a phone's battery which is 3.7 V and 2000 mAh. The maximum amount of energy that can be stored = voltage multiplied by capacity in Ah. Consider a discharged battery,,,, typically weighing about 40g. Energy stored = 0 J On a full charge, extra energy supplied = 3.7 * 2 = 7.4 J Mass equivalent = 7.4/c^2 = 8.22 * 10^(-14) g. ie... now your battery weighs about 40.00000000000000008222222222 g. 2. Fully loaded flash-drive weighs more than an empty one. Let's remind ourselves about what data really is. Data is 1's and 0's stored on some medium. For flash storage the 1's and 0's are stored by trapping electrons. These electrons have a weight of [math]1[/math][math]/[/math][math]1820[/math] unit which is the equivalent of 1.7×10^(-24) grams. The more data a flash drive stores on it, the more electrons are trapped. For 4GB of data, the difference between full and empty is 10^(-18) grams. For 32GB, it'd be 8 times of that.

You can get Electrical shocks from DC adapters i.e. your mobile, laptop chargers, USB ports, Audio/Video jacks et.c.(Usually people believe that DC circuits can not deliver shocks). laptop and mobile chargers have Switch mode power supply (SMPS) inside them and there can be a leakage across transformer due to some coupling capacitors(Y capacitors) between primary and secondary winding of transformer. Such devices should be fitted with Three pin Plug(one for passing leakage current to earth), but unfortunately they are not. the reason people usually do not get shocks from these device is the plastic casing. you can see the glowing tester touched to the metallic body of a mobile phone which is connected to a DC adapter/charger. 4. You can get electrical shocks from a electronic device or circuit which is not live(offline) or not connected to any wall socket or battery. Electronic devices some time have very large capacitors(e.g. laptop chargers) which has stored charge in it, one can get a heavy shock if both the terminal of the capacitor is accidentally touched. 5. One can use our physical earth/ground as an electrical path or just like a conducting wire. You do not need to run a couple of wire from electric power station to your house, a single wire(positive/live) is enough. the another (negative/neutral) can be connected to physical ground. because in power stations one of the terminal of the generator is connected to ground. 6.

However, Pharoah Ikhnaton chose to be shown as he really was and had some physical disabilities that he tried to overcome while serving his people and family as a good and just ruler. His belief in one God is why he got into a lot of trouble with his own people and led to his downfall. One of my great uncles, the late Dr. AO Steele, who was the chairman of the Division of the Humanities at Johnson C. Smith University in Charlotte, NC and also an activist in the Civil Rights Movement in the late 1950 and well into the 1960s, wrote a sermon during the early years of WWII and mentioned him as someone to admire because he stood up for his beliefs. The sermon is called “A Sermon for Today” and can be located in the Archives at the JCSU Library in the AO and Dot Steele Papers. He was a hero of mine and was one of my dad’s uncles.

I say it past tense because our younger is graduating from high school in six weeks at the age of 17 and a few weeks. Their mother and I are of high IQ. Top 2%. And our daughters’ have higher. Our younger started school a year early. And we home educated them until they completed 7th and 6th grade. They were regularly engaged in conversation with peers above and below their ages and engaged in presentations and rhetoric. They learned to think for themselves quite a bit. And they learned to appropriately challenge the US Education / Widget-making system by simply saying “we aren’t playing your game and we don’t have to.” They did so with our permission and with respect. (I paraphrased). They are both hard-working and have made it a point to avoid boredom of the typically gifted children by engaging in more challenging offerings as well as extra-curricular activities. My older daughter, just completing her freshman year, is carrying over a 3.3 cumulative GPA in public relations, on a significant scholarship, acting in extracurricular theatre, and working 2 part time jobs. This summer, she is editing (grammar, punctuation, and spelling) for a professor. She also co-SecGenned a Model United Nations conference as a senior in high school. Her 5th year participating.

In many cases, it is the wall between what it is and what it could have been. It helps you approach a random stranger at a conference and check for potential job opportunity. It can win you an interview over other brighter and better candidates. It puts courage in your legs to walk to your crush and ask her out for a drink. It helps you blend quickly when your friend takes you to a trip with his other friends. It empowers you to leave your comfort zone, take risk and face new challenges. It pushes you to go on stage and sing your favorite song in single Karaoke. And it enables you to put your foot down when needed. In case of failures, it helps you to spring back. It enables you to prepare harder because you know that you are larger than that last stupid interview. It helps you put a smile on your face while facing all the stumbling blocks on your path because you know that you have it in you to convert these into stepping stones. They say, “The moment you doubt whether you can fly, you cease for ever to be able to do it.” Self-confidence bridges the distance between you and your dreams. It gives power to act. It is the foundation of success and achievement.

I know they charge for instruction.","completion":"Former members of the organization have raised concerns about the group's practices, alleging that it uses high-pressure sales tactics and promotes a culture of secrecy and obedience. Some critics have also raised concerns about the organization's financial practices and the way in which it solicits donations from its members. Real meditation is no money. No pressure. No stress. No cult. Daily, you train on your own. 60 minutes in the morning. 60 minutes in the evening. 14 hours per week. When people can have more calm hours each week, naturally their life would improve. Mantra is not universal. On the other hand our breath is universal. Also, mantra is a method of distraction. It doesn’t promote and allow our hidden emotion to surface up. With a calm lake, you can see through the water. If you keep mixing the water with a stick, you can not see through water. There is no real clarity with mantra. Meditation is not a business. Meditation is letting go. Meditation is not to control. Meditation is let it be. Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Sam who loved playing outside with his friends. They would run around, play games, and have fun together. One day, Sam's mom told him about a special kind of activity that could help him feel even happier and more peaceful. She called it \\"meditation.\\" Sam was curious, so he asked his mom to show him how to meditate. She led him to a quiet room in the house and had him sit comfortably on a cushion. Then she showed him how to take a deep breath in, and slowly let it out. She told him to repeat this a few times, and to focus his attention on his breath. At first, Sam found it a little hard to stay focused. His mind kept wandering to thoughts of playing outside and having fun with his friends. But his mom reminded him to gently bring his attention back to his breath each time he got distracted. As he continued to meditate, something magical happened. Sam started to feel more and more relaxed. His body felt lighter, and his mind felt calmer. He noticed that his thoughts were slowing down, and he was feeling more peaceful. After a few minutes, Sam's mom gently brought him out of his meditation. When he opened his eyes, he felt like he was in a completely different world. Everything looked brighter and more beautiful, and he felt more connected to the world around him. From that day on, Sam made a regular practice of meditation. Sometimes he would sit alone in his room, and sometimes he would meditate with his mom or friends. But no matter where or how he did it, he always felt a sense of peace and happiness from this simple practice. And so, Sam learned that meditation could be a wonderful tool for calming his mind and finding a sense of inner peace. Mom will not charge you 1,000 to learn meditation from her.

The main advantage of the anchor chain is as follows As mentioned earlier, it's not exactly the anchor which prevents the ship from dragging /drfiting while the ship is anchored, it's merely the weight if the chain/rope attached, and, since the chain has more weight, it's more efficient in holding the ship in place. In fact it can be conveniently said that with a long enough chain, the anchor is not needed at all. This is probably is one of the most important reason to use chains on bigger ships rather than wire ropes. Other important reason is that Chains are more wear resistant than steel ropes and have less chafing and erosion over time."},{"prompt":"the eyes of a hedge fund employee, what is it specifically about retail stock traders that makes most of them so incredibly inept at trading stocks?","completion":"Answering this from the perspective of a fund manager, the reason why most people fail at investing is due to the illusion of expertise. And by most people, I mean probably 10/10 retail investors, 9/10 analysts and 4/5 fund managers. It is hard to know what you don’t know. The more ignorant you are, the more confident you become. For illustration, a retail investor thesis for say Domino’s Pizza (DPZ) would probably sound like this “Everybody loves pizza”. When the thesis should sound like this DPZ biz model is such that they offload capital expenditure to the franchisee yet they take royalty i.e no capital outlay for additional revenue streamFranchisee has to exclusively buy dough, raw material from DPZDPZ made strategic decision to serve delivery and forego dine in thus reduce their stores to 1,500 sq ft. This reduce cost. In contrast, Pizza Hut has a confused strategy of both dine in and deliveryIt is hard for a competitor to challenge DPZ store count and economies of scaleIt is hard for other franchise e.g. McD, KFC to enter the pizza biz as they have configured their kitchen for their own menuA new franchisee will recoup store cost in X years. This attracts new franchisee into the systemLocal pizza restaurants will never be able to build out DPZ global logistics and ITA pizza has a margin of X. Of this, Y goes to DPZDPZ balance sheet is X. Assuming Y royalty, and Z store growth, you are looking at ROI of XYZEtc This is just a short example to illustrate the amount of work that goes in to come up with an investment thesis. I’ve described the above qualitatively but really all these are backed up by precise numbers. Retail investor barely spent 1% of the time required to properly develop a thesis. Most of the time, their “research” consists of just reading the news or extrapolating a rising stock chart. Worse, they don’t have the necessary skill sets in terms of accounting, finance, stock market history, frauds, entrepreneurship, biz history, sector knowledge. It’s like thinking you can do brain surgery because you watched a YouTube video. That’s why they are destined to lose."},{"prompt":"w much does a partial piles laser treatment cost in Ahmedabad?","completion":"Laser piles treatment is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to treat hemorrhoids or piles. It involves the use of laser energy to precisely remove or shrink the hemorrhoidal tissue. Here are some advantages of laser piles surgery: Minimally invasive: Laser piles treatment is considered a minimally invasive procedure. It involves the use of a laser beam to target and treat the affected tissue without the need for large incisions. This can result in less post-operative pain, faster recovery, and minimal scarring compared to traditional open surgeries.Precision: Laser technology allows for precise targeting of the affected tissue. The laser beam can be controlled to remove or shrink the hemorrhoids while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.Reduced bleeding: Laser energy can effectively seal blood vessels during the procedure, resulting in reduced bleeding compared to traditional surgeries. This can lead to a decreased risk of complications such as excessive bleeding or blood clots.Reduced post-operative discomfort: Laser piles surgery is generally associated with less post-operative pain and discomfort. This is because it involves minimal trauma to the surrounding tissue and nerve endings.Faster recovery: Due to its minimally invasive nature, laser piles treatment typically allows for a faster recovery compared to traditional open surgeries. Patients may experience less downtime and can resume their normal activities sooner.

What may be the problem?","completion":"There may be nothing to resolve. It is not unusual for the system side to have a higher pressure than the inlet side. The pressure on the system side is trapped by the alarm (check) valve. The pressure on the inlet side varies over time due to demand on the system, pressure surges; supply-side system valves opening and dropping pressure, and supply-side system valves slamming shut causing pressure surges or spikes. These pressure surges lift the alarm (check valve) allowing the higher pressure in, and then when the pressure drops, the alarm (check) valve closes trapping the higher pressure in the system. Higher pressure in the system can be beneficial. Higher pressure means that the alarm (check) valve will rarely open, reducing the possibility of false alarms if the system is connected to a fire alarm system. The only drawback could be if the pressure is higher than the maximum allowed by the system design. If this is the case, the excess pressure could be bled off by opening the inspector’s test drain. In the US, at the most remote point of the system is a drain valve called the inspector’s test drain. It is designed to simulate the flow of a single sprinkler head. If you very briefly opened this valve, you could drop pressure somewhat on the system side. The downside to doing this is you may trip the fire alarm if one is connected to the system, as that is the purpose of the inspectors' test drain. Another option is to briefly open the main drain. However, the main drain is large and may quickly drop the system pressure down to the same as the supply side, leaving you open to the possibility that a surge will trip the fire alarm more easily. A qualified sprinkler system technician can easily check to see if it is an issue and correct it."},{"prompt":"What is social media listening?","completion":"Absolutely, [LINKED_TEXT: social media marketing] [URL: https://ucds.in/social-media-marketing-company-in-chandigarh] can significantly benefit your business in today's digital landscape.

MIT students are constantly told and repeatedly reminded of how smart they are, how they are among the “top few”. This could lead to an inflated sense of superiority and knowledge. Hollywood actor Matt Damon, in his MIT commencement 2016 address speech talks about this in a much more eloquent way than I ever could. First, you’re going to fail sometimes, and that’s a good thing. For all the amazing successes I’ve been lucky to share in, few things have shaped me more than the auditions that Ben and I used to do as young actors — where we would get on a bus, show up in New York, wait for our turn, cry our hearts out for a scene, and then be told, “OK, thanks.” Meaning: game over. We used to call it “being OK thanksed.” Those experiences became our armor. So now you’re thinking, that’s great, Matt. Failure is good. Thanks a ton. Tell me something I didn’t hear at my high school graduation. To which I say: OK, I will! You know the real danger for MIT graduates? It’s not getting “OK thanksed.” The real danger is all that smoke that’s been blown up your ... graduation gowns about how freaking smart you are. Well, you are that freaking smart! But don’t believe the hype that’s thrown at you. You don’t have all the answers. And you shouldn’t. And that’s fine. You’re going to have your share of bad ideas. For me, one was playing a character named “Edgar Pudwhacker.” I wish I could tell you I’m making that up. But as the great philosopher, Benjamin Affleck, once said: “Judge me by how good my good ideas are, not by how bad my bad ideas are.” You’ve got to suit up in your armor, and get ready to sound like a total fool. Not having an answer isn’t embarrassing. It’s an opportunity. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. MIT folks are smart, talented and driven to make a difference. But that, by no means, should imply that we have all the answers, or that we need to."},{"prompt":"Why is “Boycott UAE” trending on Twitter?","completion":"Apprently Islamists of Pakistan who along with the Islamists in Bharat were creating a trend last month about how Arab countries will be coming to put Bharat to task for trying to fight the terrorism and violence as per their view.

I was never the athletic type throughout my life. Add that to the fact that I loved eating all kinds of junk food and sweets, the lifestyle never really favored my body. I was really conscious of my body and was never without a shirt/t-shirt in front of anyone. I knew I had a weirdly shaped body and that brought down confidence levels way too much. I had man-boobs and a mega tummy but no motivation to do anything about it-I had given up before I had even attempted to make any changes . And my job? IT(Information Technology). An absolute sedentary lifestyle enveloped me. I wore t-shirts of size XL or XXL at times and had a waist of over 36 inches. I was not what the definition of fat would be, but I was unhealthy. Moving out of my home city caused a newfound independence and I ate, drank and smoked to my heart’s content. Then sometime early in 2015, an awakening happened somewhere. I convinced myself to hit the gym and set small goals or myself.Initially, the goals were never calories burned or calories consumed; it was just a simple goal of walking or running on the treadmill everyday for a minimum of 1 hour. With each day, it kind of became an addiction- going to the gym and sweating. I knew there was no change to be seen quickly and I had to persevere- something I was rally bad at. So I decided to control my eating habits but not do any kinds of diets or anything of that sort. I told myself I would drink less, eat at mealtimes only and smoke less. As with people our age(I am 27 btw!) at times, the drinking and smoking went overboard during parties or on weekends. But nevertheless, I took a lot of time, cut down on sweets, alcohol ,smoke, junk food, had home cooked food mostly but didn’t completely stop everything except for the smoking and I am still on a good run. The trick which I have understood and will tell you(after experimenting with lots of routines, workouts, food habits etc) is that your body will adapt to anything you subject it to at a stretch. I cut down on sweets for a stretch and my body didn’t crave for it anymore. I cu down on junk food at a stretch and my body didn’t want it anymore. It adapted to the new kind of lifestyle it was exposed to. Once you have lost all that weight and kept your body going at all the cuts you did, its actually difficult to gain back the weight even. For all those looking for more tips on shedding weight, do what I did, cut down and persevere at the gym.(You may actually do it faster if you follow a proper diet and workout everyday unlike me :D ) .For someone who was zero athletic all his life, I cannot imagine not going to the gym today; even if its just for 30 minutes of walking or some stretches or pushups, I need to be there now. All just because my body is adapted to that lifestyle now. My t-shirts size is now Medium and waist below 32 inches and I have never felt better. I feel fit and have more energy, sleep just the needed bit and eat just the needed bit. FYI- I learnt all my workouts from friends and YouTube and Apps. If anyone wants links that could really help, I’d be happy to share them. :) These 5 years have really taught me to believe in my own self. The independence, the realization of unhealthiness have had their pros and cons in my life and I would like the failures to be stepping stones to my success and I am trying hard to turn things around for the better in the long run."},{"prompt":"the UK, can a resident get him/herself checked (e.g. blood tests, scans) for cancer free of charge on NHS?

My GP offers these if you are over fifty. You are seen by the practice nurse and any issues are followed up. In Scotland we also have a three yearly bowel screening programme where a kit is sent out to you in the post. There has to be a clinical reason for scans so you just can't ask for one.

All of existence is/has/will be created to experience itself, people over-explain or personify “god”, but simply put, this is what “god” is. All of existence has been created to experience itself, we were given “life” that allows us to experience. These two functions along with physical reality allow us to “experience” what is “all of existence”. Nobody can simplify this answer more, anyone who gives any more information is wasting your time.

One thing you learn early on working in the software development or IT world is that “nothing ever dies”. Which isn’t quite true - because eventually companies can’t buy enough replacement parts off ebay to keep their computers running. But that takes decades. Seriously. I wrote software in the 1980’s that I know was still running in the 2000’s. Companies literally kept those ancient computers running by buying parts off the Internet because nobody had manufactured parts for many, many years. Java and .NET are both extremely widely used. Most numbers show that there’s more Java than .NET in the enterprise, but both are dominant over anything else (other than COBOL (?) and JavaScript). And both Java and .NET are under very active development and modernization, with rapid advancements over the past few years to better support mobile devices, container-based environments, and more. If you compare building a web site or service using Spring Boot and aspnet core they are so incredibly similar it is almost a line-for-line match! The real question you should ask, in my opinion, is whether there’s anything on the horizon that might eat into the dominant market share Java and .NET currently enjoy? Things like node.js (though it has fallen away in popularity), or GoLang, or Rust come to mind. And we don’t yet know the real impact of WebAssembly. There’s already support for WebAssembly from .NET, but Go and Rust are quite attractive in this space because they generate such small binaries. To summarize, Java and .NET both appear to have bright futures. Neither seems to be growing at the expense of the other, and any disruption is likely to come from other sources."},{"prompt":"Should students be encouraged to take the SAT and ACT?","completion":"ACT VS. SAT- WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE? WHAT IS ACT? The ACT is an entrance examination governed by the ACT organisation. It is a multiple-choice question, 3-hour exam that comprises of four different sections in the test booklet. They are English, Mathematics, Reading and Science papers with an addition Essay based Writing test of 40 minutes that the students can opt for. The purpose of the ACT is to measure the student's willingness and determination to join a college and to provide colleges with current data to decide who they accept in their college. The ACT is such an important test because it uses the statistics to judge the student's preparedness to join the college and to decide which student is categorised to be accepted. WHAT IS SAT? Scholastic Aptitude Test or SAT is a standardised test which is a crucial constituent of your college application. It is just like the ACT, a multiple choice question and 3-hour examination that comprises of three different sections in the test booklet. They are Critical Reading, Mathematics and Writing of 50 minutes. The purpose of the SAT is to decide whether or not the student has acceptable capabilities and to provide the colleges with an idea of which student is better in comparison to the other students. WHAT ARE THE 10 KEY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOTH OF THEM? Both the ACT and SAT are acceptable in the majority of the colleges. However, there are undoubtedly significant differences in both of these entrance exams that you should look into before deciding to take any one of them. · SAT gives you more time per question since there are only two main sections in the test booklet: Critical Writing and Maths. · Unlike ACT, the SAT does not have a Science section which makes it easier for students who are weak in this subject. · ACT has a broader concept of mathematical testing like geometry, matrices, trigonometry and logarithms than the SAT. · Maths is twice as relevant in the SAT because it accounts for almost have the question paper, so if you're weak in maths, it is better that you go for the ACT. · ACT has a total score of 36 points while the SAT has an overall rating of 1600 points. · ACT also gives up to five choices each math question, unlike SAT, that gives only four. · ACT has no evidence supported reading that asks you to cite specific lines as evidence to your question. · Reading questions in the SAT follow a simple chronology that can be understood by revising the passages while ACT follows a random flow of questions. · SAT also has a no calculator rule for specific questions in their test booklet. ACT has no such rule. · SAT does not ask for your perspective in the essay, while ACT essays are primarily based on how the essay affects your opinion and how you strongly agree or disagree with the author.

The point is that a high-voltage source with high internal resistance may not give you much of a shock at all while a lower voltage source with low internal resistance may kill you. Very small currents can be imperceptible. Larger current passing through the body may make it impossible for a shock victim to let go of an energized object.Still larger currents can cause fibrillation of the heart and damage to tissues. Death caused by an electric shock is called electrocution. An electrical injury has many consequences to a body as the electrical currents can travel through the nervous system and burn out tissue in patches along the way. Thanks!

The 3D angle between two vectors is not determined by the 2D angles between their projections into the various coordinate planes. It took me longer than it seems in retrospect it should have done to find a counterexample, but here one is. Let [math]pi_{x,y}[/math], [math]pi_{x,z}[/math], and [math]pi_{y,z}[/math] be the projection maps onto the respective coordinate planes. We wish to stay away from vectors whose image under any of these equals the zero vector, i.e. those which are scalar multiples of any of the elementary basis vectors for [math]R^3[/math], to avoid any of the 2D angles being undefined. So here is a counterexample. Let [math]v_1=left< 1,1,1 right>[/math] and [math]v_2=left< -1,-1,1 right>[/math], and let [math]w_1=left< 1,1,2 right>[/math] and [math]w_2=left< -1,-1,1/2 right>[/math]. We then have [math]pi_{x,y}(v_1)=left< 1,1 right>[/math], [math]pi_{x,y}(v_2)=left< -1,-1 right>[/math], and the angle between these is [math]arccos left( frac{-2}{sqrt{2}sqrt{2}} right)=pi[/math], while [math]pi_{x,y}(w_1)=left< 1,1 right>[/math], [math]pi_{x,y}(w_2)=left< -1,-1 right>[/math], and the angle between these is also [math]arccos left( frac{-2}{sqrt{2}sqrt{2}} right)=pi[/math]. Meanwhile, [math]pi_{x,z}(v_1)=left< 1,2 right>[/math], [math]pi_{x,z}(v_2)=left< -1,1/2 right>[/math], and the angle between these is [math]arccos(0)=pi/2[/math], while [math]pi_{x,z}(w_1)=left< 1,2 right>[/math], [math]pi_{x,z}(w_2)=left< -1,1/2 right>[/math] as well, and the angle between these is also [math]arccos(0)=pi/2[/math]. Similarly, since [math]pi_{x,z}[/math] and [math]pi_{y,z}[/math] agree on the vectors [math]v_1[/math], [math]v_2[/math], [math]w_1[/math], and [math]w_2[/math], the angle between the images of [math]v_1[/math] and [math]v_2[/math] under [math]pi_{y,z}[/math] is [math]pi/2[/math] and so is the angle between the images of [math]w_1[/math] and [math]w_2[/math]. Thus the projected images of [math]v_1[/math] and [math]v_2[/math] into each of the coordinate planes have the same angles between them as do the projected images of [math]w_1[/math] and [math]w_2[/math]. But finally, the angle between [math]v_1[/math] and [math]v_2[/math] is [math]arccos left( frac{-1}{sqrt{3}sqrt{3}} right)=arccos left( frac{-1}{3} right)[/math] while the angle between [math]w_1[/math] and [math]w_2[/math] is [math]arccos left( frac{-1}{sqrt{6}sqrt{9/4}} right)=arccos left( frac{-sqrt{2}}{3 sqrt{3}} right)[/math], and these are not the same. It would be nice to find a counterexample with vectors which are somehow in more general position than the above vectors, but it wasn’t until I considered these somewhat special vectors that I could see the forrest for the trees and find any counterexample at all. It seems like there are many related questions which may be interesting, like what possible triples of projected angles are even possible, and then how much leeway does one have in finding angles which can project to any such triple."},{"prompt":"At what age should I start coaching for the CEH exam?","completion":"Ideally 2 years before you are looking for job.

School is hard. I'm not ranting like other teenagers. Please try to understand. This year, after having full year of online classes,we're expected to give offline board exams in amidst of this pandemic. I study in a renowned school of Kolkata (not taking name or else they might take measures against me). I am a person who's scared of socializing with new people. I didn't make much friends, or I should use the word any. Academics deteriorating. It's been too hard. Teachers scolding, breaking parent’s expectations - it just feels that I'm wasting money. In class 12, teachers in our school took advantage of everything and called my parents too many times. I couldn't give offline preboards because of fever. Many students didn't give, the ones that did got really poor marks. They completed syllabus too early and from October, every week, we had exams. We needed time to study well. Today, when practical exams already on schedule, they decided to take online classes, and also demotivated us. It is true that I'm a disappointment but at least I had made myself stronger and made my mind that I will do good in boards. They broke me. More to come because they'll call my parents too and my parents will not only verbally abuse (yes, I used the word ‘abuse’) me but maybe beat me up. This year maybe due to rising covid case, exams may not happen. If like last year, exams are cancelled and preboards marks go to official results, I'm done. Students are the most ignored citizens of India. A global pandemic is going on and still we're expected to give exams. This shows studies are more important than health. Health is not about physical health only, it consists of mental health too. It's hard writing with hands shaking and heart pounding on your chest and having difficulty in breathing. I'm sorry mom and dad for behaving so badly these days. It's just school is being too hard on me. If a parent or teacher is reading this, I really request that try to understand your child instead of scolding. I know your life is hard but that doesn't mean ours is easy. Sometimes I just don't feel like living but I have to. I know one day I'll overcome this or succumb to it. ————————————Nibbi (#thebonggirl)"},{"prompt":"Did you ever think that if you could convince 1 million people to give you only 1 miserable dollar you would become a millionaire?","completion":"Yes, but keep in mind that a lot of people lives with around a “miserable” dollar a day."},{"prompt":"What is the most lucrative AWS certifications to get?","completion":"Hello, The most lucrative AWS certifications to get can vary depending on your specific skills and career goals, but here are some of the most in-demand certifications: AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate: This certification validates your ability to design and deploy scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant systems on AWS.

Once the humans of this earth have spread enough hatred, enough greed, enough selfishness, enough egotism and self centredness, everywhere, then there will come a time that there will be no stopping to World War 3. Then all humans can do is see their loved ones die right before eyes and cry blood stained tears ! I hope it's taken as a wake up call to meditate, ignore mass media lies and divisive and hate propaganda, let go of identities, understand that we are not the ego, we are not our various identities, we are not the masks that we wear for our self-propagation and selfishness and remember that we are not the physical body but divine beings having a human existence. Embroiled in divisiveness and constant battles and identities and various roles and propaganda and agendas forced upon us, we are made to do negative things, behave in a negative way that we would otherwise would not behave or do !Our lives are a lie, our very lives, our personalities have become a lie as fake as the stories we are told by the main stream media and our universities, institutes and researchers. We have come to rely too much on the 'outside' information and hence have progressively become easy to manipulate and 'influence' through the decades, since advertising and public announcements and public speaking and marketing campaigns began. We were taught to fear the 'unknown', fear this, fear that and it worked ! We would buy things due to irrational fears planted within us through these marketing agents with the help of their advertising campaigns. Many whole nations during WW1 and WW2 were even 'advertised' why wars are the 'inevitable need of the moment' and their soldiers must fight (read : die) these sham wars. What's the use if anyone would care to ask ? Despite all the world soldiers fighting in miserable conditions, many civilians still lost their lives by tens of millions in all the various parts of the world. It tells a lot about human butchery ! And the mass scale manipulated-ness that was going on during the years and decades of the WW1 and WW2. We, the citizens of the world, had sourced our own miseries by blindly believing all the lies that were fostered in that era and not being able to think for ourselves, being able to do our own 'thinking'. The prime reason for that is we didn't see that we were being divided because the process of division ran and worked through a very cunning devise and mechanism and that of, isolating each nation simultaneously, by cutting them from the rest. developing them into distinct significant groups and militaries each with their own needs and motivations to 'fight', and dreams, goals, military objectives and visions given to each of these by their leaders to 'conquer' the other. This is the simplest possible explanation of how 'War by deception' worked (and works), otherwise how is this rampant worldwide insanity and madness to kill the 'other', to go on a destructive spree, bombing spree, looting and pillaging spree and killing spree is possible ? Isolate each country from the other, now you have your distinct groups each with their own 'identities' with their various nationalities, now double it with each with their own military, and arm them with supplies and 'their own' war time production, triple the effect of worldwide evil and misery (caused by divisive hatred) by lies, propaganda, agendas, fake news by telling its people that the 'other' is the enemy, that the 'other' is the tyrant and we are 'right', we are 'morally correct' and we are 'justified' and there you have it ! Both WW1 and WW2 were were wars by design and they couldn't have taken place in the natural scheme of events ! The ground was made, tilled, readied, fields were ploughed, seeds were sown and wars and mass deaths were its harvest ! And the same forces can very well do it again ! When enough masses of the world harbor enough hatred, enough ill thoughts, enough ill feelings, towards the other, it will become very much possible to fire the first shot, fire the first missile, that would act as a ‘pretext’ for all those ‘hidden’ warmongers, war-profiteers and hate-breeders, who work behind the scenes through cloaks of secrecy, that would trigger the World War 3. And once that happens, mind you, there won't be any stepping back this time because the hatred of the masses around won't allow the people in charge to ! In effect, we, the citizens of the world, will kill ourselves by our own hatred, ill feelings and ill thoughts ! P.S - Observing through controlled madness and insanities and struggle & strive that have been politically going on each country, humanity has been faring well till now and am pleased that around 40% of the masses have already awakened to the fake realities of the world, who would always go on to help the others and debunk the fake MSM news ! I hope this continues and the 'awareness' of wars by deception, wars that have been artificially created and taking place by deception over the decades, over the last couple centuries spreads to all the people of the world, among all the nations of the world. I hope we reach a point where every person, every citizen refuses to take up arms, and every nation refuses to attack the other, exposing the real warmongers and war profiteers who make us, the citizens of the world, fight, kill and die on account of our national fervor, race, religion, ethnicity and even, sociopolitical ideologies, political affiliations these days, mainly on account of our ever lacking awareness ! If the human stupidity and human ignorance has ever been tapped to bring out the very worse, to bring out the very evil, to bring out the devil, to bring out the Satan, in humans, it has been through wars, war crimes, violence, atrocities and global terrorism, and lastly, racial and ethnic cleansings & religious 'holy' wars and clashes, like 'Jihad' and 'Crusades' ! Before that, entire Empires and Civilizations were pitted against the other exploiting the human 'folly' giving rise to bloodied corpses, battlefield massacres and an endless stream of blood flow ! I Hope the entire humanity wakes up from its collective slumber and doesn't repeat such 'ancient glory' ! LOL ! Thank you !"},{"prompt":"Some people argue that developers should not be involved in testing their own codes but that all testing should be the responsibility of a separate team. Give arguments for and against testing by the developers themselves?","completion":"Of course you also need to test your own code. Not testing your own code is a waste of time for the test team. It is not possible to write flawless code for anything but the most trivial of things — so no matter what, the original developer needs to test their own code. It’s the “glass box” vs “closed box” test philosophy — you can fix more obvious flaws while looking inside the box. Once the developer is convinced the code works and all obvious flaws are fixed, then — and only then! — the quality of the code can be further improved by having someone-who-is-not-the-developer test the code. Even code deemed “perfect” or “It works for me” almost inevitably contains at least one more bug, and if you didn’t find one, you possibly didn’t test well enough. Why? the original developer tests to see if the code works; a tester tries to purposely break the code.the pattern of tests done by the original developer will always be different from a tester.a developer might be malicious, and think “yeah i’m done with it”if the developer does not test their own code, the tester will instantly bounce the code back on finding a first issue. This back-and-forth is very inefficient.although the code does not need to perfect, it needs to be good enough before being handed over to the test team. It really should Mostly Work.in an automated test scenario, you can start developing the tests for code before the code is written.a failing test provides more useful feedback than a passing test.passing tests does not mean the code is complete, or maintainable, or even correct. All a passing test means is that the code passes that particular test. It is impossible to write a fully comprehensive set of tests for all cases for anything but the most trivial code.once a test has passed, as the code grows, that test will become stale. It will only suffice to prove that the code in a particular area hasn’t changed to the point of being broken, but it will no longer provide new information."},{"prompt":"What is your review of 'Dil Bechara' (2020 movie)?","completion":"Honest review? It was an okay movie. It might have bombed at the box office. But honestly, when Sushant Singh Rajput entered the screen, it was extremely hard to not get nostalgic, as if I knew him personally. He truly lights up the screen. He plays a cancer patient who is very cheerful, which almost seems fake. Almost as fake cheerful as he seemed in his real life. There is a line in the movie where he declares that ‘we don’t decide when we live or when we die, we can only decide how we live’. That line hit me hard in particular. Did you decide how to live and when to die, Sushant? Is your story continuing in this world? The actress, Sanjana Sanghvi is okay. Not extraordinary. She performs decently and conveys her emotions. Unfortunately her chemistry with Sushant wasn’t anything to write home about. Sahil Vaid was surprisingly fun to watch. Saif Ali Khan has a quick cameo, where he makes a small impression, especially since we can see the change come about in Sushant’s demeanor. The movie tends to drag in the middle. The moment I check my phone without even meaning to, I know I am losing interest fast. The story picked up when he got sick. I thought the scene where he is crying in his grandma’s lap was very well done, well acted. The last scene with a hand made movie, serving as a memoir to Sushant in the film served as an unexpected memoir to him in real life as well. It felt brutal. That is when my tears flowed.

[LINKED_TEXT: Eau de parfums] [URL: https://alphaify.in/] are richer compositions. This is due to their higher concentration of raw materials. But also because perfumers work on notes more intensely. Of course, you’ll also find flowers and citrus fruits, but in deeper, more powerful accords. The base notes are also more present, and they will really permeate the skin and last throughout the day. So eau de parfums have more character than eau de toilettes; they have more contrasts and are more assertive. Eau de toilette This [LINKED_TEXT: perfume category is for fragrances with essential oil or “perfume extract”] [URL: https://alphaify.in/shop] concentrations of between 5 to 15%.It is a light formula and usually in spray bottles.Surprisingly, it is the most popular type of fragrance, and you often buy “perfume” thinking it is eau de parfum and it is actually eau de toilette.It is much more affordable than Eau de Parfum, and can last 2 - 4 hours.Due to the low combination of essential oils and high percentage of alcohol, it tends to dissipate quickly. Eau de toilettes are fairly fresh and light compositions, and are generally more airy than eau de parfum. This is due to a lower concentration, as well as the choice of the ingredients themselves. The most commonly used ingredients are usually fresh citrus notes, delicate flowers, and crunchy fruits. Consequently, an eau de toilette made from a successful eau de parfum will smell a little different because it is a reinterpretation with different, lighter ingredients. These are generally presented as good alternatives for the Spring or Summer season, when your signature fragrance is too intense for the sunny days. The eau de toilettes have a refreshingly spring-like or summery tonality. Eau de cologne The category known as [LINKED_TEXT: Eau de Cologne] [URL: https://alphaify.in/] is one of the lightest fragrance concentrations with essential oils or “perfume extract” of between 2 to 4%.It is often thought of as a masculine formula, however, there are feminine eau de colognes as well.They often come in large bottles as you tend to need more of it and will require regular applications.It can last up to 2 hours and is fairly inexpensive. Eau de colognes are ultra-fresh compositions. They are generally composed mainly of citrus fruits and aromatic plants. The first eau de cologne was invented in the 18th century in Cologne by Jean-Marie Farina. He was the first person to come up with the idea of ​​mixing essential oils with alcohol, to create a freshly scented solution. And it was a real revolution because in the 17th century it was customary to use heady perfumes such as cinnamon or sandalwood oil. People used very strong and heady perfumes to conceal body odours caused by a general lack of hygiene. But as the quality of hygiene improved, people could now opt for lighter compositions."},{"prompt":"What are your late growth spurt stories?","completion":"This is me just after I turned 13 (about 4 years and 8 months ago): 7th grade was a rough time. Clearly, the camera angle and braces don’t help, but puberty has done some wonders since this picture. This is me about a year and a half later, just before freshman year started: My skin cleared up and I started looking like a normal human being. I also felt like one since I wasn’t right in the middle of puberty anymore, which was a major improvement. This is me about 8 months later, towards the end of that year: Skin? Eh. Hair? Better. Self esteem? At its best in my life (at that point; it still wasn’t great.). This is me the summer between sophomore and junior year: I learned how to curl my hair and how to take care of my natural curls a few months before, which was definitely good. I had also gained a lot more self-confidence in my abilities and my looks since freshman year. This is me this past summer: I learned how to be a decent human being, how to take care of my skin, how to fix my eyebrows (sort of) and how to do some pretty kickass eyeliner. I’d say those are all good things. And here’s me just a couple weeks ago, doing my senior pictures: Not trying to be some kind of narcissistic POS, but I think I look pretty good here, at least compared to a few years back. Thank goodness for puberty and increased self-esteem. However, my face and body aren’t the only things that have changed. I’ve become wiser. I’ve come to realize and accept that boys aren’t the most important thing in my life right now and that I should not make them such (because let’s be honest, high school sweethearts who don’t get divorced by the time they’re 30 are extremely rare). I’ve accepted that popularity is usually a bunch of b.s. or a result of high socialization, and this has actually led to me being able to be friends with people who are “popular” and who aren’t, as opposed to just the people who blame others or the world for their non-popularity (something I used to do often, as much as I hate to admit it.). I barely have any of the same best friends from the last few years; one moved (although she’s still one of my closest friends), another decided to make her boyfriend the most important thing in her life, and some others were lost due to stupid fights. I’m on good terms again with most of these people; we just aren’t as close. That’s okay, though; people change and grow and we can’t be expected to stay with the same people our whole lives and still grow as human beings. As long as the growth is positive and leaving people for it to happen is necessary, it is okay. I always thought that I would have one best friend forever five years ago. We had been best friends for years, but we decided to make a boy (the one who is now her boyfriend) more important than our friendship. It ruined it. We were going to go to the same college, or at least stay somewhat near to each other; now, I’m considering Michigan State and eventually med school and she’s considering a gap year so that she and her boyfriend can go to the same college at the same time. I don’t love her recent choices, and she doesn’t love mine. But that’s okay. We’ll both make our own mistakes and learn the hard way in different ways. Just because our lives are now becoming drastically different doesn’t mean that we can’t accept that and simply agree to disagree (now that we get along again). I never thought I would love myself five years ago. Now, not only am I comfortable with my appearance, I am also happy with sometimes being able to one-up guys in intelligence instead of being nervous that that would make me “unattractive”. If a guy is so insecure that he can’t stand having me be more knowledgeable than him at one thing, then screw him. I’ll find a guy who appreciates me and who I appreciate, even when one of us is better at something than the other. I’m wiser than I was five years ago. I’m smarter. I’m stronger (physically, mentally, and emotionally). I said I would never like coffee; now I don’t know what I would do without it. I said I would definitely be going to a Christian college; now I’m deciding between Central Michigan and Michigan State. I used to love math; then I got to Algebra 2 and that died real quick. I used to say that I wanted a boyfriend; now I want a Doctorate or Ph.D. (although a boyfriend might be nice too, but I’ve got more important goals than that). I said I never wanted kids; I still say that after babysitting eleven year olds, but other than that, I can’t wait to be a mom someday. I’ve changed a lot more than in just appearance in the last five years. And I’m completely okay with that. In fact, I couldn’t imagine being the same at 17 as I was at 12 and 13. I can’t wait to see how I change from now to being 22."},{"prompt":"Will WebAssembly frameworks kill the JavaScript framework?","completion":"it may not kill JavaScript, WebAssembly is definitely going to change the face of front-end web development.

He has his best friend from the platform where he used to paint and later on started earning money through his artwork. He is brilliant at his craft.

If not, can you explain atomic theory and the history of its inception?","completion":"Atoms themselves are not directly observable to the naked eye because they are too small to be seen. However, the effects of atoms are observable through scientific instruments and experiments. Atomic theory is the scientific explanation of the nature and behavior of matter. The theory proposes that all matter is made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms, which cannot be created or destroyed. Atoms combine to form molecules, which make up all of the substances we encounter in our daily lives. The concept of atoms has a long history, dating back to ancient Greece. The philosopher Democritus first proposed the idea that matter was made up of tiny, indivisible particles called atoms around 400 BCE. However, his ideas were not widely accepted at the time. It was not until the 19th century that scientists began to accumulate evidence in support of the atomic theory. John Dalton, a British chemist, proposed a modern version of the atomic theory in the early 1800s. He suggested that elements are made up of atoms, each of which has a unique atomic weight. In the early 20th century, experiments conducted by physicists, including Ernest Rutherford and Niels Bohr, provided more evidence for the atomic theory. Rutherford's experiments with alpha particles showed that atoms have a dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons. Bohr expanded on this model, proposing that electrons orbit the nucleus in specific energy levels. Today, atomic theory is a fundamental part of modern physics and chemistry, and it continues to be refined and updated as new evidence is discovered. While atoms themselves may not be directly observable, the effects of their behavior are observed and measured in a wide range of scientific fields."},{"prompt":"Name one thing that made you smile today?","completion":"Yesterday I was scrolling reels and came across a reel of cartoon show Doraemon's famous movie Three Magical Swordsmen In Hindi — Teen kabil talwarbaaz I decided to re-watch that movie and downloaded it.

In popular usage, karma is often thought of as a kind of cosmic justice or a force that rewards good deeds and punishes bad ones. Whether or not one believes in karma is a matter of personal belief and perspective. Some people believe that karma is a real force that operates in the world, while others may see it as a metaphorical or philosophical concept. It's also important to note that the concept of karma is often more complex than a simple reward-punishment system, and there are different interpretations of how karma operates. In some interpretations, karma can affect a person's current life, not just their next life, and can be influenced by factors such as intention, motivation, and context.

For going into depths of mythology around the British Isles, immerse into the magical stories of England’s fairies, scary creatures, and legendary heroes. Here are a few examples, some famous ones and some that you might not have heard about. Fairy Dogs and magical pathways When you walk in a forest, you often come to crossings, and might remember something about taking the path less taken. For certain crossings, there might even be a path that is indeed less taken, as some have an invisible path that would enable you to not just enter a different part of the forest but also a different world altogether. At some of those crossings, you might meet a rather strange looking dog. Beware - if he managed to bark at you three times, you might be in trouble! Walking these possibly enchanted forests, you might want to avoid strange looking, mythical dogs snooping around the crossings – unless you would indeed be interested in being lost in some magical other-world.

Ghost of a hunter With so many mysterious forests, England cannot be a boring ghost-less place. However, not all of them are there to haunt you or lure you into the darkness. If you ever fancy a visit to Windsor Forest, you might encounter the ghost of Herne the Hunter, who lived during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. Unfortunately, after some offense he committed, he decided to hang himself. Since that moment, he is said to patrol the forest. Locals say he is there in times of need, and would always be a guardian of Windsor Forest to make up for the mistakes of his past.

We're going to learn about people getting into FAANG companies, passing challenging coding interviews, and more. So, don't worry; we'll lay out a detailed roadmap for competitive programming, including how it will benefit you, whether it's required for interviews or not, and other factors. Students who are still unsure of whether this article will be helpful or not will have their needs met by this article. Let's start by defining what Competitive Programming actually is. What is Competitive Programming? Competitive programming is a mental sport, much like other mind sports like chess or any other sports or games. It's more of a game where you have to find faster, more effective, and more conventional ways to solve an issue. You get better at something the more you do it. It is acknowledged as a mind sport throughout the world, and every year a sizable number of contests and competitions are held internationally to promote it. These tournaments offer a variety of prizes, as well as possibilities for interviews with major companies and other benefits. Just to let you know that there are developers who take part in these competitions solely as their work even if it isn't financially rewarding enough. Starting Competitive Programming: Is It Worth It? Due to its distinctiveness, competitive programming has recently become quite popular, and this progressive growth in popularity has attracted a significant number of organizations and individuals to this sport. After shortlisting candidates from these fiercely competitive coding competitions, several startups and businesses have also started holding interview rounds. The ability of the programmer to solve problems is enabled and improved via competitive programming. Organizations look for applicants with strong problem-solving skills because while languages, frameworks, and technologies may all be learned at any moment, the notion or logic underlying complicated solutions rests on a person's ability to think analytically. Therefore, even if competitive programming is not required, it does aid in the development of problem-solving abilities. Personally, do give it a try without losing patience for some time, I feel most of you would fall in love with it. Roadmap To Start Competitive Programming Learn a language thoroughly, getting to know the bits and bytes of it. (PS: Avoid pursuing a PhD in that language as well.) You can start with any language that appeals to you, such as Java, Python, or C++, but before continuing, consider the code lengths and memory requirements of each, as they have a significant impact on your performance time in competitions. Begin to feel at ease using a coding website with a user-friendly design, such as Hackerrank, and go through many of the tasks there. Why do you want Hackerrank? Your confidence will grow as a result of its recommendation system's steady and deliberate progression through increasingly tough situations. Learn the language's data structures and libraries. For instance, using Cpp's arrays, strings, LinkedList, stack, queue, recursion, etc. and STL (Standard Template Library) will significantly increase your speed and help you write shorter, more comprehensible code. Work through at least 40–50 Hackerrank questions, and become familiar with the IDE. You should feel much more confident by this point, and we are prepared to start competing in challenges on websites like Codechef and Codeforces, among others. Start with lengthy challenges on Codechef, where you get 10 days to answer 8–10 questions. This is especially beneficial for novices as it provides them plenty of time to research a problem and find a solution. Maintain Consistency, exercise patience, and attempt to step beyond your comfort zone by going back to the questions you couldn't answer after each competition. Do them again on your own. If you can't understand it, look at editorials and other people's solutions after the competitions. Although as a beginner do not engage more than 30 mins for a question if you are not able to find an answer. For pair programming, try to locate someone who shares your desire for competitive programming. By learning from others' failures, one might develop their ability to think creatively. Start learning algorithms while participating in competitions; algorithms can help you understand your confusions; yet, some algorithms are challenging for beginners to picture. Algorithms can help you optimize your programme, and they are one of the most important criteria in contest rankings because they have a significant impact on your execution time. You should be comfortable and competent with the majority of the contests by this point, therefore it's time to advance to higher levels. Start by taking part in global contests like Google CodeJam, TopCoder challenges, ACM ICPC, etc. You can undoubtedly rank among the top competitors in these challenges if enough effort and patience are put in. Most importantly, if your ratings decline, maintain your confidence and keep trying. Maintaining consistency will be difficult at first, but everyone goes through this phase, so it's perfectly OK. Let me dispel some common misconceptions regarding competitive programming. Question 1: How long will it take for me to reach the 5- or 6-star level in CodeChef or turn purple in CodeForces? The answer to this query is very debatable. It entirely relies on how many hours you spend practicing competitive programming after you get going and begin understanding things. 2. Also very important is consistency. Question 2: Is entering a FAANG firm like Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google, or another similar product-based corporation only possible through competitive programming? In a word, the answer to this question will be a resounding NO. 1. There are a few people I know that were hired by these companies, but they never participated in any programming competitions. 2. Some of these companies took notice of them as a result of the project work they completed. However, they also demonstrated a solid understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, which helped them pass the interviews. Therefore, being a competitive coder and passing these kinds of interviews always helps. Final Thoughts Before competitive programming begins, all of these considerations must be kept in mind; otherwise, you may encounter numerous obstacles along the way of this amazing trip.

Has anyone tried both softwares?","completion":"I'm totally biased, but: If you're comparing project management software, you should also consider how apps are going to work with the rest of operations - something most project management apps can make more complicated. If you manage contacts, sales, invoicing, expenses, scheduling, and other needs, you would save a lot of time and money by going with an integrated system that puts all of this into one system for you. WORKetc puts CRM, project management, billing, and other tools together, and brings collaboration to every aspect of the system. You would be managing a client from the lead phase, through to projects, through to billing the client - all in the same app. WORKetc has a free trial: http://www.worketc.com"},{"prompt":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","completion":"Whether it is worthwhile to invest in cryptocurrencies depends on each individual's financial objectives, risk tolerance, and investment plan. On the one hand, cryptocurrencies have the potential to provide substantial returns and have historically shown tremendous price growth. For instance, early Bitcoin investors have experienced significant returns on their investments. Additionally, some investors may find the decentralisation and anonymity that cryptocurrencies offer to be attractive. Cryptocurrencies, on the other hand, are extremely speculative and carry a high level of risk. You risk lose all of your money because of the extreme volatility and quick fluctuations in the value of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there is a higher danger of fraud and other criminal behaviours because the bitcoin industry is still mostly uncontrolled. It's crucial to conduct extensive research and carefully analyse your financial objectives and risk tolerance before making any investing decisions. To reduce risk, it's also a good idea to diversify your investing portfolio and speak with a financial counsellor.

Sure those years with Derrick Rose at his peak were good, but they didn't bring back much in terms of major success. The Lakers however have had multiple era's of success, from Jerry West’s 1, to Showtime, to their early 2000’s 3peat, and their back to back in 2009 and 2010. Multiple titles, many retired jerseys, statues outside their arena, and loads of Hall of Famers too.

Can a GP refuse to arrange these checks because the client has no symptoms?","completion":"Yes you can, but you will have to somehow convince your GP that it's necessary. Preventive medicine is not really a big thing in the UK, with some notable exceptions. I did manage to get such scans when I was living in the UK, but it took several months before I managed to get past the “gatekeepers\\". Furthermore, I know several people with chronic conditions (including cancer) who have had huge trouble seeing their doctor in the last few years, due to a covid backlog and a shortage of staff due to Brexit. So getting a routine check just to put your mind at ease may well be very challenging right now.

There also is no record of who would have been the invaders. The fact is that it is a theory that came from mere linguistic speculation which happened during the nineteenth century when very little archeological excavation had yet been done around India. There have been many researchers who have tried to study the linguistics of the people to gather an indication of where the original homeland of the Vedic Aryans was actually located. This was done to either try to uphold or refute the idea of the Aryan Invasion Theory. In my book “Proof of Vedic Culture’s Global Existence”, I dealt with linguistics and word similarities to a degree, but this topic, in spite of all the research, study, and books written on whatever findings were made, has done little to absolutely establish with clarity the original home of the Vedic Aryans. Some scholars have always felt that the linguistic evidence is not sufficient to draw definite conclusions where the homeland of the Vedic Aryans was located. Linguistics amongst some scholars have always been a speculative process, at best arriving at various conjectures about the origins of particular cultures and languages. Others have been even more dismissive of the idea of reconstructing a hypothetical language based on words that remain present in spoken languages thousands of years later. Thus, in trying to understand the Vedic Aryans and where their homeland may have been by analysing some hypothetical Prot-Indo-European language that still has not been identified seems rather doubtful. At best, it may provide some basic hypothesis, which in reality may be most misleading. This alsoseems to say that there is little reason to hold the field of linguistics in such a high degree of respect, considering all the books that have been written that seem to use this process to determine so many conclusions, or conjectures, on the homeland of the Vedic Aryans.” I agree with him entirely. Humans spoke before they began to write. Many of the word similarities such as words for Father (Pitra), mother, and several first encounters of a infat to child may have been solidified for exanple in a group of people say 60000 years back and they could have carried that forwards into different regions where Indo-European language was spoken. The people themselves may have been transformed by admixing with other populations. Why put a starting point for these very essential common words at a few thousands of years from now - that has no basis. It could be 50000 years from now and then people themselves could have changed homo sapiens mixing with small percent of Neanderthals and Denisovans. In conclusion linguistics does not give any answers to any Aryan tribe existing or migrating. One has to look for Archaeloghical evidence and there is none."},{"prompt":"Can you take control of your blood sugar?","completion":"Smart way of sugar control To know more [LINKED_TEXT: click here] [URL: https://www.digistore24.com/redir/307885/Saranya2023/] Exercise regularlyManage your carb intakeEat more fiberDrink water and stay hydratedImplement portion control.Choose foods with a low glycemic indexTry to manage your stress levels.Monitor your blood sugar levels.

It is a photograph of a frail famine-stricken boy, initially believed to be a girl, who had collapsed in the foreground with a vulture eyeing him from nearby. The child was reported to be attempting to reach a United Nations feeding center about a half mile away in Ayod, Sudan,(now South Sudan), in March 1993. The picture won the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography award in 1994. 【Criticism from world 】 As with many dramatic photographs, Carter came under criticism for this shot. The St. Petersburg Times in Florida wrote: “The man adjusting his lens to take just the right frame of her suffering, might just as well be a predator, another vulture on the scene”. The attitude that public opinion condemned was not only that of taking the picture instead of chasing the vulture immediately away, but also the fact that he did not help the girl afterwards –as Carter explained later. 【 The real story from kevin】 Carter took a special assignment in Sudan, where he shot the famous vulture photo. He spent a few days touring villages full of starving people. All the while, he was surrounded by armed Sudanese soldiers who were there to keep him from interfering. The photos below are evidence that even if he decided to help the little girl, the soldiers wouldn’t have allowed it. The first was shot by Carter himself. After receiving a number of phone calls and letters from readers who wanted to know what happened to the little girl, the New York Times took a rare step and published an editor’s note describing what they knew of the situation. “The photographer reports that she recovered enough to resume her trek after the vulture was chased away. It is not known whether she reached the [feeding] center.” One of the Carter’s friend said he would “talk about the guilt of the people he couldn’t save because he photographed them as they were being killed.” It was beginning to trigger a spiral into depression. Four months after being awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Feature Photography, Carter died of suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning on July 27, 1994, at age 33. While the world was congratulating Carter for this new feat and hoping it was the beginning of many more breakthroughs for him, the journalist was unfortunately very close to the end of his promising career. In his short life, Carter witnessed barbaric practices, injustice, and gruesome killings which took a fatal toll on him and further drove him into depression. In order to cope with these horrors, the award-winning photojournalist had to indulge in drugs which became part of his daily struggles. And this young man’s life ended just like that.

After extended use, your arms will become tired and uncomfortable.Mac software is designed to work with pixel perfect pointing devices whereas touch screens can only resolve a touch to within 10 or more pixels depending on the screen resolution. Software designed to work with a mouse doesn’t work well with touch input in most cases. Apple chose to optimize the software of each platform (Mac vs phone/tablet) for the input style available. The alternative would be to create applications with a more complex hybrid user interface to acomodate both pixel perfect and touch input.Apple places a higher value on simplicity and accessibility to the widest possible audience. If you prefer a hybrid user interface that affords both touch and mouse input, Macs aren’t designed for you. They are designed for the 90% of the market that values a simpler UI. I would be surprised if Apple started puting touch screens on Macs anytime soon.

The TP4056 is a popular charging module commonly used for charging lithium-ion and lithium polymer batteries. It is designed to handle various battery capacities, including 3000mAh. The TP4056 module provides a regulated charging current to the connected battery. It typically allows for adjustable charging currents, usually ranging from around 100mA to 1000mA, depending on the specific module version. The charging current setting determines the time it takes to fully charge the battery. When using the TP4056 module, it is important to ensure that the charging current is set within the acceptable limits of the battery being charged. The charging current should not exceed the maximum charging current specified by the battery manufacturer to prevent potential damage or overheating. It's also worth noting that the TP4056 module is typically designed for single-cell lithium-ion or lithium polymer batteries. If you are using a battery with multiple cells connected in series, additional circuitry, such as a battery protection circuit, may be required to ensure proper charging and cell balancing. Always refer to the manufacturer's datasheet or guidelines for the TP4056 module and the specifications of the battery being charged to ensure compatibility and safe charging practices.

Today I weigh just about 300 pounds, with a BMI of ~37, and my long-term goal is to get down to 250 by the time I turn 50.

And I have to say that my experience was good only with coaching but when It comes to hostel I think It was one of the biggest mistake of my life to choose their hostel which I still regret even now. Because- Price of their hostel was very very high considering the facilities they provided to us. A hostel with all those facilities would have cost around Rs. 10000 per month in nearby areas. And they charge around Rs 150000 per month. Rate of electricity unit is too high Rs14 per unit but in almost all nearby hostel price is around Rs. 10–12.It’s very difficult to live in rooms in which Windows are not there. You will feel really suffocated.I lived there on 2nd floor and on 3rd & 4th floor lots of abusive are written all over the walls against some particular managers and staff. Hostel authorities clean that daily but students are really stubborn(Ziddi).And many times in night students of 3rd and 4th floor shout abusive words about the staff in verrrrrrrrry loud voice and I faced difficulties while studying because of all this. And they give such abuses which you have never heard.Hostel management is verrrrry rude here and your problems won't get solved easily. The only thing which matters for them is your money and the moment you pay your full fee They will not even check what you are doing nowadays.Water cooler does not work on the floors and you have to go to the ground floor to fill up cool water. And quality of water is also poor. And once we complained about it to their manager than he said that we also drink the same water. And we can't do anything about it.In the middle months of the session their lift had problem in almost every 3 days. But since now it is a time of new admission their lift is completely fine. They used to turn it off to save the electricity bill.We paid high amount of money for food and their counsellors told us that food is prepared by the best mess of whole Kota But their quality of food was not up to the markconsidering the amount we paid for it. Initially at the time of admissions food quality was OK OK and more no. of food items were there and their management will regularly check the food quality. But as time passes food quality decreases and If you complain about it to the authorities than they will give same excuse that. All students eat same food but why only you are having problem.Quality of Tea in morning and evening as well is verrrrrrrrry poor sometimes It’s very sweet and sometimes we ourselves need to add sugar to it to make it drinkable. And in breakfast in milk around 40% water +60% milk.I am not sure about it but many students of hostel say that security guard of hostel had sex with someone in the room of many students. And they say that CCTV cameras are everywhere but still they were unable to detect this. But I think now they know about it and that too through a student.And the reason due to which I regret most because they told all the students of class 12th that you have to leave the hostel by 31st March. And if you want to live beyond it you need to pay the rent. But at the time of admission they told that you will be allowed to live there till JEE Adv.

All the time. It's something I've learned to just get used to - if or whenever I find myself in the position. So I don't speak an iota of spanish, not one bit - whatsoever. I’ve never had a need or reason to do so. It is not my language; english is. Hence, it is very awkward when a stranger or strangers walk up to me speaking entirely in Spanish. What makes them so sure I speak their language (that’s just a rhetorical question). The last person whom did that made me really uneasy. This woman just approached me from out of nowhere on a dark winter evening as I was exiting my vehicle. She couldn't/wouldn't/didn't speak a word of English. When uttered “I don't speak Spanish\\" she smiles and walks off. So I guess that's them (certain people) judging me on my outward appearance.

Direction: Casting director Mukesh Chhabra has made his direction debut with this movie. Earlier we have watched him in small roles. As he was quite novice behind the camera, we can not expect much or reaching the level of original one. However he gave honest try and conquered somewhat. Yes, there was some areas of improvement where people feel more connected with this cinema. Performance: Sushant gave one the best performance in his small career. This movie is not for judging his performance. This movie is just feel the SSR persence on screen and give farewell to your lovely star. Sanjana Sanghi did the justice with her role of cancer patient. Sahil Vaid has played good supporting role in this tragic love story. Script: When script writers have to work on adaptation, they have big problem as audience will always compare their work with original one. There was some issues with script and screenplay, still it was great watch for cinema lovers’ perspective. Climax was in coherence with the reality and every one is having teary eyes and want to say good bye to his loving actor. Music and Background Score: After huge gap, A.R. Rahman gave music to any Bollywood movie. It is really good that he chose this movie as this movie will be stay in the heart of audience for long duration. “Main Tumhara” and title track were the best songs which you want to listen on loop. Last Words: Sudden dismissal of SSR, created new debate Nepotism vs Talent across the nation and this debate must be go on till Bollywood will stop creating misfortune like SSR. Movie Rating: I guess that this movie is beyond rating or box-office collection. Still you are looking for my rating then my answer is 4 stars out of 5."},{"prompt":"What program do photographers use to edit photos?","completion":"There are lots of tools claiming that they are the best & professional. basically, It depends on user experiences.

Trump wants to bring back manufacturing jobs, but are they ready for the big paycut that would require?","completion":"Cheap labor is a big factor but it is more complex than that. One factor is control. The quality of Chinese goods is spotty. Unless you have people there checking everything the odds are there may be issues. One example. Honda makes really good engines. The Chinese have copied every single part on the Honda GX-160 motor. You can interchange any single part. However Honda engines will last almost forever and the Chinese versions are pretty much junk. If there is something wrong with what you buy you are pretty much stuck. Another factor is freight. You are looking generally at 60 days and a cost of perhaps 5,000.00 to get a 40 foot container from China. One quote I got from China the other day made me laugh. We use a lot of ball valves in my business. We buy the ones we get in the USA but they are Chinese made. I got the idea of buying direct. I asked for a quote for 1000 2″ ball valves. We currently pay around 25.00 for that ball valve. One company quoted 1000 2″ ball valves 6.00 each. Freight by Fedex Express 136,000.00 The key to competing is automation. I know that sounds like it would eliminate jobs and in some ways it will and some it won’t. It will however eliminate jobs in China. Many production jobs may be lost but others will be created and the jobs that come from that will be high paying and in the USA. The more we produce with the less labor involved the more we all can have.

Really. And I am a former nanotechnology scientist. It was about 90’s the word started to emerge as popular. It was about in 90’s where things from different fields started to connect. All those fields like colloidal chemistry, self-organized structures, biology, thin layers, semiconductors, balistic transport… all that started to reach into other fields. Formerly isolated fields started to have similarities. But it exist long, long time. Now we call it nanotechnology. And if we extend the word enough maybe nearly anything could be nano. In this sense… it is buzzword. People love it. It sounds so new! While those are all those old tricks like supermobility thin layers. We just realized that thin layers and colloidal particles have some physics to describe them in common. Why should you care? You shouldn’t if you are not interested in science. Or you could because it is in fact birth of new paradigm. Nanotechnology is the bridge between separated fields. And on the borders of those fields new technology opportunities as well as new risks await. I believe it is usually good to be at least aware of potential risks. YOu do not need to understand electricity to be aware of your plugs, right? So it might be nice to now that something like nanotechnology exists."},{"prompt":"f evolution were true (it clearly is not), what would observable evidence look like?","completion":"Of course it’s all make believe but if it were true you would see some kind of evidence of transitional form or missing links. These missing links would have to be in greater amounts by far connecting each identifiable kind of animal than there is identifiable kinds of animals. You would also have a tremendous amount of half lungs and eyes developing and so on. The fact that there is not even one that has ever been found to be valid proves evolution never happened. If you look at the trilobite according to evolutionist one of the first creatures to evolve eyes is the exact same in the most deepest layers as in the most shallow. Now that we have sophisticated technology we know the trilobite’s eye is incredibly complicated to even mention this somehow happened by blind chance is insanity. The reason there would have to be more missing links connecting each identifiable kind of animal is factual evidence according to DNA. In DNA you have nucleotides and a change in the amount of only 3 is proved to be devastating to any animal including humans. To claim an animal somehow changed its DNA dissimilar number sequence would require a change in amount of millions of nucleotides. Hint, much more than 3. For an animal or human to change this amount of nucleotides would in no way in reality be able to happen since the creature would not survive this given any amount of time or population growth. Then comes another fact that the fossil record proves beyond certainty there is no indication of anything such thing as anatomy changes have ever took place. Every creature that has ever been found has been fully complete in its anatomy right from the deepest layers as in the most shallow layers. They just suddenly appeared in the fossil record fully complete. There is no sign of lungs developing or eyes or any body part forming in a partial manner to a complete manner. This is due to it does not do any creature any good in terms of a non functioning part of the anatomy. Every vestigial assumption evolutionists made up have required functions. For example they claimed you don’t need your tail bone since it fell off after evolving from apes but the reality is you wouldn’t be able to perform the required functions of going to the bathroom. This is because of muscles attached to that bone and other stuff. The entire evolutionary gig is not based on factual evidence or any type of evidence period. In fact it’s based on 100% assumptions. There is so much more undeniable evidence proving evolution never happened I would suggest researching what evolutionist scientists do not tell you. You will never hear about it in your school textbooks. You have to research this stuff on your own don’t take my word for it and I promise anyone it will blow them away in shock that does not know about this stuff."},{"prompt":"What is the manliest thing you've ever witnessed?","completion":"My father was a farmer who worker 12–14 hour days, as many have described their fathers.

As a rule, Scalpers have a much tighter profit objective and are in and out of a trade much faster than Swing Traders. On the other hand, Position Traders have a much larger profit objective and tend to be in a trade much longer than Swing Traders. Some people will tell you Swing Traders will hold a trade anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour; whereas others will tell you Swing Traders typically hold a trade for a day to a week. Both are right. As with all things trading related it's relative based on your perspective. I had a friend to traded in the Cattle pit in Chicago. His co-workers referred to him as a Position Trader because he would sometimes hold a trade for 5 minutes! That's because the typical trade in the pit would last only a few seconds, so for these traders, the differences between a Scalper, Swing Trader and Position Trader would be quite different than the definitions given you by an End-of-Day trader. Generally speaking Swing Trading is short term trading where the trader attempts to capitalize on a relatively short lived trend or move in price. Swing traders don't usually attempt to ride out any pullbacks in the move; rather they try to capture all (or part) of the most recent rally (or decline). Hope this answers your question.

One could say that where it not for online schools, Education would have taken a massive hit over the last year or so. There are, in fact, quite a few online schools in Abu Dhabi like the Inter High an Online secondary school that follows the British iGCSE Curriculum. Then there is iCademy Middle East that follows the American pattern of education. The point to be noted is that online schools have become a viable option in Abu Dhabi. The encouragement given by the UAE Ministry of education to online schools in the wake of the pandemic has fuelled the rise in interest in such schools. The advantage of online education in encouraging a technical orientation to learning is something that will continue beyond the pandemic, albeit in not that intense a fashion. With the technological revolution sweeping the world, it is a no brainer that some form of online instruction and learning will be an integral form of education anywhere. What the pandemic has done, unfortunate as its occurrence has been is to let the world realize the possibilities that online education provides. One could, for instance, charge a lower fee for an education received in an online school as compared to a regular one, on account of the savings made on infrastructure. However, the kind of growth and development that happens in a real school setting is not something that can be done away with, making it necessary to perhaps have a combination of online and actual school learning. In any case online schooling is here to stay and this is especially true of a place like Abu Dhabi with its modern outlook towards most things. Children of the 21st century are digital natives and with online education taking things a step further one can see these young students achieving wonders at the frontiers of technology in the times to come. As of now it is the online high schools that are coming to the rescue of the young students, enabling them to complete their school education in an unimpeded manner even through a raging pandemic. Abu Dhabi being an international destination with expats from around the world living here, online high schools have been a saviour for many youngsters, who would otherwise have struggled to complete their education. One can see online schools growing from strength to strength in the times to come."},{"prompt":"investing in cryptocurrency still profitable?","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't provide financial advice, and the decision to invest in cryptocurrencies or any other asset should be based on individual circumstances, risk tolerance, and financial goals. It's essential to conduct thorough research and consider the following factors before making an investment decision: Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are known for their price volatility, which means their value can fluctuate significantly over short periods. While this volatility can lead to potential high returns, it also comes with increased risk of losses.Risk Tolerance: Consider your risk tolerance and how comfortable you are with the possibility of losing a portion or all of your investment. Investments in cryptocurrencies are speculative and can be subject to rapid and unpredictable changes.Diversification: If you decide to invest in cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to diversify your investment portfolio to spread risk across different asset classes. Avoid putting all your funds into one cryptocurrency or asset.Research and Education: Understand the technology and underlying projects of the cryptocurrencies you are interested in. Stay informed about market trends, news, and regulatory developments that may impact the cryptocurrency market.Long-Term vs. Short-Term: Decide whether you are investing for the long term or for short-term gains. Short-term trading can be more speculative and may require more active monitoring.Regulatory Risks: Be aware of regulatory risks and how government policies can impact the cryptocurrency market.Security: Take appropriate security measures to protect your cryptocurrency holdings, such as using reputable wallets and exchanges and enabling two-factor authentication.Professional Advice: Consider consulting with a financial advisor or investment professional who can provide personalized advice based on your financial situation and goals. Cryptocurrencies can offer unique opportunities and have the potential to disrupt traditional financial systems. However, they also come with significant risks, and the market can be highly speculative. Only invest funds that you can afford to lose and be cautious of get-rich-quick schemes or promises of guaranteed returns. Ultimately, the decision to invest in cryptocurrencies should be based on a thorough understanding of the risks involved and aligning your investment strategy with your overall financial plan. If you are uncertain or lack experience in cryptocurrency investing, it's best to seek professional advice before making any investment decisions.

Here are some advantages and disadvantages to consider: Pros: 1. Large User Base: Facebook is one of the most popular social media platforms globally, and the Marketplace allows access to a large audience of potential buyers in your local area. 2. Convenience: It is easy to list and sell items on the Facebook Marketplace. Users can create listings with photos and descriptions, set prices, and communicate with potential buyers through the platform's messaging system. 3. Cost-effective: Unlike other online marketplaces or classified ads, using the Facebook Marketplace is generally free, allowing businesses and individuals to save on listing fees and potentially maximize their profits. 4. Target Local Market: The Facebook Marketplace is designed to connect buyers and sellers within the same geographical location, making it a suitable platform for individuals and local businesses looking to reach customers or buyers nearby. 5. Trustworthy Profiles: Facebook profiles provide potential buyers with information about the seller's identity and reputation, creating a sense of trust and credibility. Additionally, users have the option to receive ratings and reviews from previous customers, building further confidence in the seller. Cons: 1. Competition: With a vast number of sellers utilizing the Facebook Marketplace, the level of competition can be high, making it challenging to stand out and attract buyers. 2. Limited Reach: While the Facebook audience is extensive, the Marketplace primarily targets local buyers, which may limit the potential reach for businesses or individuals looking to sell to a wider audience. 3. Privacy Concerns: Selling on the Facebook Marketplace requires individuals to share personal information and location details. This can raise privacy concerns for some users, particularly if they are uncomfortable sharing such information publicly. 4. Security Risks: Although Facebook has implemented security measures, there is still a risk of scams, fraudulent activities, or dealing with unreliable buyers. Sellers should exercise caution and proper vetting procedures when transacting. 5. Lack of Advanced Features: Compared to dedicated online marketplaces, the Facebook Marketplace may lack advanced features like built-in payment systems, shipping options, or robust seller tools. This can place additional responsibilities on sellers to handle transactions, payments, and logistics independently. Overall, leveraging the Facebook Marketplace can be a viable option for local businesses and individuals to make extra money off their unused items and services. However, it is important to weigh the pros and cons mentioned above and carefully consider factors such as target audience, competition, privacy concerns, and the need for additional features before deciding to use this platform."},{"prompt":"What is a list of skills that are amazing if you learn them?","completion":"You know, the skills I'm about to share might seem simple, but trust me, you'll be amazed by the benefits they bring.

How long will it take the train to travel through the tunnel?","completion":"Why do you want my answer when more than three dozens answers already available."},{"prompt":"w do you calculate the mean absolute error?","completion":"Method 1 of 3:Using the Actual Value and Measured Value The formula is Δx=x0−x{displaystyle Delta x=x_{0}-x}, where Δx{displaystyle Delta x} equals the absolute error (the difference, or change, in the measured and actual value), x0{displaystyle x_{0}} equals the measured value, and x{displaystyle x} equals the actual value. 2. Plug the actual value into the formula. The actual value should be given to you. If not, use a standardly accepted value. Substitute this value for x{displaystyle x}. For example, you might be measuring the length of a football field. You know that the actual, or accepted length of a professional American football field is 360 feet. So, you would use 360 as the actual value:Δx=x0−360{displaystyle Delta x=x_{0}-360}. 3. Find the measured value. This will be given to you, or you should make the measurement yourself. Substitute this value for x0{displaystyle x_{0}}. For example, if you measure the football field and find that it is 357 feet long, you would use 357 as the measured value:Δx=357−360{displaystyle Delta x=357-360}. 4. Subtract the actual value from the measured value. Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs. This will give you the absolute error. For example, since Δx=357−360=−3{displaystyle Delta x=357-360=-3}, the absolute error of your measurement is 3 feet. Method 2 of 3:Using the Actual Value and Relative Error1. Set up the formula for relative error. The formula is δx=x0−xx{displaystyle delta x={frac {x_{0}-x}{x}}}, where δx{displaystyle delta x} equals the relative error (the ratio of the absolute error to the actual value), x0{displaystyle x_{0}} equals the measured value, and x{displaystyle x} equals the actual value. 2. Plug in the value for the relative error. This will likely be a decimal. Make sure you substitute it for δx{displaystyle delta x}. For example, if you know that the relative error is .025, your formula will look like this: .025=x0−xx{displaystyle .025={frac {x_{0}-x}{x}}}. 3. Plug in the value for the actual value. This information should be given to you. Make sure you substitute this value for x{displaystyle x}. For example, if you know that the actual value is 360 ft, your formula will look like this: .025=x0−360360{displaystyle .025={frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}}. 4. Multiply each side of the equation by the actual value. This will cancel out the fraction. For example:.025=x0−360360{displaystyle .025={frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}}.025×360=x0−360360×360{displaystyle .025times 360={frac {x_{0}-360}{360}}times 360}9=x0−360{displaystyle 9=x_{0}-360} 5. Add the actual value to each side of the equation. This will give you the value of x0{displaystyle x_{0}}, giving you the measured value. For example:9=x0−360{displaystyle 9=x_{0}-360}9+360=x0−360+360{displaystyle 9+360=x_{0}-360+360}369=x0{displaystyle 369=x_{0}} 6. Subtract the actual value from the measured value. Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs. This will give you the absolute error. For example, if the measured value is 369 ft, and the actual value is 360 feet, you would subtract 369−360=9{displaystyle 369-360=9}. So, the absolute error is 9 feet. Method 3 of 3:Using the Maximum Possible Error This is the \\"to the nearest\\" value. This might be explicitly stated (for example, \\"The building was measured to the nearest foot.\\"), but it doesn’t have to be. To determine the measuring unit, just look at what place value the measurement is rounded to. For example, if the measured length of a building is stated as 357 feet, you know that the building was measured to the nearest foot. So, the measuring unit is 1 foot. 2. Determine the maximum possible error. The maximum possible error is 12{displaystyle {frac {1}{2}}} the unit of measure. You might see it listed as ±{displaystyle pm } a number. For example, if the unit of measure is a foot, the maximum possible error is .5 ft. So you might see that the measurement of a building is 357±.5ft{displaystyle 357pm .5ft}. This means that the actual value of the building’s length could be .5 ft less or .5 ft more than the measured value. If it was any less/more, the measured value would have been 356 or 358 feet. 3. Use the maximum possible error as the absolute error. Since absolute error is always positive, take the absolute value of this difference, ignoring any negative signs. This will give you the absolute error. For example, if you find the measurement of a building to be 357±.5ft{displaystyle 357pm .5ft}, the absolute error is .5 ft."},{"prompt":"What program do photographers use to edit photos?","completion":"Photo editing does not only mean adding aesthetics to a photo.

The EU say Novavax is dragging it’s heels. Novavax say they are wary, following the AZ vaccine program. Who is telling the truth?","completion":"Probably both. I have absolutely no insider knowledge of what is going on, but based on my experience as a lawyer I would take an educated guess that it is something like this. EU wants to secure additional vaccine supplies, so wants to strike a deal with Novavax.EU notes that things went sideways with AstraZeneca, and they are keen to avoid a repeat of that.So the EU sets out a list of demands for the Novavax contract which ‘shores up’ the concerns that arose in relation to the AstraZeneca contract. It is possible those requirements may include ‘set in stone’ delivery dates, and avoiding any use of the words ‘best endeavours’.Novavax takes a look at this and decides that it doesn’t like the look of those terms much. But it doesn’t want to say ‘no’ because it is a huge contract, however it wants to understand the risk.So Novavax does two things in tandem: firstly, they push back to see if they can negotiate down some of the proposed terms (which the EU is likely pretty gun shy about), and at the same time, drills down on its own risk profile and/or examines whether it can push some of that risk downstream (ie. insure against possible risks relating to the terms, or secure similar guarantees from its own suppliers).The net result is that the process gets dragged out as both sides haggle over the details and work out how to both manage and price the additional risks. I don’t know for sure that is what is happening, but it feels like a reasonable guess. Just another day in the life of the lawyers negotiating billion dollar supply contracts.

However, the country’s exports would suffer but eventually balance themselves out. Realistically speaking, this is not possible at present, as India’s production in a globalized economy in terms of GDP is marginal at best. Unless India increases its GDP to match that of the US, this is simply not possible. The financial system too would need a complete overhaul. While it may help consumers in the short term, in the long run, it could wreak havoc on the country’s economy unless the national currency is brought on parity to match its GDP. The economics would be completely askew and there is the eventual scenario of the national economy imploding even.

Such mythical notions can have and have had many disadvantages, but far less so than in years past, although very recently with Trumpism raising its ugly landing strip of a hairdo, Freemasonry is likely to come under increasing scrutiny and attack. With the likes of Hitler, paranoid and delusional Trump is not fond of Freemasonry, and methinks Freemasonry might just collectively give him a “back at ya” gesture.

The one I saw on her was violet… Full length fur coats are really heavy, (as are shearlings) and when full length down coats became more common (and much cheaper) the long fur coat got relegated to the closets of only people who really liked them. I always wanted one, but I never lived anywhere that was that cold. I was in Venice Italy one year over New Year's and saw about a dozen regal women havng espresso in the piazza, all wearing full length furs in the morning sun, and was very tempted. Some years ago, I was talking to a product development guy from the North Face. He said that they still hadn't invented anything as warm as fur and that would last as long.

My sisters and I used to play there, but not as often as you might think, because it was kind of polluted - littered with a lot of cast-off junk that people dumped there. Once, someone dumped a camper there - the kind that goes on the bed of a truck. I found it and determined that it was relatively clean, and started to make a fort out of it. I went home for lunch one day and came back to find two other boys smashing it to pieces with hammers. They weren’t even doing it maliciously; they were just boys being boys, and when I angrily confronted them, they slunk away, shame-faced (to my grim approval). But that wasn’t the weirdest thing; it only serves to give an approximation of the weird nature of the things we might find there. Another time, I was playing there in the bushes. I had gotten used to seeing random car parts and other assorted garbage there, but one day one of my sisters came to me and said she had found something really strange. “I think it’s a penis,” she said. I scoffed at her. What were the odds that she would have found an actual severed penis lying on the forest floor? It’s not so much weird what the thing was, as was the fact that we found it lying on the forest floor amidst all the other cast-off junk. Maybe it had come from the owner of the camper. At any rate, I won’t describe it in too much detail, except to say that it was huge, black, and made of rubber. My sister was too young to know what it was, and I had only a vague inkling, (and I was only a kid, too), but over the years as I matured and grew up, it became more and more clear to me, and I often thought back to the day we found a dildo in the forest."},{"prompt":"What are some good unknown destinations to travel in 2019?","completion":"I’d suggest checking out Luang Prabang in Laos.

Numbers released from Facebook themself suggests that 83 million facebook accounts are fake – that’s more than the total number of people living in France and the Netherlands combined! An estimated 5-6% of all Facebook accounts are fake. Fake autogenerated profiles offer the creators of those the possibility of spamming your wall with weird content and also bloat the number of fans for certain pages. There are some studies of fake Facebook profiles that indicate that fake profiles have a higher average number of friends and most often identify themselves as females. For identifying whether a specific profile is fake these studies however only offer vague clues. So how to spot a fake Facebook profile? Looking at a company Facebook page the other day I noticed an unnatural high number of fans for that type of company but strangely very low fan activity on the same Facebook page. Very few likes and no comments made it a bit of a strange case. I did find a few Likes though and decided to have a closer look at those profiles. I came up with the following little trick which also will introduce you to a great and not that well-known feature of Google. Here goes: 1. Locate the Profile image of the Facebook profile you want to check. For this little test let’s use the SPAMfighter Aim logo present on the [LINKED_TEXT: SPAMfighter Facebook page] [URL: https://www.facebook.com/SPAMfighters]. 2. Right-click on the image and save it somewhere where you easily can find it again! The Windows desktop would be a great place! 3. Now enter [LINKED_TEXT: Google Image Search] [URL: http://images.google.com/]. Google Image Search is a great tool where you can search for images based on other images. I would suggest using Google Chrome or Firefox as Browser here. For some reason it does not seem to work for Internet Explorer 9. 4. Drag the recently saved file from your desktop til the search field. It is a little nifty but you will probably work it out! 5. Now Google Image Search will check where the image is present on Facebook profiles and a lot of other places on the Internet. If we for a moment return to my original fake profile my search using the above method actually produced a lot of Facebook profiles having the same profile image. See below. My best guess is that most of those Facebook profiles are fake! Remember to delete any profile images you download from Facebook by the way. Pretty sure Facebook or Facebook users don’t want their profile images laying around on your computer!"},{"prompt":"'s said that the Hidden Bible Code says the rapture is in 2021.

This has happened to me. I have spent a fortune on Amazon and left mostly 4 and 5 star reviews. During the Pandemic when merchandise was hard to obtain I received several trashy but expensive items that they made me pay shipping on in order to get my money back. I then wrote a couple of negative reviews. Ever since then I have been blocked from rating my purchases though I continue to make many purchases. .

Any remotely strong computer science PhD program (at least in North America) funds its students. An offer of admission without funding means they don’t really want you. Just say no. Second, while a low GRE score might keep you out, a high GRE score will not get you admitted to a PhD program in computer science, because that’s not what admissions committees are looking for. PhD admissions committees (in strong CS departments in the US) are looking primarily for compelling evidence of research potential. And we’ll look for that evidence primarily in your statement and in your recommendation letters. I honestly have no idea whether the scores you report are high or low; my department’s PhD program doesn’t consider GRE scores at all."},{"prompt":"Why are the Kannadigas the least known among South Indians?","completion":"Says who?

This came up in 2019 after the Kings put out an incorrect age for Buddy Hield. So some players “changed” heights. On the Nets for example when this happened, Irving went from 6′3″ to 6′2″ and Durant went from 6′9″ to 6′10″. JJ Barea went from 6 foot to 5′10″. Boban finally became 7′4″. Derrick Rose went from 6′3 to 6′1. And on the Warriors both Klay Thompson and Draymond Green went to 6′5″… But Curry… still 6′2. Some people said in past years… “hey if Klay is 6′7, there’s no way Curry is only 6′2. In reality… he was 6′2, just Klay was listed a couple inches taller than he really was. And that makes sense. Charles Barkley used to be listed at 6′7″ at times and in reality, was noticeably shorter than Jordan at 6′6. I used to go watch Miami Heat practices at my college in the 90’s after classes. And would see the players quite a bit in the parking lot and get autographs and talk with them. And I kind of accidently pissed off their shooting guard Voshon Lenard. He was listed at 6′4″. And I am 6′3″ and am taller than him there and noticed that when we were chatting one day. And I asked him how tall he really was (I was 19, didn’t realize this was a big thing in the NBA). And he kinda gave me a smartass “why, how tall are you?” line back. I laughed it off and apologized… but he wasn’t 6′4″. But 6′1–6′2 is pretty short for an NBA shooting guard. So it got pumped up a bit I’m sure in college to help his draft stock, and hey, if you can play, it ends up not really mattering anymore."},{"prompt":"Why do cats abandon their owners?","completion":"I think there are a lot of reasons, but one I think I’ve observed is “other cats”. I live out in the countryside, and about 7 years ago a cat turned up at my door one day and refused to leave. She just walked in, and acted like she owned the place. At first I’d put her back outside after a few minutes, but she’d just sit on the windowsill, looking in at me, offended. Or she’d be hanging around the garden somewhere, maybe up on the roof, just pretending to chill out like it was her home. Eventually I just accepted that I had a cat. Then one day on the way home, walking up towards my house, I saw another cat walking on the road. I thought it was my cat, it really looked like my cat, all the same characteristics like shape walk, etc, but also very slightly different. I’m pretty sure that they were siblings, which suggested to me that when my cat came to my house she was essentially after “moving out” because she was old enough. There’s several houses and farms nearby so most likely some cats just move away to find their own territory when they mature.

Little did Super Mario know that his destiny was scripted by a force more powerful than the opposition- fate by his side, sealing the victory with a well scripted team goal and a sublime finish to do the magnitude of the moment justice on the grandest stages of them all. Germany deservedly lifted the World Cup after a masterclass display of resilience and intelligence which helped them prevail in testing times. Götze’s goal was a worthy winner of a final in every essence of the word, a wonderful take of André Schürrle’s cross on his chest and then hooked finish past Sergio Romero. As a spectator and supporter of young football talent, I hope this player with immense potential can overcome his current metabolic disorder which has abruptly brought an end to his campaign with Borussia Dortmund so that he can achieve his rich vein of form again of which we have seen glimpses in the past and restore his lost glory.

But these are the few points which I think are the reasons behind kannadigas not being well known. As India is called a sub-continent, I would call Karnataka a \\"Sub-country\\". It has people and culture from every corner of India. And the number of outsiders is not small..Most of the people in Karnataka have a by birth talent of learning any given language in no time. So when people visit Bangalore, they communicate in their own language and will never get to know that a language called \\"Kannada\\" exists.Many outsiders who come and settle in Karnataka NEVER bother to learn Kannada. And when I say this I'm referring to people who have been living here for decades. Recently I met a guy who introduced himself to be a bangalorean. He also told me that he's been living in Bangalore for more than 20 years. It was pretty normal that I switched to Kannada. And he's like \\"Bro, I don't know Kannada\\". And I was just like o.OThe sad part is that it's not just the outsiders who are ignorant about the language. Even people who know in and out of Kannada feel that speaking Kannada in public places will degrade their \\"status\\". I've also seen people who aren't fluent in English speaking in an artificial accent ( I can't stop laughing when people do this) to make sure that people around them take notice.I think it wouldn't be wrong if I blame Bollywood in this regard. In all the Bollywood movies that I've watched where they try to portray a south Indian scene, they always portray tamilian or malyalis (Not sure how it is spelt).

Abuse does not make sense to people that haven’t experienced it. It is illogical and irrational. How can you explain to someone why nonsense seemed to make sense to you? How do you explain why danger felt safe and safety felt dangerous? How do you explain why you ran back to a painful place over and over again? How do you explain why you rejected logic and good advice? How do you explain why you defended someone that hurt you for no reason? How do you explain why you miss someone that was so cruel? How do you explain why you couldn’t interpret plain, obvious truth in a realistic way? How can you ever explain these things? Unless you are lucky enough to have someone in your life that really wants to listen and understand, I think you will hurt yourself more by trying to make people understand. They just won’t. It isn’t their reality. It isn’t something that they want to understand. To understand abuse is to understand that it could happen to them. Most people don’t want to realize that. They don’t have to understand. Only you need to understand. Let them think what they want to think. You can thrive without their understanding."},{"prompt":"w can I get a free Hotstar membership?","completion":"Yes it is possible. That is not difficult.

They observed the efforts of the British government to control and exploit the colonists from afar, including trying to disarm them. They observed the ease with which British and Southern colonists (and briefly, Southern US slavers) were able to kidnap people from Africa, who were unable to put up any defense for lack of guns. They observed how disadvantaged the Native American tribes were to resist depredations by other tribes, by the British, and by the colonists until they armed themselves. It really wasn’t hard to see that obtaining and maintaining the means by which to defend oneself made sense for a country that placed liberty at the center of its value system, even though that liberty to our eyes seems very unequally distributed in their time."},{"prompt":"w prevalent is cheating at MIT?","completion":"Depends.

Fast, not only from food and drinks but also the fun, Netflix,…..etc. 6- Solve a problem of someone in need of help. For example, buy clothes for the poor, baseball gloves for a child, or better to help people with worse problems. Do not forget not to underestimate the help you give, there might be no one other than you to make the difference and have the satisfaction of it. 7- Read in history of nations, emperors, or most influencing figures. History is repetitive and will give you deep thinking and understanding for our time, you might even find what makes you happy. For example, people lived 500 years ago without cars, planes, trains, and McDonalds, but they deserve your look. Thanks!"},{"prompt":"w does one get officially married if they don’t believe in God?

The Big Bang is mostly based not on scientific facts but rather scientific assumptions. Here are some “facts” that aren't facts but rather assumptions: Time began with the Big Bang Those that make this claim have absolutely zero proof of that claim. Space was created in the Big Bang Again those that make this claim have absolutely zero proof of that claim. There was nothing before the Big Bang Again those that make this claim have absolutely zero proof of that claim. Thus what can they prove…? They can prove that Matter appeared at a certain point in time, and is now moving outwards towards something. What the Big Whisper proposes is that we do away with everything that can't be undeniably proven, and we focus on a more reasonable scenario. That scenario being that before the universe became what it is now, it was something else before that. And the “Big Bang” was simply when all the conditions were right enough that Matter could be made. You speak of the scientific facts of the Big Bang when those facts are almost none. Ask any PhD scientist to prove the so called facts that I pointed out. And they'll have nice theories filled with assumptions. But at the end of their explanations you'll see that there's no hard data and thus no proof whatsoever. Even simulations done by supercomputers can't trace back to the point they claim those “facts” happened."},{"prompt":"What is the best love story people can come up with in two sentences?","completion":"1.His smile was a light guiding me through these dark, dark woods. 2.Her voice was like candy sweet I could practically tast it. 3.What is she doing to me?Why does it feel like I could fly like all my problem disappeared?"},{"prompt":"Why does the UK want the Scilly Islands?

Notice that they are surrendered at about 1–2 years old. That means training failure. They really require a ton of exercise, but more than that, they need mental stimulation. They are problem solvers and often getting free of your yard is the problem they choose to solve. They can easily get over a six foot chain link fence. They are stunningly beautiful and novices tend to think that appearance is a good way to choose a dog. They are independent and do not hang on you for approval. They aren’t disrespectful but they aren’t what we call “biddable” either. They are the ultimate team player and will follow a strong leader, but if you try to bully one, they will not submit. They will simply give up on you; lose all respect for you. And good luck getting it back. I have worked with one pure Siberian Husky and two mixes and they are difficult. Two of these were trained to recall well but they are with highly experienced owners who could run them several miles each day and find mental puzzles for them to do at home. They turned out fine, although both will kill a cat or a fox if they get a chance. The third is a Husky-Pyrenees mix with a “soft” owner who can’t meet his needs. Her idea of punishment is to tell him how disappointed she is in him. He does not give a rat’s ass. I put him on an e-collar but she wants to give him 8 or 10 chances to recall at low level stim before she turns it up where it belongs. He has chewed up the inside of their house. He has chewed up the inside of her car. His recall is poor and he is dog aggressive. When I made the owner leash him up when we came across other dogs, he redirected on her - he started biting her. So we went to a leash and a muzzle. The dog can’t walk anywhere without a muzzle on. But the owner persisted in thinking he should get another chance to play with the other dogs, so whenever I wasn’t there, she would unleash him. This 80 pound jerk went after small dogs and puppies in particular. When they rolled over on their backs and said, Uncle - you win, you’re the boss, he would grab them by the throat. No decent dog does that. It shows that he regards smaller dogs as prey, not as other dogs. I worked with them for a year and gave up about a year ago. They were ruining my local reputation and there were people who thought that four-legged asshat was my dog. I am not having that. Last week a local lady came to me to say that he attacked her 30 pound dog and the damage required a vet visit. The Husky was off leash and without muzzle. She asked if she should call animal control on her. I said yes. The dog could have been managed but the owner is a doormat. Do you know how to be a strong leader, but not a bully? Can you anticipate a dog’s behavior before it’s executed, or do you just react after the fact? Can you stay laser-focused on a dog with a mind like the cocaine bear, or will you zone out? Decide these things before you get a Siberian Husky."},{"prompt":"w difficult was it for you to find your life purpose?","completion":"I believe, as a Christian, that my purpose is to lead as many people to Jesus Christ as possible.

What is important is the legal status of someone that comes into a casino - such an individual is a \\"business licensee:\\" one that has received a revocable license to enter a property for the benefit of the property owner, the owner of the casino. As the name implies, the license – in this case, the permission to remain on the property – can be revoked at any time, so long as it as it is not for a reason that discriminates against a protected class of people. The list of protected classes contains things like \\"gender,\\" \\"national origin,\\" \\"religion,\\" and things of that nature. It should be painfully obvious that lucky or efficient gamblers are not on that list, and as such, those guys can be thrown out for anything or nothing. This doesn't set well with a lot of people, and many believe that the casino is a place that they are allowed to go to because they have some sort of a right to be there – nothing could be further from the truth… It's private property and if you are told leave, you should start walking briskly for the nearest exit, or you may get a little bit of help out the door."},{"prompt":"becoming a doctor financially worth it?","completion":"Doctor is the most noble job on this planet and the profession gets honor to it’s peak as doctor is considered second after God.

The Book of Numbers in the Torah/Pentateuch/Old Testament describes “the trial of the bitter waters” which is a test that a pregnant wife can be forced to undergo if her husband suspects that she has been unfaithful and is pregnant by another man. The suspicious husband is instructed to take his wife to the Tabernacle, where the priest will concoct a God-infused potion that includes dust from the floor of the Holy of Holies, ink scraped from a holy scroll (and likely actual abortificant herbs, if the priest thinks this particular woman has been canoodling). The priest then tells the pregnant woman to drink this concoction after swearing in the Holy Tabernacle before God that she is innocent: that she has only had sex with her husband and no one else, and the baby is her husband’s. The idea is that if she is telling the truth, nothing will happen: she is vindicated. But if she is lying the God-infused bitter waters will cause her to abort her fetus, cause her “parts” to shrivel up, making her permanently infertile, and cause her name to become a curse among her people.

A little while later my dog starts following, barking softly, & whining at my friend's cats. It took me a while to figure out, that she was trying to herd them back inside - I think to rescue them.

Am I fired, or did I quit?","completion":"Don't sign nothing do not write nothing. Talk to an attorney for legal advice. The trick is according to the situation that you are in. If they are ending your position because of the economy they know you'll get unemployment benefits from them. If you resign you get nothing unless they are willing to hand you a severance package. My company did this in 2009 and called it a buyout not a volunteer lay off where you resigned and you got a severance package but didn't realize under EEOC and labor laws that if a company has to downsize because of the economy, the company is obligated to allow the employees unemployment benefits, my deceased wife was in this buyout ( not volunteer lay off) in company words. She along with the severance package also received unemployment benefits for a year at the company's expense."},{"prompt":"Are there any Enterprise Cloud sharing solutions like DropBox but that suit a larger user base. I.e. where only a client needs to be installed on each machine and it will store files locally or easily allow remote access to files?","completion":"Dropbox is mainly a cloud folder synchronization service. It is easy and convenient for consumers. For enterprises with many users, cloud folder sync is inefficient and insecure. Business data will be synced to many computers/devices, wasting a lot of local disk space and bandwidth. It is also not secure as business data is not centrally stored/managed. Data breach can happen on any computer/device and there is no easy way to prevent it. A better solution is to use a [LINKED_TEXT: Cloud File Server] [URL: https://www.drivehq.com/WebDAVCloudDriveMapping/]. [LINKED_TEXT: DriveHQ] [URL: https://www.drivehq.com/] is a leading Cloud File Server/WebDAV Drive Mapping service provider. For enterprises, it works just like a local file server. Employees can map cloud storage as a local drive. No training is needed. Unlike Dropbox folder sync, business data is centrally stored and managed in a cloud file server. System administrators can set fine granular access control to different folders. A cloud file server is better than a local file server in that: (1) It works from anywhere. You don’t need multiple files servers for multiple office locations. (2) You can securely share files with both your employees and external clients."},{"prompt":"w much will liposuction cost in India?","completion":"Cost of liposuction depends on the area , and amount of fat to be sucked.

The words went where the money went. That left Gaelic making a home in the Highlands and Islands - always a thorn in the side of the Scottish monarchy, with old-school clan chiefs running what were essentially independent realms a long way from the seat of the national government. Indeed, today the Highlands are still referred to as a’ Ghàidhealtachd - the place of the Gaels. The lowlanders sneered at Gaelic as ‘Yris’ (Irish), and its speakers as barbaric; the highlanders scowled at Scots as English in disguise, and the king as oppressive. In short, there was a huge political and cultural divide. By the time James acceded, there had also been a divide along religious lines: the Gaelic-speaking areas were still something of a Catholic stronghold, while the Scots- and English-speakers had taken enthusiastically to Protestantism. And at this point, it’s also worth taking a look at James Stuart himself. James was the son of a deposed and executed mother and a murdered father, dominated by overbearing regents and a pawn in other people’s politics from infancy. He was regularly beaten by his tutor too, and it’s quite understandable that all this instilled into James not only the intended respect for education and the Protestant faith but a profound dislike of other people being in control of him. There is a tendency to dismiss him as a fop, a spendthrift and a fool for a handsome man, but he had a first-rate academic intellect and a gritty streak of authoritarianism rooted in that thirst for self-determination. His resulting adherence to the philosophy of the Divine Right of Kings would have dire repercussions a generation down the line in England. But that, of course, was all to come, and nothing to do with Gaelic… James seized on the suppression of Gaelic as a way of gaining control of education, and thus culture and religion, in parts of his kingdom where a separate culture and religion fed a reservoir of opposition to his policies. Enforcing the English (or, in terms of actual vocabulary used, the Scots) language on the Gaelic strongholds was a long-term, hearts-and-minds strategy: first make them talk like James, then make them pray like James, then make them think like James, then make them loyal to James. That was the logic behind the Statutes of Icolmkill/Iona in 1609, which also did their best to stamp out the professional poets and musiscians who sustained Gaelic culture. He even went so far as to insist that the sons of clan chiefs be educated in English, at schools in the South and East of Scotland - and enjoyed partial success in converting some of the clans or at least their leaders, to Protestantism. But the partial nature of that success meant that it was in the Highlands that loyalty to the Catholic Stuart cause was most dogged a century later - and, again, it was the Highlands that paid the price in 1745. Overall, it is hard to say that James VI & I’s immediate family did a vast amount to benefit the Gaelic-speaking areas of their homeland; the collapse of the language was in many ways the least of the harm they did."},{"prompt":"Aren’t you upset seeing a tattoo all over Jungkook’s arm?","completion":"No way his tattoos look great on him and it brings out his personality and every tattoo gives a message Army's shouldn't get upset his tattoos are beautiful 🥰🥰💜💜💜💜"},{"prompt":"What is the procedure to improve my accuracy in quantitative aptitude for CAT Exam?","completion":"Start by reducing your attempts.

Just try to go over solution of a mock. The ones you got right, try to find out if there is a better way provided in the solution. The ones you got wrong or couldn't attempt, u obviously need to find out why. Maintain a notebook and note down any shortcut, grammar error, words, lr or di techniques u find valuable in solution of each test. Even if you give 20 mocks.

I’ve had better at the Berni Inn and they couldn’t batter a haddock for love nor money.” She got up, gathered her handbag, and marched purposefully down the disinfected corridors. Past Brian, sitting in his armchair, nodding. Past Margaret, who was yelling something about pigs. She could march. She may not know where her father had got to since breakfast or exactly which day was Wednesday, but there was nothing wrong with her legs. I followed her, again. “Excuse me” She poked her face round the kitchen door, and smiled, revealing that she had put her teeth in the wrong way round. “If it’s not too much trouble, I should very much like a small salmon sandwich”. Dementia varies so widely, but in most cases, in the middle stages, people suffer from terrible anxiety as they try to make sense of their environment. My mother, who was blessed with a particularly vivid imagination, decided to believe that she was at a hotel. During the months that she spent at this stage, this belief worked well for her. She was happy. Her world made sense. To try to force her out of this belief would have been cruel, and thankfully no-one did. The staff went along with it. I went along with it. We even had fun. But this is a world apart from actively telling her that she was in a hotel. If that didn’t chime with her experience of her environment, it wouldn’t give her peace: it would instead deepen her anxiety and foster mistrust of me, and paranoia about what the real story was. Let the patient lead. Don’t feed them lies but also don’t insistently force a truth on them that frightens them and they can’t retain in any case. My dad didn’t believe he was in a hotel.

But by chance, recently I happened to see one of his trending video speaking at Chandigarh, he asked “What do middle class tax payers get ? That’s what made my double antennas stand up and I said.. hey Wait a minute. He is talking sense. And I watched his speech in full, sitting at the edge of my seat. He swept me off my feet. Made complete sense to me. That’s where I realized, there is a big difference in his style of politics. I was impressed by his challenge when he said don’t vote for me next term if I do not fullfill my poll promises.. He didnt mince his words when he said, “don’t trust me just call up and ask your friends and relatives in Delhi.” See no politician can dare to challenge the public like this. To say it with such confidence requires conviction. Will power backed by tremendous ethics and honesty of having laid the ground work. Throughout the history of Indian politics the freebies were always distributed before polls and after the polls to the cattle class only .. The worthless herd ( approx 900 million people and growing). The reason why India is still a backward country. The worship of mediocrity. The nation will remain a trash can until they somehow ditch this cattle class completely, snap their voting rights, sterilize them and elevate the meritocratic at all levels. But the cunning system and the successful regimes have always ignored and back stabbed the tax paying middle class, the backbone of the nation. They were always fooled. For the first time in the history somebody had the balls to question it. He is giving free electricity, free medical care, subsidized schooling not only to the herd but also to the tax paying middle class. And that is the key differentiator. This is how it works in foreign countries the US and the UK. Work hard, pay taxes and get welfare. There is no freebies otherwise.. The moment I realized this I got huge respect for him and his style of politics. For the first time middle class has the voice. For the first time somebody took a stance for the middle class. Finally the middle class has some dignity and some value in his regime. And mind you, he is not doing it by squandering the treasury fund. For god sake, he is a former IRS officer and an income tax commissioner. He understands how revenue and tax works. He is doing it by completely eliminating the corruption from Delhi’s government bodies and it is those massive savings which have trickled down to all and sundry. Its totally fair. That is the right of citizens which have been denied for a long long time.

A much higher percentage of college-bound, highly-motivated classmates who have plenty of supportive, successful adults in their lives. Thus, a much lower percentage of unmotivated classmates who have few supportive, successful adults in their lives. Want to know why your school does things the way it does, and gets the outcomes it gets? Look around your classroom. Take a good, honest look at your classmates. Do they seem really motivated to learn? Or are they just there because they have to be there. Do they have a lot of discipline problems? Does your teacher spend a lot of time just trying to get them to be quiet and pay attention? Do they seem like they’ve put any thought into their careers? Do you ever feel like your school is “like a prison?” That’s something a lot of teens complain about. But, ask yourself, honestly, do a lot of your classmates act like future prisoners? Maybe your school’s policies are an appropriate reaction to the attitudes of the students within the school. And that’s the biggest advantage private schools have over public schools in most cases: a large majority of students who don’t act like future prisoners… who actually want to learn… who care about their future careers… Where I teach, in Chicago, that’s what keeps private schools in business: public schools that are filled with students who don’t care about their education and futures, and parents who are willing and able to pay 6–15k per year to save their children from that environment."},{"prompt":"What is the best way to start learning PHP?","completion":"Unlocking the Power of PHP: A Guide for Front End Developers As a front end developer, you have likely already developed a strong understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

They are still in a survival mode Maybe those people still haven’t awakened their potential yet. Or, maybe they haven’t realized what are they experiencing. Such probabilities will be more certain when they have toxic parents or sustained themselves for too long in a toxic environment. Since those people are still in their survival mode, they “stay” in unhealthy or abusive relationships, regardless of whether they enjoy the relationships or not (in which the answer is almost always a no). Perhaps, they still figure out how to move out from the toxic relationships and untangle themselves from the patterns. 2. They are hopeful for the good things People who stay in unhealthy or abusive relationships usually are kind-hearted people who put other people’s needs ahead of theirs. Unfortunately, abusers will always be abusers – still, they cling to the hopes that the abusers would be so kind-hearted to them at the beginning of their relationships. Often, the victims are people who can communicate well, and are willing to negotiate with their partners to make the relationships work. Since they believe they can save the relationships “one more time” if only they obey their abusers, no wonder they got stuck in unwanted relationships. 3. They just don’t care about it Please, please, please… Don’t be like these people. These people are just looking for pity-party, as they decidedly stay in toxic relationships just so other people will pity them and look at them as if they were the victims. Open up your eyes and you will start to notice the irregularities behind their fabricated stories.

Whatever gave you that idea? First of all, forget about YouTube videos and tutorials. They can be helpful later on for specific things once you have a solid understanding of how to apply them to your voice, but for learning basics they're pretty much useless. A video can't hear you, or tell you what you specifically need in order to improve, or check if you are practicing or doing something correctly or not. Find a song teacher and take a few lessons instead. Two lessons with a qualified song teacher will help you more than any video anywhere online. Exercises can be incredibly effective for improving your singing, as long as you pay close attention to what you're doing. There's nothing magical about scales or any other exercise, and if you're singing scales without paying attention to how you're singing them, then you're mostly just wasting your time. This is true for any kind of exercise or for practicing at all. However, If you listen closely to what you're doing while you sing those scales, know what to listen for, and correct whatever needs improvement, then your singing will almost inevitably improve. A good teacher can tell you what would be useful for you to practice, and they can teach you how to practice those things well and efficiently. In the long run, you can also learn how to teach yourself from this."},{"prompt":"What is your favorite guitar joke?","completion":"Q: What do you throw a drowning guitarist?

From Mars the Sun appears about half the size as it does on earth. 3. Martian year is roughly 88 percent longer than one year on earth. 4. A day on Mars is slightly longer than a day here on earth blasting around 24 hours and 40 minutes. 5. Mars is about 15% of the Earth's volume yet only 11% of Earth's mass, this means that not only is Mars smaller than Earth it also less dense. 6. Despite the fact that Mars is much smaller than Earth the two planets actually have roughly the same amount of land this is because around two-thirds of the earth is covered with oceans. 7. Because of its diminished size, the gravity on Mars is slightly less than 40% as strong as the gravity we experienced on earth. 8. Mars is a torus real planet meaning it is composed primarily of rocks and metals and has a hard crusty surface upon which you could stand. 9. However Mars wasn't always the arid red desert that it is today there is clear evidence that liquid water flowed in streams and rivers across the surface of the planet hundreds of millions of years ago and once upon a time the planet even had oceans. 10. Mar's red color is caused by iron oxides, it's actually only skin-deep and even in the thickest areas is probably no deep than around two meters or seven feet. 11. Mars regularly hosts the largest dust storms in the entire solar system they can last for months and sometimes cover the entire planet in a swirling red dust cloud. 12. Mars looks like the skin of a 15th century smallpox survivor is because it's situated far closer to the asteroid belt and has a much higher chance of being pummeled by space rocks leaving behind hundreds upon thousands of craters. 13. Craters on Mars that are under 60 kilometers in diameter are named after towns on earth with populations under 100,000 for example there's a 28 kilometer wide Martian crater called Tooting named after the London suburb of the same name. 14. Martian craters larger than 60 kilometers are named after scientists, writers and others who have contributed to the study observation and exploration of Mars for example there are craters named after Nicholas Copernicus, Isaac Newton, and Charles Darwin 15. Traditionally the crust of Mars is thought to be comprised of one piece, though recent research suggests that this may not actually be the case. Mars could be made up of two large plates. 16. The temperature on Mars is significantly more variable than it is on earth with mild highs of 70 degrees Fahrenheit and harrowing lows of minus 225 degrees Fahrenheit this works out to an average Martian surface temperature of roughly minus 81 degrees Fahrenheit or hard pass. 17. The two polar ice caps on Mars appear to be largely made of water. Mars and Earth are the only known planets to have polar ice caps. 18. The northern cap is up to two miles deep and covers an area significantly larger than the U.S. state of Texas. 19. There's so much water held in Mars a southern polar ice cap that if it melted water would cover the planet's entire surface in an ocean around 11 meters deep. 20. Mars has a thin atmosphere that consists mostly of carbon dioxide, argon, nitrogen and a very small amount of oxygen and water vapor. 21. As a result of Mars's thin atmosphere, liquid water cannot exist on the surface of Mars, except at the lowest elevations for a very short period of time before quickly evaporating. 22. Because Mars has hardly any atmosphere, its sunrises and sunsets appear blue rather than traditional orange and red. 23. Though Mars rotates slightly faster than Earth it takes its time orbiting the Sun making a complete orbit around sun once every 687 Earth days. 24. Mars orbits the Sun is an average distance of around 142 million miles a distance so large that it's pretty much impossible to fathom. 25. The oval shape orbit of Mars is more eccentric than most of the planet's orbits. 26. Mars also has an axial tilt of about 25 degrees and very similar to Earth's 23.5 degrees. 27. Since Mars has no large moon spinning around it to stabilize its rotation Mars is tilted far more wobbly than Earth's. 28. Mars lacks a magnetic field indicating that it does not possess a lovely molten metal core like Earth does. However scientists believe that the planet did have a magnetic field at one point probably around four billion years ago. 29. The lack of a magnetic field leaves the red planet without protection against deadly radiation from cosmic rays and solar flares. 30. On the 27th of August 2003, Mars made its closest approach to earth in almost 60,000 years and the next time it will be back close to us again on the 28th of August 2287. 31. Mars is one of five planets in our solar system that are visible from Earth to the naked eye, the others being Venus, Jupiter, Saturn, and Mercury. 32. Mars is home to Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain in the solar system. 33. Mars is also home to Valles Marineris, one of the longest and the deepest canyon systems in the entire solar system. It stretches for approximately over 2,485 miles, it's also up to 125 miles wide and has a maximum depth of 4.3 miles. 34. There are a number of large holes on Arsia Mons, a large Martian volcano that holes up to 150 meters across and so deep that we still cannot see the bottom of them they are thought to be the product of ancient lava flows or gateways to another dimension. 35. Mars also has two moons Phobos and Deimos which cheerfully mean fear and threat respectively these names come from the twin gods who accompanied Mars and Ares into battle. 36. Phobos and Deimos are small and irregular shaped. Phobos is roughly two hundred two kilometers across. while Deimos is about 12 kilometers and are thought to be asteroids captured by Mars as gravitational pull. 37. Scientists predict that Phobos will eventually be pulled out of orbit by Mar's gravity and brought crashing to the planet's surface this will occur in roughly 7 million years. 38. The smaller of Mars's moons Deimos is so tiny that it has to escape velocity by only 5.2 m/s, this means that in the unlikely event that you ever find yourself stranded on Deimos you could blast off from its surface simply by taking a running jump. 39. The first record of humanity's awareness of Mars dates back to 1534 BC when it was spotted by ancient Egyptian astronomers. 40. Egyptians gave Mars its very first recorded name Har Decher meaning the red one. They also referred to Mars as the backward traveler because the planets slobo orbit produces apparent retrograde motion appearing to move it backwards through the sky every 25 months.

That said, its not what the government of the United States did, when the Bill of Rights (of which the 2nd Amendment is a part) was ratified in 1791 the U.S. government had not been around long enough to do much. But you must recognize two things. Frist, these mean had just fought an armed rebellion against their “lawful” rulers. Some of the founders did not want the US to have a standing Army as standing Armies tend to obey the current government in power. Which leads to the second reason. Historically every longstanding governments, Rome, Athens, Egypt, France, England has at some point become brutally oppressive to some or all of the people it rules. The founders (agian not all) believed that an armed citizenry would have a way to oppose this sort of tyranny. Now many people ask how can armed civilians fight tanks and aircraft? For the moment let's set aside that the Viet Cong did it and the Mujajadeen did it in Afghanistan agaisnt the Russians were not pulling any punches so you can't use that “well the politicians restrained them” excuse. Anyway, the way to contextualize this is that when the government does go bad (and based on humanities track record it will, maybe not for centuries, but it will) they will have to pause and think about those that are armed. How do they proceed? The resources to raid every gun owner at once dont exist, banning guns will only cause some to hid their arms. Some estimates which are sadly impossible to verify due to the consequences for those who admit it, say that 20 to 50 percent of Australians did not turn in all of their arms. Where such a ban to happen here I can imagine the numbers for non compliance would be higher (refer to (Prohibition, Americans hate being told what they can't do). The point being it about having deterrent in hand to give a government that has become despotic pause, it may not stop them but the hope is it slows them until international pressure (don't make the mistake of also assuming the U.S. will remain tops dog forever either, nothing last forever) can change the situation."},{"prompt":"Like Jayalalitha, could Sridevi (if survived) be a good politician?","completion":"No, no chance for late actress Sridevi could be a politician, though both Jayalalithaa and Sridevi were famous actress from Tamilnadu."},{"prompt":"Can somebody help me with the best endocrinologist in Mumbai for pcos?","completion":"Stay With Fitness: Tips for Staying Fit With Type-2 Diabetes!!

The idea of using JavaScript and JSON across the entire stack was compelling. Node runs on the V8 engine, which is also what Chrome runs on. So now you only needed to learn one language to be a fullstack developer. Of course, the problem with that strategy is that JavaScript is an awful language, especially on the backend, with its lack of type safety and numerous design quirks. As many development teams learned the hard way, shoehorning MongoDB into every application wasn't the best of ideas either. It can be a good fit for storing independent collections of documents, but most applications are dominated by relational data, and Mongo is just not a good fit for that. In addition, React took over from Angular as the most popular frontend framework. Due to all of this, the MEAN stack quickly fell out of fashion. Node is still used along with its package manager npm in most frontend projects. In many ways, npm turned out to be more important than Node itself. Node as a backend language is far from dead. But it was never able to challenge the dominance of Java and C#."},{"prompt":"Why do so many students in India study engineering?

Generally speaking, Silicon Valley matters because it creates new technologies that change the world and disrupts stagnant industries and governments not using these technologies. Today, a variety of factors challenge the Valley’s ability to perform both of these functions. 1. RegulationDue to a confluence of anti-growth policies, the Bay Area is notoriously expensive and physically unable to accommodate the large number of people who want to work there (see: [LINKED_TEXT: Scraping by on six figures? Tech workers feel poor in Silicon Valley's wealth bubble] [URL: https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/feb/27/silicon-aa-cost-of-living-crisis-has-americas-highest-paid-feeling-poor]). Furthermore, California has high personal and corporate income taxes that make business and living especially onerous. Competing cities (e.g. Los Angeles, Seattle, DC, Boston, New York, Chicago, Austin, Boulder, Berlin, etc.), states (e.g. Texas, Colorado, Washington, Pennsylvania), and even nations (e.g. China) are the primary destinations of overflow talent, relocation, and otherwise unfeasible ideas (e.g. drones, bike-sharing). 2. Competition & Competitive AdvantagesAmbitious local and national leaders across the world are investing a lot of resources to develop their own tech capabilities and startup cultures. Aided by universities, existing companies, looser regulations, and higher concentrations of other-industry expertise, it is increasingly common for a particular region to rival or surpass Silicon Valley in a specific vertical. For instance, NYC and London have both focused on Fintech, Boston is famous for biotech, LA is known for aviation and entertainment, Pittsburgh has robotics, and DC is the main area for govtech. China has an entire ecosystem that rivals Silicon Valley, but is dominant in several verticals as well (e.g. drones, live video, mobile transactions, bike-sharing, gaming, etc.) 3. Reaching Critical MassSilicon Valley is incredibly successful because it reached a critical mass of talent and access to capital that has allowed its ecosystem to grow beyond its initial verticals (i.e. silicon chips, defense) and into a wide variety of interesting technologies. As other regions of the world pursue their specific verticals, some will eventually reach a critical mass of talent and access to capital that can, in turn, allow their ecosystems to grow. We’re already seeing this in Dublin, Seattle, Berlin, New York, Boston, Tel Aviv, and many, many cities in China (see: [LINKED_TEXT: David S. Rose's answer to Why haven't Chicago, New York, and Boston produced tech hubs like Silicon Valley?] [URL: https://www.quora.com/Why-havent-Chicago-New-York-and-Boston-produced-tech-hubs-like-Silicon-Valley/answer/David-S-Rose] and see [LINKED_TEXT: Asian Venture Capital Deals Mark Record Quarter In Q2 2017] [URL: http://www.valuewalk.com/2017/07/venture-capital-deals-mark-record-quarter-q2-2017/]). 4. AwarenessIn recent years, Silicon Valley’s importance has been predicated less on the technologies it creates and more on the startups that use these technologies to disrupt incumbents in business, non-profit, and government. Examples include PayPal, AirBnB, Uber, Tesla, SpaceX, Opendoor, etc. However, as Silicon Valley startups “conquer” large, entrenched competitors, remaining incumbents become more aware of start-ups as a legitimate existential threat. No CEO wants to get “Ubered” or replaced by a more tech-savvy executive (see: [LINKED_TEXT: Wall Street to CEOs: Disrupt Your Industry, or Else] [URL: https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-to-ceos-the-future-is-now-1495791003]). Resultantly, the world’s largest companies are making sizable efforts to stay ahead of the curve, either by buying startups before they become serious competitors, partnering with existing tech companies, or hiring top talent to create better technologies themselves. This makes it a lot harder for startups to become big companies, and thus lowers Silicon Valley’s overall importance. 5. Diffusion of Culture & KnowledgeOver the past six decades, Silicon Valley has had a distinct culture of geek, ambition, libertarianism, and “just do it”. It has also possessed a huge information advantage over other parts of the world. As the Internet diffuses knowledge (thanks Quora!) and a number of actors diffuse “start-up culture” (e.g. books, lean methodology, case studies, migration, etc.), Silicon Valley will gradually lose the soft advantages that have made it continually more innovative than other regions. The growth of Chinese universities and China’s move toward free market policies will also facilitate this transition. 6. LocalizationThe world is a large place. Every country, state, city, and neighborhood possesses unique identities, cultures, and problems that are best understood by the people who live nearby. Whether it’s KakaoTalk in South Korea or Marini Naturals in Kenya, local companies have and will continue to have a significant advantage over their California counterparts in discovering and providing local solutions."},{"prompt":"What are the best ways to invest money?","completion":"Investment is an essential component of personal finance, and it is necessary to understand the best ways to invest money in India. With the increasing number of investment options available today, choosing the right investment plan that caters to your financial goals can be a daunting task. Therefore, it is vital to evaluate various investment opportunities and make informed decisions. For long-term investments, mutual funds are a popular choice among investors. These funds pool money from different investors and invest in various stocks or bonds, providing high returns over time. Equity mutual funds provide higher returns than debt funds but are riskier as well. On the other hand, debt funds offer lower returns but are less risky than equity mutual funds.

Outside of our own contributions, Americans are most aware of millions of Soviet deaths, and the resistance fighters in eastern Europe. A close 2nd is the British and Canadian as allies on the beaches of Normandy, and of bombing runs against Germany from the UK. What is less well known, and which was ignored by your question, is the role of other belligerents in the Pacific theater. 14 million Chinese died in 8 years of WWII. Half a million Koreans… I could go on. While it is taught, accurately in my opinion, that American industry and military power was the principal driving force stopping the Japanese Navy during World War ii, less attention is paid to the contributions, and immense human suffering, of the Asian Nations Japan invaded. We are also taught that while the Manhattan Project was conducted in the US it was British and American scientists building on theoretical work from scientists from all over Europe, which led to the development of the first atomic weapon.
