The images didn't even come close to the actual developed photos. Returned the product the next day...bought Epson Perfection 3170 (for less money!!) and was extremely happy with scanned images. Don't buy the HP scanner!! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? The answer is:","completion":"Negative Step 1: Analyze the words used in the review The reviewer uses words such as \\"extremely disappointed,\\" \\"horrible,\\" \\"didn't even come close,\\" \\"returned,\\" and \\"don't buy.\\" These words indicate a negative sentiment as they express dissatisfaction. Step 2: Examine the reviewer's experience with the product The reviewer states that they were disappointed with the end product of the scanned negatives, which resulted in them returning the product the very next day and purchasing a different scanner. This illustrates that the reviewer had a negative experience with the HP scanner. Step 3: Compare the product to another similar product The reviewer compares the HP scanner to the Epson Perfection 3170, saying that they were extremely happy with the scanned images from the Epson scanner, and even notes that it was less expensive. This comparison further emphasizes the negative sentiment towards the HP scanner. Step 4: Consider the reviewer's recommendation The reviewer explicitly says, \\"Don't buy the HP scanner!!\\" which is a clear indication of a negative sentiment since they are advising potential buyers against purchasing the product.

Information: - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - A wallaby is a small- or mid-sized macropod found in Australia and New Guinea. They belong to the same taxonomic family as kangaroos and sometimes the same genus, but kangaroos are specifically categorised into the six largest species of the family. The term wallaby is an informal designation generally used for any macropod that is smaller than a kangaroo or wallaroo that has not been designated otherwise. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - Marsupials are any members of the mammalian infraclass Marsupialia. All extant marsupials are endemic to Australasia and the Americas. A distinctive characteristic common to these species is that most of the young are carried in a pouch. Well-known marsupials include kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, possums, opossums, wombats, Tasmanian devils, and the recently extinct thylacines. Others include the numbat, the bandicoot, the bettong, the bilby, the quoll, and the quokka. - Wallaroo is any of three closely related species of moderately large macropod, intermediate in size between the kangaroos and the wallabies. The word \\"wallaroo\\" is from Dharug \\"walaru\\". In general, a large, slim-bodied macropod of the open plains is called a \\"kangaroo\\"; a small to medium-sized one, particularly if it is relatively thick-set, is a \\"wallaby\\": most wallaroos are only a little smaller than a kangaroo, fairly thickset, and are found in open country. All share a particular habit of stance: wrists raised, elbows tucked close into the body, and shoulders thrown back, and all have a large, black-skinned rhinarium. - Macropus is a marsupial genus that belongs to the family Macropodidae. It has thirteen extant species which are further divided into three subgenera. The genus includes all terrestrial kangaroos, wallaroos, and several species of wallaby. The term itself is derived from the Ancient Greek , \\"makros\\" \\"long\\" and , \\"pous\\" \\"foot\\". A further eleven extinct species are recognised. The type species is the eastern grey kangaroo. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - Macropods are marsupials belonging to the family Macropodidae, the kangaroo family, which includes kangaroos, wallabies, tree-kangaroos, pademelons, quokkas, and several others. Macropods are native to the Australian continent (the mainland, Tasmania, New Guinea and nearby islands). Before European settlement of Australia, about 65 species of macropods existed. Six species have since become extinct and a further eleven have been greatly reduced in numbers. Other species (e.g. \\"Simosthenurus\\", \\"Propleopus\\", \\"Macropus titan\\") became extinct after the Australian Aborigines arrived and before the Europeans arrived. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The kangaroo is a marsupial from the family Macropodidae (macropods, meaning \\"large foot\\"). In common use the term is used to describe the largest species from this family, especially those of the genus \\"Macropus\\": the red kangaroo, antilopine kangaroo, eastern grey kangaroo, and western grey kangaroo. Kangaroos are endemic to Australia. The Australian government estimates that 34.3 million kangaroos lived within the commercial harvest areas of Australia in 2011, up from 25.1 million one year earlier. - The Paleolithic or Palaeolithic; pronunciation: ) Age, Era or Period is a prehistoric period of human history distinguished by the development of the most primitive stone tools discovered (Grahame Clark's Modes I and II), and covers roughly 95% of human technological prehistory. It extends from the earliest known use of stone tools, probably by Homo habilis initially, 2.6 million years ago, to the end of the Pleistocene around 10,000 BP. - Protemnodon is a genus of megafaunal macropods that existed in Australia , Tasmania , and Papua New Guinea in the Pleistocene . Based on fossil evidence , Protemnodon is thought to have been physically similar to wallabies , but far larger ; Protemnodon hopei was the smallest in the genus weighing about 45 kg , the other species all weighed over 110 kg. Recent analysis of mtDNA extracted from fossils indicates that Protemnodon was closely related to Macropus . - Archaeology, or archeology, is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture. The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts, and cultural landscapes. Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities. In North America, archaeology is considered a sub-field of anthropology, while in Europe archaeology is often viewed as either a discipline in its own right or a sub-field of other disciplines. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Papua New Guinea (PNG Hiri Motu: \\"Papua Niu Gini\\"), officially the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, is an Oceanian country that occupies the eastern half of the island of New Guinea and its offshore islands in Melanesia, a region of the southwestern Pacific Ocean north of Australia. Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua. - Bass Strait is a sea strait separating Tasmania from the Australian mainland, specifically the state of Victoria. - The Pleistocene (often colloquially referred to as the Ice Age) is the geological epoch which lasted from about 2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago, spanning the world's most recent period of repeated glaciations. The end of the Pleistocene corresponds with the end of the last glacial period and also with the end of the Paleolithic age used in archaeology. - The eastern grey kangaroo (\\"Macropus giganteus\\") is a marsupial found in southern and eastern Australia, with a population of several million. It is also known as the great grey kangaroo and the Forester kangaroo. Although a big eastern grey male typically masses around 66 kg (weight 145 lb.) and stands almost 2 m (6.6 ft.) tall, the scientific name, \\"Macropus giganteus\\" (gigantic large-foot), is misleading: the red kangaroo of the semi-arid inland is larger, weighing up to 90 kg.

This is where you'll get a lot of information on the product and be able to compare to other items in the store. Start by looking at the ingredient list. You'll want to know exactly what you're feeding your child (especially if you're worried about allergies or sensitivities). This is usually found on the back or side of the cereal container. Regardless of what grain you're choosing, go for 100% whole grains. If the label says white rice or hulled wheat, these are not 100% whole grains. You will also see the nutrition fact panel on baby cereals. If your child needs to meet a certain calorie level to improve growth, this is where you'll find out how many calories this cereal contains per serving. Many health professions like pediatricians suggest starting babies on fortified cereals. These products have certain nutrients added to them to help them be a more nutrient dense food for your child. Look for cereals that are fortified with iron. You might find this as a \\"call-out\\" on the front of the package. Double check there is iron on the ingredient list and on the nutrition fact panel. Babies need about 10 – 11 mg of iron per day. You may also see cereals that are fortified with DHA or EPA. These are optional fortifications; however, both of these healthy fats help support the development of your baby's brain and immune system. DHA is needed for brain, eye, and nervous system development. DHA accumulates in the brain during the first two years of life. The brain grows quickly at this time of life. Some infant cereals even advertise that they contain probiotics. Although this is only an optional fortification, some studies show that probiotics may help infants with colic, diarrhea or eczema. Another option that you'll see on store shelves is organic baby cereal. Decide whether or not you want to feed your child organic or conventional baby cereal. Organic baby cereals are produced the same way that other organic foods are. They are not raised or farmed with pesticides or synthetic fertilizers. Feeding your baby an organic cereal may limit their exposure to these pesticides. There are different organic labels you'll see in the store. \\"100% organic\\" can be used to label a product that contains 100% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water which are considered natural). \\"Organic\\" can be used to label any product that contains a minimum of 95% organic ingredients (excluding salt and water). Up to 5% of the ingredients may be inorganic, and are not commercially available as organic. \\"Made with organic ingredients\\" means they contain at least 70% organically produced ingredients. When it comes to nutrition, there is no difference between organic and conventional baby cereal. The nutrients are identical. Health professionals generally recommend you choose organic if you feel that is most important; however, it's better to focus on finding a cereal that contains adequate fortification and is something you and your baby will enjoy. If you don't find a baby cereal in-store that you think is appropriate for your child, consider making your own baby cereal. This is not very difficult, but does take some advanced planning. To make your own homemade baby cereal, start by choosing what grain you'd like to use. Brown rice is the most common grain, but you can also use oats or multigrain cereals. Blend 1/4 cup of your chosen grain in a food processor until it becomes a powder or the consistency of flour. Mix this with about 1 cup of water, breast milk or formula. Bring to a low simmer and whisk for a few constantly for about 10 minutes. Taste the cereal to make sure there are not uncooked pieces. Allow your homemade cereal to cool completely or to be only room temperature. Serve to your child within 24 hours.","completion":"To choose the best healthy and nutritious baby cereal, start by examining the food label, which contains essential information to compare with other products.

Its exact area is not precisely or consistently defined but varies depending on whether one is taking a linguistic, geographic, socio-cultural or historic standpoint. - Speed metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music that originated in the late 1970s from new wave of British heavy metal (NWOBHM) roots. It is described by AllMusic as \\"extremely fast, abrasive, and technically demanding\\" music. - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards. - Heavy metal (or simply metal) is a genre of rock music that developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s, largely in the United Kingdom and the United States. With roots in blues rock and psychedelic/acid rock, the bands that created heavy metal developed a thick, massive sound, characterized by highly amplified distortion, extended guitar solos, emphatic beats, and overall loudness. Heavy metal lyrics and performance styles are sometimes associated with aggression and machismo. - The new wave of British heavy metal (commonly abbreviated as NWOBHM) was a nationwide musical movement that started in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s and achieved international attention by the early 1980s. Journalist Geoff Barton coined the term in a May 1979 issue of the British music newspaper \\"Sounds\\" to describe the emergence of new heavy metal bands in the late 1970s, during the period of punk rock's decline and the dominance of new wave music. - Holy Moses is a German thrash metal band. They are well noted for being fronted by Sabina Classen (it is rare for a woman to be a singer in thrash metal) and for being one of the very first German thrash metal bands. - Thrash metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music characterized by its fast tempo and overall aggression. The songs usually use fast percussive beats and low-register guitar riffs, overlaid with shredding-style lead work. The lyrics often deal with social issues and reproach for The Establishment, using direct and denunciatory language, an approach borrowed from hardcore punk. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - Helloween is a German power metal band founded in 1984 in Hamburg, Northern Germany.

Context: Multiple ischemic lesions identified by diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been shown to predict high risk of future ischemic events. However, the importance of lesion age has not been factored into this risk. Our goal was to evaluate whether the presence of ischemic lesions of varying ages identified by DWI and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) suggests a higher risk of future ischemic events.', 'Patients with acute stroke and TIA presenting within 12 hours of symptom onset who had a baseline and 1-month follow-up MRI were enrolled in the study. Acute ischemic lesions were divided into DWI positive with ADC low lesions and DWI positive with ADC normalized lesions. The baseline MRI and the presence of new lesions on the follow-up MRI were analyzed.', 'A total of 360 patients were prospectively enrolled, and all had appropriate imaging. Two hundred twenty-three were excluded as there were no DWI lesions, they received recombinant tissue plasminogen activator, or they did not have the 30-day follow-up MRI. One hundred seventeen patients had DWI lesions of one age (DWI positive with either ADC low lesions or ADC normalized lesions alone) and 20 had lesions of varying ages (DWI positive lesions with reduced and normalized ADC) on the baseline MRI. Patients with multiple DWI lesions of varying ages were at more risk of having new lesions on the 30-day MRI compared with those having lesions of the same age (relative risk = 3.6; 95% CI 1.9 to 6.8). Multiple DWI lesions of varying ages (odds ratio [OR] 6.6; 95% CI 2.3 to 19.1) and cardioembolic stroke subtype (OR 3.2; 95% CI 1.1 to 8.7) were independently associated with new lesion recurrence by multiple logistic regression analysis. Answer: The presence of multiple diffusion-weighted imaging lesions of varying ages suggests very active early recurrence over time and portends a higher early risk of future ischemic events.

The statement highlights the importance of ensuring that these rights are respected and protected, for they form the basis of a democratic and just society. Below is an analysis of the various freedoms mentioned in the statement and the implications of the restrictions on them. 1. Freedoms of thought, conscience, and religion: These fundamental freedoms allow people to form, hold, and express their beliefs without fear of persecution or discrimination. They also encompass the freedom to change one's religion or belief and to practice one's faith in private and public. Restrictions on these freedoms may lead to severe consequences, such as limiting social, cultural, and intellectual progress, as well as fostering intolerance, enmity, and divisions within society. 2. Freedom of opinion and expression: This right is directly related to the freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive, and impart information and ideas through any media, regardless of frontiers. Unceasing restrictions on this freedom may lead to censorship, the suppression of dissent, and a lack of transparency in governance, eventually resulting in a stifled democratic process, curtailed individual development, and diminished creativity. 3. Freedom of peaceful assembly and association: The rights to gather peacefully, form associations, and express collective interests are essential to a vibrant civil society and function as a channel for public participation in decision-making processes. Limitations on these freedoms can limit the voice of the people, affect the balance of power, and lead to corruption and abuse of authority by those in positions of power. 4. Access to information for everyone: Transparency and access to information are pivotal in building a well-informed and engaged populace. Restrictions on these aspects may lead to misinformation, concealment of illegal activities, and the obstruction of justice, creating an environment ripe for corruption and the infringement of human rights. 5. Freedom of movement within the country and travel abroad: Ensuring the right to move without unjustified restrictions allows individuals to exercise their personal freedoms and contribute to the economic and social well-being of the nation. Restricting this freedom may result in negative impacts on freedom of choice, family unity, and cultural exchange, as well as limiting opportunities for education, work, and political participation. In conclusion, severe and unceasing restrictions on these fundamental rights can lead to significant detrimental effects on individuals and society as a whole. Upholding these freedoms is essential for fostering a democratic, just, and progressive society, where its members can pursue their personal and collective aspirations without fear or hindrance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Brewster (Dennis O'Keefe), a newly discharged U.S. soldier back from fighting in Europe during World War II, rushes home in New York City to marry his sweetheart, Peggy Gray (Helen Walker). However, he has to postpone the wedding after he learns of a strange windfall. His deceased uncle has left him 8 million, but he can inherit the money only if he can spend a million of it before his 30th birthday, only two months away by October 13, 1944, without keeping any assets. The lawyer explains that Brewster's relative hoped it would make him so sick of spending that the rest of the fortune would not be wasted. The conditions include not telling anyone what he is doing. Brewster reluctantly agrees. Brewster sets up his own investment company called Brewster &amp; Company and hires his wartime buddies Hacky Smith (Joe Sawyer) and Noppy Harrison (Herbert Rudley) as vice presidents and Peggy as his private secretary. However, despite his best efforts, most of his schemes to lose money become profitable. Worse, Peggy becomes jealous of Brewster spending a great deal of time with first socialite Barbara Drew (Gail Patrick), then showgirl Trixie Summers (June Havoc), even though he is only using them to help squander the million. Smith and Harrison (mistakingly thinking that Brewster has gone crazy due to his spending sprees), begin to thwart all of his spending schemes. At the same time, Peggy breaks up with Brewster, but her wise mother (Nana Bryant) persuades her to go on a costly cruise with him and the cast of a failed play he financed after Smith and Harrison close it down. During the cruise, Smith and Harrison stage a rebellion by confining Brewster to his quarters and ordering Brewster's chartared yacht turned around to return to New York, thinking that Brewster has lost his mind by financing this pointless cruise.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Coal is loaded into the firebox - The boiler produces steam under high pressure - The steam generated in the boiler flows down into a cylinder - Just ahead of the wheels, pushing a tight-fitting plunger, the piston - The piston is connected to one or more of the locomotive&#x27;s wheels through a kind of arm-elbow-shoulder joint called a crank and connecting rod - As the piston pushes, the crank and connecting rod turn the locomotive&#x27;s wheels and power the train along - An outlet valve opens and the piston pushes the steam back through the cylinder and out up the locomotive&#x27;s chimney - Question: suppose less coal available happens, how will it affect LESS power produced by the steam engine. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","completion":"B: less If there is less coal available, it will directly impact the power produced by the steam engine. Here's a detailed explanation of how this happens: 1. With less coal available, the amount of coal loaded into the firebox will be reduced. The firebox is responsible for heating the water in the boiler, producing high-pressure steam. 2. When there is less coal in the firebox, the burning temperature will not be as high, and the boiler will not be able to produce the same amount of steam under high pressure as it would with a sufficient amount of coal. 3. As a result, the steam generated in the boiler will have less energy, and when it flows down into the cylinder, the force exerted on the piston will be lower. 4. Since the piston is connected to the locomotive's wheels through the crank and connecting rod, a decrease in the force exerted by the steam on the piston will lead to a lower turning force on the crank and connecting rod. This, in turn, will result in less power being transmitted to the wheels. 5. With less power being transferred to the wheels, the locomotive will not be able to propel the train along with the same amount of force and speed. 6. Additionally, the reduced steam pressure in the cylinder may also result in the outlet valve not opening as effectively, which can have an impact on the overall efficiency of the steam engine. Therefore, when there is less coal available, it will lead to less power being produced by the steam engine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Russian: В конце XIX и начале XX веков, царизм активно использовал военные подразделения для подавления революционных и национально-освободительных движений, особенно во время Революции 1905-1907 годов. В этот период российская империя проходила через серьезные социальные, политические и экономические напряжения, что приводило к массовым протестам и волнениям на национальной основе. Одной из главных причин возникновения революционных движений было насилие и эксплуатация царской администрации, ужесточение цензуры и подавление любых возможных проявлений свободы и независимости. Царская власть создавала все больше и больше слоев недовольных людей, включая крестьян, рабочих, студентов и интеллигенцию. В этой связи, царизм в своей попытке сохранить свою власть и подавить революционное марево использовал военные подразделения для борьбы с возросшими социальными напряжениями. Военные части демонстрировали строгую верность и лояльность царью, были хорошо обучены в тактике подавления массовых протестов и быстро реагировали на любые знаки возмущения. Подавление Революции 1905-1907 годов было жестоким и кровавым, с тысячами убитых и раненых на обеих сторонах конфликта. Военные подразделения действовали беспощадно – полиция и войска открывали огонь без предупреждения, а арестованных мирных жителей и революционеров ждало мучительное заключение или казнь. Однако, несмотря на весь этот ужас, использование военных сил для подавления незадачливых революций и движений, долго сохранить власть царизму не удалось. В результате Серебряного века русской культуры, а затем и расширяющегося присутствия идеологии социализма, народное недовольство продолжало расти. Наконец, в 1917 году, каждая из тех же самых групп, которые участвовали в Революции 1905-1907 годов, объединились еще раз, и единая революционная волна положила конец царскому режиму России и привела к формированию новой, советской власти."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) is not only a sparring partner to him but also responsible for organizing his fights.Joey discusses a potential shot for the title with one of his mob connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent), on the way to his brother's house in their neighborhood in the Bronx. When they are finally settled in the house, Jake admits that he does not have much faith in his own abilities. Accompanied by his brother to the local open-air swimming pool, a restless Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vickie (Cathy Moriarty) at the edge of the pool. Although he has to be reminded by his brother he is already married, the opportunity to invite her out for the day very soon comes true when Joey gives in.Jake has two fights with Sugar Ray Robinson, set two years apart, and Jake loses the second when the judges rule in favor of Sugar Ray because he was leaving the sport temporarily for conscription in the United States Army. This does not deter Jake from winning six straight fights, but as his fears grow about his wife, Vickie, having feelings for other men, particularly Tony Janiro, the opponent for his forthcoming fight, he is keen enough to show off his sexual jealously when he beats him in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colosanto) and Vickie.The recent triumph over Janiro is touted as a major boost for the belt as Joey discusses this with journalists, though Joey is briefly distracted by seeing Vickie approach a table with Salvy and his crew. Joey has a word with Vickie, who says she is giving up on his brother. Blaming Salvy, Joey viciously attacks him in a fight that spills outside of the club. When Tommy Como hears...

Answer the following question: Given the below context: War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016. Beginning in 2010, and for the next five years, Seattle gained an average of 14,511 residents per year, with the growth strongly skewed toward the center of the city, as unemployment dropped from roughly 9 percent to 3.6 percent.

Question 1: How do intelligent people intimidate others with their intelligence? Example? Question 2: \\"What does it mean to be 'people smart'?\\" Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They deal with different aspects of intelligence and human behavior. I will provide detailed explanations for each question to clarify the differences. Question 1: How do intelligent people intimidate others with their intelligence? Example? Intelligent people can sometimes intimidate others by using their intellectual prowess in ways that make others feel inferior or unable to match their cognitive abilities. This can be done intentionally or unintentionally. Here are some ways intelligent people might intimidate others: 1. Using complicated language: An intelligent person might use advanced vocabulary, technical jargon, or complex sentence structures that others struggle to understand. This can create a sense of distance between them and those they communicate with, making others feel inadequate. Example: A scientist talking about their research findings using a lot of technical terms and complex phrases that a layperson might not understand, making the layperson feel intimidated and unsure of their own knowledge. 2. Displaying extensive knowledge: Intelligent people can have a vast repository of knowledge across various subjects, and they might display this information in conversations and debates, making others feel overwhelmed or less informed. Example: During a group discussion about climate change, an intelligent person could share intricate details about the subject and cite numerous studies and facts, making others feel like they lack enough information to contribute meaningfully to the conversation. 3. Condescending attitude: Some intelligent people might develop a sense of superiority over those they deem less intelligent. They might express themselves in a condescending manner, belittle others' opinions, or dismiss them outright. Example: A professor in a university setting might dismiss a student's question or opinion as \\"irrelevant\\" or \\"naive\\" without even considering its merit. Question 2: \\"What does it mean to be 'people smart'?\\" Being \\"people smart\\" refers to possessing strong interpersonal and social skills. People who are people-smart have a keen understanding of others' emotions, motivations, and behaviors and can effectively navigate social situations, build relationships, and work well in teams. Some elements of being people smart include: 1. Emotional intelligence: People who are people-smart can quickly perceive and understand the emotions of others and respond accordingly. They know how to empathize, provide support, and adapt their communication style to connect with others on an emotional level. 2. Communication skills: People-smart individuals excel at both verbal and non-verbal communication. They can express their thoughts and feelings clearly, listen actively, and interpret body language and other non-verbal cues. 3. Conflict resolution: Being people-smart means effectively managing conflicts and finding solutions that satisfy all parties involved. People with these skills are good at maintaining harmony in relationships and addressing disagreements in a constructive manner. 4. Adaptability: People-smart individuals can adapt their behavior to different social and cultural contexts, making it easier for them to build relationships with diverse groups of people. In summary, while Question 1 explores how intelligence can be intimidating to others, Question 2 discusses the concept of being \\"people smart,\\" which refers to possessing strong interpersonal and social skills. These questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of human intelligence and behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Working the night shift a few nights a month can do more than leave your eyes bleary-eyed ,suggests a study on Wednesday. It just might increase your risk of color1ectal cancer .Nurses who worked the night shift at least three times a month for t5 years or more were 35%more likely to develop that type of cancer than nurses who never worked nights,Harvard University researchers report in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The finding,from the ongoing Nurses Health Study,is the first to link night shift work with a higher risk of color1ectal cancer,expected to kill 57,100 Americans this, according to the American Cancer Society.Another research,including a report out of the Nurses Health Study, has suggested that working night shifts increases women's breast cancer risk. The researchers asked 78,586 nurses whether they had ever worked three or more night shifts a month.The nurses indicated whether they had done so for less than 15 years or 15 years or more.The scientists followed the women to see who developed color1ectal cancer. Researchers believe that lowered levels of melatonin might increase night-shift workers' cancer risk.Melatonin levels usually reach the highest point in the middle of the night. Turn on the lights,though,and _ dropped measurably in just 10 minutes,says Richard Stevens a cancer epidemiologist at the University of Connecticut who did not take part in the new study.After two weeks of continuous nightly exposure to light,humans experience a sharp drop in melatonin production,Nurses Health Study researchers write. In the lab,melatonin appears to stop tumor growth.Other studies suggest that color1ectal cancer patients have lower blood levels of melatonin than healthy people,the authors write.However,that could be a result of the disease,not a cause of it.Stevens says.

This statement is NOT true because the Nurses Health Study does not claim that nurses who never work night shifts are completely free from colorectal cancer. Instead, the study indicates that those who work night shifts at least three times a month for 15 years or more have a 35% higher risk of developing colorectal cancer compared to those who never work night shifts.

The Science Of 'Happily Ever After': 3 Things That Keep Love Alive As Daniel Jones, author of Love Illuminated, explains: we spend youth asking “How do I find love?” and midlife asking “How do I get it back?” Anyone in a relationship or who plans on being in one needs to know how to keep love alive over the long term. But how do you learn the secret to this? Everyone is happy to explain “how they met” but few give the details on “how they stayed together.” So let’s look at what science has to say. Aside from being the epitome of lazy writing, “happily ever after” is not simple. Ty Tashiro explains that couples in their first year of marriages score 86% for marriage satisfaction. By the seventh year, it’s under 50%. Yes, about 50% of couples get divorced. Another 10-15% separate but do not file paperwork. And 7 more percent are chronically unhappy. So the real stat is two-thirds of marriages do not live “happily ever after.” Via The Science of Happily Ever After: What Really Matters in the Quest for Enduring Love: The divorce rate often reported by the media is 50 percent, which is based on Census Bureau data. However, census data does not capture the 10 to 15 percent of couples who permanently separate but do not file formal paperwork for a legal divorce. This means that a conservative estimate of the divorce and permanent separation rate is 60 percent. Add the additional 7 percent of chronically unhappy couples who do not divorce or permanently separate but are consistently unhappy in their marriage, and this means that two-thirds of all married couples do not live happily ever after. Why is marriage so hard over the long term? One of the main reasons is what science calls it “habituation.” Which is a fancy way of saying we get bored. Early on, when a couple can finish each other’s sentences it’s romantic. But over time “predictable” is a huge negative. Chris Rock gets the point across humorously in this video (NSFW): Robert Greene, author of The Art of Seduction, explains that surprise is key to romantic feelings: Seduction involves a degree of surprise, which is generally the first thing that disappears after you’ve been in a relationship, and why there’s no more seducing that goes on. Everything is familiar and you’re no longer surprised by the other person. So is there any way to bring those tingles back? Hold on a sec. We can learn something here. What do researchers find when they compare at 50 arranged marriages and 50 “love” marriages? Love marriages start out happier — but that declines quickly. Arranged marriages start out less happy, but after 10 years, they’re happier than love marriages. And stay that way. Via The Art of Choosing: The couples who had married for love and been together less than a year averaged a score of 70 points out of a possible 91 on the love scale, but these numbers steadily fell over time. The love couples who had been married ten years or longer had an average score of only 40 points. In contrast, the couples in arranged marriages were less in love at the outset, averaging 58 points, but their feelings increased over time to an average score of 68 at the ten or more years mark. What’s the secret behind the long term success of arranged marriages? They have to work at it. They don’t passively rely on “magic” and intense emotion. They have to spend a lot of time thinking about how to make it work. That process of discovery is ostensibly the fun of courtship, too, except that in arranged marriage the goal is to figure out how to be married, not whether to marry. Research shows expecting a fairy tale relationship is a prescription for disappointment. Via 100 Simple Secrets of Great Relationships: Elements of fairy tales such as Cinderella were present in 78 percent of people’s beliefs about romantic love. Those people were more likely to have experienced disillusionment, devastation, and angst in their relationships than were those who gave less credence to fairy tales. – Lockhart 2000 Feeling like it’s all magic means it’s out of your control — and that without that initial magic, it’s hopeless. The happiness of arranged marriages means a couple can make magic if they try. So you need to actively keep the marriage happy. How do you do that? Look at your spouse as something you purchased “as-is.” Research shows trying to change them doesn’t work: …when participants (N = 160) focused their relationship improvement attempts on changing the partner, individuals reported more negative improvement strategies, lower improvement success, and, in turn, more negative relationship evaluations… results suggest that targeting the partner may do more harm than good despite that relationship evaluations pivot on whether the partner produces change. John Gottman, researcher and author of The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work, says 69% of a couple’s problems are perpetual. These problems don’t go away yet many couples keep arguing about them year after year. Via The Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work: Most marital arguments cannot be resolved. Couples spend year after year trying to change each other’s mind – but it can’t be done. This is because most of their disagreements are rooted in fundamental differences of lifestyle, personality, or values. By fighting over these differences, all they succeed in doing is wasting their time and harming their marriage. So if you can’t change them and they won’t change you, how can you reduce the bad stuff? You can’t. But you don’t need to. The best relationships are more about increasing the good than reducing the bad. Divorce may have less to do with an increase in conflict and more to do with a decrease in positive feelings. Via Flourish: A Visionary New Understanding of Happiness and Well-being: Shelly Gable, professor of psychology at the University of California at Santa Barbara, has demonstrated that how you celebrate is more predictive of strong relations than how you fight. Okay, so you need to increase the good times. What’s the best way to do that? (This part is exciting. I mean, literally.) Think a pleasant date night is all it takes to keep love alive? Researchers did a 10 week study comparing couples that engaged in “pleasant” activities vs “exciting” activities. Pleasant lost. Via For Better: How the Surprising Science of Happy Couples Can Help Your Marriage Succeed: Those who had undertaken the “exciting” date nights showed a significantly greater increase in marital satisfaction than the “pleasant” date night group… Why would doing anything exciting have such a big effect on a relationship? Because we’re lousy about realizing where our feelings are coming from. Excitement from any source will be associated with the person you’re with, even if they’re not the cause of it. As happiness researcher Sonja Lyubomirsky explains, excitement experienced mutually brings the tingles back. Via The Myths of Happiness: What Should Make You Happy, but Doesn’t, What Shouldn’t Make You Happy, but Does: …Whether the couples were only dating or long-married, the ones who did the shared novel activity were more likely than the ones who did the shared neutral activity to agree to statements like “I feel happy when I am doing something to make my partner happy” and “I feel ‘tingling’ and ‘an increased heartbeat’ when I think of my partner” after the activity than before. So no boring, lame date nights. Go do something exciting. Go dancing together or anything else you can both participate in as a couple. Keeping love alive can be tricky. You need to actively work at it and it’s more important to increase the good then to reduce the bad. And the best way to do that is by increasing excitement. So you’re hopping on roller coasters and going white water rafting — but what do you need to do when you’re there? Pretend you’re on your first date. Studies show pretending time with a romantic partner was a first date makes it more enjoyable for you and for your partner: Across a series of studies, participants underestimated how good they would feel in situations that required them to put their best face forward… participants who were instructed to engage in self-presentation felt happier after interacting with their romantic partner than participants who were not given this instruction… Why? On first dates we make an effort to impress. And we’re full of hope. Love means being a little delusional (Some researchers even think love might qualify as a mental illness.) Thinking your partner is better than they really are makes for longer, better relationships. Via The Science of Love: Sandra Murray and her colleagues have been studying romantic relationships now for several decades, and have found that idealising one’s partner is a sure recipe for marital success; moreover, the higher one’s ideals are and the more one idealises one’s partner, the more satisfied one is with the relationship – and the longer it is likely to last.

Engaging in exciting and novel activities together, which fosters feelings of excitement and happiness that can be attributed to the relationship. 4.

The owners of Germany's Die Zeit and Handelsblatt had claimed that AdBlock Plus's product was anti-competitive and threatened their ability to make money. But a court in Hamburg ruled that users do have the right to use the plug-in. The judgement has implications for other disputes involving the tool. \\"The Hamburg court decision is an important one because it sets a precedent that may help us avoid additional lawsuits and expenses defending what we feel is an obvious consumer right: giving people the ability to control their own screens by letting them block annoying ads and protect their privacy,\\" wrote AdBlock Plus's project manager, Ben Williams, on its blog. \\"Now that the legalities are out of the way, we want to reach out to other publishers and advertisers and content creators and encourage them to work with Adblock Plus rather than against us.\\" However, the publishers have indicated that they intend to fight on. \\"We are still convinced that AdBlock Plus is an illegal and anti-competitive practice,\\" they said in a joint statement. \\"It infringes the freedom of the press. Therefore, we will await the written reasons for the judgment, analyse them and examine the prospects of an appeals procedure.\\" AdBlock Plus - which is owned by the Cologne-based firm Eyeo - faces three separate but related cases involving the media groups, ProSiebenSat.1, RTL Interactive and Axel Springer. The recent court case had contested the legality of AdBlock Plus's software suppressing adverts from the pages of the Zeit Online, Handelsblatt and Wirtschafts Woche news sites. Their publishers had sought damages, but said their motivation was to challenge the software provider's wider business model. \\"We are, of course, questioning the offer [of] Adblock Plus in general,\\" Ebba Schroder, a spokeswoman for Zeitverlag Gerd Bucerius told the BBC. While AdBlock Plus offers its web browser add-on to the public for free, it makes money by operating a \\"white list\\" of adverts that it allows to get through its filters. Such ads must meet certain criteria, for instance they must not include animations or sounds and cannot be pop-ups that cover other content. Website operators that want ads on their site added to the white list must seek permission. Although AdBlock Plus states that \\"no one can buy their way onto the white list\\", it does charge fees for what it terms \\"support services\\", the details of which are not made public. In February, the Financial Times reported that one unnamed media company had said it had been asked to pass on the equivalent of 30% of the extra revenues it would have made by having ads on its platform unblocked. That has led some critics to claim that the Eyeo is engaged in a \\"racket\\". But the firm insists that term is \\"imprecise and wrong\\". It highlights that its service has proved popular with many users, with AdBlock Plus having been downloaded nearly 400 million times. It also notes that it does not charge fees to smaller businesses and blogs, and allows users to block its white-listed ads if desired. \\"If we are racketeers we are terrible racketeers because 90% of the people on the white list don't pay anything and the criteria is the same for everyone,\\" Mr Williams told the BBC. \\"[The ruling] is living proof of the unalienable right of every user to enjoy online self-determination.\\" However, one lawyer, who is not involved in the German cases, noted that other European courts might not necessarily take the same view. \\"The Hamburg court based its decision on the provisions of EU Law... other national courts in EU member states must do likewise, but are not bound to reach the same legal conclusions,\\" said Paul Henty from the law firm Charles Russell Speechlys. \\"There could also be different factual or economic circumstances in those jurisdictions which lead to a different result. \\"Nonetheless, the Hamburg judgment may be persuasive as an authority and will certainly be a boon to Eyeo in similar AdBlock disputes.\\" Summary:","completion":"A court in Hamburg has ruled that users have the right to use AdBlock Plus, stating that it was not anti-competitive, in a case involving Germany's Die Zeit and Handelsblatt, who claimed that the product threatened their ability to make money."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns. Bob's was located in a hilly area, with more precipitation and full of bike trails, so he had more people coming in, while Rob's was in the valley, near the parks. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds? Hint: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22] Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23] A:","completion":"A: Bob's town had more cyclists riding downhill at high speeds.

The Banality of Robbing the Jews PARIS â The recent discovery of more than 1,400 prized paintings in the Munich residence of Cornelius Gurlitt, an art collector whose father collaborated with the Nazis, has brought the pillage of the Jews back into the limelight. Yet the bulk of anti-Semitic looting during World War II was at once much more banal and more widespread. In Paris, the plunder of Jewish possessions began with the arrival of German troops in June 1940. At first, it applied only to art collections. But as soon as the Final Solution was devised in January 1942, the confiscations spread to the entire Jewish population, most of which comprised poor immigrants from Eastern Europe. Stripping Jews of their belongings was part and parcel of the effort to destroy them; pillage was an essential tool of extermination. But what would be done with these items? Could they be reused, or were they too Jewish for that? Were the dishes and the blankets that had been touched by Jews fit for use by Aryans? In Berlin in February 1942, Hitler himself ordered Alfred Rosenberg, who had been overseeing the looting of artworks throughout Western Europe, to entirely empty the apartments of Jews who had been deported or arrested, or had fled. The spoils would then be sent back to the Reich. This widespread plunder, known as MÃ¶bel Aktion, occurred in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. From 1942 to 1944, at least 70,000 dwellings were emptied; in Paris 38,000 apartments were stripped bare by French moving companies at the request of the German authorities. It took 674 trains to transport the loot to Germany. Some 2,700 train cars supplied Hamburg alone. Everything was taken: toys, dishes, family photos, tools, light bulbs. The goods were placed in crates and taken to warehouses and sorting centers specifically established for this purpose in the heart of Paris. Pianos were stored in the cellars of the Palais de Tokyo in the 16th arrondissement. Porcelains and fabrics went nearby, to Rue de Bassano. Books and musical scores were gathered at 104 Rue de Richelieu, furniture at the Quai de la Gare. The plunder of the Jews spread far beyond the famous Jeu de Paume and Louvre museums, the main gathering sites for looted art. With German soldiers busy fighting on the Eastern Front, the Nazis in Paris were short-staffed for the sorting and crating required for MÃ¶bel Aktion. So they turned three warehouses into work camps. And they resorted to Jewish prisoners from the Drancy internment camp, a vast cluster of lodgings under construction just outside the city, and an antechamber to Auschwitz. From 1943 to 1944, nearly 800 Jewish men and women worked â ate, slept, lived â among these objects. Some saw their own possessions or those of family members pass before their eyes, and at that moment understood that they, too, had been slated for internment or deportation. The contents of each apartment were divided into two groups. Damaged objects or personal ones, like papers or family photos, were burned almost daily in a bonfire at the Quai de la Gare. The other items were sorted and classified by category, rather than source. A saucepan taken from one family would be added to a stack of other saucepans rather than kept in the original set. Stripped of their provenance, items lost their identity. Belongings became goods. The supervisors of MÃ¶bel Aktion set aside the most appealing items â porcelain, fine linens, fur coats â for themselves and their friends. Former prisoners from the sorting work camps later described regular inspections by German soldiers; they would come to shop âjust like at the Galeries Lafayette,â the Parisian department store. Detainees who had been tailors, cobblers or leather workers before their arrest were forced to make luxury clothes for the Nazi dignitaries and their wives. Shipments of spoons, dishes, clothes and other items were regularly sent on to Germany. They were distributed to German civilians as compensation for losses caused by the Allied bombings or to support their immigration eastward, where they were sent to populate newly conquered territories. But the systematic looting and redistribution of everyday goods of little value and often in poor condition suggest a motivation that goes well beyond economic calculation in a time of hardship. Indeed, several Nazi services, including those of Hermann GÃ¶ring, regularly questioned the financial rationale of MÃ¶bel Aktion. If the project endured nonetheless itâs because one of its fundamental objectives was to destroy all trace of the Jewsâ very existence. Since the end of the war, the French and German governments have offered some indemnities, though often partial, to the small number of looted owners or their descendants who have asked for compensation. The goods themselves could not be retrieved. Unlike stolen works of art â some of which were preserved and continue to resurface â the colossal spoils of that other, mundane looting have vanished. Either they have been destroyed, or they remain with German families, who to this day probably have no idea where they came from. Sarah Gensburger is a social scientist at Franceâs National Center for Scientific Research and the author of âImages of Plunder: An Album of the Looting of Jews in Paris.â This article was translated by Edward Gauvin from the French. What was this article about?","completion":"The article discusses the widespread and systematic looting of Jewish possessions during World War II, explaining how it was not only a theft of valuables, but also a method of eradicating the existence of Jews. Key points being raised are the scope it took - how it moved from targeting artwork to encompassing every Jewish possession - and the purpose it served in the Nazi Final Solution. German troops began the confiscation operation, known as Möbel Aktion, at the arrival of Paris in June 1940. Initially, they focused on art collections but, with Hitler's order in 1942, they began to confiscate every belonging from the deported or arrested Jews. This operation was implemented not only in France, but also in Belgium and the Netherlands. Between 1942 and 1944, at least 70,000 dwellings were stripped, with 38,000 being in Paris alone. The stolen belongings were transported to Germany using more than 674 trains, showcasing the vast scale of this operation. Everything from toys and dishes to family photos and light bulbs was taken, with these possessions going to warehouses and sorting centers in Paris. Because the Nazis in Paris were short-staffed, they turned three warehouses into work camps and used Jewish prisoners to sort and crate the stolen goods. From 1943 to 1944, nearly 800 Jewish men and women worked in these camps, often encountering their own stolen possessions. The article explains how these stolen items were categorized not by source but by type, causing the belongings to lose their identity and become mere goods. German soldiers and their acquaintances took the most appealing items for themselves, turning these locations into shops for their own pleasure. Items were then shipped to Germany to be distributed among German civilians, presenting the looted belongings as compensation for losses or immigration support. Interestingly, despite the questionable financial rationale behind the Möbel Aktion, it continued. This was due to its overarching goal - exterminating Jews by erasing all traces of their existence. Despite some attempts at offering indemnities for the looting, the goods themselves have been impossible to retrieve. Unlike stolen works of art that continue to resurface, these ransacked everyday items are either destroyed or remain with German families unaware of their provenance. Thus, the article illustrates the dual purpose of Möbel Aktion: not only dispossessing Jews materially but also culturally erasing Jewish existence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The official purchasing managers' index (PMI) fell below forecasts to 49.6 in November, down from the previous month's reading of 49.8. A reading below the 50-mark indicates contraction in the sector, while one above suggests growth. China's factories have struggled to gain momentum in a slowing economy. The Asian giant is headed for its slowest growth in a quarter of a century this year and economists are concerned that it will miss Beijing's official growth target of 7%. Activity in its vast manufacturing sector shrank for the fourth consecutive month in November and hit a three-year low. The government is trying to move China from an export-driven economy to a consumption-based one. China's manufacturing sector is a key gauge of how the economy is doing. It was the driving force of economic growth for decades and helped China become the workshop of the world. As Chinese factories pumped millions of cheap goods out at a record pace, income levels on the mainland rose for workers, creating a brand new middle class. But now demand for Chinese goods is drying up - both inside and outside of China, which has led to these weaker figures. Beijing has been under pressure to boost slowing economic growth in the country especially in the crucial manufacturing sector. And so over the last few months the government has released a raft of stimulus measures to boost growth - including cutting interest rates six times and fast-tracking investment approvals for new building projects and factory plants. But so far these measures don't appear to have worked. Activity in the country's services sector did pick up last month which helped offset the decline in manufacturing. The services PMI rose to 53.6 from 53.1 in October. Bernard Aw, market strategist at trading firm IG, said the improvement in the services PMI had reinforced the view that the sector is \\"cushioning\\" growth. Easing measures by the government may also be supporting growth, according to Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at research firm Capital Economics. \\"There are some hints that accelerating credit growth and fiscal spending, on the back of recent policy easing, may have continued to support investment growth last month,\\" he said in a note on Tuesday. China's central bank has cut interest rates six times since last November, among a series of other measures to stimulate the economy. The Caixin/Markit manufacturing PMI contracted for the ninth month in a row in November, but factory activity shrank at a slower pace than the pervious month. The private PMI survey, which focuses more on small to medium-size businesses, was up to 48.6 in November, from 48.3 in October. In reaction to the manufacturing data, the Shanghai Composite index was down 0.2% to 3,438.32 points - bucking the higher trend in the rest of Asia.

Milady brings the Cardinal information regarding the notorious affair between the queen of France and the English Duke of Buckingham. Outside their window, the queen's seamstress, Constance Bonacieux, stands watching the conversation between the two characters, when she is attacked by Rochefort, one of the Cardinal's loyal men. She is rescued by the young musketeer d'Artagnan and taken away to his abode, where Constance briefly explains her troubles and asks for d'Artagnan's help. Cardinal Richelieu, wanting to convince King Louis XIII that his wife, the queen, is unfaithful to him and in love with the Duke of Buckingham, suggests that he should ask his wife to wear the diamonds he had given her for an upcoming ball. The queen, shocked and dismayed, confesses to Constance that she had sent the diamonds to the Duke of Buckingham, and her confidant goes to d'Artagnan for help. With the help of his companions, three of the finest musketeers in France, Athos, Porthos and Aramis, d'Artagnan makes his way to England to seek the Duke himself, so that he may recover the diamonds and restore the queen's honor. Still, when all problems seem overcome, the English Duke of Buckingham plans to invade France, remove King Louis XIII and marry the queen; on the other hand, Cardinal Richelieu and Milady want revenge on d'Artagnan and Buckingham.

Question: Which of the following people has a book of the Bible named after them: Mary, Luke or Jesus? Context: Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius). The answer is:","completion":"Luke. The context mentions the \\"circumcision (Luke 2:22)\\" which is a reference to the Gospel of Luke in the Bible.

However he has left behind a flute that only has six holes. The King throws it into the fireplace in his room, which starts to emit green smoke.

That night a man named Matthew McCreep learns from the merchant that the same flute he had been looking for is at the castle. He heads over to the castle and steals the flute from Peewit. The king sends Peewit and the young knight Johan out to catch McCreep who uses the flute to rob people of their money. However McCreep uses the flute to stop them. Johan and Peewit then go to the house of Homnibus the wizard. Using a spell called Hypnokenesis, the wizard sends Johan and Peewit to Smurfland where the magic flute was built. Upon arriving they meet a smurf who leads them to the village. Papa Smurf greets the two of them and tells them that they'll make a new flute in order to counter McCreep's flute. The smurfs head into the forest and chop down a huge tree to get wood from the tree trunk's very centre as only this kind of wood can be useful in crafting a magical flute.

He was an immensely influential philosopher, theologian, and jurist in the tradition of scholasticism, within which he is also known as the Doctor Angelicus and the Doctor Communis. The name \\"Aquinas\\" identifies his ancestral origins in the county of Aquino in present-day Lazio. - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC). - Scholasticism is a method of critical thought which dominated teaching by the academics (\\"scholastics,\\" or \\"schoolmen\\") of medieval universities in Europe from about 1100 to 1700, and a program of employing that method in articulating and defending dogma in an increasingly pluralistic context. It originated as an outgrowth of and a departure from Christian monastic schools at the earliest European universities. The first institutions in the West to be considered universities were established in Italy, France, Spain, and England in the late 11th and the 12th centuries for the study of arts, law, medicine, and theology, such as Schola Medica Salernitana, the University of Bologna, and the University of Paris. It is difficult to define the date at which they became true universities, although the lists of studia generalia for higher education in Europe are a useful guide, held by the Catholic Church and its various religious orders. - Adam Pulchrae Mulieris , also called Adam de Puteorumvilla , was a Paris master who studied under Peter of Lamballe , who flourished in the first half of the 13th century . Little is known of his life . He has been described as one of the \`\` metaphysicians of light '' ( Robert Grosseteste was another ) . He was a contemporary of William of Auvergne , Bishop of Paris , and his works are cited by Richard de Fournival , Gerard of Abbeville and Thomas Aquinas . The origin of his name is unknown . The only book seriously attributed to him is Memoriale Rerum Difficilium , also known as De Intelligentiis . This was originally attributed to Witelo . It was published as Adam 's in 1908 but in the 1930s the question of this attribution was re-opened . - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Canonization is the act by which the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion declare that a person who has died was a saint, upon which declaration the person is included in the canon, or list, of recognized saints. Originally, people were recognized as saints without any formal process. Later, different processes, such as those used today in the Eastern Orthodox Church and Roman Catholic Church, were developed. - Robert Grosseteste ( 9 October 1253) was an English statesman, scholastic philosopher, theologian, scientist and Bishop of Lincoln. He was born of humble parents at Stradbroke in Suffolk. Upon his death, he was almost universally revered as a saint in England, but attempts to procure a formal canonization failed. A. C. Crombie calls him \\"the real founder of the tradition of scientific thought in medieval Oxford, and in some ways, of the modern English intellectual tradition\\". - Mendicant orders refers primarily to certain Christian religious orders that have adopted a lifestyle of poverty, travelling, and living in urban areas for purposes of preaching, evangelization, and ministry, especially to the poor. At their foundation these orders rejected the previously established monastic model of living in one stable, isolated community where members worked at a trade and owned property in common, including land, buildings and other wealth. By contrast, the mendicants avoided owning property, did not work at a trade, and embraced a poor, often itinerant lifestyle. They depended for their survival on the goodwill of the people to whom they preached. - Gerard of Abbeville (1220-1272) was a theologian from the University of Paris. He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the mendicant orders, particularly in the second stage of the conflict, taking part in a concerted attack that temporarily affected their privileges. - The Bishop of Lincoln is the ordinary of the Church of England Diocese of Lincoln in the Province of Canterbury. - The University of Paris, metonymically known as the Sorbonne (its historical house), was a university in Paris, France. Appearing around 1150 as a corporation associated with the Notre Dame de Paris cathedral school, it was the second-oldest modern university in Europe. Chartered in 1200 by King Philip II (Philippe-Auguste) of France and recognised in 1215 by Pope Innocent III, it was often nicknamed after its theology collegiate institution, College of Sorbonne, founded about 1257 by Robert de Sorbon. - Doctor of the Church (Latin \\"doctor\\" \\"teacher\\") is a title given by the Catholic Church to saints whom they recognize as having been of particular importance, particularly regarding their contribution to theology or doctrine. - Richard de Fournival or Richart de Fornival (1201 ?1260) was a medieval philosopher and trouvère perhaps best known for the \\"Bestiaire d'amour\\" (\\"The Bestiary of Love\\"). - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire. With a population of 159,994 it is the 52nd largest city in the United Kingdom, and one of the fastest growing and most ethnically diverse. The city is situated from London, from Bristol, from both Southampton and Birmingham and from Reading. - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites. 'adam pulchrae mulieris' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'occupation'?

Passage: As the 1990s dawned, gamers predicted that competition from technologically superior systems such as the 16-bit Sega Mega Drive/Genesis would mean the immediate end of the NES’s dominance. Instead, during the first year of Nintendo's successor console the Super Famicom (named Super Nintendo Entertainment System outside Japan), the Famicom remained the second highest-selling video game console in Japan, outselling the newer and more powerful NEC PC Engine and Sega Mega Drive by a wide margin. The console remained popular in Japan and North America until late 1993, when the demand for new NES software abruptly plummeted. The final Famicom game released in Japan is Takahashi Meijin no Bōken Jima IV (Adventure Island IV), while in North America, Wario's Woods is the final licensed game. In the wake of ever decreasing sales and the lack of new software titles, Nintendo of America officially discontinued the NES by 1995. However, Nintendo kept producing new Famicom units in Japan until September 25, 2003, and continued to repair Famicom consoles until October 31, 2007, attributing the discontinuation of support to insufficient supplies of parts.

If the parents care about their children whether they made many friends,what matters is that the child is comfortable and happy with his friends. Parents need to understand the steps children take in building friendships. First of all, be a friend to your child. Good friendships start at home. Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\\" For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones.

With no family to turn to, she debates her future, wanting to break free from her controlling husband. She crosses paths with Wally and Mildred, an eccentric yet empathetic couple who can understand her struggles. The trio embarks on a rollercoaster journey of emotion, conspiracy, and self-discovery to help Veda escape her marriage and regain control of her life. Act 1: Veda Wharton, a talented artist, marries Jacob Carter, a wealthy and possessive businessman. Her dreams are shattered when she realizes how emotionally abusive and manipulative her husband is. Desperate for support and a way out, Veda's path crosses with Wally and Mildred, an older couple who own a quaint antique store in town. Wally, a retired detective, and Mildred, a wise and warm-hearted woman, recognize Veda's suffering and agree to help her escape her marriage. Act 2: Wally and Mildred devise a detailed plan to help Veda collect evidence of Jacob's abusive behavior, ensuring she receives legal protection and a fair divorce settlement. Veda begins discretely documenting the abuse with photographs, voice recordings, and written accounts of her day-to-day experiences. Meanwhile, Wally uses his connections to find others who have been wronged by Jacob and wishes to testify against him. As the trio works together, Veda forges a life-changing bond with Wally and Mildred. They impart wisdom, open her eyes to her true worth, and become the parental figures Veda never had. Veda's artistic talent flourishes in their presence, and she uses her art to express her emotions and cope with her fear. Act 3: Mildred suggests that they inform the authorities and let the legal system handle the situation. Wally hesitates, fearing something might go wrong, but ultimately agrees that it is the safest route. Unexpectedly, Jacob discovers Veda's stash of evidence and confronts her with the intention of punishing her. However, in this climactic scene, Veda's newfound strength and the support of Wally and Mildred finally enable her to stand up to Jacob. Filled with courage, Veda calls the police and have her husband arrested. Her myriad of evidence reveals not only the abuse she suffered but also a series of financial crimes committed by her husband. Epilogue: After a lengthy, intense trial, Jacob is both convicted for his financial crimes and forced to comply with Veda's conditions for a divorce. Veda has successfully escaped her marriage and regained control of her life. The friendship and bond formed with Wally and Mildred grow even stronger. In the end, Veda, no longer suppressed under the weight of her abusive marriage, stands tall with Wally and Mildred by her side. The film closes as she opens her own art gallery and begins a new, fulfilling chapter of her life, unafraid and unhindered by her past. The Agreement is a poignant tale of perseverance, the power of friendship, and the courage of a woman discovering her inner worth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Our shop was on the fourth story of the building, so we had to install an elevator. The story of exposure to lead.","completion":"No, the word \\"story\\" has two distinct meanings in each of these sentences. 1. In the first sentence, \\"Our shop was on the fourth story of the building, so we had to install an elevator,\\" the word \\"story\\" refers to a level or floor in a building. In this context, a \\"story\\" is a horizontal division of a building, consisting of a single floor that runs the entire length and width of the structure. Here, \\"story\\" denotes the vertical position of a distinct area within a building. The sentence basically means that the shop was located on the fourth floor, so an elevator had to be installed to provide easy access to this floor. 2. In the second sentence, \\"The story of exposure to lead,\\" the word \\"story\\" signifies a narrative or an account of events – a tale of occurrences. Here, \\"story\\" is used to describe the history, background, or sequence of events that are connected to the exposure of people, animals, or objects to the harmful effects of lead. This could be a detailed account of an incident caused by lead exposure, or it could be the summary of a series of experiences and facts related to how individuals or communities were affected by such exposure. In summary, the word \\"story\\" is not used in the same way in the two sentences provided. In the first sentence, it denotes the position of a specific floor in a building, while in the second sentence, it represents a narrative or account of events connected to a certain subject.

The action involves breaking up, turning over, or removing materials (most likely salt and surrounding rock) to gain access to the salt. 2. \\"Dig out a channel\\" - In this context, \\"dig\\" is used to describe the action of making a channel.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence 1: Reich appears to have fabricated much of this episode for dramatic effect. Sentence 2: Surprisingly, Reich didn't have to fabricate the episode to achieve that dramatic effect. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","completion":"The truth value of the second sentence depends on the context and the interpretation of the content. Let's analyze both sentences in-depth to develop a better understanding. Sentence 1 claims that Reich \\"fabricated much of this episode for dramatic effect.\\" In other words, it suggests that Reich altered or exaggerated the details of the story for the sake of making it more interesting or engaging. Sentence 2, on the other hand, asserts that \\"Reich didn't have to fabricate the episode to achieve that dramatic effect.\\" This statement implies that the inherent drama of the episode was sufficient without the need for any narrative embellishment or distortion. If the first sentence is true, the conclusions we can draw are: 1. Reich did, in fact, fabricate much of the episode. 2. The primary motivation for doing so was to create a dramatic effect. Now, let's consider the implications of these conclusions in the context of the second sentence. 1. The fact that \\"Reich didn't have to fabricate the episode\\" contradicts the idea that Reich fabricated much of the episode. While the objective fact of whether or not Reich fabricated the episode may be clear, the necessity or lack thereof for doing so remains subjective. 2. From the perspective of necessity, if the first sentence is true, then one might argue that the second sentence is false. This would be based on the assumption that Reich's fabrications were, in fact, required for achieving the intended dramatic effect. However, it's essential to acknowledge that there may be more nuance to the matter. For example, it's possible that both sentences could be seen as true if we consider the idea that Reich might have fabricated the episode unnecessarily—that is, the original events were already dramatic enough but Reich still chose to exaggerate or alter them. Ultimately, in the absence of additional context or information, it is difficult to determine the truth value of the second sentence with certainty. We can only conclude that if the first sentence is true, the relationship between the two sentences warrants further examination and depends on the subjective interpretation of the facts and intentions behind the fabrication."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the key elements of the sentence: - \\"watts\\" refers to an actress (or character) in the movie. - \\"lend credibility\\" implies that her role adds authenticity to the movie. - \\"strange scenario\\" suggests an unusual or unexpected plot. - \\"her presence succeeds\\" indicates that Watts effectively contributes to the movie. - \\"making us believe\\" denotes that the audience is convinced by the story and performance. 2. Determine the overall sentiment of each key element: - \\"strange scenario\\" has a slightly negative connotation because anything deemed strange might be perceived as confusing or out of place. - \\"lend credibility,\\" \\"her presence succeeds,\\" and \\"making us believe\\" have positive connotations as they all praise Watts' performance and its impact on the audience. 3. Weigh the sentiment of each key element to determine the overall sentiment of the sentence: - The mildly negative sentiment of \\"strange scenario\\" is offset by the overall positive sentiment expressed towards Watts and the effectiveness of her role in the movie. 4. Finalize the overall sentiment: - The overall sentiment of the movie review sentence is positive because it praises Watts for her performance and her ability to make the audience believe in the story despite the strange scenario.

(CNN) -- As we learned in past battles with polio and AIDS, the key to solving a massive health crisis is to move public sentiment away from fear and stigmatization toward action and acceptance. That is why a recent ad campaign about Ebola from Medicins Du Monde -- MDM or Doctors of the World -- is so encouraging An international humanitarian and medical organization with a long history of advocating for vulnerable populations, MDM joined in the United States with ad agency Publicis Kaplan Thaler to turn public fear of Ebola on its head by asking people to donate a hazmat suit to workers in Africa. The symbol of the fearful hazmat suit is reintroduced as a crucial piece of the solution: \\"Here it's a costume. There it saves lives.\\" It is possible we can chart a better course in the future on","completion":"global health crises by learning from our experiences with polio, AIDS, and Ebola, and by leveraging the power of public sentiment for positive change. The success of MDM's ad campaign highlights the importance of reframing the narrative around such crises, transforming fearful symbols into powerful tools of action and solidarity. One potential strategy to achieve this involves collaborating with local and international organizations, like MDM, to create targeted and effective public awareness campaigns. These campaigns should be tailored to resonate with diverse communities and cultures, ensuring that they address specific fears and misconceptions while emphasizing the need for collective action. Moreover, investing in research and development of innovative medical solutions, such as vaccines and therapeutics, should remain a priority. This could combat the spread of infectious diseases and provide long-term support for affected regions. It is crucial, however, to also address societal and infrastructural vulnerabilities that contribute to the persistence of these health crises. Another key aspect in charting a better course is improving communication and coordination among different stakeholders, such as governments, NGOs, and healthcare providers. Building trust through transparent information sharing and collaboration would foster a sense of collective responsibility, rather than stigmatization, towards affected communities. Lastly, education and capacity building initiatives should be implemented to ensure that both individuals and communities are better equipped to handle and prevent future health crises. This includes promoting better hygiene practices, personal protective measures, and empowering community members to become local health advocates. By adopting these steps, we can not only alleviate the suffering caused by current health crises, but also better prepare for and prevent the emergence of future ones. The collective action and acceptance demonstrated during our previous fights against polio, AIDS, and Ebola serve as a powerful reminder that we can overcome even the most daunting challenges when we stand together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Neptune has 14 known moons. Triton is the largest Neptunian moon, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit around Neptune,[e] and it is the only one massive enough to be spheroidal. Triton was discovered by William Lassell just 17 days after the discovery of Neptune itself. Unlike all other large planetary moons in the Solar System, Triton has a retrograde orbit, indicating that it was captured rather than forming in place; it was probably once a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt. It is close enough to Neptune to be locked into a synchronous rotation, and it is slowly spiralling inward because of tidal acceleration. It will eventually be torn apart, in about 3.6 billion years, when it reaches the Roche limit. In 1989, Triton was the coldest object that had yet been measured in the Solar System, with estimated temperatures of 38 K (−235 °C). Now answer this question: What orbit does Triton have around Neptune?","completion":"Triton has a special kind of orbit around Neptune called \\"retrograde orbit\\". It means it goes around Neptune in the opposite direction to how most other moons go around their planets.

Every September 22, governments, green groups and ordinary citizens stress the damage cars are doing to the earth. The day is a reminder that we do not need to rely so much on cars. Those who take part in the activity hope that we all should realize we do not have to accept our car-controlled society. Carlos Pardo from Colombia's Sustainable Urban Transport Project said, \\"World Car Free Day is not only a celebration of fun ways to get around the city, but a demonstration of traffic-free streets and clean air is possible. But we do not want just one day of celebration and then a return to normal life. When people get out of their cars, they should stay out of their cars. It is up to us, our cities and our governments to help create lasting change to benefit walkers, cyclists and other people who do not drive cars. \\" Car-free days were organized as early as during the 1970s, and several car-free days were organized in European cities during the early 1990s. An international car-free day was organized in Europe in 1999. The European Union adopted the idea in 2000. Today, as many as 100 million people in over 1500 cities worldwide celebrate this day. World Car Free Day aims to take a large number of cars off the streets for all or part of a day. This will give people a chance to see what their town might look like with fewer cars. But some people say it is a one-day trick and does not make people give up their cars for the rest of the year. They say what is needed is a move towards a more sustainable city transportation system. Question: What can be inferred from the passage?

One of the most important questions is if you have enough space. You may need to add onto your kitchen. After settling on space, pick out the kitchen features you absolutely have to have. For example, your dream kitchen may feature an island cooktop instead of a traditional stove. Save pictures of kitchens you like. Use them to identify features you want in your ideal kitchen. Decide upon a maximum amount of money you’re willing to invest in the remodel. As you plan your kitchen, do some research to find out how your plans fit your budget. You can do this by searching for furniture estimates online, visiting furniture showrooms, and talking to designers and contractors. Most of the time, remodeling costs more than you’d expect, so you’ll need to alter your plans or budget. The biggest priority is getting the layout and utilities right. Cabinets and countertops are the next part. These will comprise most of your biggest expenses. Don’t forget to add in designer and contractor costs. Take the time to draw out your kitchen. Figure out where you’ll put your refrigerator and other appliances. Add in the counters and cabinets. A complete sketch shows you how much space you have to work with. You may need to opt for smaller appliances, counters, and cabinets in order to maintain enough free space in the kitchen. Keep in mind where your utility lines are going to be. Electrical outlets, plumbing, and gas lines all affect the arrangement. To save money, have the contractor keep them where they are now. Most likely you have an idea of how you want the kitchen to look. Perhaps you want your kitchen to look modern instead of traditional. It could be all wood, or it could incorporate a color theme. Picking a style means focusing on the overall look of the kitchen rather than its parts. For example, a kitchen with a modern style might have a black, gray, or white color scheme with a lot of reflective surfaces and marble walls. The appliances can be metallic and the furniture can look very sleek and minimal. A cottage kitchen could have checkered light blue or yellow patterns, vintage or white appliances, wood floors, and colorful decorations. For a farmhouse kitchen, wood flooring and furniture works well. The color scheme can include red, yellow, blue or white. Stone and brick appliances can also give a rustic look. A French or Mediterranean kitchen looks very ornate. It can feature warm colors with white or yellow walls and wood cabinets. It might have hand-painted wall tiles, a chandelier, copper pots, or ceramic crafts on display. Even if you plan on building the kitchen yourself, speaking to a designer is a good idea. Kitchen designers and architects can help you finalize your remodeling plans while staying within your budget. Construction contractors provide outlines for structural and utility work. You’ll need these plans to apply for building permits. Significant remodels involve a lot of different parts, from electrical wiring to furniture installation. Usually you can get one contractor to do everything you need. Get estimates from at least three companies. Each contractor should talk to you about your design plans and give you an estimate. Use the estimate to figure out if you need to change your plans to stay under budget. Search the contractor’s name online to find reviews from other customers. Consult your local government to figure out what permits you need. For most work, you won’t need a permit. If your remodeling plan includes building or demolishing walls, window openings, or utility lines, you’ll most likely need a permit. Designers, architects, and contractors can take care of this. Summary:","completion":"This article guides readers through the process of planning and budgeting for a kitchen remodel, including assessing space, selecting features and style, consulting with designers and contractors, acquiring permits, and adjusting plans to stay within budget."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The swimmers, Adam Peaty, Francesca Halsall, Christopher Walker-Hebborn, and Jemma Lowe, made history in the Berlin competition, only to have their celebrated success contested. After a long fight for recognition, justice has now been served, and the athletes' exceptional achievements can finally be celebrated anew. Background: The 2014 European Swimming Championships, held in Berlin, witnessed strong performances from these British swimmers. In the competition, they set two world records - one for the 4x100m mixed medley relay (3:44.02) and the other for the 4x50m mixed medley relay (1:37.46). It was an incredible feat for Adam Peaty, Francesca Halsall, Christopher Walker-Hebborn, and Jemma Lowe as they proudly represented Great Britain at the prestigious event. Ruling: The records achieved by this indomitable group of swimmers were initially deemed ineligible due to a technicality. Amid a series of concerns surrounding the eligibility criteria, the swimmers’ appeal gained traction and eventually prevailed. The crux of the matter stemmed from the absence of mandatory independent drug-testing requirements for world-record ratification at the European Championships in 2014. As a result, the initial ruling led to the invalidation of British swimmers' world records. The athletes responded by launching an appeal, arguing that the circumstances surrounding eligibility were beyond their control. They further emphasized that they had always been committed to clean sport and that their achievements should not be tarnished by an administrative issue. The successful appeal indicates the clear determination of these swimmers to defend the integrity of their performances. This landmark decision suggests a shift in how sporting organizations may need to approach eligibility issues and criteria in the future. Recognizing the swimmers' outstanding feats reflects a greater commitment to rewarding hard work and dedication, thus boosting morale within the swimming community. Impact on British Swimming: The favourable decision will inevitably have a significant and positive impact on British swimming in general. It reinforces the prowess and remarkable talent of British swimmers on the international stage. The successful appeal sends a strong message to budding British athletes that their achievements will not go unnoticed, solidifying the notion that commitment to hard work, discipline, and exceptional performance pays off in the long run. Moreover, the verdict serves as a reminder that even the highest echelons of world sport can be vulnerable to administrative issues. It also underscores the importance of having robust systems in place to ensure that drug testing requirements are met, thereby upholding the integrity and fairness in competitive sports. Conclusion: The ruling in favour of the four British swimmers bears testament to the unwavering resilience and determination required in elite sport. Their success in the appeal has secured their rightful place in the annals of swimming history, allowing their incredible achievements at the 2014 European Championships to shine. As the swimming community around the world revels in their triumph, the talented quartet is undoubtedly an inspiration to countless aspiring athletes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the alcoholic beverage similar to cider which is made from fermented pears?","completion":"The alcoholic beverage similar to cider that is made from fermented pears is known as perry. Perry, sometimes also referred to as pear cider, has been common in England for centuries, particularly in the Three Counties (Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire) and the Welsh Marches. Like its apple-based counterpart, perry is made through the fermentation of pear juice, the quality and flavor profile of which can be significantly affected by factors including the variety of pears used, the quality of the harvest, and even regional characteristics of the area in which the pears were grown - a concept similar to the \\"terroir\\" seen in wine-making. The process of brewing perry begins with the collection of pears, which are harvested during fall. The harvested pears are left to mature and sweeten for several days or even few weeks. The matured pears are then crushed and pressed to extract their juice. This juice, known as must, is left to ferment over the course of several weeks or months, using naturally occurring yeasts or those added by the brewer. Throughout this fermentation period, the sugars in the pear juice are converted into alcohol by the yeast. Once the fermentation process is complete, the perry is often filtered to remove remaining sediment, then it is left to mature – a period that can last from several months to several years depending on the brewer's preference. The resulting beverage is generally clearer and lighter in body than traditional apple cider, with a flavor that can range from very sweet to dry, with a fresh, fruity pear flavor. Many factors can influence the taste of the final perry product, including the type of pear used. Until recently, perry was traditionally made with specific varieties of pears known as perry pears, which are different from standard table pears. There are many different varieties of perry pears, each imparting their own unique flavor and aroma characteristics to the finished product. Some of these include the Thorn pear, known for its high tannin content that contributes body and the Moorcroft pear, which imparts a sweet flavor. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of perry production, driven by an increase in popularity of craft and artisanal brewing and distillery operations. Today, you can find a wide range of perry products on the market, from mass-produced versions that mimic the light, refreshing qualities of popular ciders, to small-batch artisanal offerings that highlight the nuanced complexities of specific perry pear varieties. Despite these variations, at its core, perry remains a delightful and often under-appreciated cousin of cider, offering its own unique twist on fermented fruit beverages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

By \\"these disciplines,\\" it is assumed that the context refers to related fields of study. As a result, we can deduce that researchers with expertise in those disciplines have critically evaluated the case study method from different viewpoints. They may have examined the design, implementation, data collection, analysis, and ethical considerations related to case studies. However, based on this premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis \\"Researchers in entirely unrelated fields were the ones that critically discussed the case study from all angles\\" holds true or false. The premise does not indicate any information about researchers from entirely unrelated fields or whether they played any role in discussing the case study method. It is not uncommon for researchers in unrelated fields to use case study methodology, as case studies are a versatile research tool and can offer valuable insights into various phenomena across disciplines. These researchers may have also contributed to the discourse around case studies, bringing unique perspectives from their respective fields. Here are a few possible scenarios from which to consider the hypothesis: 1. Unrelated fields' researchers could have critically discussed case studies from all angles, in addition to the researchers within specified disciplines. In this scenario, both groups would have contributed to the development and understanding of the case study. 2. Researchers in unrelated fields may have discussed case studies from some angles, but not necessarily from all angles. They may have evaluated specific aspects or offered unique perspectives that may not be covered within the disciplines involved. 3. Researchers from unrelated fields may have had minimal or no involvement in critically discussing case studies from all angles. In this case, the essential discussions would mostly come from researchers within the specified disciplines. As a result, based solely on the given premise, we cannot conclude whether the hypothesis is true or false. A more extensive examination of the literature across both related and unrelated disciplines would be necessary to determine the role that researchers from unrelated fields have played in critically discussing the case study from all angles."},{"prompt":"Lee couldn't find their skateboard.

Greeting Emily with a heartfelt 'Dear Emily,' she continued her letter by acknowledging the first time they had met. Rachel recalled the interview process and how Emily's insightful questions had piqued her interest in the position. She mentioned how Emily had carefully observed her potential and given her an opportunity that eventually led to her professional growth. Rachel proceeded to elaborate on the ways Emily had consciously promoted an environment of thoughtfulness in the workplace. Be it through weekly check-ins, providing constructive feedback, or being a listening ear to her concerns, Emily's influence had shaped the way Rachel perceived her role and her interactions with her peers. As she dived deeper into the letter, Rachel mentioned specific instances where Emily had not only showcased thoughtfulness but also preferred others who shared the same value. Emily's support of employees who took time to plan and consider alternatives before arriving at an informed decision was one such example. Additionally, Rachel highlighted Emily's encouragement of team members who often engaged in thoughtful gestures, like handwritten thank-you notes or remembering colleagues' birthdays. Rachel then took a moment to express how Emily's preference for thoughtful people had created a positive, collaborative work culture. Employees were continually motivated to perform at their best, reciprocating the same thoughtfulness that had been demonstrated by their leader. The team, as Rachel described, had blossomed into an active community that thrived on empathy and understanding, all fostered by Emily's penchant for thoughtfulness. As she approached the conclusion of her letter, Rachel extended her appreciation for all that Emily had done for her, both professionally and personally. She shared how her own viewpoint had changed since working with Emily and that thoughtfulness had become integral to her life outside the workplace as well. With a final line expressing her sincerest gratitude for being a part an environment that celebrates thoughtfulness, Rachel signed the letter and let the ink dry. Once complete, she carefully folded the letter and placed it within a tasteful envelope, addressing it to Emily with a sense of pride.

Question: Sonar equipment sends waves into deep water and measures the Answer:","completion":"Sonar equipment sends waves into deep water and measures the time it takes for the echoes to return after bouncing off objects or the seafloor. Step 1: Send out sound waves The sonar device sends out sound waves (often called \\"pings\\") into the water. These waves travel through the water until they encounter an object or the seafloor. Step 2: Listen for the echo After the sound wave encounters an object or the seafloor, it bounces back towards the sonar equipment. The equipment listens for these echoes or reflections of the original sound waves. Step 3: Measure the time taken for the echo to return The sonar equipment precisely measures the time it takes for the echo to return from the point it was sent to the point it was received. This is known as the \\"two-way travel time.\\" Step 4: Calculate distance Using the measured two-way travel time and the speed of sound in water (approximately 1,500 meters per second), the distance from the sonar equipment to the object or seafloor can be calculated using the equation: Distance = (Speed of Sound × Time) / 2 Step 5: Create a representation of the underwater environment The data collected from these distance calculations can then be used to create a representation of the underwater environment, such as a depth map or a sonar image, which can be useful for various applications like navigation, scientific research, or detecting underwater objects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This programme summed up perfectly just how obsessed Victoria Beckham has become with whoring herself and her family out to the media in the name of self promotion and 'Brand f*cking Beckham'. A few years ago I used to really like 'Posh and Becks', I still very much admire David's talent, but I have no respect for him anymore. How can you respect someone who has his wife's hand shoved up his backside working him like a puppet. It was clear the hand of Victoria was all over Beckham's premature departure from Manchester United and now the same thing has happened at Real Madrid. I hope Beckham can live with the fact that although he may be earning squillions of pounds - he's sold his soul for the American Buck and will end his days playing for a team who would struggle to gain promotion from Division One in England (no offence America - but at Baseball and Basketball you rule - football you don't!) Anyway - I digress. It's been years since I've seen such an over-the-top, entirely false performance from 'Posh' - this being topped only during her cringe worthy red carpet performances following the Rebecca Loos 'debacle', when instead of throwing all the cr*p at David he deserved, she desperately clung onto his arm trying to save the million pound money-spinner her marriage has become. This whole PR stunt was pathetic. Why can't she just go over there quietly, support her husband through the biggest mistake of his professional career and keep her head down? When did she become so full of self importance that she feels the move to America should be shrouded by this huge fan fare? Incidentally, I saw the David Beckham documentary last night. At least he has retained a sliver of grace and humility. Two things his wife could do with learning. One more thing Victoria - you complain about constantly being hounded by the paps. Little hint - stop tipping them off about your whereabouts you stupid woman. Good Luck America!!","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses strong disapproval and resentment towards Victoria Beckham and her influence on her husband, David Beckham. There is a sense of frustration and disdain towards the couple's constant presence in the media, their self-promotion, and the perceived manipulation of their careers and personal lives for fame and financial gain. The reviewer also criticizes Victoria Beckham's lack of humility and questions her motives, implying that she is self-absorbed and calculating in controlling both her own and her husband's public image. They express relief that she will be far away from them due to relocating to another continent. However, there is a slight positive note regarding David Beckham within this review, as the writer still admires his talent and mentions that he has maintained some grace and humility in comparison to his wife.

Q:Given the below context: Johnny Clay is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay. He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop, a betting window teller to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender. George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by a security guard. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George emerges as the only man standing. He goes home and shoots Sherry before collapsing. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong.

How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a 24 hour period? Step 1: Identify the similarities and differences Both questions are asking about the overlapping of hour and minute hands on a clock. The first question refers to \\"a day,\\" while the second question specifies a \\"24 hour period.\\" Step 2: Determine if \\"a day\\" and \\"24 hour period\\" are equivalent A day is typically understood to be a 24 hour period. Therefore, the time frames being referred to in both questions are the same. Step 3: Analyze if the questions are asking for the same information Both questions are asking for the number of times the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap. Thus, they are asking for the same information. Conclusion: Yes, these two questions are asking the same thing. Now let's answer the question: How many times do the hour and minute hands of a clock overlap in a 24 hour period? Step 1: Analyze the clock A regular clock has 12 hours, and the hour and minute hands overlap once every hour, except for one instance where the 12-hour cycle resets. Step 2: Calculate the overlaps in a 12-hour cycle Since there are 12 hours on a clock, the hands overlap 11 times during a 12-hour cycle (missing the instance where the cycle resets). Step 3: Calculate the overlaps in a 24-hour cycle Since there are two 12-hour cycles in a 24-hour period, the total overlaps will be 2 * 11 = 22.

The ruling led to boycotts of the state by some sports teams, businesses, and entertainers. The full case challenging the bill is expected to go to trial in November. US District Court Judge Thomas Schroeder said three plaintiffs challenging the measure had a strong chance of proving that the state's toilet-access measure violated federal law, and temporarily blocked the university from applying the state law. \\"The individual transgender plaintiffs have clearly shown that they will suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,\\" he wrote, noting their assertions that single-occupant toilets were generally unavailable at the University of North Carolina.

But the fight is not over: we won't rest until this discriminatory law is defeated,'' Mr Carcano said.

Lawmakers in several other US states have proposed similar legislation - sometimes referred to as \\"bathroom bills\\".

The goal is to complete the grid such that each row, each column, and each of the nine 3x3 subgrids contain all of the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetitions. Here's a step-by-step process for solving a Sudoku puzzle: Step 1: Observe the given numbers Look at the pre-filled numbers in the grid and try to find rows, columns, or subgrids with a high concentration of given numbers. This will make it easier to determine missing numbers. Step 2: Fill in the obvious numbers Identify the cells where only one possible number can fit due to the constraints of the game. Fill in these numbers as they will help you to find more possibilities in other cells. Step 3: Use the process of elimination For cells with multiple possible numbers, eliminate the numbers that already appear in the same row, column, or subgrid. This might help you identify the correct number for that cell. Step 4: Look for patterns In some cases, the same set of numbers appears in multiple rows, columns, or subgrids.

What happens when oil is placed in water? Options: +Some oil sinks below the surface. +Oil droplets form in the water. +The oil and water mix together. +The oil floats on top of the water.","completion":"In order to determine what happens when oil is placed in water, I will analyze each option provided and assess the likelihood of each outcome based on the properties of oil and water. Option 1: Some oil sinks below the surface. - Oil is less dense than water, which generally means it will not sink below the water's surface. Thus, this option is unlikely. Option 2: Oil droplets form in the water. - While oil droplets can form if vigorously mixed with water (e.g., through the process of emulsification), oil and water do not naturally mix due to their differing polarities. Water is a polar molecule, whereas oil is non-polar. If the oil is simply placed in water without any external force, they will not naturally form droplets. Therefore, this option is also unlikely. Option 3: The oil and water mix together. - As mentioned earlier, oil and water do not naturally mix due to their differing polarities. Without external forces, such as emulsification, they will not blend together. Consequently, this option is improbable. Option 4: The oil floats on top of the water. - This option is the most likely outcome. When oil is placed in water, it will float on the surface due to its lower density in comparison to water. The difference in density, along with the differing polarities of the two substances, prevents the oil from mixing with the water, causing it to form a layer on the water's surface. In conclusion, when oil is placed in water, the most likely outcome is that the oil floats on top of the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize: The data for 2012 shows a marked rise on the 12.7 million cases in 2008. In that time the number of deaths has also increased, from 7.6 million to 8.2 million. The rising burden of cancer is being driven by a rapid shift in lifestyles in the developing world to more closely reflect industrialised countries. Rising rates of smoking and obesity as well as people living longer are contributing to the rise. Lung cancer, which is mainly caused by smoking, was the most common cancer globally, with 1.8 million cases - about 13% of the total. The WHO also described a \\"sharp rise\\" in cases of breast cancer. Both the incidence and mortality have increased since 2008. The disease in now the most common cancer in women in 140 countries. Dr David Forman, from the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer, said: \\"Breast cancer is also a leading cause of cancer death in the less developed countries of the world. \\"This is partly because a shift in lifestyles is causing an increase in incidence, and partly because clinical advances to combat the disease are not reaching women living in these regions.\\" The WHO said there was an \\"urgent need\\" for the advances made in detection, diagnoses and treatment of breast cancer to be implemented in developing nations.

Article: Your brain takes around 20 minutes to register feelings of fullness, suggesting that you need to slow down so that your brain can properly communicate those feelings. If you don't feel full immediately after a meal, wait. The chemicals your brain releases when you eat or drink take time to rise and to communicate that sense of fullness. As the chemicals increase, your hunger dissipates; this is why you should pause for a little bit after eating and before having a second helping. Eating with your hands will mean that you take in more food in one scoop. Studies also show that people who eat with larger utensils eat less than those who eat with smaller utensils. When you feel comfortably satiated after eating, stop and put your utensils and napkin on the plate to signal that you're finished. This is also a signal to yourself that you're done with your meal as well as to those around you. Remember, you don't have to eat all of your meal once you feel satisfied. Eat until you are 80% full. No one should feel stuffed and sick after eating. Often we mistake thirst for hunger which means we eat when it's not necessary. By keeping yourself well hydrated you'll feel hungry less as well as getting a clearer complexion and shinier hair. If you're not sure what you're feeling is actually hunger, try drinking a big glass of water and then wait a few minutes. If you don't feel hungry anymore, it's because your body was actually in need of water, not food. . This is a simple yet very powerful exercise to open your eyes to see whether you are keeping up with your food plan. Often, we tend to overlook the snacking we do between meals and instead really think that our diet is failing us. Most people underestimate their daily intake by about 25 percent. You might also discover useful information about your daily habits and a reality check about how many calories you actually consume. Once you know your habits and patterns better, you can begin to address problem behaviors that are hindering your progress. Keeping a journal also makes you more accountable. Eating in restaurants or at other people's homes can be a real challenge. You want to eat, but you also don't want to eat the wrong things and risk backtracking on your progress. Choose foods that are steamed, grilled, broiled or baked instead of fried. Avoid dishes that are labeled as \\"breaded\\", \\"crispy\\" or \\"battered\\" – these are code words for \\"fried\\". Don't be afraid to ask for modifications. For example, ask to swap out potatoes or bread for a side salad. Request sauce on the side of chicken or other entrée, rather than smothered on top. This will enable you to still eat something delicious but without all of the extra calories. If the restaurant is known for especially large portion sizes, opt to split something with a friend. To avoid overeating when going out, eat a small and healthy snack at home beforehand. Try some carrots and hummus or an apple.This will curb off your hunger and keep your head clear while you make healthy and informed choices from the restaurant's offerings. Pack away food. At the beginning of the meal, ask for a doggie bag, and put what you aren't going to eat in the bag. When ordering salads, always ask for dressings and sauces on the side. Lots of dressings can be very fatty and full of calories. Your seemingly \\"healthy choice\\" can pack as many calories as a burger if it’s swimming in a fatty dressing. Be also wary of other high-calorie additions like bacon bits and cheese. You might overeat one night. You might have a bad day where you indulge in way too much junk food. Just don't despair when you realize you've strayed from your goals. It took you a lifetime to achieve your current weight, and it will take time to achieve your new weight and size goal. To keep up your optimism, reward yourself for meeting smaller goals. For example, buy yourself a small token or treat every time you lose another five times. The prospect of the reward will eventually become its own form of motivation.

Hypothesis: A local banker bids for Bank Antonveneta.","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, it can be concluded that the hypothesis stating \\"A local banker bids for Bank Antonveneta\\" is true. The paragraph discusses a scandal involving the Bank of Italy, which is an institution that plays a vital role in Italian banking mergers. The scandal arose from police wire taps that exposed Fazio, presumably a high-ranking official at the Bank of Italy, and his wife giving advice to a local banker. This advice was specifically regarding the local banker's bid for Bank Antonveneta and it hints at a potential conflict of interest, as Fazio and his wife should have maintained a neutral stance in this situation. Furthermore, the paragraph highlights that the local banker was attempting to acquire Bank Antonveneta, which was also targeted by the Dutch bank, ABN AMRO. This competition between the local banker and ABN AMRO suggests that there was indeed a bidding war for the ownership of Bank Antonveneta. In conclusion, the paragraph provides sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that a local banker was bidding for Bank Antonveneta. The scandal involving Fazio and his wife, as well as the competition with ABN AMRO, indicate that the local banker's bid for Bank Antonveneta was a significant factor in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Who says zombies can't be converted into useful members of the community? Certainly not the makers of \\"Fido,\\" who take us to a never-never-land version of the 1950's where the undead have been turned into butlers and servants for the burgeoning middle class. Timmy Robinson is the all-American boy who becomes emotionally attached to the family's new full-time domestic - a recently resurrected zombie whom Timmy has affectionately dubbed Fido. All of this has been made possible by Zomcom, a big-brother-type organization that has found a way to render the zombies (who were originally brought to \\"life\\" by radiation from outer space) manageable and docile - at least most of the time. This twisted, modern-day spin on the TV series \\"Lassie\\" - it might easily have been entitled \\"A Boy and His Zombie\\" - takes slyly satirical swipes at such pre-'60s concerns as obsessive social conformity (here keeping-up-with-the-Joneses means having more zombie servants than the folks next door), the sterility of suburban life, the corporate control of civic affairs, small town corruption and nuclear family values - all played out in a beautifully designed setting of parti-colored houses and immaculately manicured lawns. The movie doesn't hit the audience over the head with its message nor does it engage in endless hyperbole to generate laughs. Instead, this is a low-keyed, subtle little satire that elicits appreciative chuckles rather than full-bellied guffaws. Much of the humor derives from the incongruity between the placidness of the setting and the cavalier attitude towards death demonstrated by the fine citizens of the community (Life Magazine has been replaced with a periodical entitled Death Magazine). Despite some playfully graphic violence, the movie stays true to the spirit of innocence we generally associate with both the 1950's itself and the cheesy, low-budget horror movies that were so much a part of the pop culture scene of that decade. K'Sun Ray, Carrie-Ann Moss and Dylan Baker are amiable and appealing as the wide-eyed Timmy and his Cleaver-esquire parents (with slightly sinister undertones), while Billy Connolly accomplishes the well nigh impossible task of bringing a great deal of humanity and depth to the role of a resurrected corpse. This is what \\"Lassie\\" might have been had Timmy's best friend been afflicted rabies.","completion":"The sentiment of the given review appears to be positive. The review highlights various aspects of the movie \\"Fido\\" that the reviewer finds appreciable. 1. The reviewer appreciates the unique concept of zombies being turned into butlers and servants in the 1950's setting. 2.

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: What does David Meyer do for a living? Options: A. Something smart B.

This is more than just foreign music, television or film becoming popular with young people, but that popular culture changing their own expectations of life and their desire for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted. For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea. The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc. Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants.

Article: Global Positioning Systems (GPS) are now a part of everyday driving in many counties.These satellite-based systems provide turn-by-turn directions to help people get to where they want to go. But, they can also cause a lot of problems, send you to the wrong place or leave you completely lost. Many times, the driver is to blame. Sometimes a GPS error is responsible. Most often, says Barry Brown, it is a combination of the two. Barry Brown is with the Mobile Life Centre in Stockholm, Sweden. The center studies human-computer interaction, or HCI, especially communications involving wireless devices. He told us about an incident involving a friend who had flown to an airport in the eastern United States. There he borrowed a GPS-equipped car to use during his stay. \\"And they just plugged in an address and then set off to their destination. And, then it wasn't until they were driving for thirty minutes until they realized they actually put in a destination back on the West Coast where they lived. They actually put their home address in. So again, the GPS is kind of 'garbage in garbage out'.\\" Mr. Brown says this is a common human error. But, he says, what makes the problem worse has to do with some of the shortcomings, or failures, of GPS equipment. \\"One problem with a lot of the GPS units is they have a very small screen and they just tell you the next turn.

My first impression was of a huge belly with a little dog around it - at that time the birth was only one week away. I liked Line and placed an order for a male puppy. When the glorious sun illuminated the morning sky, the harmonious laughter of the delightful Line danced with the tunes of the singing birds in the background, eagerly anticipating her days as a nurturing mother to her litter of puppies. Boris, the diligent and ever-charming red knight, couldn't help but embrace his dual role as a brave protector and empathetic companion, always offering his unwavering support to Line, while also displaying unconditional devotion to the canine family they both were enthusiastic to welcome. This whimsical and heartwarming tale of Line and Boris was like an enchanting melody that resonated through the quaint village they called home, and their adventures together were the embodiment of love and companionship, making everyone's hearts flutter with anticipation of the puppies' arrival. The day finally came when the birth of the puppies was imminent, and the townsfolk, captivated by Line's strength and dedication, as well as Boris' unprecedented love, gathered around to celebrate the much-awaited moment. With each little paw that emerged into the world, everyone rejoiced, smiling brightly as the puppies' tiny bodies breathed life into the village that had grown to cherish their very essence. One by one, the puppies took form and joined their parents, each bringing a unique sense of love and joy to the beaming faces that surrounded them. As I stood at the periphery of this heartwarming scene, my heart swelled with happiness and I eagerly anticipated the arrival of the male puppy that I had placed an order for, unknowing of the profound bond we would form in the days, months, and years to come. Unbeknownst to me, his tiny form would weave its way into the very fabric of my life, teaching me important life lessons on love, compassion, friendship, and loyalty that would shape my character as a person. And so, as I observed the birth of the puppies from afar, with Line in all her motherly glory and Boris being the epitome of strength and compassion, I knew that this moment was not just about a lovely, red knight and his burgeoning canine family; it represented the intersection of the past, present, and future, weaving together a tender story of love, camaraderie, and the unbreakable bond that exists between human and canine, promising to fill our lives with joy, laughter, and an everlasting sense of fulfillment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Children are known to be very keen observers and once they are interested in something, it is very likely to stay with them for life. They tend to look at life through the eyes of the person they are close to or want to be like. If their role model is optimistic, there are more chances of them optimistic. The role model becomes their standard of measurement. Because they follow the actions of their role models so closely, children adopt the personality and attitude of their role models. Children learn to like or dislike certain things by _ the personality and attitude of the people they admire. One reason why children keep changing their answers to \\"what would you like to be when you grow up\\" is that they are influenced by individuals in a certain field. Children view the social relationships (family or public) mainly in the light of the importance these relationships hold in the life of their role models. Their expression of their feelings is many times a reflection of their role model's outlook. According to a study, around 56% of teenagers identified with the role models. Out of these, those having personal or direct contact with their role models had higher self-esteem and were better at academics compared to those who didn't. As such, children who have positive role models, have more self-confidence and are more optimistic about their future. They learn to handle themselves well in social settings and positively interact with those around them. Of course, children who have their parents as positive role models have a well-rounded outlook towards life. They find it easier to deal with the highs and lows of life because they have seen their parents do it before. They find a sense of stability and security knowing that they will overcome failures just like their parents before them. Besides, it becomes easier for parents to discipline and guide children. So it is no wonder why children who have parents as their role models have fewer behavioral issues.

Mendes was born in Niteroi, Brazil, the son of a physician. He attended the local conservatory with hopes of becoming a classical pianist.

Article: Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules. Question: We know from the passage that _ Options: A: Social fairness is very important for a society to survive \\" B: there must be a war to end an old society and build a new one C: only the poorest are willing to help the richest in a society D: the poor people in a society are always cheated by those wealthy ones A:","completion":"Social fairness is very important for a society to survive In the article, it mentions that a society is concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics, and time limits which are basic ways to achieve fairness.

A: Answer:","completion":"Scientists use a range of technological devices and methods in order to study the depths of the sea without physically going to the seafloor. 1. Sonar technology: Sonar (Sound Navigation and Ranging) systems use the propagation of sound waves to detect and map objects in water. It can measure depth and create detailed topographical maps of the seafloor. 2. Satellite Remote Sensing: Scientists use satellites to measure sea surface height, which can provide clues about what lies beneath. Changes in sea surface height can indicate the presence of mountains, ridges, and other topographical features on the ocean floor. 3. ROVs and AUVs: Unmanned submarines, known as Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROVs) and Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs), can be controlled from a ship to take video, and photographs, gather physical samples, and collect data on temperature, salinity, and other qualities of seawater. 4. Seismic surveys: By setting off controlled explosions on a ship, and measuring how long the sound waves take to bounce back from the seabed, scientists can gather information about the rock types below the seafloor. 5. Deep-sea Sediment Cores: Scientists can study the core samples of the ocean floor, which are extracted by dropping a coring device to the seafloor. By examining these samples, they can understand the historical geology and biological activity in the ocean. 6. Submersibles: Though not without going to the seafloor, it's worth mentioning that scientists also use manned submersibles such as Alvin to directly observe the deep sea and collect samples. These tools and methodologies allow scientists to gather information about the underwater world, helping them to study and understand the largely unexplored deep-sea environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Having encouraged his pregnant lover, Ann Gill, to rob and leave her mistress, he murders the girl when she meets him. The murder is shown to be particularly brutal: her neck, wrist, and index finger are almost severed. Her trinket box and the goods she had stolen lie on the ground beside her, and the index finger of her partially severed hand points to the words \\"God's Revenge against Murder\\" written on a book that, along with the Book of Common Prayer, has fallen from the box. A woman searching Nero's pockets uncovers pistols, a number of pocket watches—evidence of his having turned to highway robbery (as Tom Idle did in Industry and Idleness), and a letter from Ann Gill which reads: Dear TommyMy mistress has been the best of women to me, and my conscience flies in my face as often as I think of wronging her; yet I am resolved to venture body and soul to do as you would have me, so do not fail to meet me as you said you would, for I will bring along with me all the things I can lay my hands on.

What does Inuit and Eskimo mean ? What kind of thing would answer this question?","completion":"\\"Inuit\\" and \\"Eskimo\\" are terms used to describe different indigenous peoples who inhabit the Arctic regions of Alaska, Northern Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. These terms have unique origins and implications, and their usage and acceptance can vary significantly. \\"Inuit\\" refers specifically to the indigenous peoples of Northern Alaska (Inupiat), Canada (Inuit), and Greenland (Kalaallit). The term is of native origin, and it means \\"the people\\" in the Inuit language, which is also known as Inuktitut. The Inuit people share a common linguistic and cultural heritage, and their language belongs to the Eskimo-Aleut family. Inuit communities throughout these regions have been historically engaged in hunting, fishing, and other subsistence activities, with traditional practices shaped by the challenges of their local environment. \\"Eskimo,\\" on the other hand, is a term with a more complex history. It was originally used by non-native people, and its etymology is uncertain. Some sources claim that it comes from a Native American language and means \\"eaters of raw meat,\\" while others argue that it derives from an Inuit word meaning \\"people wearing snowshoes.\\" Regardless of its origins, \\"Eskimo\\" was widely adopted by early European explorers and settlers to describe the Arctic indigenous peoples, including both the Inuit and the Yupik (found in Alaska and Siberia). Over time, the term \\"Eskimo\\" has become controversial in certain contexts. Some indigenous communities consider the word to be pejorative due to its uncertain origins and potential negative connotations. Additionally, it tends to homogenize a diverse group of Arctic peoples with distinct languages, cultures, and histories. As a result, \\"Inuit\\" has become the preferred term in Canada and Greenland, while \\"Eskimo\\" is still used in Alaska. However, Alaskan Native corporations and organizations have advocated for the usage of specific group names, such as Inupiat and Yupik, to be more culturally respectful. In summary, \\"Inuit\\" refers specifically to the indigenous peoples of Northern Alaska, Canada, and Greenland who share a common linguistic and cultural heritage, whereas \\"Eskimo\\" is a more general term that encompasses both the Inuit and Yupik peoples. The latter term has become controversial in certain contexts due to its uncertain origins and potential negative connotations, so it is now primarily used in Alaska but is falling out of favor in favor of more culturally respectful designations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A plan was quickly crafted at the international business to save their financials because the pick from the following. (i) business was unorganized.; (ii) plan was unorganized.;","completion":"(i) business was unorganized. There was an urgent need for change. The realization that the business was unorganized had reached the management, causing them to scramble for a solution. The once-thriving enterprise had started to slip through the cracks, as inefficient processes, spotty communication, and unplanned decisions wreaked havoc on their once-immaculate reputation. The board of directors convened an emergency meeting to bring forth a resolution to the crisis. The CEO, Annabelle Thompson, was at the helm of the meeting, presenting the alarming statistics and figures that highlighted the severity of the situation. The participants listened with rapt attention and growing concern as they began to absorb the gravity of the problem. After some moments of silence and contemplation, the board members and top executives started to map out a plan to save their financials and turn the business around. Divided into several specific categories, the plan aimed to address various issues, with clear-cut steps and well-defined timelines for each. First and foremost, the team decided to overhaul their communication channels. To solve the widespread miscommunication, they introduced new policies for meetings, emails, and discussions - ensuring that all levels of the company were aligned and informed. Regular update meetings would be held to keep everyone in the loop, with department heads subsequently cascading the information down to their teams. Next, streamlining and optimizing processes took center stage. The executives assessed and analyzed the existing procedures and then devised strategies to make them more efficient. This involved restructuring departments, assigning new roles, eliminating redundancies, and automating repetitive tasks through the latest technological advancements. By doing so, the company could not only save time but also resources, enabling them to allot more budget to future growth and innovation. Employee engagement and training were also deemed essential to make the business more organized. The plan incorporated regular employee feedback sessions and upgraded the training programs offered. These would be tailored to upskill the workforce, address any skill gaps, and ensure each employee was well-equipped to handle their roles effectively. To make the most of their available resources, better inventory management and budget allocation also formed a crucial part of the plan. This initiative would audit current inventory levels, establish reliable supply chain partnerships, and implement cost-saving measures to minimize financial waste. Moreover, the finance team would be tasked with reevaluating the budgets allocated to various departments to determine if the investments were wisely made and generated optimal returns. Lastly, the board emphasized the importance of establishing a robust company culture. Fostering values like transparency, collaboration, and innovation would be crucial in empowering employees to be proactive in resolving issues and taking ownership of their projects. A renewed focus on leadership development would help cultivate a motivated and accountable managerial force that could guide the business through the turbulence and successfully execute the plan. With the comprehensive plan in place, the stage was set for the company's revival. Timelines were assigned, measurements were established, and teams set to work on executing the various aspects of the plan with unwavering determination. Although the road ahead was challenging, the renewed sense of purpose and unity within the company rekindled hope that the business would not only regain its footing but emerge stronger and more organized than ever before. As the months passed, the impact of the plan began to take effect. Employees noticed improvements in efficiency and morale, while the financial reports showed clear signs of recovery. Slowly but surely, the business was being reshaped and rejuvenated, positioning itself to face the future with confidence and assurance, knowing that they overcame challenges and emerged as a more organized and efficient enterprise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1882 a visitor noted, \\"We, who ... have wandered through its forests and parks, have come to regard it as the most enchanting region it has ever been our privilege to visit.\\" This was also the living place of the Rocky Mountain mule deer. Indians hunted there every autumn to gather meat and skins. The forest also had mountain lions, timber wolves and bobcats that kept the deer from multiplying too rapidly. Then, in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt made the Kaibab a national game preserve. Deer hunting was forbidden. Government hunters started killing off the deer's enemies. In 25 years' time, 6,250 mountain lions, wolves and bobcats were killed. Before the program, there were about 4,000 deer in the Kaibab, by 1924, there were about 100,000. The deer ate every leaf and twig they could reach. But there was not nearly enough food. Hunting of deer was permitted again. This caused a slight decrease in the deer herd ,but a far greater loss resulted from starvation and disease. Some 60 percent of the deer herd died in two winters.

While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who said \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental?\\", using the article: Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite..., what would be the answer ?

Unforntuanately, all of them have the same trend. They sound like 4th graders having fun with a computer. This one, as foul as it is, is actually better than most, however.There Are a few songs that aren't bad, Hark The Harold Angels Sing isn't exactly regrooved, but it's nicely mixed. White Christmas has good usage of vocals and beats. The rest however . . . well, Carol of the Bells, for instance, sounds like someone banging pots and pans to the music of a very, VERY slow paced funeral march. It is so bad. There are Dj scribble sounds, a demoic voice that whispers \\"Christmas\\", whoosey moans like a smurf taking a crap. It's horrid. If you don't believe me, listen to the samples, they won't lie to you. The answer to this question is:","completion":"This review would decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. Here is a detailed analysis of the review: 1. The reviewer explicitly mentions not loving the album and seems disappointed with it despite being a fan of the genre. This statement indicates that the product did not meet their expectations and they would not recommend it. 2. The reviewer points out that \\"remixed Christmas\\" CDs generally have a disappointing trend, implying that the product in question is a part of this trend. This indicates that the album may not be unique or innovative in its approach to transforming holiday songs into club anthems. 3. While the reviewer acknowledges that this particular album might be better than most in the genre, they still highlight several issues with the majority of the tracks. For instance, \\"Carol of the Bells\\" is described as a poorly executed song that sounds like pots and pans banging to a slow funeral march. This negative description can deter potential buyers from making a purchasing decision. 4. The reviewer does provide some positive feedback for a few songs, like \\"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\\" and \\"White Christmas,\\" but it does not outweigh their overall dissatisfaction with the album. 5. To support their opinion, the reviewer urges readers to listen to the samples for themselves, which suggests that the flaws in the album are evident and not solely based on the reviewer's personal taste.

Michaels Stores Inc, the biggest U.S. arts and crafts retailer, on Thursday confirmed that there was a security breach at certain systems that process payment cards at its U.S. stores and that of its unit, Aaron Brothers. The company said in January that it was working with federal law enforcement officials to investigate a possible data breach. Michaels Stores said the breach, which took place between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014, may have affected about 2.6 million cards, or about seven per cent of payment cards used at its stores during the period. Security breach: A statement from Michaels management indicates up to three million credit cards may have been compromised. The company said about 400,000 cards were potentially impacted at its Aaron Brothers unit by the breach, which occurred between June 26, 2013 and February 27, 2014. There was no evidence that data such as customers' name or personal identification number were at risk, Michaels Stores said in a statement. This is the second known data breach since 2011 at Michaels Stores. Michaels Stores, whose major investors are Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital LP, said cyber security firms it hired found that malware not encountered previously had been used in the latest attack. The company said it was working with law enforcement authorities, banks and payment processors, and that the malware no longer presents a threat. Michaels Stores, which resubmitted its IPO documents late last month following a restructuring, is the latest U.S. retailer whose systems have been breached. Arts and crafts giant: Michaels has almost 900 stores around the country and in Canada. Last year, the number three U.S. retailer Target Corp suffered a massive security breach that resulted in the theft of some 70 million customer records. Reuters reported in January that smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target. U.S. retailers are planning to form an industry group for collecting and sharing intelligence in a bid to prevent future attacks. Michaels Stores, which owns several private brands such as Recollections, Artist's Loft and Loops & Threads, competes with Hooby Lobby Stores Inc, Jo-Ann Stores Inc and Wal-Mart Stores Inc.

Michaels said this happened between May 8, 2013 and January 27, 2014. They think around 2.6 million cards might have been affected but no names or personal numbers are at risk. This is the second time Michaels has had a security problem since 2011. They found out that a new type of bad software was used in the attack, and they are working with the police and banks to fix the problem. This is important because other big stores, like Target, also had security problems last year and many stores are now working together to make sure this doesn't keep happening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although no people live on the island, archaeological evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life. On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following is true about Henderson Island? a) The island is inhabited by a small human population. b) The island is home to four kinds of special land birds found only there. c) The island was discovered by British Captain Henderson in the 17th century. d) The island was successfully purchased by an American businessman for development.

You must judge whether the order of two coordinated clausal conjoints have been inverted or not. Inversion would result in the sentence sounding unnatural.

A:","completion":"The task is asking you to analyze a sentence that includes a coordinating conjunction, which are \\"for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so\\". You need to decide whether the two clauses that the conjunction connects are in inverted order (the order is switched) or original order (the order is normal). In the given example (\\"Damian tried to stay upright, but the sheer force threw him into the wall\\"), the coordinating conjunction used is \\"but\\". The first clause (\\"Damian tried to stay upright\\") is logically followed by the second clause (\\"the sheer force threw him into the wall\\") because the event in the second clause is the consequence of the what the first clause states. This suggests that the sentence is in original, not inverted, order. To decide the correct order, remember the common sequence of actions or results. If the first clause states an action and the second one its consequence, then it's usually in original order. If the first clause states a consequence and the second one an action that led to it, then it's usually an inversion.

The sun was dipping low in the sky, casting a warm golden light over the dock and the surrounding landscape. It danced across the rippling water, casting playful shadows that moved and shifted as the waves responded to her movements. The air, too, was cool, a gentle breeze whispering through the trees as though trying to engage her in play. Ethan had finally made it into the water, his own entry less graceful than her feet-first dive. As she reached the dock, she couldn't help but let out a laugh as he sputtered and gasped, his face a mix of shock and delight. She pulled herself onto the wooden planks, water streaming off her body as she reached back to pull him up beside her. \\"Don't say I didn't warn you,\\" she teased, reaching out to steady him as he caught his breath. Despite the cool water still clinging to her skin, the warmth from the sun and her exertion had already begun to chase away the chill, leaving her feeling refreshed and alive. Together, they stood on the dock, watching as the sun continued its lazy descent towards the horizon. She smiled softly, feeling a sense of contentment settle over her as she breathed in the scents of the water, the earth, and the forest. In that moment, memories of hundreds of other days filled with laughter and splashes came flooding back. Days where she'd been tossed in or jumped willingly, each time feeling that same intoxicating thrill rush through her. As her thoughts gently meandered, she was pulled back to the present by the soft pressure of Ethan's hand on her shoulder, his fingers warm and steady against her still-damp skin. She looked up to see his eyes filled with an expression she couldn't quite name, but it filled her with warmth, as if the golden light they both bathed in had managed to seep inside her chest. She returned the touch, her hand finding his where it lay against her shoulder, giving it a tender squeeze. Together, they stood silently on the dock, the world before them bathed in the soft light of a dying day. Time seemed to stand still as they basked in the glow, their spirits entwined – a shared moment that would forever be etched in their hearts. They eventually pulled away from one another, their fingers reluctantly separating as the reality of their surroundings began to gently seep back in. With warm smiles and still-waterlogged laughs, they began their journey back to the shore, to a world of responsibilities and worries that would have to be faced. Yet, as they left the water and dock behind, they knew that they would always have this moment – a memory shaped by the sun and the water, forever the imprint of joy and companionship forged in the deepest corners of their souls.

The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist.

Based on the sentence \\"A man bends down in an outdoor area that is also covered while birds walk around him.\\", is the sentence \\"The man is searching for something.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"The sentence \\"A man bends down in an outdoor area that is also covered while birds walk around him.\\" does not explicitly state that the man is searching for something; however, it is possible to infer this interpretation based on the given information. It is important to acknowledge that there might be other possible reasons behind the man bending down and the provided sentence does not give enough context to state with certainty that \\"The man is searching for something.\\" is a true sentence. To better understand the situation, it is helpful to analyze the details given in the initial sentence. First, we know that the scene takes place in an outdoor area, suggesting that the man is interacting with his surrounding environment. Second, the area is covered, which implies that the location might offer some form of shelter or shade. This could be a structure like a gazebo, a park shelter, or a shaded space under trees. Lastly, we know that birds are walking around the man, which could indicate that the location is a natural setting or that the man might be in proximity to food sources attracting the birds. Based on these details and the man's action of bending down, it is reasonable to infer that he may be searching for something. Here are several possible scenarios: 1) The man could have dropped an item, and he is bending down to retrieve it. 2) The man might be examining or observing the birds closely by bending down to their level. 3) The man could be engaged in an activity that requires bending down, such as gardening or picking up litter. While the statement \\"The man is searching for something.\\" could be a potential interpretation of the original sentence, it would involve making assumptions that are not clearly supported by the given information.

Media playback is not supported on this device Fly-half Sam Davies conjured a rare - and pivotal - flash of quality to send Josh Matavesi in for the game's only try with a superb reverse pass. Davies converted the score and kicked two penalties to Duncan Weir's three for Edinburgh. The defeat is the Scottish side's fifth in succession and they remain ninth in the league table. It was another foul night at Myreside; cold, wet and breezy. The Ospreys and Edinburgh exist in different worlds in the Pro 12, the visitors pursuing the top four and a title while the home side were merely trying to get the win that has eluded them for so long. Edinburgh owned the opening 20 minutes but a lack of imagination, and wet conditions, plus stout resistance meant they led by just three points from Weir's boot. Even that tiny advantage was eliminated soon after when Davies knocked over a penalty of his own. Twenty minutes had been played and the Ospreys hadn't yet fired a shot. They hadn't even got into Edinburgh's 22. That changed quickly when Ospreys carved Edinburgh open with a rare moment of class in an otherwise poor contest. It was Davies who created it, a little show-and-go then a nicely-timed pass to Matavesi arriving on an unstoppable line. Clinical. Davies added the conversion to make it 10-3. Edinburgh had their chances to turn it around. Chance after chance in fact. They spent an inordinate amount of time in the opposition half as the game went on, but couldn't break through what is the Pro 12's best defence. There was controversy when Edinburgh fired up a close-range, fast-moving maul that the Ospreys collapsed. They were awarded a penalty, but no penalty try. Edinburgh went for touch instead of the posts and then, painfully, knocked on to allow the Ospreys to lift the siege. Amid all of this was the desperately sad sight of Alasdair Dickinson being stretchered off on his comeback after 10 weeks on the sidelines. Scotland head coach Vern Cotter will await the medical report with something approaching dread. Weir made it 10-6 with the boot but it needed to be more given their weight of possession. Davies kicked the visitors back into a seven-point lead but Weir brought it back down to four. Continually, though, Edinburgh mistake followed Edinburgh mistake. Ospreys hung on to go top - and their organisation and thunder in defence was the difference, apart from Davies' gorgeous creativity for the only try. For Edinburgh, a fifth straight loss in what is an increasingly turbulent season. Edinburgh acting head coach Duncan Hodge: \\"It was a tough night to play rugby, and they got one chance and took it. That seven points was a big cushion on a night like this. We had chances; we didn't help ourselves with little mistakes. \\"We had a line-out five metres out that looked like it was going over the line at a rate of knots, and we don't get a break there. It's a tough one to take. \\"The bottom line is, the decision is made by the referee. That's just incredibly tough, on a night like this, you've got an advantage like that. Seven points makes a huge difference to how you play the game, and we just didn't get that break. \\"I don't know (the latest on Alasdair Dickinson's injury). It's terrible for Dicko and he'll be absolutely distraught. You can imagine what he's been through the last nine months, to be back on the field for 45 minutes and get carted off, it's not what anyone wanted to see.\\" Edinburgh: Blair Kinghorn; Damien Hoyland, Glenn Bryce, Chris Dean, Rory Scholes; Duncan Weir, Sam Hidalgo-Clyne; Alasdair Dickinson, Neil Cochrane (capt), Murray McCallum, Grant Gilchrist, Ben Toolis, Magnus Bradbury, Jamie Ritchie, Cornell Du Preez.

Please answer the following question: This article: Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Is \\"In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Why would one use hydrogen mixed with nitrogen?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"In more recent applications, hydrogen is used pure or mixed with nitrogen (sometimes called forming gas) as a tracer gas for minute leak detection.\\" provides a relevant answer to the question \\"Why would one use hydrogen mixed with nitrogen?\\". However, if you are looking for a more detailed and longer answer, consider the following: Hydrogen and nitrogen, when mixed together, form a gas called forming gas. This combination serves several purposes: 1. Leak detection: As mentioned in the original statement, the primary application of forming gas is to serve as a tracer gas for detecting minute leaks in a wide range of industrial systems, such as pipelines, tanks, and storage vessels. Hydrogen, being the smallest and lightest molecule, has an exceptional ability to penetrate even the tiniest of leaks, making it an ideal tracer element. In addition, hydrogen can easily be detected using specialized equipment, such as hydrogen leak detectors. 2. Safety concerns: Pure hydrogen gas can be flammable and explosive when mixed with air at concentrations between 4% and 75%. Mixing it with an inert gas like nitrogen reduces the risk of fire and explosion by diluting the hydrogen concentration. Nitrogen makes up the majority of forming gas—generally between 95% and 99%—ensuring that it is non-flammable and significantly safer to use. 3. Cost-effectiveness: Hydrogen is a less expensive tracer gas option compared to alternatives, such as helium. The lower cost of hydrogen makes forming gas a highly cost-effective solution in leak detection, particularly in industries that require large volumes for testing and maintenance. 4. Environmental impact: Hydrogen and nitrogen both occur naturally in the atmosphere and do not contribute significantly to air pollution when released. While other tracer gases may contribute to the greenhouse effect or ozone depletion, the use of forming gas has a relatively low environmental impact. This further adds to its appeal as a preferred tracer gas for many industries. 5. Welding applications: Forming gas is also used in certain welding applications, specifically reducing the oxidation of metal surfaces during the welding process. The combination of hydrogen and nitrogen in forming gas acts as a shielding medium, thereby creating a protective atmosphere around the weld zone that helps mitigate the negative effects of oxidation. In conclusion, using hydrogen mixed with nitrogen addresses multiple concerns, such as safety and cost, while maintaining its primary purpose as an effective tracer gas for minute leak detection. Additionally, the gas mixture boasts a lower environmental impact than some other tracer gases. For these reasons, forming gas has become a popular option across various industries, including applications beyond leak detection, such as some welding processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Disgraced football legend O.J. Simpson is scheduled to return to a Las Vegas courtroom Monday in a bid to get his robbery, assault and kidnapping convictions thrown out. The one-time Heisman Trophy winner and Buffalo Bills halfback is more than four years into a 33-year prison term and is asking for a new trial. In court papers, he's arguing that bad legal advice led to his arrest and conviction in a 2007 confrontation with sports memorabilia dealers. Simpson not only accuses his old lawyer, Yale Galanter, of having a conflict of interest and of failing to mount an effective defense in his trial. He also says Galanter told him before that confrontation that he was within his rights to take back property he believed had been stolen from him, \\"so long as there would be no trespass and no physical force used against the persons with the property.\\" Simpson, 65, was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the Palace Station hotel and casino and using threats, guns and force to take back the items from the two dealers. \\"Simpson also contends that Galanter did not advise Simpson that carrying out the plan could subject him to criminal charges, regardless of the ownership of the property,\\" his new lawyers wrote in seeking a new trial. Simpson also blames Galanter for preventing him from testifying in his own defense. Without putting him on the stand, \\"There was no evidence presented to adequately challenge the state's evidence of criminal intent and knowledge of the guns or the bad character evidence to which the jury was exposed,\\" his appeal states. The Nevada Supreme Court already upheld his conviction in 2010. Prosecutors have called the new attempt to reverse his conviction \\"without merit,\\" and Galanter is quoted in court papers as telling the judge in the original trial that he spoke to Simpson only after the confrontation. \\"Other than Simpson's bare allegations, the record does not support any conflict of interest,\\" prosecutors wrote in response to Simpson's claims. Galanter could not be immediately reached for comment Sunday. Simpson's October 2008 conviction came on the anniversary of his famous acquittal on murder charges in the 1994 deaths of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Goldman. Though cleared of criminal charges, a civil jury later slapped him with a 33 million wrongful-death judgment, and lawyers for the Goldman family have doggedly pursued his assets.

Summarize: The retail billionaire and former BHS owner said he was \\"not prepared to participate\\" with the work and pensions committee hearing, scheduled for Wednesday, unless Mr Field stands down. In a letter, he said the MP was biased and conducting a \\"trial by media\\". Mr Field had told the Financial Times he \\"would laugh\\" if less than £600m was offered to settle BHS's pension debts. Meanwhile shadow chancellor John McDonnell has called for Sir Philip to be stripped of his knighthood if he fails to attend a session on Wednesday to answer MPs' questions. He told the Observer that the move would \\"help restore public faith in the honours system\\". Reacting to news of the letter, which he said he had yet to receive, Mr Field said: \\"The House of Commons decides who chairs these committees, not Sir Philip Green. It's in his interest to turn up.\\" And Business Minister Anna Soubry tweeted: \\"Sir Philip needs to understand Parliament is the boss, get a grip [and] get in front of the committee on Weds.\\" Attempts to find a buyer to rescue the chain of department stores failed earlier this month, and it was announced it would close with the loss of up to 11,000 jobs. Sir Philip, whose Arcadia Group sold BHS for £1 to a former bankrupt in 2015, has been accused of taking money out of BHS while the pension fund sank deep into deficit. He is scheduled to answer MPs' questions about the sale on Wednesday. However, in a strongly worded letter he claimed the outcome of the inquiry was \\"pre-determined\\", and Mr Field had used his position as committee chairman \\"to destroy my reputation\\" ahead of the hearing. \\"I am not prepared to participate in a process which has not even the pretence of fairness and objectivity and which has as its primary objective the destruction of my reputation,\\" he wrote. \\"I therefore require you to resign immediately from this inquiry.\\" 163 stores to close 11,000 jobs at risk, including: 8,000 members of staff and 3,000 non-BHS employees who work in the stores A spokesman for Sir Philip Green's retail group Arcadia later clarified his position saying Sir Philip was waiting to see how Mr Field replies to his letter before deciding whether to attend on Wednesday. He added: \\"This doesn't appear to be a proper process any more. This is mob rule.\\" by Joe Lynam, BBC business reporter Both Frank Field and Sir Philip Green are taking a gamble with this stand-off. Sir Philip must know that Mr Field will never resign at his behest and ordering him to do so won't look great. But Mr Field also knows that publicly disparaging the retail tycoon may give the latter the excuse he needs to not to attend a grilling by MPs. Although the Thatcher Room in Portcullis House is not a court of law, it could be seen as the court of public opinion. If that's the case, then calling for Sir Philip to be stripped of his knighthood before the Arcadia boss even takes his seat next Wednesday, doesn't sound like Frank Field has an open mind. Of course we could have a situation where Sir Philip attends next week but folds his arms in silence every time Frank Field (who is co-chairing this inquiry) asks a question. We shall wait and see. On Friday, the Financial Times quoted Mr Field as saying £600m was needed to cover BHS's pension hole, which affects more than 20,000 people. If Sir Philip's proposal amounted to \\"anything less than that, the committee will just laugh at him\\", he said. \\"The committee may have considered a reasonable settlement in the very early days of our inquiry, but things have changed.\\" Sir Philip has previously said he would appear before the committee on condition that his wife Tina Green, who owns a company which controls Arcadia Group, was not called.

Few would argue that football is the planet's true global game. From Baghdad to Buenos Aires it is watched, played, argued about, loved and hated with an intensity that no other sport can match. Its ubiquity also brings a tremendous amount of power. Dictators and politicians have long tried to harness its ability to inspire unity and national pride for more nefarious political purposes -- be it Argentina's junta who used the 1978 World Cup to inspire the kind of loyalty that its regime had failed to do, to current Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, who feared and respected football's power to spark change in equal measure. \\"[Football] has caused at least one war and many battles, often tragic, off the pitch,\\" wrote Melvyn Bragg, nominating the 1863 Rules of Association Football, the football's first official code, in his \\"Twelve Books That Changed the World.\\" But sometimes a single match has been at the center of huge social and political changes. Ahead of the start of the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, CNN gives you some of the games that changed the world. Secretary's XI versus President's XI (1864) When 22 men gathered in Battersea Park, London, in the winter of 1864 for a game of football, no-one could imagine the worldwide sporting revolution that would follow. This was the first game played according to the Rules of Association Football, written by the embryonic English Football Association and the first attempt to unite and codify football's different, not to mention competing, strands. The forward pass hadn't been introduced yet, there were no such thing as crossbars and the offside rule was still three years away from being introduced, but the British Victorian need for imprimatur and order meant that the simplified, slimmed-down rules -- just 13 laws -- were easily exported. Which the British did with a proselytizing zeal throughout its colonies and the rest of the world. One such football missionary was Charles William Miller, who in the mid-1890s took a copy of the rules and a football to Brazil, from where it caught on like wild fire. \\"A Brazilian taxi driver told me that Charles Miller had invented football. In other words, he's a legendary figure [in Brazil], but no-one is quite sure what the legend actually is,\\" explained Josh Lacey, author of \\"God is Brazilian,\\" a biography of Miller. \\"In Sao Paulo, there is a square named after him. It's the square outside the stadium where Corinthians play.\\" And the match itself? The Secretary's XI won 2-0, with both goals scored by Charles William Alcock, who would himself go on to organize the very first international fixture, between England and Scotland, seven years later. West Germany versus Hungary (1954) Post-war Germany was a haunted, broken and divided place. Although it was devastated financially by the folly of Nazism and the split between east and west by the emergence of the Iron Curtain, Germans were in a soul-searching funk over their role in the Second World War. The singing of the national anthem was actively discouraged and the country's new, unloved flag was rarely seen. And then came the \\"Miracle of Bern\\" at the 1954 World Cup, held in Switzerland. Despite being trounced 8-3 in their first match against Hungary, West Germany made it to the final of the World Cup to face the same opposition. The team was made up solely of amateur footballers, while Hungary -- the best team in the world at the time -- boasted the likes of Ferenc Puskas. No-one gave them a chance, but they won 3-2, sparking scenes of jubilation back in West Germany and the first positive, collective nationalistic outburst since the war. \\"It was a kind of liberation for the Germans from all the things that weighed down upon them after the Second World War,\\" German historian Joachim Fest wrote. \\"July 4, 1954 is in certain aspects the founding day of the German Republic.\\" From there West Germany boomed economically, becoming the leading nation in Europe. As newspaper Der Spiegel pointed out before a united Germany hosted the 2006 World Cup: \\"In one 90-minute match against Hungary, modern-day Germany was born.\\" Rangers versus Bucks (1966) Robben Island is infamous for its most revered prisoner: Nelson Mandela. But the jail, which held what the apartheid South African state viewed to be the most dangerous political prisoners, also gave birth to an unlikely football league. The Makana Football Association was set up by a group of prisoners desperate to break the monotony of prison life. Every week from 1964 onwards a prisoner would ask for permission to play football, and then be punished by the authorities as a result of his temerity. But by 1966 the prison warden relented and a football league was set up based on one of the only books in the prison library: the FIFA rule book. Scores, leagues, disciplinary records and even the results of disciplinary hearings from on-pitch indiscretions were kept, although no record exists of the score between the Rangers and Bucks in the first-ever match. As well as giving the inmates hope during desperate times, the Makana FA had a more important impact: honing the administrative skills of South Africa's future leaders. Jacob Zuma, the current President, was a tough-tackling defender for the Bucks and a future Makana FA referee. \\"It taught them administration ... Robben Island created the new generation of people that struggled for freedom,\\" explains Professor Chuck Korr, author of \\"More Than Just a Game: Football vs. Apartheid.\\" \\"And those men thought football was very important in maintaining their sanity and hope for the future. By definition, football is absolutely essential in the way the struggle for freedom is won.\\" The Makana FA, although long abandoned, was given honorary FIFA membership in 2007. Dinamo Zagreb versus Red Star Belgrade (1990) Yugoslavia was already on the brink of imploding by the time Serbia's Red Star Belgrade played Croatia's Dinamo Zagreb at the latter's Maksimir Stadium. Pro- independence parties had already won recent Croatian elections. But the events that unfolded on March 13, 1990 are regarded by many as the opening salvo of the most vicious European war since the Nazis were defeated in 1945. During the match, future AC Milan and Croatia captain Zvonimir Boban launched a kung-fu kick at a policeman who was attacking a Zagreb fan. Riots broke out between Zagreb's \\"Bad Blue Boys\\" ultra group, and Red Star's \\"Delije\\" -- led by the brutal war-lord Arkan. Arkan's Tiger's, the paramilitary group he ruled during the war, recruited heavily from the Delije. Arkan himself was indicted by the United Nations for war crimes, but was assassinated in 2000 before he stood trial. Later, Boban explained what was going through his head. \\"Here I was, a public face prepared to risk his life, career and everything that fame could have brought, all because of one ideal cause: the Croatian cause.\\" For the rest of the soon-to-be-non-existent country, it was a symbolic moment. \\"It was the most important match in Yugoslav history,\\" explains Dr. Neven Andjelic, author of \\"Bosnia-Herzegovina: The End of a Legacy.\\" \\"It has political implications and is a clear sign of the forthcoming violence and war that this unfinished match provided to the population.\\" The war went on to rage for five years, with the International Center for Transnational Justice estimating that 140,000 people were killed. Its effects are still evident today, not least outside the Maksimir Stadium, where a statue depicting a group of soldiers stands. On it is the inscription: \\"To the fans of the club, who started the war with Serbia at this ground on May 13, 1990.\\" Iraq versus Saudi Arabia (2007) Younis Mahmoud ran the length of the pitch to celebrate with the handful of fans that had made the long journey to the vast, half-empty stand in Jakarta's Bung Karno stadium. The captain of the Iraq national team -- a team of Kurds, Sunni and Shia Muslims -- had just scored the only, decisive goal in the 2007 Asian Cup final on July 29 against Saudi Arabia, but it meant much more than the first piece of major silverware for the \\"Lions of Mesopotamia.\\" Back in Baghdad, tens of thousands of Iraqis poured into the streets, firing celebratory bullets into the air, with many clutching something that had not been seen in numbers since the fall of Saddam: the Iraqi flag. Football had achieved what no politician or general had managed to achieve: a semblance of national unity. According to the U.S. military, there were 1,700 sectarian attacks in Baghdad alone in June 2007. That had almost halved after the final, to 960 by the end of August. But the victory came at a price. Minutes after Iraq had beaten South Korea in a penalty shoot out in the semifinal, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a crowd of cheering fans, killing 50 people. At the Asian Cup, the victorious team sat, stunned, in the dressing room and contemplated pulling out of the final. But then the players watched the carnage on television. \\"One of the victims was a 12-year-old child,\\" recalled Mahmoud to the press afterwards. \\"His mother, when his body was laid in front of her, she didn't weep, but she said: 'I present my son as a sacrifice for the Iraqi national team.' We have to win.\\" They chose to continue, and the rest is history. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Noah researched the climate of Antarctica, while Frank researched the climate changes of Madagascar and the Southern tip of Africa. But I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Claudia Yanira Hernandez Soriano, 25, and Juan Francisco Martinez Rojas, 28, had returned home from a party when an argument escalated to physical violence. The unfortunate event began when the couple attended a party on Sunday night. However, their evening took a dark turn when they returned home. What had begun as a disagreement quickly spiraled out of control. Family members were not only alarmed but also affected by the situation. Juan's mother, Ana Angelina Rojas-Jovel, 45, attempted to intervene when the couple started fighting. Concerned about the safety of her family, she wanted to prevent the altercation from escalating further. However, her efforts to maintain peace didn't yield the desired outcome. In the heat of the moment, Hernandez Soriano allegedly assaulted Rojas-Jovel. The consequences of this attack were severe and unexpected. Rojas-Jovel tragically suffered a cardiac arrest due to the incident. When the local police arrived on the scene, they discovered Rojas-Jovel deceased, finding victim and family in a state of shock and distress. The aftermath of this tragic event not only resulted in the loss of a life but also left a deep emotional impact on the family. Adding to the tragedy was the presence of a seven-year-old girl, who witnessed the entire ordeal. The incident has certainly placed a considerable psychological burden on the young girl, who was present during such a horrific event at her tender age. This unfortunate incident serves as a harrowing reminder of the devastating ramifications that can result from domestic disputes. In this case, what started as a disagreement between a couple ended with the heartbreaking loss of a family member – a loss that could have been avoided with better conflict resolution and understanding between the involved parties.

Step 2: Identify the factors involved in the process a. Kidneys b. Renal artery c. Nephrons d. Waste removal e. Renal vein f. Ureters g. Bladder Step 3: Identify the main function of the kidneys The kidneys filter the blood, removing waste materials and balancing electrolytes by adjusting the levels of water and ions. Step 4: Understand the impact of increased kidney activity If kidney activity increases, it is likely that they would filter more blood within the same time frame. As a result, more waste might be removed from the blood, leading to increased waste production. Step 5: Determine how increased waste production affects the bladder As the kidneys filter more waste from the blood, they will transport more urine containing the waste to the bladder through the ureters. An increased waste passing to the bladder means that it will fill up more quickly. Step 6: Assess the potential effects caused by the perturbation hypothesis In cases where the perturbation hypothesis holds true, the following effects may be observed: a. More waste will be removed from the blood in the same amount of time. b. The bladder will fill up more quickly and require more frequent emptying. Step 7: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis does have an effect on the process. If the kidneys become more active and filter more blood, they will remove more waste and pass it to the bladder.

In both sentences, the word has different meanings based on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence — \\"He made trade protection a plank in the party platform\\" — the word \\"protection\\" refers specifically to trade protection, which is a political and economic policy aimed at regulating and sheltering domestic industries from foreign competition. This is usually accomplished through the imposition of tariffs, import quotas, and other measures that restrict or control the flow of foreign goods and services into the domestic market. In this context, the word \\"protection\\" is used to emphasize the defensive and supportive aspect of the policy, as well as its primary goal of preserving and promoting the interests of domestic industries. Here, the term \\"protection\\" has an economic and political connotation. In the second sentence — \\"Insurance provided protection against loss of wages due to illness\\" — the word \\"protection\\" has a more general meaning, and it refers to the safeguarding of an individual's or organization's financial interests in the face of potential risks, losses, or damages. In this case, the protection is offered by an insurance policy, which typically agrees to compensate the policyholder for certain types of losses (such as a loss of wages due to illness) in exchange for a regular payment called a premium. Here, the term \\"protection\\" has a financial and risk management connotation. In summary, while the word \\"protection\\" is used in both sentences, its meaning and implications are context-dependent. In the first sentence, it pertains to the realm of trade and economics, focusing on shielding domestic industries from international competition. In the second sentence, it relates to the insurance and risk management domains, addressing the safeguarding of an individual's or organization's financial interests.

The delightful colors and fragrances of a flower bed can add an idyllic beauty to your home. Consult with a gardening expert to see what types of flowers grow best in your region’s particular climate. Don’t overwater flowers. Unlike fast-growing plants like grass and shrubs, flowers don’t require as much moisture on average, and watering too often may cause them to wither. Many people have begun sewing small patches of crops right in their own backyards. Decide what you’d like to grow—beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, squash; your options are nearly limitless—and make sure the soil is thoroughly aerated and suitable to grow vegetables in. Raising your own small batches of vegetables will give your yard a utilitarian appeal while providing you and your family with fresh, homegrown food to enjoy all summer long. Use organic compost to help vegetable crops absorb vital nutrients. If yard space is an issue, considering planting your vegetables on a vertical trellis, or even in a compact grower that you can keep inside your own house! Pick ripe vegetables immediately to keep pests from feeding on them. Build a simple wooden fence to mark your property and give your yard a sense of peaceful containment. Fences can be useful for offering a little privacy if you live in a crowded neighborhood, as well as keeping out animals that may trample and devour plants. If you contract with a handyman, ask them about the materials and expenses needed to put a fence around your yard. If you have an especially large yard, or one that is divided up with shrubs, flower beds or amenities like a pool or fire pit, you might construct a simple stepping stone path out of flagstones or wooden planks. A footpath can give you an expedient way to traverse your yard or garden without wearing down the grass, is easy to build and has a pleasant, quaint aesthetic. Take a look at these resources for simple plans to lay down a footpath: You’ll be spending a lot of time outside this summer, so make sure you do it in leisure. Purchase some nice, sturdy lawn chairs to give you a place to sit and sip lemonade on a hot day. If space permits, you could even set up an entire dining set to host picnics. Study the layout of plants, trees and shrubs to decide on the best way to arrange the furniture, and turn your yard into a relaxing outdoor lounge. Be sure that you’re buying furniture with water-resistant cushions and surfaces. This way, you won’t have to worry about bringing it in every time it rains. Water-resistant outdoor furniture is often cleaned easily, as well. Place a small bench within a garden for a nice seating area, or lay out some reclining chairs somewhere unshaded for sunbathing.

Given the question: Given the background: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. and the situation: In sub-Saharan Africa there are two predominant groups of antelope present. The first group of antelope, group A, have long necks and strong teeth. The second group of antelope, group B, have shorter necks and weaker teeth.

Answer the following question: Which group of antelope is more adapted to the environment? The answer is:","completion":"Group A of antelope is more adapted to the environment in sub-Saharan Africa.

This suggests that the individuals in Group A have developed advantageous traits that make them more \\"fit\\" to survive in their specific environment, which in turn leads to greater reproductive success and increased prevalence of these traits in their population over time. This is an example of natural selection and adaptation in action, as explained by the theory of evolution by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a new situation: Russian research spent most of their time in Antarctica to study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere. The Canadian team went north of the Polar Circle, close to the North Pole to do the same thing. They spent several months there. The Canadian team didn't find any ozone holes at the North Pole. But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. What is an answer for this question: Which team didn't observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth? Answer:","completion":"The Canadian team did not observe higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. This is because they conducted their research at the North Pole and did not find any ozone holes in that region. On the other hand, the Russian team, which conducted their research in Antarctica, did study the loss of ozone in the atmosphere and found an ozone hole there, which leads to higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: In which area has excavations uncovered substantial evidence of habitation? ? The location of the Acra is important for understanding how events unfolded in Jerusalem during the struggle between Maccabean and Seleucid forces. This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the...

So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy).

She was a television producer, earned 900 a week, and had a closetful of designer labels like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. But she also had a 20,221.40 credit card bill and an empty bank account. Karyn decided that it was time for a change. She built a website and simply asked people to help her out by sending her a dollar or two. On the site, Karyn honestly explained her situation. \\"If 20,000 people gave me just 1, I'd be home free.\\" Amazingly, it worked. Her website was visited by more than a million people. Although most donors just gave a few dollars, one generous donor sent 1,000. She was on TV and in newspapers and magazines. She was offered a book deal and a movie contract. And of course, she was able to pay off her credit card debt. She also sold her designer clothes on eBay. In her closet, where the Gucci purse once sat, Karyn keeps all the letters that people have sent her. It's hard to understand why so many people helped a total stranger pay off her huge credit card bill. Karyn explains, \\"I was just honest about what happened; I didn't make up some sob story about saving the world.\\" Her donors think it's funny and original, and view it less as a charity than as an entertainment site.

However, she suffers from recurring nightmares and inexplicable anxiety that starts to disrupt her daily life. Her concerned family, unsure of how to help, take her to Dr. Bensley, a renowned psychiatrist with an impeccable record of helping patients overcome their traumas. Act 2: The Treatment From their first session, Dr. Bensley (played by a talented actor like Anthony Hopkins or Meryl Streep) manages to establish a strong connection with Mary. As their weekly sessions continue, Dr. Bensley delves into the depths of Mary's subconscious, revealing disturbing memories from her past. As they uncover more details about her childhood, a shocking truth begins to emerge – Mary was abused as a child by someone she trusted. The trauma had been repressed for years, but the nightmares and anxiety stemmed from these unresolved issues. Act 3: Unraveling the Truth Dr. Bensley helps Mary confront this painful truth, enabling her to process and come to terms with her past. Although their sessions are filled with dark moments and intense emotion, Mary gradually learns to trust Dr. Bensley and relies on their bond to guide her through this difficult journey. However, as Mary starts to investigate further, she begins to suspect that there is more to Dr. Bensley than meets the eye. She starts to question whether the psychiatrist is truly helping her or manipulating her memories for some hidden agenda. Act 4: The Revelation Determined to unearth the truth, Mary investigates Dr. Bensley's past and uncovers a shocking connection – the psychiatrist had been a close friend of her family when she was a child and had a direct involvement in her traumatic past. The revelation shakes Mary to her core and shatters the trust she had placed in Dr. Bensley. Act 5: Confrontation and Resolution Mary confronts Dr. Bensley with the uncovered evidence, demanding an explanation for the betrayal. Initially defensive, Dr. Bensley finally breaks down and confesses that they participated in covering up the abuse due to threats and blackmail from the abuser. Consumed with guilt, Dr. Bensley went on to become a psychiatrist in an attempt to repent for their past actions. With the truth finally out, Mary decides to sever her ties with Dr. Bensley, and instead work on rebuilding her life and overcoming her trauma on her own terms.

Angered citizens took to the streets to voice their frustration, leading to a series of protest-related riots. In response to the escalating tensions and to restore order, Guinean authorities have deployed troops throughout the affected areas. Over the past few months, Guinea, a West African country known for its rich resources, has been grappling with soaring energy costs. The rise in prices has been attributed to various factors, including fluctuations in global oil prices, inflation, and inadequacies in the country's energy infrastructure. The combination of these factors has culminated in a public outcry, with citizens demanding immediate action from the government to alleviate the harsh impact of the rising energy prices on daily life. The government's decision to deploy troops in strategic locations within the town is indicative of its commitment to safeguarding against further outbreaks of violence. This move aims to secure public safety and deter any potential criminal activity, such as looting and property damage, which have been occurring amidst the riots. The presence of a formidable law enforcement force also hopes to restore a sense of calm and stability, encouraging citizens to engage in peaceful dialogue and seek democratic resolutions to their grievances. While the deployment of troops may serve as a temporary solution to the current unrest, it highlights the underlying issues Guinea faces concerning its energy sector. The country's reliance on imported oil and its rudimentary energy infrastructure have made it susceptible to fluctuations in global energy costs. Indeed, this vulnerability has been starkly revealed in the recent riots, as citizens find their quality of life affected by factors beyond their control. To address this situation, the Guinean government will need to implement sustainable solutions that diversify the country's energy sources and build a more resilient energy infrastructure. This could involve investing in renewable energy technologies, such as solar and wind power, and partnering with international organizations to finance the development of more sustainable energy projects. By doing so, Guinea can secure a more stable and affordable energy future for its citizens, ultimately mitigating the risk of further unrest. In the meantime, it is crucial for the government to engage in open dialogue with the public, demonstrating a willingness to acknowledge and address their concerns. Adopting a transparent and responsive approach can go a long way in rebuilding trust between the authorities and the citizens, an essential prerequisite for meaningful, positive change. As the situation unfolds, the international community will observe with keen interest how Guinea responds to its current challenges. The recent deployment of troops may have halted the chain of violent incidents for now, but lasting peace will only be achieved through sustainable reforms and constructive communication between the government and its people. If successful, these efforts may pave the way for other countries to follow suit, employing multi-faceted approaches to combat the global issue of energy price volatility and its impact on social stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As I have pondered where I want things to go and how I can successfully make that happen, I have learned that I need to manage my time and energy differently in order to be successful in each area. The main obstacles standing in my way are, ironically, working from home and having my children with me 24/7. But, that was my choice and I’m sticking to it. My goal is to embrace these obstacles by approaching them in different ways. Work at Home Tips for Success Work at home tips can be implemented or not, depending on my needs.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: Bridget Jones's Diary makes me snort. I mean that literally. I emit a scornful guttural sound whenever I see it, which, unfortunately, happens a lot in my house. It's one of my wife's go-to cable movies (as opposed to a more sensible choice like, say, Patton), and it definitely doesn't make her snort. It makes her laugh and smile and sometimes tear up, especially when Colin Firth is on the screen. This problem has long been irreconcilable (the movie came out nine years ago), but thanks to a new study by a pair of German and British researchers, we may someday be able to hug it out. According to their findings, all it would take is a quick squirt of the hormone oxytocin up my nose, and I'd be swooning over Bridget too. What's more, past research has shown that the same chemical that could smooth over a couple's differences in cinematic taste might also be used in labs and hospitals to mitigate much more serious social-relation problems, like those associated with autism and schizophrenia. (See the top 10 medical breakthroughs of 2009.) Pumped out by the hypothalamus, oxytocin is known more colloquially as the \\"cuddle chemical.\\" As any pregnant woman knows and any spouse of a pregnant woman learns, it soars during labor and nursing, triggering contractions and aiding in the letdown of milk, and plays a major role in mother-baby bonding. New dads get a big slug of the stuff in their bloodstream too, but usually not until after the baby is born. Oxytocin is also partly responsible for even getting couples to the new-parent stage: it's released in both men and women during sex, giving post-romp bonding a chemical boost. Psychiatrist Rene Hurlemann of Bonn University and neuroscientist Keith Kendrick of the Cambridge Babraham Institute were well acquainted with the power of oxytocin when it's released the way nature intended. What they wanted to determine is if it could be artificially administered to a person to manipulate feelings of empathy and perhaps even learning. \\"Both learning and empathy are part of what's known as social cognition,\\" says Hurlemann. \\"That's our ability to feel what other people are feeling and take their point of view.\\" (See the world's most influential people in the 2010 TIME 100.) To test how oxytocin might affect those capabilities, Hurlemann and Kendrick ran a two-part experiment. In the first, 48 males were divided into two groups  half received an aerosol shot of oxytocin and half got a placebo  and then shown evocative pictures of things like a crying child, a grieving man and a girl hugging a cat. They were then asked to describe how deeply they were feeling the emotions associated with the pictures. On the whole, the men in the oxytocin group exhibited \\"significantly higher emotional empathy levels\\" than those in the placebo group. This, despite the fact that all of the volunteers were able to describe and understand what was going on in the pictures and what the people in them were probably feeling. In the second part of the experiment, the subjects were given a simple on-screen exercise that tested their ability to observe certain details in images or words. Sometimes correct answers were indicated by a green circle and incorrect ones by a red one; other times a happy face and a disapproving face were substituted. All of the men learned more quickly when the faces were used, but the difference was particularly marked among those in the oxytocin group. \\"You got a combined effect,\\" Hurlemann says. \\"You enhance empathy and in the process, you enhance social learning.\\" (See the top 10 scientific discoveries of 2009.) In the home, the oxytocin implications could be enormous. Husbands could learn to melt at Olympic ice dancing; wives could swoon over a Drew Brees bomb. Is Glenn Beck crying? Now your blue-state mate can too! But the hormone  in theory at least  could have more meaningful implications. If healthy social behavior turns in part on being able to feel the pain of others, antisocial behavior involves an ability to observe  or even cause  that kind of suffering and not experience any of it yourself. Could oxytocin change that? \\"It's an interesting possibility,\\" says Hurlemann. \\"For instance, someone who didn't sympathize with handicapped people might learn to with oxytocin. You'd probably have to administer it just once, because you learn the feeling forever.\\" (See TIME's special report \\"How to Live 100 Years.\\") That's a little too Clockwork Orange for most people, but other potential therapeutic uses could be more benign  and perhaps even game-changing. Both schizophrenia and autism are defined by a lack of social feeling and an inability to read facial and other cues. In a study last February at the Centre de Neuroscience Cognitive in Lyon, France, investigators administered oxytocin spray to 13 children with mild autism. After treatment, the participants were better able to read body-language cues during a game of catch, and when looking at photographs of faces, they spent more time studying the images  especially the eyes  than they would have otherwise. Still, Hurlemann warns, the hormone has its limits. An Israeli study has shown that when people are engaged in a contest, if one player's emotions are manipulated by the offer of a bigger prize to the other player, the first player's feelings of jealousy and ill will are actually exacerbated by a dose of oxytocin. \\"Oxytocin does not make you a better person,\\" he says. \\"In some cases it may simply intensify whatever you're feeling.\\" That, alas, means I may never like Bridget Jones. On the upside, pending further studies, I do get to keep on snorting. See TIME's health and medicine covers. See the 100 best movies of all time.

Make this lower case.","completion":"the three brick-clad buildings is thus setting a beautiful sentence for the many suggestions that have been krøyers place in recent years. The transformation of this sentence to lowercase demonstrates how the visual aspect of text can influence the way in which we perceive and interpret the information being presented. By altering the original sentence and removing any capitalization, the text appears less formal and more approachable. This change in appearance invites readers to engage with the message being conveyed in a more relaxed and informal manner. Furthermore, the transition from uppercase to lowercase allows for an increased emphasis on the specific words and phrases within the sentence. As there are no capital letters to rigidly structure the text, readers are more likely to analyze the content carefully and extract meaning from the individual words and their arrangement. In this particular sentence, the use of lowercase emphasizes the architectural elements and the passage of time. The three brick-clad buildings are highlighted as a symbol of beauty and emphasize the significance of their construction. Additionally, the mention of \\"many suggestions\\" and \\"Krøyers place\\" draws attention to the ongoing process of development and transformation that has taken place in recent years. Lowercase text does not suggest that the content is less critical or valuable. Instead, it reflects a stylistic approach that encourages greater reader engagement. As we read the sentence, we're still presented with a detailed picture of the architectural developments at Krøyers place. However, the overall atmosphere and tone of the sentence now feel more open and conversational, making it more accessible to a broader range of readers. In conclusion, making the sentence lower case brings attention to the specific elements of the text and encourages a deeper engagement with its contents. This change represents the power of language to affect our interpretation and invites an in-depth analysis of the interplay between style, tone, and information.

Determine the sentiment: First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges. Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired. However, it wasn't the Preston Sturges, it was Preston Sturges, Jr. The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson's short story \\"The Bottle Imp\\". A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell. That's fine. Nobody said screenwriters had to be original. The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen. My biggest complaint comes with the ending. The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person. At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film, they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film. This is a stupid convention. The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end. There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think. You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end.

This implies they have a strong bond and mutual respect. Therefore, we can interpret that Aubrey would likely aim to uphold his parents' teachings, follow their advice, and potentially make life choices that reflect their wisdom. Hence, when we examine the three given options, answer C: \\"make their parents proud\\" seems to fit best according to the context. Option A: \\"remain the same Aubrey\\" is a bit vague and doesn't imply any specific action or direction that Aubrey is likely to take based on the context. While this doesn't explicitly contradict what we know about Aubrey, it doesn't resonate with the notion of following parental advice or achieving something related to it. Option B: \\"work harder\\" could potentially be true, as working hard is generally good advice. But this response isn't given any grounding in the provided context. It's an assumptive statement and doesn't specifically link to Aubrey's behavior guided by his parents' advice. Option C: \\"make their parents proud\\" goes along with the idea of valuing and following parental advice. If Aubrey appreciates and implements his parents' advice about life, it's reasonable to deduce that he might wish to make them proud by using their teachings wisely and beneficially. Thus, it aligns best with the provided context and Aubrey's established character traits.

Chair of the Commission of Inquiry on Syria Paulo Pinheiro (L) delivers his report next to U.N. human rights chief Navi Pillay during the Human Rights Council at the United Nations in Geneva March 11, 2013. GENEVA (Reuters) - The Syrian government has stepped up indiscriminate, heavy bombardments of cities while rebels are executing prisoners condemned in their own makeshift courts without due process, U.N. investigators said on Monday. The independent investigators said they were looking into 20 massacres committed by one or the other side and hundreds of \\"unlawful killings\\", cases of torture and arbitrary arrests since September in the two-year-old conflict. \\"Indiscriminate and widespread shelling, the regular bombardment of cities, mass killing and the deliberate firing on civilian targets have come to characterize the daily lives of civilians in Syria,\\" Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the commission of inquiry on Syria, told the U.N. Human Rights Council. The uprising in Syria erupted in March 2011 with largely peaceful protests but escalated into a civil war pitting mainly Sunni Muslim rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, whose minority Alawite faith is an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam. \\"In a disturbing and dangerous trend, mass killings allegedly perpetrated by Popular Committees have at times taken on sectarian overtones,\\" the 10-page U.N. report said. \\"Some appear to have been trained and armed by the government.\\" Pro-Assad Popular Committee militiamen have been documented as operating across Syria, \\"where at times they are alleged to be participating in house-to-house searches, identity checks, mass arrests, looting and acting as informants\\", it said. Karen Koning AbuZayd, an American commissioner, said the committees were formed initially to defend their neighborhoods. \\"In a way, this is a move by the government to supplement its own manpower as it begins to lose some of the (regular military) manpower that it used to have,\\" she told a news conference. Syrian Ambassador Faysal Khabbaz Hamoui dismissed the report as based on \\"partial information from untrustworthy sources\\" and accused Qatar and Turkey of \\"supporting terrorism\\" in Syria. Related Coverage › Lebanon says world must shoulder Syrian refugee burden \\"There is a conspiracy against Syria. Qatar has financed and armed tens of thousands of mercenaries from 30 countries. Turkey has provided the military bases and sent them into Syria on their jihad,\\" he told the Geneva forum. \\"SECTARIAN ELEMENTS\\" \\"We are not saying that it is a sectarian war but we call attention to sectarian elements in the present conflict,\\" Pinheiro said. Foreign fighters from more than a dozen countries are estimated to comprise less than 10 percent of the opposition forces fighting the Assad government, he said. \\"We don't want to contribute to a paranoia that Syria is being invaded by foreign fighters. But they have a lot of skills and have been very successful in spreading acts of terror inside Syria,\\" said Pinheiro. More than 1 million Syrian refugees have fled abroad and 2.5 million are uprooted within the country, while more than 70,000 people have been killed in the war, the United Nations says. The war is mired in a \\"destructive stalemate, amid heavy shelling and air raids by government forces, the report said. Both sides have committed violations against civilians, the U.N. investigators said. They are investigating about 20 cases of massacre, including three in Homs at the start of the year, despite their lack of access to the country. They said rebel forces often execute captured Syrian soldiers and militiamen and have established detention centers in Homs and Aleppo. Rebels had also taken up positions in or near densely-populated areas, in violation of international law. \\"There is an intensification of violations because the war is worsening. You have to look at the totality of the panorama - the murders, the arbitrary arrests and all of it,\\" said Vitit Muntarbhorn, a commission member from Thailand. \\"Some groups are exercising or trying to exercise civilian authority without due process of law. So we have allegations for example of sentences being imposed on various people, arrested and captured soldiers and so on, without due process and then being executed, as well as some families,\\" Muntarbhorn said, noting that these were war crimes under the Geneva Convention. The European Union and United States denounced continuing crimes and said that those responsible must be held accountable. The U.N. investigators said that they would give a secret third list of suspects in a sealed envelope to High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay with a view to future prosecutions. Carla del Ponte, a former U.N. war crimes prosecutor who tried ex-Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, is on the panel. Speaking in Italian to reporters, she said: \\"Sooner or later the International Criminal Court must be seized of the matter. \\"I don't think that high-ranking political and military officials can be judged in their own country. We have seen, we have experience, we know that with a president of a nation, it is difficult for countries to put him on trial.\\" (Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Mark Heinrich) ||||| Few civilian areas in Syria remain untouched by the country’s two-year civil war and more than 2.5 million people have been displaced internally, according to the United Nations Independent Commission of Inquiry on Syria. “Over the past two months, there has been a dramatic erosion of areas inside Syria where civilians are able to live unaffected by the violence and destruction caused by the conflict,” the panel told the Human Rights Council in Geneva today, according to an advance copy of its presentation. In its latest report, which covers Jan. 15 to March 3, the commission said the collapse of Syria’s economy has crippled citizens’ access to basic economic and social rights. The conflict between troops loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and anti-government rebels has led to shortages of fuel, electricity, water and medicine that have been compounded by international sanctions, according to the commission. The panel is charged with investigating alleged violations of international law and all massacres in Syria. More than 70,000 people have been killed since the conflict broke out in March 2011 and UN High Commissioner for RefugeesAntonio Guterres said on March 6 that 1 million Syrians had fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey and other countries. “The scope of the humanitarian crisis in Syria remains of grave concern,” the commission said. “The education system in many areas is in tatters. Prices for basic necessities have increased exponentially. There has been significant damage to the country’s infrastructure.” Hospitals Targeted Medical personnel and hospitals have been “deliberately targeted” and are treated by both sides in the conflict as military objectives, the commission said. “Medical access has been denied on real or perceived political and sectarian grounds,” it said. “The urgent need for a political solution cannot be overstated,” the commission said. “A failure to resolve this increasingly violent conflict will condemn Syria, the region and the millions of civilians caught in the crossfire to an unimaginably bleak future.” The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that at least four million people are in need of assistance.

OPTIONS: (a). read the words on the pages from left to right. (b). read the words on the pages from right to left.","completion":"(a) Read the words on the pages from left to right. Reading a book is a fundamental skill that is essential for acquiring knowledge, understanding concepts, and improving language skills. The process, although seemingly simple, consists of multiple steps and practices that must be adopted to get the most out of reading. Here is a detailed explanation of how to read a book, specifically choosing option (a), which is to read the words on the pages from left to right. 1. Choose a suitable book: Your reading journey begins with selecting a book that interests and engages you. Be it fiction or non-fiction, the book should cater to your preferences and reading level to ensure a positive and worthwhile experience. 2. Start with basic book information: Before diving into the actual content, familiarize yourself with the book's title, author, and any essential information like the publication date, edition, and publisher. This knowledge provides a context for your reading. 3. Read the synopsis/summary/blurb: A quick review of the book's cover or back flap will give you an idea of its content and themes. This information will set the stage for what to expect while reading. 4. Get comfortable: Find a comfortable and quiet spot with ample lighting to ensure that you can concentrate on your reading without distractions. Good posture and minimal physical discomfort allow you to read for longer periods. 5. Begin at the book's starting point: Start with the table of contents and any preface or introduction the author has included. These sections often provide valuable context, background, or insights into the book's organization and content. 6. Read from left to right and top to bottom: As you begin reading the main body of the book, follow the standard reading pattern in the English language, which is to read from left to right and from top to bottom. This directional approach ensures that you are reading the content in the intended order. 7. Follow the flow of paragraphs and sentences: A book is typically divided into chapters, which are further broken down into paragraphs. Pay attention to punctuation and sentence structure. Read sentences and paragraphs in their entirety to fully grasp the ideas, statements, or arguments being made by the writer. 8.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the meaning of the first sentence.

He has, however, cut meaningfully the politicians salaries. These policies have led to social unrest and to confrontations between several institutions, namely between the Government and the Constitutional Court. Several individualities belonging to the parties that support the government have also raised their voices against the policies that have been taken in order to try to solve the financial crisis.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The professions that bypassed receiving pension cuts in the context provided are judges, diplomats, military personnel, and police forces. In an effort to address the financial crisis, Passos Coelho announced a series of austerity measures that affected various sectors, such as raising the retirement age from 65 to 66, cutting pensions, unemployment benefits, health, education and science expenses, and abolishing the mandatory English classes in Basic Education. However, amidst these measures, the pensions of judges and diplomats were left untouched. Additionally, the retirement age for military and police forces was not raised. While Passos Coelho did cut the salaries of politicians in a meaningful manner, the preferential treatment given to certain professions led to social unrest and confrontations between government institutions, particularly between the Government and the Constitutional Court. This has also caused some individuals belonging to the parties that support the government to raise their voices against these policies, as various groups of the population have been disproportionately impacted by these austerity measures. In conclusion, despite efforts to address the financial crisis through various cutbacks and policy changes, the selective nature of the implemented measures has sparked controversy and dissent among the affected parties, with judges, diplomats, military personnel, and police forces remaining exempt from pension cuts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The cougar (Puma concolor), also commonly known as the puma, mountain lion, panther or catamount, is a large felid of the subfamily Felinae native to the Americas. Its range, from the Canadian Yukon to the southern Andes of South America, is the widest of any large wild terrestrial mammal in the Western Hemisphere. An adaptable, generalist species, the cougar is found in most American habitat types. It is the biggest cat in North America, and the second-heaviest cat in the New World after the jaguar.

Muhammad Yunus (Bengali: muhaammd iunuus; born 28 June 1940) is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, economist, and civil society leader who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for founding the Grameen Bank and pioneering the concepts of microcredit and microfinance. These loans are given to entrepreneurs too poor to qualify for traditional bank loans. In 2006, Yunus and the Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize \\"for their efforts through microcredit to create economic and social development from below\\". The Norwegian Nobel Committee said that \\"lasting peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find ways in which to break out of poverty\\" and that \\"across cultures and civilizations, Yunus and Grameen Bank have shown that even the poorest of the poor can work to bring about their own development\\". After his graduation, Yunus joined the Bureau of Economics as a research assistant to the economics researches of Professor Nurul Islam and Rehman Sobhan. Later, he was appointed lecturer in economics in Chittagong College in 1961. During that time, he also set up a profitable packaging factory on the side. In 1965, he received a Fulbright scholarship to study in the United States. He obtained his PhD in economics from the Vanderbilt University Graduate Program in Economic Development (GPED) in 1971. From 1969 to 1972, Yunus was assistant professor of economics at Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Yunus founded a citizen's committee and ran the Bangladesh Information Center, with other Bangladeshis in the United States, to raise support for liberation. He also published the Bangladesh Newsletter from his home in Nashville. After the War, he returned to Bangladesh and was appointed to the government's Planning Commission headed by Nurul Islam. However, he found the job boring and resigned to join Chittagong University as head of the Economics department. After observing the famine of 1974, he became involved in poverty reduction and established a rural economic program as a research project. In 1975, he developed a Nabajug (New Era) Tebhaga Khamar (three share farm) which the government adopted as the Packaged Input Programme. In order to make the project more effective, Yunus and his associates proposed the Gram Sarkar (the village government) programme. Introduced by president Ziaur Rahman in the late 1970s, the Government formed 40,392 village governments as a fourth layer of government in 2003. On 2 August 2005, in response to a petition by Bangladesh Legal Aids and Services Trust (BLAST) the High Court had declared village governments illegal and unconstitutional. His concept of microcredit for supporting innovators in multiple developing countries also inspired programs such as the Info lady Social Entrepreneurship Programme.

Created by writer Stan Lee, scripter Larry Lieber, and penciller Jack Kirby, a version of the character first appeared in Venus #6 (August 1949). The modern day incarnation of Loki first appeared in Journey into Mystery #85 (October 1962). He is the adopted brother and often the enemy of the superhero Thor. With the Asgardian population other than Thor still wary of Loki, Loki revealed to his brother that he was attempting to learn more about Earth and humans, to which Thor approves. When a magpie exploded in his quarters carrying a key, it led to a chain of events where at the end, Loki was contacted by an echo of his former incarnation, who revealed he chose to sacrifice himself fighting the Void as part of a greater plan which would involve his death and return. The child Loki refused to follow this path, wanting to be his own person, and transformed the spirit of his former self into a magpie named Ikol. On returning to Earth, he witnessed Odin striking down Thor. Odin prepared all of Asgard for an unknown battle and imprisoned Thor for attempting to protect Midgard from being scoured. Loki, who disagreed with Odin's actions, was put to work by Volstagg into cleaning the stables of Thor's goats to keep him out of trouble and danger. Using the wool of one of the goats, Loki descended into the roots of the World Tree at the advice of Ikol to ask questions from the Nornish women who live there. After receiving his answers, Loki wept but decided to turn to the imprisoned Thor for his opinion before making his final decision. Breaking into the prison by stealth, Loki asked his brother what he would do if he had to let something bad happen in order to prevent something worse from happening and what if it cost him everything. With Thor's answer, Loki decided to free one of the imprisoned Hel Wolves and bind it to him in servitude using the bridle of Thor's goats. He revealed he needed help from one more 'personage' before heading for the realm of Hela. Having recovered Thor's hammer after he was killed and erased from memory following the war against the Serpent, Loki was able to work with the Silver Surfer to restore the hammer to its natural state and send it to Thor in the afterlife, restoring his memory and allowing him to fight his way back into the realm of the living. After Thor's return, Ikol would afterwards reveal that circumstances had been manipulated to force the young Loki to allow his former personality to subsume him and live again, his former slate wiped clean by the \\"new\\" Loki's actions. During his adventures, the young Loki had inadvertently helped create and was tied to a powerful artifact that was about to be used by Mephisto to conquer all the Hells and ultimately everything. However, if the new Loki ceased to be, the artifact would lose all power. Seeing no other option, Loki allowed Ikol to become Loki again, ceasing to be, but he warned beforehand that the Ikol personality was incapable of true change and believed this older persona would ultimately be stopped by those who always stopped him before, his brother included.

Movie title: Courage Under Fire Context: While serving in the Gulf War, Lieutenant Colonel Serling (Denzel Washington) accidentally destroys one of his own tanks during a confusing night-time battle, killing his friend Captain Boylar. The US Army covers up the details and transfers Serling to a desk job. Later, Serling is assigned to determine if Captain Karen Emma Walden (Meg Ryan) should be the first woman to receive a (posthumous) Medal of Honor. She was the commander of a Medevac Huey that was sent to rescue the crew of a shot-down Black Hawk. When she encountered a T-54, her crew destroyed it by dropping a fuel bladder onto the tank and igniting it with a flare gun. However, her own helicopter was shot down soon after. The two crews were unable to join forces, and on the next day, when further rescue arrived, Walden was reported dead. Serling notices inconsistencies between the testimonies of Walden's crew. Specialist Andrew Ilario, the medic (Matt Damon), praises Walden heavily. Staff Sergeant John Monfriez (Lou Diamond Phillips) claims that Walden was a coward and that Monfriez himself led the crew in combat, and that the fuel bladder technique was originated by him. Sergeant Altameyer, who is dying in a hospital, complains about a fire. Warrant Officer One Rady, the co-pilot, was injured early on and rendered unconscious. Meanwhile, the crew of the Black Hawk claims that they heard firing from an M16, which Ilario and Monfriez deny. Under pressure from the White House and his commander, Brigadier General Hershberg (Michael Moriarty), to wrap things up quickly, Serling leaks the story to newspaper reporter Tony Gartner (Scott Glenn) to prevent another cover up. When Serling puts pressure on Monfriez during a car ride, Monfriez forces him to get out of the vehicle at gunpoint, then commits suicide by driving into an oncoming train.

Neither man is expected to serve any time in jail and Barcelona have launched a social media campaign urging fans to show \\"unconditional support\\". A club statement said: \\"Using the hashtag #WeAreAllLeoMessi while posting a photo or message with both hands open, the campaign is encouraging all Barça fans to express their sympathy for the greatest footballer in the world by voicing their unconditional support on social networks. \\"By making it clear that #WeAreAllMessi, we want Leo to know that he is not alone.

The pair were found guilty of using tax havens in Belize and Uruguay to conceal earnings from image rights.

It enjoyed support from many Barca fans, who believe their club is being politically persecuted by the central Madrid government for its part in the campaign for Catalan independence from Spain. They point to the fact that Messi's case was pushed through despite one branch of the government recommending it was dropped, and that other sports stars - including former Real Madrid duo Jose Mourinho and Iker Casillas - received much lighter punishments for similar tax offences.

Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.).

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person that was a paratrooper during World War II?, using the article: MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea. When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice. Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment.

Given the following context: Athenian slaves were the property of their master (or of the state), who could dispose of them as he saw fit. He could give, sell, rent, or bequeath them. A slave could have a spouse and child, but the slave family was not recognized by the state, and the master could scatter the family members at any time. Slaves had fewer judicial rights than citizens and were represented by their master in all judicial proceedings. A misdemeanour that would result in a fine for the free man would result in a flogging for the slave; the ratio seems to have been one lash for one drachma. With several minor exceptions, the testimony of a slave was not admissible except under torture. Slaves were tortured in trials because they often remained loyal to their master. A famous example of a trusty slave was Themistocles's Persian slave Sicinnus (the counterpart of Ephialtes of Trachis), who, despite his Persian origin, betrayed Xerxes and helped Athenians in the Battle of Salamis. Despite torture in trials, the Athenian slave was protected in an indirect way: if he was mistreated, the master could initiate litigation for damages and interest (δίκη βλάβης / dikē blabēs). Conversely, a master who excessively mistreated a slave could be prosecuted by any citizen (γραφὴ ὕβρεως / graphē hybreōs); this was not enacted for the sake of the slave, but to avoid violent excess (ὕβρις / hubris).Isocrates claimed that \\"not even the most worthless slave can be put to death without trial\\"; the master's power over his slave was not absolute. Draco's law apparently punished with death the murder of a slave; the underlying principle was: \\"was the crime such that, if it became more widespread, it would do serious harm to society?\\" The suit that could be brought against a slave's killer was not a suit for damages, as would be the case for the killing of cattle, but a δίκη φονική (dikē phonikē), demanding punishment for the religious pollution brought by the shedding of blood.

They are usually funded by donations but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests. - The United Nations (UN) is an intergovernmental organization to promote international co-operation. A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states.

They should not be taken away except as a result of due process based on specific circumstances; for example, human rights may include freedom from unlawful imprisonment, torture, and execution. - The Alps are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the FrenchItalian border, and at is the highest mountain in the Alps.

Negative Title: \\"Disappointing Dreams\\" - A Case of Unrealized Potential 'Disappointing Dreams' is an unfortunate case of a movie with an interesting premise, only to fall flat with its execution. With high expectations primarily due to its captivating trailer, the movie was anticipated to be a thought-provoking and sentimental exploration of personal ambition. However, the film does not live up to its promises, ultimately delivering a disjointed and underwhelming narrative. The story attempts to follow the journey of Mark, a talented pianist with dreams of making it big in the music industry. As the film progresses, it becomes clear that there is a notable lack of character development. Mark's struggles and hurdles during his journey lack the emotional weight required to garner empathy from the audience. With poor writing contributing to generic dialogues and shallow relationships with other key characters, the film fails to bring forth captivating performances from its cast. Furthermore, the editing feels rushed and uneven, constantly shifting between scenes without any cohesive transitions. This disorganization creates confusion and adds to the diminishing interest in the events surrounding Mark. There is a certain disappointment in how the captivating moments from the trailer become a sequence of fragmented scenes within the movie, and key plotlines are either abandoned or left unexplored. The director's decision to implement clichéd and formulaic storylines does not contribute to the movie's overall appeal. Predictable twists and turns, along with characters that comply with existing stereotypes, are all too familiar for avid movie enthusiasts. The film lacks the innovation that audiences crave for in today's cinematic landscape. It's disappointing to see a concept that could have potentially sparked thoughtful conversations and challenged established norms in storytelling fall victim to common clichés. The only redeeming feature of the film would be its musical score. Designed by an accomplished composer, the soundtrack does an impressive job of reflecting Mark's emotions and journey as a pianist. Unfortunately, the musical genius of the composer cannot save the movie from sinking into the abyss of mediocre filmmaking. In conclusion, 'Disappointing Dreams' is a wasted opportunity that could have been an intriguing exploration of human dreams, ambition, and the struggles that come with achieving one's goals. The poor writing, lack of character development, and rushed editing all contribute to a movie that ultimately fails to engage the audience. It is a stark reminder that a captivating trailer does not always guarantee a fulfilling cinematic experience. All in all, 'Disappointing Dreams' is a regrettable addition to the film industry and should serve as a lesson for filmmakers when crafting movies that promise profound experiences."},{"prompt":"Given the following context: In 1951, Thelonious Monk was convicted of narcotics possession after refusing to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police; a police search of the car belonging to Powell's female companion had discovered his glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet. The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of the pianist's music. With the residency, he had finally found jazz stardom after twenty years of career struggles and obscurity.Monk began his first stint at the venue in July 1957, with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group. However, by the time it ended in December, he had lost Wilson to poor health, while Coltrane left in pursuit of a solo career and a return to Miles Davis's group.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who studied Celtic culture and language? ? Philip Arnold Heseltine (30 October 1894 – 17 December 1930), known by the pseudonym Peter Warlock, was a British composer and music critic. The Warlock name, which reflects Heseltine's interest in occult practices, was used for all his published musical works. He is best known as a composer of songs and other vocal music; he also achieved notoriety in his lifetime through his unconventional and often scandalous lifestyle. As a schoolboy at Eton College, Heseltine met the British composer Frederick Delius, with whom he formed a close friendship. After a failed student career in Oxford and London, Heseltine turned to musical journalism, while developing interests in folk-song and Elizabethan music. His first serious compositions date from around 1915. Following a period of inactivity, a positive and lasting influence on his work arose from his meeting in 1916 with the Dutch composer Bernard van Dieren; he also gained creative impetus from a year spent in Ireland, studying Celtic culture and language. On his return to England in 1918, Heseltine began composing songs in a distinctive, original style, while building a reputation as a combative and controversial music critic. During 1920–21 he edited the music magazine The Sackbut. His most prolific period as a composer came in the 1920s, when he was based first in Wales and later at Eynsford in Kent. Through his critical writings, published under his own name, Heseltine made a pioneering contribution to the scholarship of early music. In addition, he produced a full-length biography of Frederick Delius and wrote, edited, or otherwise assisted the production of several other books and pamphlets. Towards the end of his life, Heseltine became depressed by a loss of his creative inspiration. He died in his London flat of coal gas poisoning in 1930, probably by his own hand.

He was the type of detective who could get the job done, even if it meant bending the rules a little. In a small town plagued by a series of baffling and gruesome murders, his superiors were willing to let Tomkins try anything that might stop the carnage. Tomkins had gathered a select group of officers - Larry, Megan, Kate, Josh, and Patrick - to help him with his latest plan. He intended to stage murder scenes to draw out the culprit or gather clues about their identity. Fact1: Tomkins dispatches them to examine corpses in different areas as part of staged murders, restricting pairs from interacting only allowing use of walkie-talkies to report back to him. Tomkins decided to split the team into pairs, each assigned to a specific area. Larry and Megan would cover the industrial district, Kate and Josh would investigate the residential district, while Patrick and Rob would take the dense, wooded parklands. They were to analyze the staged corpses from a distance, and if they saw anything suspicious, they were not to engage but report directly back to Tomkins via walkie-talkie. Although the team was anxious, they trusted in Tomkins' expertise and went into their assigned areas. Fact2: Larry warns Megan and Kate about finding an unexpected corpse of a skinhead female in a jumpsuit. While examining the staged scene in the industrial district, Larry stumbled upon a genuine corpse hidden amongst the chaos they'd orchestrated. The victim was a skinhead woman, clad in a jumpsuit. Larry immediately reported his findings to Tomkins, who instructed the other pairs to be on high alert. Megan and Kate, in particular, took this warning to heart, as the presence of the female corpse signified that whatever they were dealing with was far more dangerous and unpredictable than they'd initially thought. Fact3: A zombie pursues Kate in the woods, while she's alone. As the sun began to set, the officers found themselves in increasingly eerie and treacherous terrain. Kate, having wandered off from Josh to explore a suspicious-looking area, found herself deep within the woods. Suddenly, she realized she was being pursued by a grotesque and horrifying figure—a living corpse that had once been a person. The zombie relentlessly chased Kate through the darkness, its guttural moans and gnashing teeth striking terror into her heart. Fact4: Josh and Patrick see the zombie's movements in the woods. Unbeknownst to Kate, Josh had noticed her absence and had called in Patrick for backup. They scoured the woods in search of their colleague, knowing that something dreadful was afoot. As they searched, they caught sight of the staggering and unnatural movements of the zombie hunting Kate. With growing panic, they realized that their team had stumbled upon something far more dangerous and otherworldly than they could have ever anticipated—a supernatural force that threatened not only the lives of the townspeople but their own as well. Fact5: Rob approaches Kate after being bitten to death by the tattooed zombie and thug zombie. In a moment of desperation, Kate tripped and fell, the menacing figure looming over her. It was then that Rob appeared, limping and bloodied, only to reveal that he had fallen victim to a horrifying pair of zombies—one adorned with tattoos, the other a thug-like monster. Despite being all but torn apart, Rob mustered the strength to fight off the creature that threatened Kate's life. Unfortunately, his brave actions came at the ultimate cost. As his life ebbed away, Rob transformed into a monstrous shell of his former self, leaving Kate and their fellow officers to confront an enemy that was as deadly as it was unstoppable. In the end, it was up to Tomkins and his team to face their greatest fears, not just for the sake of the town, but for each other. The stakes were high, and the question remained: how could they fight an enemy that was both relentless and terrifyingly inhuman? Only time would tell if they could succeed in banishing the darkness that had invaded their once-peaceful lives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minutes from the Fed's meeting on 28-29 July show one policymaker was ready to vote for a rate rise at the meeting. However, other policymakers remained concerned that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices. The Fed's key interest rate has been kept near zero since December 2008. There has been speculation that the Fed will raise rates at its meeting in September, and last month Fed chair Janet Yellen said she thought a rate rise this year was likely. In assessing the strength of the US economy, the Fed has been keeping an eye on the US jobs market - which has seen the unemployment rate fall to 5.3%. However, inflation is still below the Fed's target of 2%. The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) July meeting said: \\"Most judged that the conditions for policy firming had not yet been achieved, but they noted that conditions were approaching that point.\\" The committee noted that the labour market \\"had continued to improve, with solid job gains and declining unemployment\\". However, when assessing inflation, it said that \\"some members continued to see downside risks to inflation from the possibility of further dollar appreciation and declines in commodity prices\\". The FOMC said it would continue to monitor inflation \\"closely, with almost all members indicating that they would need to see more evidence that economic growth was sufficiently strong and labour market conditions had firmed enough for them to feel reasonably confident that inflation would return to the committee's longer-run objective over the medium term\\". Inflation figures released earlier on Wednesday showed that consumer prices rose by 0.1% in July, and were 0.2% higher from a year ago. So-called core inflation, which ignores changes in food and energy prices, also rose 0.1% last month, but was up 1.8% over the year. The committee also cited China as a potential problem, saying that a \\"material slowdown\\" in the Chinese economy could affect the US economic outlook. The FOMC's meeting came before last week's action by China to weaken its currency. Following the release of the Fed's minutes, US stocks rallied briefly but then fell back, while the dollar weakened on the currency markets. \\"The Fed minutes don't rule out a September rate hike but they are certainly saying they want more evidence on the data,\\" Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Rockwell Global Capital, told Reuters. Summary:","completion":"The Federal Reserve remains cautious about raising interest rates due to concerns that inflation would remain weak because of the strong dollar and falling commodity prices, while also considering the potential impact of a \\"material slowdown\\" in the Chinese economy on the U.S. outlook."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut.

While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal.

In this case, we want to get 'h' by itself. -125h - 3407 = -5782 2. First, we'll move the constant term '-3407' from the left side to the right side of the equation by adding '3407' to both sides: -125h - 3407 + 3407 = -5782 + 3407 -125h = -2375 3. Now, to isolate 'h', we'll divide the equation by the coefficient of 'h', which is '-125': -125h / (-125) = -2375 / (-125) h = 19 So the solution to the equation -125*h - 3407 = -5782 is h = 19."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The three phases coexist at a single pressure and temperature. This is known as the triple point and is described by a single point on a phase diagram. A gas at a temperature below its boiling point is called a vapor. Vapor pressure is the pressure at which a gas coexists with its solid or liquid phase.

SANTIAGO (AFP) - Former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, 89, was indicted and placed under house arrest and may, for the first time, face trial for murders and kidnappings of opponents to his 17-year rule. Choices: A). World B). Sports C). Business D). Science/Tech","completion":"This news is about A). World, particularly focusing on politics and human rights in Chile during the rule of former dictator Augusto Pinochet. The article discusses his indictment and house arrest for murders and kidnappings of those who opposed his 17-year rule. This is an important development considering the impact Pinochet's regime had on Chilean society and the many victims who continue to seek justice. Augusto Pinochet, born on November 25, 1915, was the leader of Chile from 1973 to 1990. He came to power through a coup d'état on September 11, 1973, overthrowing the then-elected socialist president Salvador Allende. Pinochet's regime was known for its brutal oppression of dissidents, severe human rights abuses, and widespread corruption. An estimated 3,000 people were killed, and tens of thousands were imprisoned and tortured during his rule. Pinochet stepped down in 1990, but he continued to influence Chilean politics for years after, serving as a senator-for-life. Several attempts were made to prosecute him, both in Chile and abroad, for human rights violations committed during his rule. In October 1998, Pinochet was arrested while visiting London, following a request from a Spanish judge who wanted to try him for human rights abuses committed against Spanish citizens in Chile. This marked a significant milestone in efforts to hold him accountable for his regime's crimes and demonstrated the concept of universal jurisdiction, which allows for the prosecution of war criminals and those responsible for crimes against humanity anywhere in the world. However, due to health concerns, Pinochet was returned to Chile in 2000 without standing trial. The indictment in the news refers to charges brought against Pinochet in Chile, where he faced house arrest and the possibility of domestic legal proceedings for the first time. Pinochet was charged with multiple counts of human rights abuses, including murder and kidnapping, stemming from his role as the dictator responsible for implementing repressive policies and practices which led to the suffering and deaths of thousands of Chileans. Despite these legal efforts, Pinochet never faced a full trial for his crimes, as his health significantly declined, and he later died on December 10, 2006. His death left behind a legacy of pain and trauma in Chile, with many families still searching for the truth about their missing loved ones and hoping for justice for the atrocities committed during his rule. In conclusion, the news about Augusto Pinochet's indictment and house arrest is related to world affairs, specifically the political history of Chile and the pursuit of justice for human rights abuses committed during his dictatorship. The case highlights the struggle for accountability in cases of severe human rights violations and demonstrates the importance of continuing to seek justice for victims, even decades after the crimes have been committed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a summary based on this article: One week ago I left Hong Kong after it became clear that my freedom and safety were under threat for revealing the truth. My continued liberty has been owed to the efforts of friends new and old, family, and others who I have never met and probably never will. I trusted them with my life and they returned that trust with a faith in me for which I will always be thankful. On Thursday, President Obama declared before the world that he would not permit any diplomatic \\"wheeling and dealing\\" over my case. Yet now it is being reported that after promising not to do so, the President ordered his Vice President to pressure the leaders of nations from which I have requested protection to deny my asylum petitions. This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, and neither is the extralegal penalty of exile. These are the old, bad tools of political aggression. Their purpose is to frighten, not me, but those who would come after me. For decades the United States of America has been one of the strongest defenders of the human right to seek asylum. Sadly, this right, laid out and voted for by the U.S. in Article 14 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, is now being rejected by the current government of my country. The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum. In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, Bradley Manning or Thomas Drake. We are stateless, imprisoned, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be. I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many. Edward Joseph Snowden Monday 1st July 2013 ||||| Activists from the Internet Party of Ukraine perform during a rally supporting Edward Snowden, a former contractor at the National Security Agency (NSA), in front of U.S. embassy, in Kiev June 27, 2013. LONDON Former U.S. spy agency contractor Edward Snowden has broken his silence for the first time since he fled to Moscow eight days ago to say he remains free to make new disclosures about U.S. spying activity. In a letter to Ecuador, Snowden said the United States was illegally persecuting him for revealing its electronic surveillance program, PRISM. He also thanked Ecuador for helping him get to Russia and for examining his asylum request. \\"I remain free and able to publish information that serves the public interest,\\" Snowden said in an undated Spanish-language letter sent to President Rafael Correa of Ecuador, seen by Reuters. \\"No matter how many more days my life contains, I remain dedicated to the fight for justice in this unequal world. If any of those days ahead realize a contribution to the common good, the world will have the principles of Ecuador to thank,\\" part of the text read, according to a translation. Snowden, who is believed to be holed up in the transit area of a Moscow airport, complained that the United States was illegally pursuing him for an act he said was in the public interest. \\"While the public has cried out support of my shining a light on this secret system of injustice, the Government of the United States of America responded with an extrajudicial man-hunt costing me my family, my freedom to travel, and my right to live peacefully without fear of illegal aggression,\\" he wrote.

Summarize this article: If you need to get your system clear of cocaine, stop using the drug right away. One-time users will have cocaine in their urine for at least 4-8 hours afterwards, but cocaine can still be detected for up to 4 days even after a single use. However, habitual users can show up positive on a drug test for up to a month. The sooner you stop using, the sooner you’ll be clean. ” Anyone who uses cocaine will likely have a comedown or “crash” after the initial effects of the drug wear off. This is your body rebalancing itself in terms of energy and mood. Expect to be tired and potentially depressed for a short time, even up to 2-3 days. The cocaine crash is not the same thing as withdrawal, though there are some overlapping symptoms. If you’ve been using cocaine regularly, you will probably experience symptoms of withdrawal when you remove it from your life. Tell yourself ahead of time that you will get through it, and prepare yourself mentally to experience any of the following: Severe cravings Nausea and vomiting Paranoia, depression, or anxiety Mood swings or irritability Itching or a feeling that something is crawling on your skin Insomnia, sleeping too much, or vivid and distressing dreams Fatigue and exhaustion If you’ve been using cocaine for a long time or using it often, you may need to go through medically-supervised detoxification. There’s no drug that can remove cocaine from your system, but a medical professional can help you through withdrawal by giving you medications to counteract the withdrawal symptoms. If you need help, look online for a detox center near you. Depending on your symptoms and how heavily you used cocaine, a detox program can last from 3 days to over a week. An inpatient rehabilitation program can last around 30 days. Outpatient detox can cost you between 1,000-1,500, whereas a full rehab program can cost up to 20,000. There’s no great way to flush your system of cocaine and its metabolites (what your body turns it into), so you may just have to wait it out. If so, know that how long cocaine takes to leave your system depends upon a number of different factors: How much you used: More cocaine takes longer to leave. How often you use it: The more often you use, the longer it lasts in your body. What was mixed with the cocaine, i.e. how pure it was: Purer cocaine leaves more drug in your body. If you were also drinking alcohol: Alcohol slows down elimination of the drug at first, keeping it in your body longer. How well your liver and kidneys function. If you have liver or kidney problems, your body won’t clear cocaine as effectively as in a healthy person. Your weight: Cocaine sticks around longer in heavier individuals.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of stopping cocaine use immediately for it to clear from your system.

Movie title: Career Opportunities Movie plot: Jim Dodge (Frank Whaley) is a self-proclaimed \\"people person\\" and dreamer who is perceived as lazy and good for nothing. After being fired from numerous low-paying jobs, Jim is given the choice by his father, Bud Dodge (John M. Jackson), to either land a job at the local Target or be put on a bus to St. Louis. Jim is hired as night cleanup boy at Target. On his first shift at his new job, Jim is locked alone in the store by his boss, the head custodian, who leaves him there until his shift ends at 7 am. He encounters Josie McClellan (Jennifer Connelly), a stereotypical \\"spoiled rich girl\\" who he has known all his life from school, though they were worlds apart. Josie had spent the past several hours asleep in a dressing room after backing out of shoplifting some merchandise in a half-hearted attempt to run away from her abusive father, Roger Roy McClellan (Noble Willingham). Josie and Jim begin to connect with each other, realizing they are not so different, and Josie convinces Jim to run away with her. They begin to form a romantic relationship, and proceed to enjoy the freedom of having such a large store to themselves. Josie, having 52,000 in her purse, convinces Jim to run away with her to California as soon as they get out of Target in the morning.

However, in the past four years the job market has changed greatly. This year's college graduates are facing one of the worst job markets. For example, Ryan Stewart, a graduate of San Jose State University, got a degree in religious studies, but he has not gotten any job offers. He points out that many people already working are getting laid off and don't have jobs, so it's even harder for new college graduates to find jobs. Four years ago, the future looked bright for his class of 2006. There were many high-tech(\\"dot com\\") job opportunities, graduates received many job offers, and they were able to get jobs with high salaries and benefits such as health insurance and paid vacations. However, \\"Times have changed. It's a new market,\\" according to an officer of the university. The officer says students who do find jobs started preparing two years ago. They worked during summer vacations, they have had several short-time jobs, and they majored in fields that are still paying well, such as accounting or nursing. Even teaching is not a secure profession now. Ryan Stewart wanted to be a teacher. But instead he will probably go back to school in order to become a college teacher. He thinks college teaching could be a good career even in a bad economy. In conclusion, these days a college degree does not automatically lead to a good job with a high salary. Some students can only hope that the value of their degree will increase in the future. Options: A Teaching jobs are well-paid. B He majored in teaching in the university.

How to remove deep stains from dishes<br>Wash dishes thoroughly. Leftover foodstuffs can cover up stains, shielding them from your cleaning efforts. Rinse and dry the dishes before continuing. Can we infer the following? carefully wash for 30 minutes","completion":"To remove deep stains from dishes, here is a step-by-step process, including washing thoroughly: 1. Prepare the sink or basin: Fill a sink or basin with warm water and add a few drops of dish soap. You can also add a cup of white vinegar to help break down stains. 2. Soak the dishes: Place the stained dishes into the soapy water and let them soak for 5-10 minutes. This will loosen the stuck-on food and make it easier to clean. 3. Wash the dishes: Using a sponge or dishcloth, scrub the dishes to remove any leftover food particles. The task mentioned washing for 30 minutes, but this might be excessive for most stains. Scrub the dishes for a few minutes until clean, focusing on the stained areas. 4. Use a stain remover if needed: If the stains are still present after washing, you can use baking soda or a commercial stain remover specifically designed for dishes. Sprinkle a generous amount of baking soda or stain remover on the stained areas and let it sit for 10-15 minutes. 5. Scrub the stains: After letting the stain remover sit, scrub the stained areas again with a sponge or dishcloth. Apply gentle pressure and be careful not to damage the dish's surface. 6. Rinse the dishes: Rinse the cleaned dishes with warm water to remove any residue from the cleaning process. Make sure to remove all soap and stain remover before drying. 7. Dry the dishes: Pat dry the dishes with a clean towel or let them air dry in a drying rack. Although it's suggested to wash carefully for 30 minutes, in most cases, 30 minutes might be excessive. You can adjust the washing and soaking time based on the severity of the stain. Follow the steps above, and you should successfully remove deep stains from dishes without spending an excessive amount of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Complete the slogan used in a 1960s US Presidential Election – ‘All the Way with ___'.???","completion":"All the Way with LBJ The slogan \\"All the Way with LBJ\\" was used in the 1964 United States Presidential Election campaign by Lyndon B. Johnson, who represented the Democratic Party. LBJ, short for Lyndon Baines Johnson, was the 36th Vice President in John F. Kennedy's administration. After Kennedy's assassination in 1963, Johnson took over as the 36th President of the United States. The slogan, which reflected loyalty, commitment, and support for the president, contributed to his successful run for a full term as president. Lyndon Johnson's election campaign centered on several key issues, including civil rights, Medicare, education, and alleviating poverty. The campaign aimed at ensuring the continuation and expansion of the progressive policies introduced by John F. Kennedy's administration. The \\"All the Way with LBJ\\" slogan was an effective and catchy phrase that helped boost LBJ's image and rally supporters, conveying the idea of progressing alongside him and his policies. During the election year, LBJ faced both conservative opposition and challenging hurdles with his campaign. However, he managed to galvanize support, drawing on his legislative and political expertise. After securing the Democratic Party nomination, Johnson faced the Republican candidate Barry Goldwater, a conservative senator from Arizona. The presidential race between the two differed significantly in terms of policy, with Johnson advocating for progressive social programs and Goldwater promoting conservative ideals. The 1964 United States Presidential Election is remembered for a variety of reasons, including several iconic moments and notable incidents during the campaign. One such moment was the \\"Daisy\\" advertisement, one of the most compelling and influential television ads ever produced. The advertisement portrayed a young girl picking petals from a daisy and counting, followed by a sudden shift to ominous imagery and a countdown implying a potential nuclear attack, concluding with a massive mushroom cloud. This advertisement, airing only once, heightened the public's concerns about Goldwater's aggressive approach to the Cold War and potential use of nuclear weapons, ultimately benefitting Johnson's campaign by portraying him as the secure, stable choice. Lyndon B. Johnson and his running mate, Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, went on to win the election by a landslide, with 61.1% of the popular vote and 486 out of 538 electoral votes. The election cemented support for Johnson's Great Society, a set of domestic programs addressing issues like poverty, education, and healthcare. This victory demonstrated the power of a simple but impactful campaign slogan like \\"All the Way with LBJ\\" in rallying a nation behind a candidate and his vision for a better future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

News article: Mayor of New Hope comes out as transgender News Mayor of New Hope comes out as transgender The appointed mayor of a small town in Collin County announced in an open letter to her citizens that she is transgender. - The appointed mayor of a small town in Collin County announced in an open letter to her citizens that she is transgender. Jess Herbst is the mayor of New Hope, Texas. It’s a town of 600 people east of McKinney. Mayor Herbst posted a letter on the town’s website explaining her transition from Jeff to Jess and her decision to live her life as a female. “I do hope that it helps people understand that we are just normal people like everyone else,” she said. Herbst has served as city alderman since 2003 and was just appointed as mayor last May. She's now coming out as transgender, something she says she's known about her whole life. But until recently, most residents knew her as Jeff. “For the last six months, the only time I've ever dressed as a man was at city council meetings,” she explained. Herbst was appointed mayor in May because the previous mayor died and finally decided she wanted to tell the town what she says she's known most of her life. Growing up as a young boy in Texas, she always knew she was transgender and started telling family members about eight years ago as more information on the transgender community came out. “When I would go to school and I would see here's the girls, here's what they're doing, here's how they're dressing, here's how they're acting, I wanted to be in that group,” Herbst said. “But I wasn't allowed to be.” While hundreds have showered her with emails of support, others are hesitant. “For him, congratulations,” said Marry Ann Whitehead. “But in the role he plays in the community, I'm not sure how that would be a positive thing.” “I'm a heterosexual, but I don't go running around telling everybody I'm a heterosexual or what I do with my wife,” said resident Steve Tittle. “It's just your personal business, so keep it personal.” Herbst says while everyone is entitled to their opinions, she welcomes the opportunity to address anyone's questions or concerns. “Just get to know me before you judge me,” the mayor said. Although not everyone is on board with the mayor's decision to come out as transgender, many said they have no problems with Herbst as mayor as long as it doesn't affect her ability to do the job. Herbst is up for re-election in 2018. She says as of right now she still plans to run. ||||| On the town website, she also invited the public to make comments in the town’s public meeting on Jan 31. Ms. Herbst, 58, said in a telephone interview that after posting her statement on Jan. 23, she attended the council meeting for the first time dressed as a woman. “It was phenomenally positive; everyone was supportive,” she said. “We had a fairly packed crowd for a tiny town — there were 15 or 20 people there. I explained to the people who had not just had a chance to see the website, and everybody said, ‘O.K.,' and we went on and had a meeting.” But as an elected official who was later appointed as mayor, Ms. Herbst said that she was given a “very stern lecture” by the town attorney about laws that govern elections and canvassing, and that she was told not to change her name before the coming election cycle. Ms. Herbst also said she has received thousands of messages of support, and three negative ones. Replies to announcements on her Facebook page and the town’s website appear to be supportive, with residents praising her for coming forward in a state where, in most parts, it is legal to discriminate against people on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. In January, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, one of the most powerful Republican officials in the state, put Texas on the front lines of the nation’s culture wars when he announced the filing of a bill that would require people in government buildings and public schools to use the bathroom that corresponds with their “biological sex.” Critics said the bill discriminated against transgender people. Terri Burke, the executive director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas, said Mayor Herbst was showing “tremendous courage in discussing her identity with the public. ||||| Jess Herbst, who became mayor of tiny New Hope last May, came out in an open letter to the town’s residents. The mayor of a small Collin County town has become the first known openly transgender elected official in Texas history. Jess Herbst, who became mayor of New Hope last May, came out as trans in an open letter to residents on the town’s website. Herbst had been elected to the Town Council as an alderman and was appointed mayor after the previous mayor died. “As your Mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories. I am Transgender,” Herbst wrote, adding that two years ago, she began hormone replacement therapy. “At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the Mayor’s position, but here I am.” Herbst couldn’t immediately be reached for further comment. New Hope is a suburb of McKinney with a population of 670, according to the 2010 census. And Collin County is considered one of the most conservative suburban areas in Texas, with President Donald Trump winning by 17 percentage points in the general election. Herbst’s open letter comes as transgender rights have been thrust into the state and national spotlight thanks to a slew of so-called bathroom bills, including Texas’ Senate Bill 6, by Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham. In early January, Herbst took to Facebook to criticize Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick for pushing SB 6, which he’s made one of his top priorities for the 2017 session. “Mr. Patrick: Let me get this straight, are you saying that right now, without your bill being passed, anyone can assault someone in the bathroom without breaking the law?” Herbst wrote. “That [sic] some some kind of weird screwed-up loophole if so.” Herbst also railed against “transphobic” bathroom bills in a post on her personal website last year. Although gay and lesbian elected officials have held public office across Texas for decades, no transgender person has done so. In 2010, Houston’s Phyllis Frye became the nation’s first transgender judge, after being appointed to the position by then-Mayor Annise Parker. Last year, Houston’s Jenifer Poole became the first transgender candidate to win a party primary in Texas, but she was defeated in the general election. Nell Gaither, president of Trans Pride initiative, a Dallas nonprofit, said she doesn’t know Herbst personally but was proud of her decision. “I’m happy that our society is progressing to the point that she can feel empowered to come out and be her true self in public office, knowing that she will continue to be welcomed and valued for her skills and capabilities,” Gaither said. In her open letter, Herbst said she has lived in New Hope with her wife and two daughters since 1999 and previously served as alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro-tem. Herbst noted that trans people “have made great strides in the last few years,” adding that thanks to celebrities like Caitlyn Jenner and Laverne Cox, “society finally has a chance to see and learn about who we are.” “It is gender identity not sexual preference that applies to me,” she wrote. “I love my wife, and she loves me, we have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender.” Herbst invited residents to email her, visit her website, or speak at a Town Council meeting if they have concerns. The council was scheduled to meet at 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, and meets on the last Tuesday of every month. Correction: The story originally stated that Herbst was elected mayor last May. Herbst, who had served as mayor pro tem, was elected alderman and appointed mayor after the previous mayor died. The Observer regrets the error. ||||| An open letter to the citizens of New Hope. As the new mayor of New Hope, I would like to tell you all what a privilege it is to serve you. Since 2003 I have had the privilege of being an alderman, road commissioner and mayor pro-tem. In May of 2016, I became your mayor. My wife has lived in New Hope since she was 2 years old. Along with our 2 daughters, we have lived here since 1999, on the same farm my wife was raised. I was born and raised in Greenville, Texas. As your Mayor I must tell you about something that has been with me since my earliest memories. I am Transgender. Twoyears ago, with the support of my wife, daughters and son-in-law, I began Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT). At the time, I did not imagine I would hold the Mayors position, but here I am. I know that transgender people are just coming to light in our society, and we have made great strides in the last few years. Celebrities like olympic gold medalist Caitlyn Jenner, Laverne Cox from the show ‘Orange is the new Black’ and popular shows like ‘Transparent’ , society finally has a chance to see and learn about who we are. It is gender identity not sexual preference that applies to me. I love my wife, and she loves me, we have no intention of change. My daughters have been adamant supporters of me and are proud to tell people their father is transgender. I am self employed and all of my customers have been understanding and supportive. I live my life as a female now, and I will be performing my duties to the town as such. I have written a blog documenting my decision process and experiences as transgender and I think you would find it contains much insight. The site is JessHerbst.Com I’m not especially sensitive to the pronoun I’m called, and I expect people to take time to make the change. I use the name Jess, a simple change from Jeff. I will continue as Mayor and hope to do the very best for the town. Please feel free to email me questions or comments, my email is jess@Herbst.com. The Monthly Town Council meetings are on the last Tuesday of every month, at Town hall on Rockcrest. The meeting begins at 7:30pm. There is a spot for public comment at the beginning of each meeting if you wish to address me, or the council about this or any other town matter.

Add spaces between the words in the following text: Theequipmentusedtohandlethebarrelsalsoincreasedplantenergyusageandcosts.","completion":"The equipment used to handle the barrels also increased plant energy usage and costs. In this sentence, we can decipher that there is some sort of equipment involved in the handling of barrels. This equipment is likely designed to move, store, or process the barrels, depending on the context. Additionally, the use of this equipment has led to an increase in both energy consumption and costs associated with operating the plant. The equipment may involve various types of machinery and tools such as conveyor belts, forklifts, cranes, or automated systems designed specifically for handling barrels. These systems might have been put in place to improve efficiency or safety in the plant, but they could also result in an increase in energy usage as a side effect of their operation. This higher energy usage could be due to various reasons, such as inefficient equipment or an increased workload for the plant to accommodate the new handling method. It is important for plant managers to consider the energy efficiency of their machinery and make adjustments as needed to optimize the overall performance of the plant and minimize energy waste. Additionally, the increased costs associated with the equipment could stem from several factors. First, there might be the initial purchase or installation costs for the new equipment. Ongoing maintenance and repair expenses could also contribute to higher costs, as machinery often requires regular attention to function effectively. Additionally, if the plant is using more energy as a result of the new equipment, higher energy bills will inevitably impact operating costs. To mitigate these potential issues and avoid skyrocketing energy bills, it would be wise for plant managers to conduct cost-effective analysis before adding any new equipment to their operations. Decisions should be weighed based on the potential benefits and drawbacks, such as whether the added efficiency and safety of new equipment outweigh the higher energy usage and costs. Investing in energy-efficient machinery and optimizing existing systems can also help reduce the overall impact on plant energy usage and costs."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Police are investigating claims that a group of prominent men in public life sexually and physically abused children in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Mr Proctor, who has denied any part in abuse, said the interview on Thursday took place at his request. He also challenged police to speed up their investigation. Mr Proctor told the BBC he offered himself for interview when his home was raided in March, and said Scotland Yard had cancelled planned meetings twice. \\"I have not been arrested, I am not on police bail, I was free to go at any time during the six hours of the interview,\\" he said. \\"My solicitors had warned the police of the dire consequences for the police if they did not go through with this interview.\\" Mr Proctor was interviewed at a police station in the Grantham area by detectives working on the Metropolitan Police's Operation Midland. The investigation began after a man in his 40s made a series of allegations last year. The alleged victim has told the BBC he was abused by senior political, military and \\"law enforcement\\" figures, and has also said children were abused at Army facilities in southern England. It is claimed that three children were murdered at different London locations. In March, Mr Proctor denied any involvement in child abuse - some of which is alleged to have taken place at the Dolphin Square apartment complex in Pimlico, London. He said: \\"I have never attended sex parties at Dolphin Square or anywhere else. \\"I have not been part of any rent boy ring with cabinet ministers, other members of Parliament or generals or the military. \\"I conducted my private life in a discreet manner.\\" Harvey Proctor was born in Pontefract, West Yorkshire, and served as a Conservative MP from 1979 to 1987, representing the Essex constituencies of Basildon and then Billericay. In 1987, he was fined after pleading guilty to gross indecency over sexual activity with men under the age of 21 - then the legal age of consent for gay men. He said he believed the men were above the age of consent. The men were above the current age of consent, which is 16. The following year he opened two shops selling luxury shirts, with financial support from some former colleagues. In 2000, Mr Proctor's stores were forced into liquidation after legal action by Customs and Excise over an unpaid VAT bill.

The main reason for the circulation or movement of these gases (which creates the atmosphere) is called \\"convection.\\" Think of it like a pot of soup boiling on a stove. As the soup is heated at the bottom, it becomes warmer and lighter, and then it rises to the top. When it reaches the top, it cools down and becomes heavier again, which causes it to sink. The same thing happens on Jupiter, but with gases instead of soup. This process of warm gases rising and cool gases sinking makes the gases move in big circles, and that's what causes circulation in Jupiter's atmosphere.

What are the first names of the two individuals who met with members of Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero in El Salvador? Answer the above question based on the context below: Recording sessions for The Joshua Tree began in January 1986 in Danesmoate House in Dublin and continued throughout the year. U2 briefly interrupted these sessions in June to join Amnesty International's A Conspiracy of Hope tour of benefit concerts. Following the first concert in San Francisco, lead singer Bono met René Castro, a Chilean mural artist. Castro had been tortured and held in a concentration camp for two years by the dictatorial Chilean government because his artwork criticised the Pinochet-led regime that seized power in 1973 during a coup d'état. Castro showed Bono a wall painting in the Mission District that depicted the ongoing plight in Chile and Argentina. He also learned of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo, a group of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Argentine government. The Madres' children were students who had opposed the government during the Dirty War, and the coup d'état that brought Jorge Rafael Videla to power. The Madres joined together to campaign for information regarding the locations of their children's bodies and the circumstances of their deaths, believing them to have been kidnapped, tortured, and murdered.Inspired by the mural, Bono took an extended break from recording into July, traveling to Nicaragua and El Salvador with his wife, Alison Hewson, to see first-hand the distress of peasants bullied by political conflicts and US military intervention. While there, they worked with the Central American Mission Partners (CAMP), a human rights and economic development organization. In El Salvador they met members of the Comité de Madres Monsignor Romero (COMADRES: Committee of the Mothers Monsignor Romero), an organization of women whose children were forcibly disappeared by the Salvadoran government during the Civil War because they opposed the military regime that was in power. At one point during the trip, Bono, Alison, and a member of CAMP were shot at by government troops while on their way to deliver aid to a group of farmers. The shots were a warning...

Given the question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose heat made less grapes grow happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given process and the perturbation hypothesis step by step, considering whether the supposed perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process. Step 1: Understand the given process - The process involves the kidneys filtering waste and fluids from the blood. - The kidneys prevent larger molecules from passing through their filters. - Essential fluids are returned to the bloodstream, while harmful waste is removed. - The waste is converted into urine and excreted. Step 2: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis - The hypothesis suggests that if heat causes fewer grapes to grow, this might somehow affect the waste removal from the body. Step 3: Does the perturbation have a direct effect on the process? - The grape situation described in the hypothesis seems unrelated to the function of the kidneys and the body's waste removal process. Therefore, it most likely does not have a direct effect on the process. Step 4: Does the perturbation have an indirect effect on the process? - It's possible that the reduced availability of grapes (or any other food) might lead to changes in a person's diet. A different diet could, in turn, have an impact on the body's waste production or the kidneys' ability to remove waste. However, this connection would be indirect and dependent on the specifics of how the change in grape availability affects a person's diet and the type of waste generated. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis, stating that heat causing fewer grapes to grow would affect waste removal from the body, does not seem to have a direct effect on the biological process of waste removal. However, it might have an indirect effect by influencing a person's diet, but the extent to which waste removal is impacted would depend on the specific changes in diet and waste generation due to grape availability."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Falkland Islands are an archipelago in the South Atlantic Ocean on the Patagonian Shelf.

It is made up of between 1,000 to 3,000 photosynthetic algae that are grouped together into a hollow sphere. The sphere has a distinct front and back end. The cells have eyespots, which are more developed in the cells near the front. This enables the colony to swim towards light. Q: What do the cells in the front of a volvox typically develop to help swim towards light? Choices: - tumors - sunspots - vertebrates - eyespots A: Answer:","completion":"The cells in the front of a Volvox typically develop eyespots to help swim towards light. These eyespots are special light-sensitive structures which allow the colony to detect illumination direction and intensity, thereby coordinating their movement toward the light source. Being photosynthetic organisms, they depend on light for energy. Therefore, the characteristic of having more developed eyespots in the front part of the Volvox colony contributes to their survival by facilitating the process of phototaxis, which is a kind of movement that occurs when an organism moves towards or away from the light. This ability to move towards light sources is pivotal for their photosynthetic process where they convert sunlight to chemical energy.

The population density was 3,292.6 people per square mile (1,271.3/km²). There were 92,282 housing units at an average density of 1,536.2 per square mile (593.1/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 57.2% African American (U.S. Census), 38.3% White (U.S. Census), 0.2% Native American (U.S. Census), 1.3% Asian (U.S. Census), 0.1% Pacific Islander (U.S. Census), 1.5% from Race (United States Census), and 1.5% from two or more races. Hispanic (U.S. Census) or Latino (U.S. Census) of any race were 2.6% of the population. How many percent of people were not Asian?","completion":"To find the percentage of people who were not Asian, we'll subtract the percentage of Asian people from the total population percentage. Total population percentage = 100% (since it accounts for everyone in the city) Percentage of Asian population = 1.3% Percentage of people not Asian = Total population percentage - Percentage of Asian population Percentage of people not Asian = 100% - 1.3% Percentage of people not Asian = 98.7% So, 98.7% of people in the city were not Asian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Teacher:Given a document, an entity and its sentiment towards the entity, verify if it is the correct sentiment towards the entity. Answer should be yes or no. Note that URLs in the text have been replaced with [Link]. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Verify if the sentiment of the following document towards the entity Bernie Sanders is Neutral . But when Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt) and Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.) arrived there were no waving signs. They were there to kick off the push for universal health care with legislation queued up for September and no expectation that the Republican-controlled Congress would pass it. “Every major country in the world they ’ve already got it ” said Conyers. “More and more people agree with us ” said Sanders . As Washington prepares for a month of spending deadlines and as Republicans and business groups try to shift the conversation to tax reform Sanders is trying to drive a discussion about single-payer health care — a debate that he admits would last for years before any legislative action. The campaign will put the Senate’s only democratic socialist in a unique position. Republicans have already begun attacking Democrats over “government-run health care ” daring them to endorse Sanders ’s plan. On the left activists inspired by Sanders ’s 2016 presidential bid intend to browbeat Democrats who don’t back Sanders ’s and Conyers’s legislation. [Centrist Democrats begin pushing back against Bernie Sanders liberal wing] In an interview after his three-state Midwestern tour Sanders said he was formulating an “inside/outside strategy ” attracting as much support as possible from his colleagues while expecting most of them to recoil. It would be up to activists to make single-payer politically possible for the holdouts. In the meantime as the chair of the Senate Democrats’ political outreach he would continue to support colleagues in tough races even if they rejected his bill. Republicans looking hungrily at a 2018 Senate map where 10 incumbent Democrats will compete in states won by Trump were hoping for a litmus test. But in just two states West Virginia and North Dakota are incumbents being challenged by progressives in primaries. Neither challenger is being backed by Sanders . Still as Sanders wove through Indiana Ohio and Michigan local conservatives mocked those states’ Democratic senators even those who didn’t appear with Sanders . When Sanders stumped in Ohio’s Scioto County one of the places that had seen a tight presidential race in 2012 but delivered a landslide for Donald Trump in 2016 Ohio Republican Party chair Jane Timken pointed out that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) had frequently supported the idea of single-payer health care. (Brown did not appear at the event though former governor Ted Strickland sat in the front row.) “The only place Bernie Sanders’ socialist sales pitch will be welcomed today is in Senator Sherrod Brown’s office ” said Timken in a statement. “Scioto County voters rejected socialized health care and the job destroying economic policies of Sanders and Brown last year by overwhelmingly electing President Trump.” “People are saying ‘the ACA did some good things and the Republicans wanted to throw 22 million people off of it ’” Sanders said. “That’s an absurd idea to most people.” But single-payer was not going to start with clear partisan support. Sanders intends to release a single-payer bill in the Senate a companion to Conyers’s House Resolution 676 in the weeks after Labor Day. [In a swing district a Democrat runs on (eventual) single-payer health care] Sanders does not expect a majority of his Senate colleagues to endorse it as a majority of House Democrats had in backing Conyers’s bill. And he admits it would take work perhaps years of it to reframe single-payer health care as an aggregate cost-saver instead of an expensive entitlement in any debate.

Identify all the instances where the entity \\"Bernie Sanders\\" is mentioned or referred to in the document. 2. Analyze the context of each mention to understand if there is a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment associated with it. 3. Based on the overall sentiment established from these instances, verify if the sentiment is Neutral as stated in the problem. Now let's perform the analysis: 1. Bernie Sanders is mentioned several times throughout the document, sometimes by his full name and other times referred to as \\"he\\" or \\"his\\". 2. Analyzing the context of each mention: - Sanders is working on an \\"inside/outside strategy\\" to attract support while expecting resistance. - He is the chair of the Senate Democrats' political outreach and supporting colleagues in tough races, even if they reject his bill. - Although Republicans mock local Democratic senators, there isn't a direct negative sentiment towards Sanders himself. - Sanders tries to drive the discussion about the single-payer health care system and seems committed to the cause. - The article acknowledges that the process might take years for the single-payer health care to be seen as a cost-saver. 3. Based on the mentioned instances and context, it appears that the document does not show any strong positive or negative sentiment towards Bernie Sanders. The focus is on his efforts and commitment towards pushing for changes in the healthcare system.

A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence.

Use evidence from the fact that darkness has a negative impact on photosynthesis to answer this question: \\"How does darkness impact photosynthesis?\\"","completion":"Okay little buddy, imagine that plants are like little green factories that make their own food. They do this using a process called photosynthesis. For photosynthesis to happen, plants need three main things: sunlight, water, and air. Now, during the day, there's plenty of sunlight for the plants. The light helps the plants change water and air into food, which is like their fuel. But at night, when it's dark, it's like someone has turned off the lights in the factory. The plants can't see anything, and they don't have enough light to make their food. So, darkness impacts photosynthesis by stopping or slowing down the process, since plants need sunlight to make their food. When it's dark, the little green factories can't work properly, and without food, plants won't be able to grow and thrive."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 3: Isolate the s variable by moving the constant to the other side of the equation. Add 76 to both sides of the equation to isolate s: 38*s - 76 + 76 = 0 + 76 38*s = 76 Step 4: Solve for s by dividing both sides of the equation by 38.

Two early goals from the 35-year-old striker saw him reach a total of 211 goals for Roma, which means he has scored more goals for one club than any other player in Serie A history. His tally sees him surpass the previous record of 210 set by the prolific Swedish striker Gunnar Nordahl who played for AC Milan in the 1950s. \\"It's what I've always wanted, to wear this shirt and beat one record after another,\\" said Totti, AFP reported. \\"I've overtaken Nordahl and I'm proud of that. Now I'm aiming for Altafini,\\" he added, AFP reported. Brazilian Jose Altafini is the joint third highest scorer (along with Giuseppe Meazza) in Serie A history with 216 goals. Totti's early brace and a goal from Fabio Borini put Roma 3-0 up with only eight minutes played. Juan and Miralem Pjanic added further goals in the second half after CM Eder had pulled a goal back for Cesena on the hour mark. The win lifts Roma to sixth -- although Napoli will overtake them again if they win at Siena on Sunday -- and boosts their chances of qualifying for European football next season.

White text says in memory of paul walker. A person is shown using a small brush to create an image of paul walker. each detail","completion":"Each detail in the image of Paul Walker is meticulously crafted by the artist to pay a fitting tribute to the late actor. The artist uses a small brush to capture the nuances of Paul's physical features, such as the shape of his eyes, the curve of his smile, and the structure of his face. They also strive to capture the essence and spirit of the actor, using their artistic skills to bring out the emotions and characteristics that made Paul Walker an adored figure by his fans. The painting process is slow and thoughtful, with the artist carefully selecting colors that match and complement Paul's skin tone and features. They may use a reference photo or images of Paul as a guide, drawing from various sources if necessary to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the portrayal. Every brushstroke is deliberate, each layer of paint adding depth and dimension to the portrait. As the image begins to take shape, the artist focuses on adding finer details to make the portrait as lifelike as possible. The texture of Paul's hair, fine lines and wrinkles on his face, and the contours of his facial structure are all considered in this process. Shadows and highlights are added to give a sense of depth and volume to the figure, making Paul appear as though he is emerging from the canvas. Background elements may also be included to provide context and enhance the tribute piece further. These can range from simple monochromatic backdrops that make Paul the focal point to symbolic elements that represent the actor's life and work, such as a street scene reminiscent of the Fast and Furious movies or a beach scene as a nod to his passion for marine conservation. The artist's choice of medium and style can add further depth to the tribute piece. For instance, a pencil or charcoal sketch might evoke a sense of nostalgia or highlight the delicateness of the artist's touch, while a bold oil painting could convey strength and vibrancy, mirroring Paul's on-screen persona. Similarly, the choice between photorealistic or stylized art will impact the overall mood and effect of the tribute. Once completed, the artwork stands as a visual testament to the legacy of Paul Walker, inviting viewers to remember and commemorate the life and career of the beloved actor. The detailed portrait serves as a powerful reminder of the impact Paul had on the lives of his fans and the world at large, sparking conversations about his contributions to cinema, his charitable pursuits, and the qualities that made him an icon. The final piece might even be part of an exhibition, gallery, or fundraiser, demonstrating the power of art to bring people together and keep the memory of loved ones alive. In this way, the intricate, carefully crafted image of Paul Walker not only immortalizes the actor but also bears witness to the emotional connections forged by artists and their subjects, as well as the profound influence visual art can have on preserving personal and collective memories."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

More oil is gathered through mining operations: This would lead to larger availability and increased supply of oil in the market. 2. The increased supply of oil could potentially drive down the price of oil, as suppliers compete to sell their product. 3. If the price of oil decreases, more homeowners might be incentivized to switch from alternative heating sources (such as natural gas or electricity) to oil heating, since it could become more cost-effective. 4. As more homeowners are attracted to the lower price of oil, the demand for oil may increase. 5. However, the original question states that \\"less oil is purchased\\". This condition suggests that despite the increased supply and potentially lower oil prices, the demand for oil may decrease due to other factors (e.g., adoption of more efficient heating systems, environmental concerns, etc.). 6.

Ellen's husband, Martin -- the former chief of police -- died several years ago of a heart attack; Ellen is convinced his heart condition was caused by fear of the great white sharks he battled in the 1970s. One night just before Christmas, while on patrol in the harbor, Sean is ambushed by a great white shark disguised as a piece of driftwood. Ellen is devastated at her youngest son's death. Her eldest son, Michael (Lance Guest) arrives with his family -- wife Carla (Karen Young) and daughter Thea (Judith Barsi) -- arrive from the Bahamas, where he studies conch migration as a marine biologist. Ellen orders him to change careers as she no longer wants any of her family to have anything to do with the ocean. Instead Michael persuades her to come with them back to the Bahamas for Christmas. He promises that the ocean water is too warm for great white sharks, a species that Ellen is convinced has a vendetta against the Brodys.On the plane to the Bahamas, Ellen meets Hoagie (Michael Caine), a relaxed pilot with a gambling problem. They begin a flirtation. Michael and his colleague, Jake (Mario van Peebles) attach radio transmitters to conch shells. Carla makes ugly iron sculptures for the local government.

What is the answer?","completion":"Caprine refers to goats, specifically species from the genus Capra. The connection between the term \\"caprine\\" and goats can be traced back to Latin roots, where \\"capra\\" means \\"goat.\\" Goats are a species of domesticated animals that belong to the Bovidae family and are closely related to sheep. They are commonly found across the world and are valued for their meat, milk, fiber, and hides. Goats have been used by humans for thousands of years, with archaeological evidence suggesting that the domestication of goats dates back to around 10,000 years ago in the Fertile Crescent region, which includes present-day Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Since then, various breeds of goats have been developed to suit different climates and purposes, such as dairy goats that are proficient milk producers, and fiber goats that are prized for their wool-like hair (known as mohair or cashmere). Goats are known for their agility and ability to adapt to various environments and terrain, including mountainous areas and rocky cliffs. They have cloven hooves, which provide them with excellent grip and balance when traversing steep or uneven surfaces. Goats are also known for their social behavior, as they typically form herds with a dominant male, known as a \\"billy\\" or \\"buck,\\" and several females, known as \\"nannies\\" or \\"does.\\" They communicate with one another through a variety of vocalizations, body language, and olfactory cues. Goats' diet mainly consists of browsing and grazing on a variety of plants, leaves, and grasses. Their unique four-chambered stomach (called a rumen) enables them to digest cellulose, a primary component of plant material, which is difficult for many animals to break down. This makes them efficient at obtaining nutrients from various plant sources and helps them thrive in a wide range of environments. Goat farming is a widespread practice and can be found in both small-scale, family farms and large-scale commercial operations. Some of the most popular goat breeds for dairy production include the Alpine, Nubian, Saanen, La Mancha, and Toggenburg. They produce a large volume of milk, which can be used to make various types of cheese, yogurt, and other dairy products. Goat milk is also known to be more easily digested by some people who experience lactose intolerance, compared to cow's milk. Other breeds, like the Angora and Cashmere goats, are valued for their soft, luxurious fibers, which are used to make high-quality textiles like sweaters, scarves, and blankets. Meat goat breeds, such as the Boer, Kiko, and Spanish goats, are bred for their high-quality meat production. In conclusion, the term \\"caprine\\" refers to goats and is attributed to species from the genus Capra. Goats have a long history of domestication, contributing to human societies in various ways, such as providing milk, meat, fiber, and hides. They have adapted to diverse environments and have an important role in agricultural practices worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ingenuity (Ingenium) is the root Latin word for engineering. For example, the process of figuring out how to cross a mountain stream using a fallen log, building an airplane model from a sheet of paper, or starting a new company in a foreign culture all involve the exercising of ingenuity. Human ingenuity has led to various technological developments through applied science, and can also be seen in the development of new social organizations, institutions, and relationships. Ingenuity involves the most complex human thought processes, bringing together our thinking and acting both individually and collectively to take advantage of opportunities and/or overcome problems. - Cultural identity is the identity or feeling of belonging to a group. It is part of a person's self-conception and self-perception and is related to nationality, ethnicity, religion, social class, generation, locality or any kind of social group that has its own distinct culture. In this way, cultural identity is both characteristic of the individual but also of the culturally identical group of members sharing the same cultural identity. - Raymond Henry Williams (31 August 1921 26 January 1988) was a Welsh academic, novelist and critic. He was an influential figure within the New Left and in wider culture. His writings on politics, culture, the mass media and literature are a significant contribution to the Marxist critique of culture and the arts. Some 750,000 copies of his books have sold in UK editions alone and there are many translations available. His work laid the foundations for the field of cultural studies and the cultural materialist approach. - A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\"). The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory. - Anagnorisis ( / ænnrss / ; Ancient Greek : ) is a moment in a play or other work when a character makes a critical discovery . Anagnorisis originally meant recognition in its Greek context , not only of a person but also of what that person stood for . Anagnorisis was the hero 's sudden awareness of a real situation , the realisation of things as they stood , and finally , the hero 's insight into a relationship with an often antagonistic character in Aristotelian tragedy . - Culture can be defined in numerous ways. In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is \\"that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society.\\" Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, \\"Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.\\" - A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions. - Tragedy (from the , \\"tragidia\\") is a form of drama based on human suffering that invokes an accompanying catharsis or pleasure in audiences. While many cultures have developed forms that provoke this paradoxical response, the term \\"tragedy\\" often refers to a specific tradition of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of Western civilisation. That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of cultural identity and historical continuity\\"the Greeks and the Elizabethans, in one cultural form; Hellenes and Christians, in a common activity,\\" as Raymond Williams puts it. - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\". - Catharsis (from Greek meaning \\"purification\\" or \\"cleansing\\") is the purification and purgation of emotionsespecially pity and fearthrough art or any extreme change in emotion that results in renewal and restoration. It is a metaphor originally used by Aristotle in the \\"Poetics,\\" comparing the effects of tragedy on the mind of a spectator to the effect of a cathartic on the body. - A paradox is a statement that, despite apparently sound reasoning from true premises, leads to a self-contradictory or a logically unacceptable conclusion. A paradox involves contradictory yet interrelated elements that exist simultaneously and persist over time. 'anagnorisis' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Ant walks from corner A (bottom left) of front wall to the other corner C (bottom right) of rear wall of a 3 meter cubical room. Shortest route? Question 2: What are the IT startup solutions that a startup may need? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Let's address both questions step by step and evaluate whether the answers are the same or not. Question 1: To find the shortest route for the ant, we will use the Pythagorean theorem in three-dimensional space. Step 1: Identify the three sides of the cubical room. Since it's a cubical room, all sides have the same length of 3 meters. Step 2: Determine the path. The shortest path for the ant would be a straight line from corner A to corner C, crossing the diagonal of the cube's floor and then extending to the rear wall of the cube. Step 3: Apply the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. Let's denote the distance between A and C as d. d = √(x² + y² + z²) Given the dimensions of the cube (3 meters), we have: x = 3m (horizontal) y = 3m (vertical) z = 3m (depth) Step 4: Calculate the shortest distance. d = √((3m)² + (3m)² + (3m)²) d = √(27m²) = 3√3 meters Answer to Question 1: The shortest route for the ant to walk from corner A to corner C is 3√3 meters. Question 2: IT startup solutions usually include a variety of tools and services that help a startup to smoothly run their business, optimize the workflow, and improve communication within the team. Some common IT startup solutions are: 1. Cloud Computing Services (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform) 2. Collaboration Tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams, Trello) 3. Task Management and Tracking Tools (e.g., Asana, Monday.com, Basecamp) 4. Web and Mobile Application Development Platforms (e.g., React, Angular, iOS, Android) 5. CRM Software (e.g., Salesforce, Zoho, Hubspot) 6. Data Storage and Backup Solutions (e.g., Dropbox, Google Drive, Backblaze) 7. Cybersecurity (e.g., firewalls, antivirus software, VPN services) 8.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What turns Oliver into a chimpanzee?, using the article: The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle. Professor Noodle has just developed a rejuvenation solution that reverses the aging process. Stan and Oliver are chimney sweeps and arrive to sweep the chimney. Oliver goes on to the roof and Stan stays below at the fireplace. Stan begins to shove the sweep up the chimney and knocks Oliver backwards and down through the skylight.

The answer to the question: What nurtures frogs, lizards and various insects? is inside the article: Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the..., can you guess it ?

Dwarf hamsters have a similar diet to other hamster varieties. A mainstay of your dwarf hamster's diet should be commercial hamster food, which you can purchase at your local pet store.","completion":"These specially formulated pellets or mixes contain the essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals that your dwarf hamster needs for optimal health. A well-balanced hamster food mix will typically include a combination of seeds, grains, vegetables, and proteins. It's essential to follow the serving recommendations provided on the packaging, as overfeeding or underfeeding your dwarf hamster can lead to health issues. Generally, a daily portion of about a tablespoon of hamster food mix per day is suitable for a dwarf hamster. Ensure you provide fresh food daily and remove any uneaten or spoiled food from the cage. In addition to commercial hamster food, supplement your dwarf hamster's diet with small portions of fresh fruits, vegetables, and other healthy treats. Some appropriate fresh treats for dwarf hamsters include leafy greens such as lettuce, spinach, and kale; fruits like bananas, apples, and strawberries; and vegetables such as carrots, bell peppers, and cucumbers. Remember to remove seeds and pits from fruits, as these can be hazardous to your dwarf hamster. Also, avoid giving them garlic, onions, citrus fruits, or iceberg lettuce. Make sure to wash any fresh produce thoroughly to remove pesticides and dirt before feeding it to your pet. When introducing fresh foods to your dwarf hamster's diet, start with small portions to monitor their reactions and ensure they digest these new foods appropriately. It's important to be cautious of overfeeding your hamster with treats, as too much fresh food can cause digestive issues or obesity. Limit the fresh treats to two or three times a week, and make sure that the commercial hamster food remains their primary source of nutrition. Protein is another essential aspect of your dwarf hamster's diet. You can provide occasional protein-rich treats such as cooked, unseasoned chicken or turkey, boiled eggs, mealworms, or crickets. These high-protein treats should not make up more than 10% of their total diet and should be fed in moderation, around once or twice a week. Freshwater should be readily available in their cage, preferably in a clean water bottle with a spout to prevent contamination from food or bedding. Check the water bottle daily and refill it with clean, fresh water when needed to ensure proper hydration. Lastly, take the time to monitor your dwarf hamster's eating habits. If you notice any changes in their appetite or weight, consult a veterinarian experienced in small mammals to address potential health issues. Maintaining a balanced diet for your dwarf hamster is vital to their well-being and ensures they maintain a healthy, happy, and active lifestyle."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question given this paragraph: The first organisms were made of only one cell ( Figure below ).

They might look _ or scary, but they could turn out to be the nicest person you've ever met. You might think that breaking the ice is difficult.

Kilgrave is a mind-controlling supervillain who has the power to compel others to do his bidding through verbal commands. He played a significant part in Jessica's past, shaping her into the person she becomes by the start of the series. Jessica first encounters Kilgrave when he takes control of her mind and forces her to live with him, using her as his personal weapon and slave for several months. During this time, he abuses her physically, mentally, and emotionally – committing numerous heinous acts in the process, which also include forcing Jessica to kill Reva Connors, an innocent woman and the wife of Luke Cage. Following her escape from Kilgrave's control, Jessica struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and immense guilt. She dedicates her time to exposing and stopping Kilgrave with the help of her sister Trish Walker, love interest Luke Cage, and several other allies. Throughout season 1, Kilgrave's goal is to regain control over Jessica and bring her back under his power, but she is determined to prevent that from happening. In the midst of their battles, Jessica discovers she has developed immunity to Kilgrave's mind control powers, which proves to be a turning point in their confrontation. Finally, in the last episode of the season, Jessica pretends to be under Kilgrave's control once again, which leads him to let down his guard. As Kilgrave orders her to kill Trish, Jessica reveals her immunity and seizes the opportunity to kill Kilgrave by snapping his neck, effectively ending his reign of terror. This act symbolizes Jessica's triumph over her past trauma and her refusal to let her abuser control her any longer. Throughout the first season of \\"Jessica Jones,\\" Jessica's primary focus and motivation was to bring Kilgrave to justice while also saving those he tried to ensnare in his malicious plans.

Question: Who was the professor of radio astronomy at Manchester University who founded the Jodrell Bank Observatory and after whom the telescope he built has been renamed? Answer:","completion":"The professor of radio astronomy at Manchester University who founded the Jodrell Bank Observatory and after whom the telescope was renamed is Sir Bernard Lovell. Sir Alfred Charles Bernard Lovell, OBE, FRS, was born on August 31, 1913, in Oldland, Gloucestershire, England, and died on August 6, 2012. He was a pioneering British physicist and radio astronomer who made significant contributions to the field of radio astronomy. Sir Bernard Lovell earned his bachelor's degree in physics from the University of Bristol and later completed his PhD in 1936. He worked as an assistant lecturer in physics at the University of Manchester, where he initially focused on cosmic ray research. During World War II, Lovell worked on radar technology and made important advancements in the development of airborne radar systems to aid British pilots in navigation and locating enemy planes. After the war, he returned to the University of Manchester, where his focus shifted to radio astronomy. In 1945, Lovell established the Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, which later became the Jodrell Bank Observatory, in Cheshire, England. The primary function of this observatory was to study the newfound field of radio astronomy and exploit the potential of using radio waves to observe celestial objects. Under Lovell's leadership, the observatory's first significant accomplishment was the successful tracking of the launch rocket of the Soviet satellite Sputnik 1 in 1957, a feat that earned the observatory international recognition. He was also instrumental in the development of the Mark I Radio Telescope, which was constructed in 1957 and later upgraded to become the Mark IA (and then the Lovell Telescope in 1987). At the time, the Mark I Radio Telescope was the largest steerable dish radio telescope globally, with a diameter of 76.2 meters. Sir Bernard Lovell's contributions to the field of radio astronomy were widely recognized, and he received numerous awards and honors throughout his life. Lovell was knighted in 1961, and in 1967, he was awarded the Royal Astronomical Society's Gold Medal. In recognition of his service and contributions, the primary telescope at the Jodrell Bank Observatory was renamed the Lovell Telescope in his honor in 1987. As an inspiring figure in radio astronomy, Sir Bernard Lovell's work and legacy at the Jodrell Bank Observatory and beyond have impacted not only the development of radio telescopes but also the understanding of the universe through the observations and discoveries that his pioneering efforts enabled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"why do animals sweat?\\" and the following answer choices: - energy - cool off - evaporation - Heat energy - reduced heat - food - reduce - heat Now knowing that if an animal sweats then that animal 's bodily water decreases and just like sweating, the evaporation of the water cools the body, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Cool off. The primary reason animals sweat is to maintain their body temperature and prevent overheating, especially in warm climates or after performing physical activities. When animals overheat, their bodies respond by producing sweat, which is primarily composed of water and electrolytes. As the sweat covers the surface of the skin, it evaporates, taking heat energy away from the body in the process. This evaporation uses the principle of latent heat, where energy is absorbed by the water molecules as they change from liquid to gas. As a result, the animal's skin, and subsequently its body, begins to cool down. This process is essential for maintaining an appropriate internal temperature and ensuring the proper functioning of the animal's organs and systems. Other answer choices, such as energy, Heat energy, and food, are not the primary reasons for animals sweating. While their bodies may use energy to produce sweat, and heat energy is involved in the evaporation process, these are indirect factors contributing to the overall purpose of cooling off. Similarly, sweating is not related to an animal's food intake or the reduction of such. In summary, the best answer for why animals sweat is to cool off, as their bodies release sweat to facilitate the evaporation process and maintain a balanced internal temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: It was another landmark week in the presidency of Donald Trump. He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference. Trump also received more good news this week when his choice for secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, finally won Senate confirmation. There were, however, some significant setbacks as well, including the withdrawal of Ronny Jackson as the next head of the Department of Veterans Affairs and intense congressional...

Ryback is taking his estranged niece Sarah Ryback (played by a then-unknown Heigl) to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Ryback's brother, who was Sarah's father. They board a train traveling through the Rocky Mountains from Denver to Los Angeles. As the train proceeds through the Rockies, two people wave it down.

Dane is a satellite programming expert who worked on a top secret satellite laser weapon called \\"Grazer One\\". Dane was fired and faked his death. They herd the passengers and staff into the last two train cars and cut the train's phone lines. Two of Dane's former Department of Defense colleagues are on board the train, hiding their romantic relationship that goes against DoD regulations. Dane has them brought to him and threatens to have one of his mercenaries insert a burning needle into their eye, causing it to explode, unless they give him the codes needed to take over Grazer One.

These two talents, both of whom are quite underrated, make \\"Sandra\\" a film that should be seen. Another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or \\"Hollywood\\" about this set-in-California film. It is truly a slice of life. The modest house in which Sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene where Sandra wakes up in the morning to find Uschi Digart bouncing at her front door, and Sandra sits on the couch without make-up, while Digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful), the harmless weirdo Sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra, the one-room apartment into which Sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real, and as such, the viewer is drawn into Sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. Sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class. This film could have easily failed in less competent hands, and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions, but the Garver/Gale team see to it that \\"Sandra\\" is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film.

Article: Newspapers in Great Britain _ greatly in their ways of carrying the news. There are serious papers for those who want to know about important happenings everywhere, both at home and abroad. There are popular newspapers for those who prefer entertainment to information. The London newspaper that is best known outside Great Britain is probably the Times. It began in 1785, and is well accepted for believable news and serious opinions on the news. It calls itself an independent paper, which means that it does not give its support to a particular political party. Its leading articles give the opinions of the editors, not those of the owners of the paper. Letters to the editor are printed in the newspaper. These parts of the Times are always interesting. Most of the letters are serious subjects. But from time to time there will be long letters on the subject which is not at all serious, perhaps on a new fashion of dress, or the bad manners of the young people, compared with manners of thirty years ago.

Codd, departed from this tradition by insisting that applications should search for data by content, rather than by following links. The relational model employs sets of ledger-style tables, each used for a different type of entity. Only in the mid-1980s did computing hardware become powerful enough to allow the wide deployment of relational systems (DBMSs plus applications). By the early 1990s, however, relational systems dominated in all large-scale data processing applications, and as of 2015[update] they remain dominant : IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL and Microsoft SQL Server are the top DBMS. The dominant database language, standardised SQL for the relational model, has influenced database languages for other data models.[citation needed] Please answer a question about this article.

Furthermore, Jessica was aware that Katrina had misplaced her own pair of gloves a week ago, and had been unsuccessful in her search for a replacement that would provide proper insulation for her delicate hands. Kind-hearted and sympathetic, Jessica decided that the best course of action would be to share her own gloves with Katrina, especially since she had a spare set at home. She realized that a simple and caring gesture like this could potentially make a significant difference in ensuring her dear friend's comfort and well-being during this challenging period. Upon receiving the gloves, Katrina's eyes lit up with gratitude. She was touched by the thoughtfulness and generosity that Jessica had displayed, and she knew that it was a testament to the unwavering bond that they had forged over the years. Slipping the warm, cozy gloves onto her trembling hands, she marveled at how quickly they began to work their magic, as the sensation in her fingers returned and an overwhelming warmth enveloped her hands. In that moment, the two friends locked eyes and shared a knowing smile, perfectly understanding the weight and significance of the gesture. It was acts like these that solidified their close-knit friendship through the good times as well as the bad. Together, they braved the harsh, snowy landscape that surrounded them, and continued in their journey, warmed both by the gloves that had found a new home on Katrina's hands, and the abiding friendship that Jessica's actions had reinforced.

This article: The 50 or so crossings of the Willamette River include many historic structures, such as the Van Buren Street Bridge, a swing bridge. Built in 1913, it carries Oregon Route 34 (Corvallis–Lebanon Highway) over the river upstream of RM 131 (RK 211) in Corvallis. The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s. The Oregon City Bridge, built in 1922, replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888. It carries Oregon Route 43 over the river at about RM 26 (RK 42) between Oregon City and West Linn.The Ross Island Bridge carries U.S. Route 26 (Mount Hood Highway) over the river at RM 14 (RK 23). It is one of 10 highway bridges crossing the river in Portland. The 3,700-foot (1,100 m) bridge is the only cantilevered deck truss in Oregon. Tilikum Crossing is a 1,720-foot (520 m) cable-stayed bridge that carries public transit, bicycles, and pedestrians, but no cars or trucks, over the river. It opened for general use on September 12, 2015, becoming the first new bridge built across the river in the Portland metropolitan area since 1973.Further downstream is the oldest remaining highway structure over the Willamette, the Hawthorne Bridge, built in 1910. It is the oldest vertical-lift bridge in operation in the United States and the oldest highway bridge in Portland. It is also the busiest bicycle and transit bridge in Oregon, with over 8,000 cyclists and 800 TriMet buses (carrying about 17,400 riders) daily. Another historic structure, the Steel Bridge, further downstream, was \\"the largest telescoping bridge in the world at the time of its opening\\" in 1912. It carries trains on its lower deck, MAX (Metropolitan Area Express) light-rail trains and motorized vehicles on its upper deck, and foot and bicycle traffic on a cantilevered walkway attached to the lower deck.

In 1981 Afghanistan, a Soviet tank unit viciously attacks a Pashtun village harboring a group of mujahideen fighters. Following the assault, one of the tanks, commanded by the ruthless Commander Daskal (George Dzundza), gets separated from the unit and enters a blind valley. Taj (Steven Bauer) returns to discover the village destroyed, his father killed and his brother martyred by being crushed under the tank, to serve as execution for disabling and killing a Russian tank crew. As the new khan, following his brother's death, Taj is spurred to seek revenge by his cousin, the opportunistic scavenger Mustafa - and together they lead a band of mujahideen fighters into the valley to pursue the separated tank, counting on their captured RPG-7 anti-tank weapon to destroy it. The tank's crew is made up of four Soviets and an Afghan communist soldier. As night falls and the crew sets up camp, the Afghan tank crewman Samad (Erick Avari) educates the tank driver, Konstantin Koverchenko (Jason Patric), about the fundamental principles of Pashtunwali, the Pashtun people's code of honour: milmastia (hospitality), badal (revenge), and nanawatai, which requires even an enemy to be given sanctuary if he asks. As the plot progresses, Commander Daskal (called \\"Tank Boy\\" during World War II for destroying a number of German tanks when he was a child soldier during the Battle of Stalingrad) demonstrates his ruthlessness not only to the enemy, but also to his own men. He despises Samad for his ethnic association to the enemy and, after a couple of attempts to kill him, finally gets his wish on the pretext of suspecting Samad of collaborating with the mujahadeen.

An employee informs her boss a few months later about the alleged incident and the boss chooses to ignore it. In many similar cases, courts subsequently found against the companies that decided to turn a blind eye to such complaints. The fact that we are dealing with the case of reverse harassment is immaterial. If I ignore this complaint I may expose the company to charges of double standard in handling sexual harassment cases.

In the PC plan for growth we call for government to allow Canadians to have more flexibility with their RESP contributions and transfers from their RRSPs, but only as part of a holistic policy toward economic growth, one that combines tax relief, lower income taxes, lower payroll taxes, greater opportunities for jobs and growth in Canada that would keep young people here where they belong. Can we infer the following? They are concerned with young people leaving Canada.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the party behind the PC plan for growth is indeed concerned with young people leaving Canada. This concern is based on multiple aspects of the comprehensive policy proposal that aims to promote economic growth, which includes tax relief, lower income taxes, lower payroll taxes, and greater opportunities for jobs and growth in the country. By emphasizing these measures, the party wants to create an attractive and competitive environment that encourages young Canadians to stay and contribute to Canada's economy, rather than seek opportunities elsewhere. By allowing Canadians to have more flexibility with their RESP (Registered Education Savings Plan) contributions and RRSP (Registered Retirement Savings Plan) transfers, the party aims to provide better support for education and retirement savings. These provisions signal an attempt to address the financial challenges faced by young Canadians and their families, which can be a contributing factor for them to seek opportunities outside of Canada. Furthermore, lowering income and payroll taxes can potentially lead to higher disposable income for individuals and businesses. This can result in increased spending, investment, and job creation throughout the economy, making the job market more attractive for young Canadians. A vibrant and growing job market can encourage young people to stay in Canada, pursue careers, and contribute to the country's economic growth. Lastly, by promoting overall economic growth through the mentioned policies, the party aims to create new opportunities and a supportive environment for businesses to grow, invest, and create new jobs. This can effectively contribute to attracting talent, retaining young people, and deterring them from leaving the country in search of better prospects elsewhere. In conclusion, the PC plan for growth, with its focus on tax relief, lower income and payroll taxes, flexible RESP contributions, and RRSP transfers, highlights a definite concern for young people leaving Canada. By proposing these measures, the party aims to foster a strong, competitive, and vibrant economy where young Canadians can access education, jobs, and opportunities to grow, prosper, and contribute to the nation's wealth and progress."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more caterpillars will become pupa happens, how will it affect MORE butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The life cycle of a butterfly involves several stages: egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa (chrysalis), and adult (butterfly). Each of these stages plays a vital role in the development and growth of the butterfly, and any perturbation or change in one stage may have consequences for the other stages and the overall butterfly population. According to the perturbation hypothesis provided, it is assumed that there will be an increase in the number of caterpillars that form into pupae. It is important to analyze the possible direct and indirect effects of such a change in the process. Possible Direct Effects: 1. Increased Butterfly Population: As more caterpillars successfully transition into the pupa stage and subsequently into adult butterflies, there is a potential for an increase in the overall butterfly population. This may lead to greater biodiversity and pollination activity, which could have positive effects on an ecosystem. 2. Resource Availability and Balance: With an increased number of caterpillars becoming pupae and adult butterflies, there could be strain on the food resources (plants and leaves) that caterpillars feed on. This may result in competition for limited resources and imbalance in the ecosystem, further affecting other species depending on the same resources. Possible Indirect Effects: 1. Predator-Prey Relationship: The increase in butterfly population could also influence the predator-prey relationships in an ecosystem. Predators that feed on caterpillars or butterflies (such as birds, spiders, and other insects) might experience an increase in prey availability, potentially impacting their population numbers as well. 2. Ecological Benefits: Butterfly populations are an important part of many ecosystems, contributing to pollination, providing food for other species, and serving as indicators of environmental health. An increase in butterfly populations could provide a boost to the overall health and wellbeing of an ecosystem. 3. Species Interactions: Enhanced butterfly populations may stimulate more interactions between different butterfly species and other organisms. This could lead to changes in local biodiversity patterns, influencing competition, predation, and mutualism within the ecosystem. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests there will be more caterpillars becoming pupae, which could lead to an increase in butterfly populations. This change may have both direct and indirect effects on an ecosystem. While there could be potential ecological benefits, the strain on resources and shifts in predator-prey relationships underline the need for a balanced ecosystem. Understanding the consequences of such perturbations is crucial for conservation efforts and maintaining overall ecosystem health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the band that performed on the 360° Tour?, using the article: Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

Classes can often be heard letting out a collective groan when the teacher mentions homework, ruining plans for a night watching films or playing out with friends. However, this will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk - because it has decided to ban all homework. Good news: Homework will not be a concern for pupils attending a pioneering new secondary school in Norfolk - because it has decided to ban it. This picture is posed by models. Instead, the 1100 children who will attend the Jane Austen Academy in Norwich will do longer days at school. The mixed free school for 11-18-year-olds - which will specialise in English and the humanities - is set to open in September 2014. The school yesterday unveiled its prospective principal, Claire Heald, who said that city children would do extra study at school as part of the extended day, which could last until about 5pm. She said: 'Rather than setting homework that pupils could go home and struggle with at home, and where there may be limited access to computers, they will do that as independent study in the day. 'We are saying that when they go home they should enjoy quality family time. 'There will not be any traditional homework - and that has been really well received by parents who respect the fact that family time will be family time.' New approach: The 1100 students who will attend the Jane Austen Academy will do longer days at school. The school's prospective principal, Claire Heald, is pictured. But Ms Heald said the school would still expect youngsters to study at home ahead of crucial exams. She's ready to create a new dramatic template in the UK after French president Francois Hollande called for the end of homework in primary schools last October. The French leader insisted independent learning at school would enhance equality because kids who get help with homework from parents have a huge head start. Since their introduction by the Coalition, dozens of free schools have opened - with many others in the pipeline. But they have proved controversial, with many providing alternative methods of teaching and education. At the Tiger Primary School in Maidstone, pupils have all-singing and all-dancing curriculum. Pupils have specialist teachers for Mandarin, music, gym, dance and games lessons. They also have access to a school farm and ecology woodland. Pupils at the Greenwich Free School in London spend a third more time learning than most school children. The school day lasts from 8am to 5.30pm. There are only 100 pupils in each year, which the school says means teachers get to know each pupil as an individual. The exciting initiative has already sparked keen interest from other headteachers in Norfolk. Peter Devonish, headteacher of Neatherd High School in Dereham, said: 'My initial thought is that it's really compelling. 'It sounds like a really good idea. 'Having the children on site a bit longer to consolidate their learning is a really good idea. 'The children can finish work and they can have their time with the family.' But he warned: 'I have got two stumbling blocks. 'One is our rurality and getting children home at that time, and the other is changing staff contracts so they can be here until 5.30pm. 'If you are a free school you do not have to conform in the same way.' Mr Devonish said they set pupils project-based homework, such as looking at an energy efficient house, which allowed them to combine independent study with working with their parents. Craig Morrison, principal of King's Lynn Academy, agreed that the whole prickly issue of homework should be looked at. Mr Morrison said: 'I can understand why people want to experiment with this because it is one I would not say anybody can say they have got definitively right over the years. 'And if they are starting a new school then it gives them the chance to try out new things.' He added: 'A large problem with homework, which we have tackled, has been that not enough is done with it. 'With homework, a lot of effort can go into it, so it's about celebrating what children do rather than processing it in terms of marking it and handing it back.'","completion":"The Jane Austen Academy, a new secondary free school in Norfolk, UK has banned homework for its 1100 students, who will spend longer school days doing independent study.

And there is only one fold out timeline in the beginning of the book. Answer: A:","completion":"Based on the provided product review, it seems that the reviewer has mixed opinions about the book. The review cannot be entirely classified as positive, as there are certain elements they found unsatisfactory. The review begins by acknowledging that the book contains a lot of information, which indicates that the reviewer appreciates the content to some extent. However, their primary concern revolves around the lack of a detailed timeline they were expecting. The reviewer was looking for a comprehensive timeline that spanned the entirety of the Bible, as well as world history to make comparisons between the two. Unfortunately, they found that the book did not deliver on this specific aspect. The reviewer goes on to state that they have come across free online resources that provided more detailed timelines than the one offered in the book. This comparison might suggest that the reviewer may not consider the book to be of great value, as it didn't fulfill their expectations in this area. Moreover, the mention of the fold-out timeline at the beginning of the book seems to be an additional point of dissatisfaction, as they probably found it insufficient. Consequently, it would be reasonable to assume that the reviewer might have wanted a more exhaustive visual representation of the timeline throughout the book. In conclusion, the review may not be considered entirely positive due to the specific grievances expressed regarding the timeline. Although the reviewer acknowledges the book's informative content, their disappointment with the timeline's lack of detail overshadows their overall satisfaction with the product."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Which colour was the title of Coldplay's first top 5 hit in 2000 and the flag used in Formula 1 racing to indicate a hazard, slow down and not overtake?","completion":"The color that corresponds to both Coldplay's first top 5 hit in 2000 and the flag used in Formula 1 racing to indicate a hazard, slow down, and not overtake is yellow. Coldplay, a British rock band, achieved their first top 5 hit in 2000 with the song \\"Yellow.\\" Released as the second single from their debut album, \\"Parachutes,\\" the song quickly gained popularity and commercial success on the music charts. \\"Yellow\\" showcases Coldplay's early sound, characterized by melodic instrumentation and Chris Martin's emotive vocals. The title \\"Yellow\\" is significant as the lyrics mention stars and their shimmering yellow color, and may symbolize warmth, optimism, and hope. The song was critically acclaimed and helped establish Coldplay as a prominent force in the alternative and indie rock genres. In Formula 1 racing, the yellow flag holds immense importance as a prominent safety feature. This flag signals drivers to slow down, be prepared to change their course, and not overtake other vehicles due to a hazard on the track. The hazard could be anything from an accident, debris, or a stopped car to unfavorable weather conditions that could impact the drivers' ability to race safely. Race marshals use the yellow flag to alert drivers to the presence of these hazards. A single waved yellow flag indicates that drivers should slow down and be prepared to encounter a hazard, while two waved yellow flags imply that the drivers must slow down and be prepared to stop if necessary. Additionally, during a Formula 1 race, yellow flags are accompanied by yellow lights strategically placed along the course to enhance their visibility and ensure that drivers receive the necessary safety information. In summary, yellow is the color that connects the two distinctive areas of Coldplay's early success with their chart-topping song and the critical safety protocol in Formula 1 racing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\". Question: whom team is difficult from the outset? Movie title: Saving Mr. Banks Movie plot: The film begins in Australia, 1906. We start in the sky and for a moment, see the shadow of an umbrella in the clouds. The camera goes lower and lower as a weathervane turns to point east and a young girl, Ginty (the real name of P.L. Travers) is seen playing make believe in her front yard. The disembodied voice of Travers Goff says, \\"Winds in the East, mist coming in, like something is brewing, about to begin. Can't put my finger on what lies in store but I feel what's to happen all happened before.\\" This is the same overture that begins \\"Mary Poppins.\\"Now it's the year 1961. Pamela \\"P.L.\\" Travers (Emma Thompson) is a beautiful, sophisticated and smart but also grumpy, stuffy and rather unkind woman living in London. Her home office reveals she has already found success as the author of the Mary Poppins series. The doorbell rings and she finds Diarmiud Russell, her agent. They talk in her living room. She tells him she's cancelled the car because she no longer needs a ride to the airport, having changed her mind about giving up the rights to her story. Diarmuid points out she has a verbal agreement and can be sued but she replies by saying she has no money for him to claim. He confirms this as he reminds her that sales have dried up and there are no more royalties -- and that she has just recently reached terms after 20 years of being pursued -- no animation, script approval. To keep her house, Pamela agrees to venture to Los Angeles to hear the studio out but promises to leave the papers unsigned if she's not happy with their interpretation.In a flashback, we see Travers Goff (Colin Farrell) surprise his daughter, a young Pamela, nicknamed Ginty. He says he's looking for his daughter, the royal princess, and Ginty laughs and reveals it's her. They are obviously close. He puts her on his shoulders and they rush into the park, with him telling her their adventure is about to begin.In current day, Pamela is trying to load a giant bag into the overhead locker.

The movie depicts the story of Pamela \\"P.L.\\" Travers, the author of the Mary Poppins series, and her struggles with the idea of giving up the rights to her story. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, let us discuss several factors that you should consider before making a decision. 1. Cast and Crew: The film stars Emma Thompson as P.L.Travers and Colin Farrell as Travers Goff, both of whom are critically acclaimed actors with numerous accolades. Their performances would attract audiences and potentially result in a successful film. It would be important to also consider the director, screenwriter, and other key crew members' experience and reputation in the film industry. A proven track record would increase the chances of the film being a success. 2. Budget and Financing: You should analyze the proposed budget for the film, including the costs related to production, marketing, and distribution. A thorough understanding of the financial aspect will help you determine whether the expected return on your investment aligns with your goals. 3. Market Potential: Evaluate the potential market for a film with this storyline. Period dramas often have a niche audience, but the connection to the popular Mary Poppins series could help broaden its appeal. Research similar films in terms of genre, subject matter, and target audience to gauge the potential box-office success and revenue from other sources like streaming or merchandising. 4. Awards and Critical Reception: Awards and positive critical reception can significantly improve a film's box-office performance and longevity. With talents like Emma Thompson and Colin Farrell, there is potential for critical recognition, which can translate into better financial returns. 5.Return on Investment: Based on your research, calculate an estimated return on investment (ROI) and compare it with other potential investment opportunities. This will allow you to determine if investing in the film proposal provides a competitive and satisfactory return on your investment. 6. Personal Interest and Passion: Assess your personal interest in the film's story and the creative vision behind it. Passion is an important aspect to consider when investing in a film, as your involvement may not solely be based on financial gains. In conclusion, to decide whether to invest in the film proposal for \\"Saving Mr. Banks\\", you should thoroughly assess various factors such as the cast and crew, budget, market potential, potential for awards, return on investment, and your personal passion for the project. By conducting proper research and evaluating these aspects, you can make an informed decision about whether or not this is the right investment opportunity for you."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - New England is a geographical region comprising six states of the northeast United States: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Vermont. It is bordered by the state of New York to the west and south, and the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Quebec to the northeast and north, respectively. The Atlantic Ocean is to the east and southeast, and Long Island Sound is to the south. Boston is its largest city. Its largest metropolitan area is Greater Boston, which also includes Worcester (the second-largest city in New England), Manchester (the largest city in New Hampshire), and Providence (the capital and largest city of Rhode Island), with nearly a third of the entire region's population. - Wood is a porous and fibrous structural tissue found in the stems and roots of trees, and other woody plants. It is an organic material, a natural composite of cellulose fibers which are strong in tension embedded in a matrix of lignin which resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees, or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs. In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves, other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber. - A roof is part of a building envelope. It is the covering on the uppermost part of a building or shelter which provides protection from animals and weather, notably rain or snow, but also heat, wind and sunlight. The word also denotes the framing or structure which supports that covering. - Essex County is a county in the northeastern part of the U.S. state of Massachusetts.

It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - A chimney is a structure that provides ventilation for hot flue gases or smoke from a boiler, stove, furnace or fireplace to the outside atmosphere. Chimneys are typically vertical, or as near as possible to vertical, to ensure that the gases flow smoothly, drawing air into the combustion in what is known as the stack, or chimney, effect.

In the given statement, \\"A child jumps on a sand dune,\\" we are provided with information about a specific action that the child is performing - jumping on a sand dune. This action implies that the child is active and engaged in physical activity at that particular moment. However, we do not have any information on what the child does after jumping or whether the child transitions into another position, such as laying down. The statement doesn't provide enough information to make any conclusions or assumptions about the child's position post-jump. Moreover, laying down and jumping are contrasting actions - one representing a state of rest or relaxation (laying down) and the other representing movement or physical activity (jumping).

The user is addressing their tweet to another user named 'MichelleAzure'. The content of the tweet includes \\"I wish you would go STFU one day.\\" Here, 'STFU' is an internet slang term that stands for 'shut the (expletive) up', a harsh phrase that connotes anger or irritation. The user is expressing a strong wish for MichelleAzure to stop talking or expressing herself, which is a negative sentiment. Primarily, sentiment analysis identifies the mood or subjective emotions within the text, whether positive, negative, or neutral. The emotional cues are derived from the language and context used in the text. In this case, the language usage and expression explicitly depict a negative sentiment. This tweet does not express joy, satisfaction, or any positive emotions towards the user MichelleAzure. Instead, it communicates annoyance, dissatisfaction, and distaste. The tweet is confrontational, with an apparent desire for MichelleAzure to silence her opinions or views. Such a manner of direct, vehement expression denotes a negative sentiment as it lacks any positive or even neutral tonality. Furthermore, understanding and interpreting the sentiment in a tweet, or any piece of online user-generated content for that matter, involves considering various contextual factors. These include sarcasm, irony, the user's prior tweet history, the overall conversation's theme, etc. However, based on this single tweet alone, the sentiment unmistakably comes across as negative. Predicting the sentiment of this tweet as negative is based on the text's overall tone, the harsh abbreviation used, and the sentiments that such a phrase would usually denote in an online communication context.

The coats of domestic dogs are of two varieties: \\"double\\" being common with dogs (as well as wolves) originating from colder climates, made up of a coarse guard hair and a soft down hair, or \\"single\\", with the topcoat only. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What is the more common coat for dogs from colder climates?","completion":"The more common coat type for dogs from colder climates is the \\"double coat.\\" This type of coat is specially adapted to provide dogs with insulation and protection from harsh weather conditions often associated with cold climates. It is made up of two layers: the guard hair and the soft down hair. The guard hair, also known as the outer coat or topcoat, primarily provides protection. It is made up of longer, coarser, and water-resistant hairs that help shield the dog from rain, snow, and other environmental conditions. The guard hairs also help to wick away moisture and protect the dog's skin from the sun's harmful UV rays. The soft down hair, also known as the undercoat or inner coat, is the insulating layer in a double coat. It is made up of short, soft, and dense hairs which work together to trap warm air close to the dog's body, thus effectively maintaining body heat. The undercoat acts as a thermal layer, providing warmth during winter and serving as a cooling barrier during the summer by allowing air circulation close to the skin. Dogs from colder climates, such as Arctic regions or high-altitude environments, have developed these double coats through natural selection. As a result, they have a better chance of survival and thriving in these challenging conditions. Some examples of breeds with double coats originating from cold climates include Siberian Huskies, Alaskan Malamutes, and Samoyeds. In summary, the more common coat type for dogs from colder climates is a double coat which provides them with both protection and insulation, making them well-adapted to surviving and thriving in harsh weather conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Especially if you are in a household with children — who are prone to frequent cuts and abrasions while playing — it can be helpful to have some supplies in the house that are \\"easy-access\\" for when an injury does occur. These can be purchased over-the-counter at any drugstore or pharmacy, and are described in more detail in the steps below. Either iodine or hydrogen peroxide is effective as an antiseptic — meaning they work to reduce the likelihood of infection in a wound. Do not rub the area too hard when applying the antiseptic, as this may further the injury or cause irritation to the wound. Gently applying it is all that is required. Use a cotton ball to apply the antiseptic to the wound surface; this is because the cotton ball is clean, so it will not further contaminate the wound, as opposed to using your hand. Note that hydrogen peroxide is the most commonly used antiseptic, and it can be purchased at any drug store or pharmacy. Antibiotic creams or ointments, such as Neosporin or Triple Antibiotic, can be applied directly over the cut, and then covered by a Band-Aid. These greatly diminish the possibility of bacterial infection of the cut or abrasion. These have been shown to boost the immune system and to increase speed of healing. Examples include gently rubbing aloe vera, honey, or lavender oil on the wound, and then covering it with a bandage.","completion":"The article highlights the importance of having easy-access antiseptic supplies like iodine or hydrogen peroxide for treating wounds, and suggests using antibiotic creams, bandages, and natural remedies to prevent infection and promote healing in households with children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She also said that Popecki, who had been Lyzwinski's aide, had tried to induce a miscarriage by giving her a labour-inducing drug called oxytocin. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Lyzwinski's aide had tried to create a miscarriage.","completion":"Based on the information presented in the paragraph, the statement \\"Lyzwinski's aide had tried to create a miscarriage\\" seems to be true. According to the accusations of Aneta Krawczyk, Popecki, an individual identified as Lyzwinski's aide, had given her a labor-inducing drug called oxytocin. It is well known that oxytocin could stimulate uterine contractions, and in some cases, it could potentially cause miscarriage if administered during pregnancy. Given this, it seems appropriate to interpret Krawczyk's accusation as implying that Popecki, in his role as Lyzwinski's aide, attempted to induce a miscarriage. However, it should be pointed out that this interpretation is based solely on the information given, which is based on the accusations of Aneta Krawczyk. In real-life contexts, such a serious allegation would typically be subject to legal scrutiny and would require corroborating evidence to be proven true. If substantiated, this would constitute a serious crime and ethical breach. Furthermore, it is noteworthy to mention that while we are drawing these conclusions, we understand that they are based on accusations and claims and should be treated as such. It is crucial that such allegations need robust investigation and legal dissection before we can categorically state them as facts, as anyone accused of a crime is presumed innocent until proven guilty. Lastly, these types of allegations have significant social and political implications. They can potentially damage the reputation of involved individuals and political entities, and often underscore the need for ethical conduct and transparency in political and interpersonal engagements. What this story essentially highlights is an alleged incident of misuse of power for personal and political gains, as well as potential sexual exploitation, adding to an often-decried culture of impunity in some political circles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is strange enough that the same person may also have a different answer as time goes by. Five years ago when I was in Junior Grade One, I got interested in bicycling because I thought my uncle was very cool when he rode his bike. He could ride a bike with only one wheel. He could also sit on the bike and keep it standing straight, without moving for a long time. I thought it was easy to learn to ride a bike, so I decided to learn from my uncle. He told me how to ride. When I fell off the bike the first time, I was afraid to try again. It was too hard for me to learn. Then my uncle helped me by holding the bike for me and not to let go. With his help, I was able to ride longer and longer. \\"You can do it by yourself now, young boy!\\" I heard his voice far behind me. Question: What's the best title of this passage?

There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Georgi Malenkov. Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Union's air force would need two or three months to prepare any operations. In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet air force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time. Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951. Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu. Soviet shipments of matériel, when they did arrive, were limited to small quantities of trucks, grenades, machine guns, and the like.

Summarize this article: Leyla Yunus and her husband Arif Yunus, an academic, were hoping to board a flight from the capital Baku to Doha in Qatar, but were held at the airport. They were released after a night in custody. But her passport was withheld. Her arrest comes amid a crackdown on human rights activists and journalists in the oil-rich ex-Soviet state. Azerbaijan has been ruled by the Aliyev family since 1993, soon after the break-up of the Soviet Union. Mrs Yunus had been pressing for reconciliation between Azerbaijan and its next-door neighbour and bitter rival Armenia. Earlier this month journalist Rauf Mirkadyrov, who worked with her on the Armenian project, was arrested and accused of spying for Armenia. Mrs Yunus predicted last week that she faced imminent arrest. On Tuesday morning, after her overnight detention, she was taken back to her home but refused to let police search it without a warrant. Amid the tension her husband fell ill and was taken to hospital. Doctors told the BBC Azeri service he had suffered from hypertension and was stable. Mrs Yunus told journalists outside her house that during her 11-hour detention she was not allowed to use the toilet, and when finally allowed to go it was only in the presence of a male police officer. \\"It's like torture, like the Middle Ages,\\" she said. \\"I haven't slept for a whole day.\\" She was later released, but her office was searched.

Question: Why does Nelson submit to Barry at first? Movie title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Let's Go to Prison\\", Nelson Biederman IV submits to Barry at first primarily due to a combination of fear, vulnerability, and the need for protection in a new and dangerous environment. As the son of a judge, Nelson IV comes from a privileged background and has led a sheltered life, which makes him ill-equipped to deal with the harsh realities of prison. Once Nelson IV ends up in prison, he finds himself in a whole new world where the rules are different, and he is forced to adapt quickly to survive. This is where John Lyshitski, who has a personal vendetta against the Biederman family, takes advantage of Nelson's vulnerability, pretending to be his friend but secretly trying to ruin his life even further. When Nelson IV meets Barry, the imposing yet charismatic gang leader, he recognizes that Barry is both feared and respected by other inmates, and he sees an opportunity for protection and potential guidance. Barry's strength and the influence he has over other prisoners make him a powerful ally in the treacherous environment Nelson finds himself in. Nelson IV comes to the realization that to survive in prison, he will need to rely on others to navigate it successfully, even if it means submitting to the power dynamics of this new world. Additionally, as Nelson IV discovers his homosexuality and develops a romantic relationship with Barry, his submission is not just an act of self-preservation but also a natural consequence of his newfound love and intimacy with Barry. The relationship between Nelson and Barry evolves from one based on necessity to a genuine attachment, providing both emotional and physical support for Nelson as he tries to acclimate to life in prison. In conclusion, Nelson Biederman IV submits to Barry initially due to his overwhelming fear of the unknown world of prison, his vulnerability resulting from his privileged background, and his desperation to find protection in a dangerous environment. Moreover, the development of a romantic relationship with Barry further solidifies Nelson's willingness to submit to him as a means of emotional and physical support. Throughout the story, this submission represents a coping mechanism for Nelson IV to navigate the harsh realities of life in prison while slowly finding his footing and ultimately learning how to survive."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

As a visually impaired user, I constantly rely on accessibility tools to navigate through my device, and this app has been a tremendous help. The app's voice-guided navigation feels natural and is relatively easy to use. The gestures are straightforward, making it simple to open menus and access various functions. It's clear that the developers put a lot of effort into ensuring that this app caters to the needs of its target audience. The integration with other Google apps is seamless, allowing me to use Gmail, Maps, and Chrome effortlessly. However, there is some room for improvement. The app faces occasional voice synthesis bugs that disrupt my experience. Also, the app could benefit from more customization options, such as adjustable voice speed or a choice of different voice types. Further, the tutorial could be more comprehensive, enabling novice users to get up and running more quickly. I experienced a slight learning curve initially, but after some trial and error, I was able to master the app's functionality. Overall, I give the com.google.android.marvin.talkback app a solid 4-star rating. It's a fantastic accessibility tool for those who need it, with just a few areas that could benefit from refinement.

The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air. Question: \\"What kind of vessels in the skin dilate to help cool the body?\\" Answer: \\"Plastic vessels\\" Is this answer correct? Choices: a). no. b). yes....I think the answer is","completion":"a). no. The correct answer is \\"no,\\" because plastic vessels are not a part of the human body's vascular system. The question refers to blood vessels in the skin. Blood vessels, specifically capillaries and arterioles, are responsible for dilation and constriction to regulate body temperature. When the body needs to cool down, the blood vessels close to the skin's surface dilate, allowing for increased blood flow and heat to be released. Plastic vessels are not involved in this process, making this answer incorrect."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

To assess the sentiment of a piece of text, we need to analyze the context, the emotions expressed, and the specific words used. In this case, the context of the tweet highlights a series of unfortunate events experienced by the user. Let's break it down: 1. The user starts by mentioning that their phone is almost dead, mentioning that it is \\"pretty much dying permanently.\\" This statement has negative implications, as the loss of phone functionality can cause inconvenience or even anxiety for the user. 2. The user then talks about their gas being stolen, which is another negative event. The theft of personal property is almost universally considered a negative experience. In this case, it not only corresponds to a significant financial loss but also adds stress to the user's life. 3. The user says they spent their last bit of money on a ride home, which suggests financial hardship and a lack of resources. This again is a negative circumstance, as it underscores the user's dire situation and further elevates their stress levels. 4. The user mentions having an empty gas tank, highlighting that they cannot use their own vehicle. This statement reinforces the negative sentiment because it adds a layer of inconvenience and frustration to their current situation. 5. Finally, the user expresses a desire to see their \\"lovess,\\" which may refer to loved ones or significant others. While the longing to see loved ones might be considered positive in a different context, in this tweet, it adds to the negative sentiment because it underscores the user's inability to fulfill their emotional needs due to the difficulties they face. Considering these factors, it is clear that the sentiment of the tweet is negative. The user's choice of words and the context in which they are used convey disappointment, stress, and frustration, making it evident that the user is undergoing a series of adverse events that have negatively impacted their overall emotional state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. The company developed and marketed one of the world's best-selling desktop computers, the Commodore 64 (1982) and released its Amiga computer line in July 1985. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - A 16-bit register can store 2 different values. The signed range of integer values that can be stored in 16 bits is -32,768 (-1 × 2) through 32,767 (2 - 1); the unsigned range is 0 through 65,535 (2 - 1). Since 2 is 65,536, a processor with 16-bit memory addresses can directly access 64 KiB of byte-addressable memory. - A player character or playable character (PC) is a fictional character in a role-playing or video game whose actions are directly controlled by a player of the game rather than the rules of the game. The characters that are not controlled by a player are called non-player characters (NPCs). The actions of non-player characters are typically handled by the game itself in video games, or according to rules followed by a gamemaster refereeing tabletop role-playing games. The player character functions as a fictional, alternate body for the player controlling it. - The VIC-20 (Germany: VC-20; Japan: VIC-1001) is an 8-bit home computer that was sold by Commodore Business Machines. The VIC-20 was announced in 1980, roughly three years after Commodore's first personal computer, the PET.

In a shoot 'em up, the player character engages in a lone assault, often in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting large numbers of enemies while dodging their attacks. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot 'em up. Some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement; others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives.

The Commodore Amiga, often referred to as simply \\"Amiga,\\" is a product of Commodore International, a company that played a significant role in the home/personal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s. \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\" is a shoot 'em up game that is reminiscent of the classic game Space Invaders and follows the protagonist's, Brad Zoom's, journey to save civilization from aliens. In this game genre, the player character is often involved in a solitary assault, which often takes place in a spacecraft or aircraft, shooting a large number of enemies while evading their attacks. In the case of \\"Better Dead Than Alien,\\" the player assumes control of Brad Zoom's spaceship. The Amiga was a significant platform for the release of various games, including \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\", because of its advanced graphics and sound capabilities, which were superior to many other systems at the time. The game developers leveraged the high-definition color, superior sound, and graphic specs of the Amiga to deliver a more engaging gaming experience. The Amiga's ability to deliver high-quality graphics and sound was due to its unique architecture, which included dedicated coprocessors for handling tasks such as audio, graphics, and direct memory access (DMA) transfers. In addition to showcasing the advanced technological capabilities of the Amiga, \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\" and similar games contributed to the platform's popularity and commercial success. Many successful and popular games were released for the Amiga during the 1980s and 1990s, thus establishing it as a key console in the video game industry of that era. This relationship between the game \\"Better Dead Than Alien\\" and the Amiga platform illustrates the symbiotic relationship between gaming software and hardware in driving technological innovation and market success in the video game industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve this math problem Solve -424*r = -404*r + 200 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation -424*r = -404*r + 200 for r, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the r term First, attempt to isolate r by removing the -404*r term from both sides of the equation. To do this, add 404*r to both sides. -424*r + 404*r = -404*r + 404*r + 200 This simplifies to: -20*r = 200 Step 2: Solve for r Now that you have isolated the r term, you can solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by -20. (-20*r) / (-20) = (200) / (-20) This simplifies to: r = -10 So, the solution for the equation -424*r = -404*r + 200 is r = -10."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

We have the equation: 81024 = 1865*w - 7827 + 4926 First, we want to put all the numbers together. So we need to move those numbers that are not with \\"w\\" on the other side, by adding or subtracting them. Let's start by adding 7827 to both sides (since it's negative on one side, adding it will cancel it out): 81024 + 7827 = 1865*w - 7827 + 7827 + 4926 That gets us: 88851 = 1865*w + 4926 Now we need to get rid of the 4926 on the w side. We'll subtract 4926 from both sides: 88851 - 4926 = 1865*w + 4926 - 4926 Now our equation looks like this: 83925 = 1865*w Now, it's time to find what \\"w\\" is.

He is usually portrayed as a warrior with superhuman abilities and a master of disguise possessed of magical powers. Cu Roi further appears in the episode known as \\"The Trance of Amairgin\\", variants of which appear in Recension I and II of the Tain bo Cuailnge. The episode appears as Aislinge n-Aimirgin (\\"The trance of Amairgin\\") in Recension I of the Tain. Having followed news of Cu Chulainn's sustained success in single-handedly opposing the Connacht army, Cu Roi once again appears on the scene, this time to fight Cu Chulainn directly. However, on finding Cu Chulainn weak from the injuries which Ferdiad had recently inflicted on him, he refused to carry out his original plan. Instead he faces the giant warrior poet Amairgin, who in a trance is hurling stones at the Connacht army in Tailtiu, with devastating effects. Cu Roi attacks him in kind and their stones meet in the air. They pause when on Cu Roi's request, Amairgen allows the cattle to go past Tailtiu, but seeing as the passage had become difficult, Cu Roi agrees to withdraw from the contest altogether. The episode in the Book of Leinster (Recension II), called Imthusa Chon Rui meic Daire (header) or Oislige Amargin (text), offers by and large the same story, but adds more explicit detail, notably on the point of Cu Roi's sense of honour in his encounters with Cu Chulainn and Amairgin. First, Cu Roi explains his refusal to fight Cu Chulainn not only by pointing out the inequality between a physically healthy and an injured warrior, but also by saying that a victory would not be his, seeing as it was Fer Diad who had laid low his opponent. Second, the conclusion of Cu Roi's fight with Amairgin is told from a perspective which highlights the role of honour in his motives. Medb insisted \\"[b]y the truth of your [Cu Roi's] valour\\" ([a]r fir do gascid fritt) that he should abandon the competition, obstructive as it proved to be to the progress of the expedition. Cu Roi, however, was determined to persist \\"till the day of doom\\" (co brunni bratha) unless Amairgin agreed to stop. (When the matter was settled and Cu Roi returned to his country, Amairgin resumed his attacks on the invading army, explaining that his agreement was with Cu Roi only.) Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what is the trance of amairgin","completion":"The Trance of Amairgin, also known as Aislinge n-Aimirgin (in Recension I of the Tain) or Imthusa Chon Rui meic Daire / Oislige Amargin (in Recension II), is an episode from the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology featuring the character Cu Roi mac Daire. In this episode, Cu Roi encounters the giant warrior poet Amairgin, who has fallen into a trance and is hurling stones at the Connacht army in Tailtiu, causing significant damage. Cu Roi, initially intending to fight Cu Chulainn, decides against it on finding him injured. Instead, he engages in a battle with Amairgin by launching stones at him, and their stones clash in mid-air. They come to a temporary pause when Amairgin allows the cattle to pass by Tailtiu. Due to the challenging passage and Cu Roi's sense of honor, as well as Medb's insistence based on his valour, Cu Roi agrees to withdraw from the contest altogether. Cu Roi's honor is further emphasized in this episode when he opts not to fight Cu Chulainn, insisting that a victory would not be rightfully his since Fer Diad had already injured Cu Chulainn."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Such programs usually cater to children from infancy until they enter formal schooling and can sometimes be extended to cover out-of-school or after-school care for school-aged children. The primary goals of these programs are to provide a safe, supportive, and nurturing environment for children while their parents or guardians are at work or engaged in other obligations. Learning and childcare services are often essential for working families who need a reliable and secure place for their children to stay during working hours. These programs can vary in their educational approach, with some focusing on a structured curriculum, while others emphasize play-based learning or a combination of both. Some key components of these programs may include: 1. Early childhood education: These programs are designed to support the development of cognitive, social, emotional, and physical skills in young children. Early childhood education can be provided in various settings, such as preschools, kindergartens, and childcare centers. 2. Daycare services: Daycare centers offer childcare for infants, toddlers, and preschoolers, providing a safe and nurturing environment for children while their parents are at work. These centers may offer a mix of educational, play-based, and recreational activities to support the overall development of the child. 3. After-school care: This type of program provides care, supervision, and enrichment opportunities for school-aged children during the hours immediately following the end of the school day. After-school care programs may include educational support, recreational activities, and socialization opportunities. 4. Special needs services: Some programs cater to children with special needs, providing individualized support and targeted interventions to help them reach their full potential. These programs may include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy, among other specialized services. 5. Parent engagement and support: Many learning and childcare programs also include resources and support for parents, such as parent education workshops, resources for at-home learning, and opportunities for parental involvement in the program's activities. In summary, programs offering learning and childcare services play a crucial role in supporting families, offering a safe and nurturing environment for children to grow and develop their skills, and helping prepare them for success in school and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again. Question: suppose sediment becomes a smaller rock happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: no effect The process you described outlines the rock cycle, which explains how rocks transform between different types (igneous, sedimentary, and metamorphic). In the scenario you provided, sediment becoming a smaller rock (sedimentary rock) will not directly affect the formation of more igneous rocks. Igneous rocks form when magma from a volcano cools and solidifies. The formation of sedimentary rocks, which occurs when sediments accumulate and undergo compaction and cementation, is a separate process that does not influence the cooling of magma or the solidification process. Therefore, the formation of more sedimentary rocks will have no direct effect on the formation of more igneous rocks. However, it is important to note that the rock cycle can involve multiple complex processes and interactions between different types of rocks. For example, if the sedimentary rocks mentioned in your scenario were eventually subjected to high pressures and temperatures due to tectonic forces, they could become metamorphic rocks, which could then melt and turn into magma, leading to the formation of igneous rocks under the right conditions. In that case, there would be more igneous rocks formed as a result of the complete rock cycle process, but the direct change from sediment to smaller sedimentary rocks would still not have a direct effect on igneous rock formation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago. When. Annette Lewn's children were young, she longed to join in the chats. with other mothers at toddler group coffee mornings, but always felt. like an outsider. 'I desperately wanted to be part of the group, but I. never seemed to say the right thing and I'd get funny looks from. people,' says Annette, 42, a school cleaner who lives in Chippenham,. Wiltshire, with her son Ryan, 15, and daughter Rachel, 14. 'I just don't. pick up on social niceties at all,' she adds. Annette has often. been criticised for being rude or blunt, although she never intends to. be, and the criticism upsets her greatly. 'When I was a teenager I. remember a friend asking me what I thought of her new make-up. She. obviously thought she looked great, but I said she looked like she'd. upset a paint box all over her face. Everyone else just stared at me in. disbelief.' Annette had friends 'but found the reality of having to make conversation stressful, and I'd long to go home and be alone'. Meanwhile, teachers would scold her for not making eye contact. 'I. could mask my personality traits by copying the behaviour of others,. but I just didn't pick up the cues for what was appropriate; it required. huge effort,' recalls Annette. As well as her lack of social skills, Annette's hobbies set her apart. While most of her. friends plastered their walls with pop star posters, she was obsessed. with maps, and stuck her collection of 30 or so all around her bed. Then,. five years ago in her late 30s, Annette discovered the cause of her. quirky behaviour traits. She has Asperger's syndrome, sometimes referred. to as a 'mild' form of autism. Autism is a spectrum disorder. affecting how a person makes sense of the world, processes information. and relates to other people. At one end of the spectrum, some with. Asperger's can often hold down jobs, marry and - on the surface, at. least - live a normal life. But their symptoms can still cause a lot of. distress, with problems in relationships and at school and work. There. are around 700,000 people on the autism spectrum in Britain, according. to The National Autistic Society, with more being diagnosed. Asperger's. is much more common in men, although experts are beginning to wonder if. this is simply because the symptoms are harder to recognise in women. Annette Lewns, from Chippenham, Wiltshire, has also been diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome. Last week, singer Susan Boyle, 52, revealed she was diagnosed with Asperger's a year ago. For. years she'd thought her difficulties - she was nicknamed 'Susie Simple' at school - had been caused by complications at birth. She'd also. suffered from anxiety around strangers and struggled with eye contact,. making her feel 'different' and 'an outsider' throughout her childhood. In fact, these were signs of Asperger's. 'Many people with. Asperger's want to be sociable, but have difficulties making friends and. struggle to maintain them,' explains Dr Judith Gould, of the National. Autistic Society. 'They don't understand the unwritten social rules. and can appear aloof or behave inappropriately. This can make them. depressed and cause them to withdraw.' The condition is 'particularly. difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at. masking their symptoms than males, says Dr Gould. 'They know they are. different, but still want to fit in and make friends, and so will learn. how to \\"act\\" in social situations. Men can do this, too, but they don't. care as much about fitting in and don't tend to need to be as sociable. as women. 'Girls also tend to be more passive than boys with. Asperger's, who are usually more aggressive. Consequently, it's easier. to detect it in boys. 'The strain of trying to work out how to behave. and interact can make women anxious, and this can often be misdiagnosed. as depression or they will develop an eating disorder. They may obsess. about counting every calorie, for example, or how much exercise they can. do.' Developing obsessional interests is another common Asperger's trait. 'Girls. might, for instance, develop an obsession with a celebrity, a soap. opera, horses or Barbie dolls,' says Dr Gould. 'What will stand out,. though, is the intensity of that interest or the rituals of how their. collections will be displayed. Perfectionism is another common trait. And a love of strict routines.'What causes it is not clear, though. research using MRI brain scans has shown differences in specific areas. of the brains of children who have Asperger's, including the frontal. lobe which controls our ability to control and moderate our behaviour. The condition is 'more difficult' to diagnose in females because they are much better at masking symptoms. Asperger's. was formally recognised by the World Health Organisation as a distinct. condition only in 1994. Therefore, many adults, such as Susan Boyle and. Annette, are only just now getting a diagnosis. 'There are various. red flags that an experienced clinician will pick up on, such as a lack. of interest in people in childhood,' says Dr Gould. Most of those. with Asperger's have average or above-average intelligence. But. typically, girls with Asperger's will underachieve at school unless a. teacher nurtures them, says Dr Gould. 'They have intelligence, but not. social intelligence: they don't pick up on the whole picture. 'Many. will go on to struggle in a work situation because, although they can. focus on the job, they can't do the social chit-chat which can help them. fit in and get on.' After leaving school Annette worked at a care. home, and although she loved the routine, she found getting on with her. colleagues difficult. 'It baffled me - I just didn't know what I was. doing wrong,' she says. 'I knew I was different, but I just thought it. was my fault and that I wasn't the popular type.' In her 20s Annette met her husband Russell, a firefighter, now 44 (the couple have since separated). 'He carried me in social situations. I felt safe with him,' says Annette. 'I still struggled with female friendships, though.' Then, when their son Ryan was three-and-a-half years old, he was diagnosed with Asperger's.'Luckily,. I never had a problem bonding with the children,' says Annette. 'But. before Ryan's diagnosis, I had wondered if his behaviour was my fault. I. even went to parenting classes.' After their daughter Rachel's. diagnosis at the age of nine, Annette wondered if she herself had it,. too, as Rachel's behaviour was so similar to her own. 'I started. doing more research and took an online diagnosis test for Asperger's and. scored quite high,' says Annette. 'It was a wake-up call. 'My GP. said there was no point getting a diagnosis, but I knew through my. experience with my children that the right support can make a. difference. I was eventually diagnosed in 2011, but only after being. referred to a psychiatrist for depression by my GP. 'It was a great relief to finally find out why I'd always felt like an outsider.' Tom. Madders, head of campaigns at the National Autistic Society, says the. problem is that the condition is often not spotted. He adds: 'Only 63 of. 152 local authorities have a diagnostic pathway in place - a set route. for GPs to refer on to a specialist so people with suspected Asperger's. can be assessed.' Once the condition is diagnosed, the charity runs. courses on social skills, a befriending scheme as well as providing. information on employment and other training. Since Annette's. diagnosis, she has completed a maths qualification, taken a cognitive. behavioural therapy course to help with her anxiety and now works as a. volunteer mentor in a school. 'My confidence has improved and I can. finally explain to people why I might come across the way I do,' explains Annette. 'I'd love to work in education - and I think with. support I could study for qualifications. 'All we \\"Aspies\\" need is some extra help with our social skills.'

Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Alright kiddo, this is a story about a woman named Annette and a famous singer named Susan Boyle. They both were diagnosed with something called Asperger's syndrome, which is a type of autism. Autism is when a person's brain works a little differently, especially in how they connect with other people. Annette struggled with making conversation, understanding social rules, and sometimes said things that seemed rude, though she didn’t mean them to be. She was also very interested in things other people didn't care as much about, like maps. This made her feel like she didn't quite fit in. Then, as an adult, she learned that all these things were because she had Asperger's syndrome. It helped her understand why she'd always felt so different and she even started helping others in a school after this discovery. Susan Boyle, the singer, found out she had Asperger's too, when she was 51 years old. Before that, people thought she was just simple or shy because she struggled with making eye contact and felt like an outsider. They say girls with Asperger's might be better at hiding their signs, so it's harder to spot compared to boys. Also, the things they become intensely interested in could look like typical girl interests - like a celebrity, or Barbie. These stories tell us how it's important to understand why some people might seem different. Once we know, we can help them feel accepted and be successful, just like anyone else!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Which formerly called \\"Fright Night\\" event at Universal Studios featured the Nick Everhart film, Slash-in-the-Box? A:","completion":"A: The event that was formerly called \\"Fright Night\\" at Universal Studios and featured the Nick Everhart film, Slash-in-the-Box, is Halloween Horror Nights. Halloween Horror Nights is an annual special event held at Universal Studios theme parks in Orlando, Hollywood, Singapore, and Japan. The event started back in 1991 under the name \\"Fright Nights,\\" and from 1992 onward, it became known as Halloween Horror Nights. Slash-in-the-Box, directed by Nick Everhart, was showcased during the Halloween Horror Nights event in 2011. In that year, the event was called \\"Halloween Horror Nights 21: No One Beats the House\\" at the Orlando location. This was the 21st edition of the annual event, which brought special attractions connected to the horror genres - haunted houses, scare zones, live shows, and more. In Halloween Horror Nights 21, Universal Orlando created an all-new storyline revolving around a sinister figure known as Lady Luck. Lady Luck acted as a force of misfortune that enticed people to take risks, ultimately leading to terrible consequences. Throughout the event, guests would encounter iconic horror characters, terrifying new faces, and a blend of interactive experiences, evoking fear and excitement at every step. Nick Everhart's Slash-in-the-Box is a short horror film that was integrated into the event, resonating with the theme. It tells the story of a young couple who opens an eerie, old jack-in-the-box toy that unexpectedly unleashes a terrifying surprise. The film played a role in crafting the immersive atmosphere of the event, contributing to the overall horror experience. Thus, the formerly called \\"Fright Night\\" event at Universal Studios that featured the Nick Everhart film, Slash-in-the-Box, is Halloween Horror Nights, specifically during its 2011 edition titled \\"Halloween Horror Nights 21: No One Beats the House\\" at Universal Orlando."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the \\"5 second rule\\" --- the belief about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped. The study, undertaken by final year Biology students and led by Anthony Hilton, Professor of Microbiology at Aston University, monitored the transfer of the common bacteria from a variety of indoor flooring types (carpet, cement floor etc.) to toast, pasta, a biscuit and a sticky sweet when contact was made from 3 to 30 seconds. The results showed that: Time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food; and the type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from cement flooring surfaces to moist foods making contact for more than 5 seconds. Professor Hilton said: \\"Consuming food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk as it very much depends on which bacteria are present on the floor at the time.\\" The Aston team also carried out a survey of the number of people who employ the 5 second rule. The survey showed that: 87% of people surveyed said they would eat food dropped on the floor, or already have done so. 55% of those who would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor are women. 81% of the women who would eat food from the floor would follow the 5 second rule. Professor Hilton added, \\"Our study showed that a surprisingly large majority of people are happy to consume dropped food, with women the most likely to do so. But they are also more likely to follow the 5 second rule.\\" The answer is:","completion":"Which factor(s) influence the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food, according to the Aston University study?

Second question: Why do silver ions kill bacteria? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Firstly, let's clarify that colloidal silver and silver ions are indeed related but they are distinct entities. Colloidal silver is a suspension of submicroscopic silver particles in a colloidal base (often water), which can deliver silver ions, but they're not the same thing. So, these two questions, while related, are not the same. First question: How does colloidal silver kill bacteria? Colloidal silver's potent antimicrobial properties are largely attributable to the silver particles it contains. When colloidal silver enters the body, it comes into contact with the body's fluids, which enables the silver ions to detach from the particles. It is these silver ions that possess the antimicrobial potency. When silver ions come into contact with bacterial cells, they can damage the cell membranes, rendering them more permeable. More notably, they're capable of interacting with the cell's DNA and proteins. Silver ions attach to the bacterial cell and penetrate it, leading to the formation of a bond between the silver ion and bacterial DNA. This bond prevents the DNA from unwinding, a crucial step necessary for it to replicate and multiply. Silver ions also interact with the sulfhydryl (-SH) groups present in certain enzymes needed by bacteria for their metabolism. The silver ions react with these groups, leading to their deactivation. This inactivation of essential bacteria enzymes interferes with the bacteria's energy production processes and other crucial biochemical processes, resulting in the death of bacterial cells. Second question: Why do silver ions kill bacteria? As mentioned earlier, the antimicrobial effects of silver ions come from their interaction with bacterial cells at multiple levels. First, silver ions can rupture bacterial cell walls and membranes. The ions destroy the structural integrity of these cells damaging their proteins, resulting in leakage of cell contents and ultimately, cell death. Second, silver ions can penetrate bacterial cells and interfere with their metabolic processes. They react with specific proteins and enzymes required for the bacteria's metabolic activities, disabling their function thereby disrupting the energy production and various other necessary activities for bacterial survival. Last, and most critically, silver ions can interact with bacterial DNA. Upon penetration into the bacterial cell, they bind to the DNA and inhibit its replication by preventing it from unwinding. Without the ability to replicate, bacteria cannot multiply and maintain their population, leading to their eventual dwindling and extermination. So, while both questions are about the antibacterial properties of silver, they are not the same. The first is about the mechanism by which colloidal silver—which contains silver particles—kills bacteria. In contrast, the second is specifically about how silver ions, which are one component of colloidal silver but can also be derived from other sources of silver, kill bacteria. Both mechanisms involve a similar sequence of interactions between silver and bacterial cells but are not identical in the specifics of those interactions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The folks at Amazon and Google must have been wringing their hands on Monday when Apple CEO Steve Jobs showed off a new service called iTunes Match. That all-important \\"one more thing\\" from Apple's software presentation is part of the iCloud Web application and storage suite. It was a coup of sorts -- and Apple's win over competitors could be attributed to Jobs' experience at Pixar Animation Studios, which he co-founded. Here's what Apple pulled off: With a free iCloud account, all songs purchased from iTunes can be accessed from any Apple gadget or computer with iTunes installed. (Amazon has done something similar with Cloud Drive.) For 25 a year, iTunes in the Cloud stores a maximum of 25,000 songs on Apple's servers, ready to access from various gizmos. And, importantly, Apple did this with the blessing of the music industry. Amazon and Google, on the other hand, couldn't get the record labels to agree to their terms. Cloud Drive and Google's Music Beta require users to upload every single track to their servers, a process that can take hours or days. Apple, the largest music retailer, somehow managed to convince the labels and publishers to go along with its plan to use a scan-and-match process. iTunes Match looks at the user's music library and grants the keys to high-quality versions of those songs. It uses a don't-ask-don't-tell policy: Napster who? How did Apple pull off something Amazon and Google couldn't, despite them launching cloud-music services first? For one, Apple has a history with the music industry as long as any technology company's. \\"It's really hard to get the labels to give you the rights that you need,\\" Jobs said in a 2003 interview at the first All Things Digital conference. \\"And I don't see them sprinkling those rights around everywhere, letting a thousand flowers grow quite yet.\\" In that interview eight years ago, Jobs described the vast divide between technology and entertainment executives, and he talked about how he bridged it. \\"One of the things I learned at Pixar is the technology industries and the content industries do not understand each other,\\" he said. \\"In Silicon Valley and at most technology companies, I swear that most people still think the creative process is a bunch of guys in their early 30s, sitting on a couch, drinking beer and thinking of jokes. No, they really do. That's how television is made, they think; that's how movies are made.\\" Likewise, record executives can't relate to technical people, Jobs said. \\"People in Hollywood and in the content industries, they think technology is something you just write a check for and buy,\\" Jobs said. \\"They don't understand the creative element of technology. \\"These are like ships passing in the night,\\" the Apple co-founder added. Music execs also may have seen Google as an enemy because its search engine is a popular place to find websites serving pirated albums, according to an article in the Hollywood Reporter. For the ribbon-cutting of the iTunes Store in 2003, Apple broke through the barriers with a list of predictions, Jobs said. Apple executives provided the record labels with a glimpse into their crystal ball, and nine months later, Jobs' team was getting calls from the music companies, he said. \\"The record companies, the most important thing they do is not distribute music,\\" Jobs said. \\"It's picking which of 500 people are going to be the next Sheryl Crow. That's what they do. And some of them do it quite well. And it's an intuitive process. There's not enough data.\\" (Hey, Sheryl Crow, remember her?) \\"It's not surprising that they didn't understand Napster,\\" Jobs said. \\"It's not surprising that they didn't understand that distributing their content over the Internet was the next big wave.\\" Because technology companies treat record labels like clearing houses for content, Silicon Valley bigwigs have trouble getting through the door, Jobs suggested. So it was perhaps Jobs' expertise from Pixar, during his exodus period from Apple, that has given him the edge to secure risky deals with entertainment giants first. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"So, this article is about Apple's iTunes Match service. It's a way for people to store their music in iCloud, which is like a big digital shelf in the sky. When they use iTunes Match, their songs are stored in a special place where they can listen to them anytime on different gadgets, like phones and computers. Apple was able to make this work because Steve Jobs, who used to be in charge of Apple, was also part of a movie-making company called Pixar. He learned how to talk to the people who make music and movies, and he was able to get their permission to use their songs in iTunes Match. What makes this surprising is that other companies like Amazon and Google tried to do something similar, but they couldn't get the same permission from the music-makers. Steve Jobs believed that understanding both technology and creativity made Apple stand out and helped them make deals that other companies couldn't."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wind: Wind is a natural phenomenon caused by the movement of air due to the differences in pressure and temperature in the Earth's atmosphere. It can blow air at varying speeds and directions. 2. Humans: Humans can blow air through their mouths, usually by pursing their lips together and exhaling forcefully. This action can be used to blow out candles or inflate balloons. 3. Some mammals: Certain mammals, such as whales and dolphins, have blowholes. These creatures exhale forcefully through these openings, expelling air and releasing a fine spray of water vapor. Some mammals, like humans, can also blow air through their mouths. 4. Referees: Referees in various sports, such as soccer and basketball, use a whistle to signal various game events. They blow air into the whistle to create a sound that stops play or signals a foul or violation. As for the other options: - Gravity: Gravity is the force that attracts two bodies of mass. It doesn't blow air, but it does influence the movement of air particles and helps maintain the Earth's atmosphere. - Density: Density refers to the mass of an object per unit volume. It plays a role in understanding how air moves, but density itself doesn't blow air. - Volume: Volume is a measure of the amount of space an object occupies. It can be used to describe the amount of air present in a particular space, but volume alone doesn't blow air. - Heat energy: Heat energy is a form of energy that transfers from warmer objects to cooler ones. It doesn't directly blow air; however, it can create differences in pressure and temperature, which can lead to wind and air being blown in natural environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: All superheroes come from somewhere. The background story of superheroes gives us a lot of information about those heroes. Who would Superman be without the destruction of Krypton? Who would Batman be without the death of his rich parents? Where does your hero come from? Who were/are your hero's parents? How did your hero gain powers or were they born with them? What does your hero do for a living? What was your character scared of as a child? Who are your character's friends? What does your character want? Does your character have any allies? Now comes the fun part. A superhero's look and uniform are the things that will set them apart from all the other heroes. Superheroes have to look cool, and ready to do battle with evil. Think of a few colors and specific clothing items that will mark your character. Let the uniform match the abilities. If your superhero has Superman-like abilities, they probably won't need much in the way of protective gear or fancy gadgets. Many characters wear masks to help protect their secret identity. In general, capes are Golden/Silver age traits for a hero, but it's still possible to get away with one. Come up with a symbol. What mark or badge will your character have to let people recognize them instantly? Think of Superman's S and the symbol on Green Lantern's ring. Some comic book heroes don't always have full uniforms, just little things that help you identify them. Think of Wolverine's hair and sideburns. Just as important to the story of a good superhero is their alter-ego or secret identity. A superhero is cool, but the alter-ego is where your superhero comes to life. What does your hero do when they're not swooping in to save the day? Who are they as real people? That's where great characters are made. Good superheroes need to struggle. Clark Kent is a perfect alter-ego for Superman because he can't do anything right. And the Kryptonian named Kal-El would probably struggle to get everything right on his new Earth home. In some cases, your hero's secret identity might come from the origin story. Maybe your character is a trash collector who gets superpowers after discovering some radioactive waste in the garbage. His/her secret identity might be his/her original job, collecting garbage. Superheroes aren't all good. Good heroes and good stories contain tension, which you can only get if your hero has something to struggle against. Character flaws are an essential part of any good character, superheroes included. What does your character want? What keeps your character from getting what they want? What is your superhero afraid of? What makes your superhero angry? What is your superheroes weakness? Now that you've got a series of good traits, abilities, and flaws built up for your character, it's time to pick an iconic name. Superheroes should have memorable names that will make for good titles for comic books. Pick one that matches your character's backstory and powers. Not all superheroes need to have names that end with \\"man.\\" John Constantine, Swamp Thing, and Wolverine are all great examples of superheroes that have different sorts of names.","completion":"The article talks about how to create a superhero character.

Tori was sad, but chose to make the best of it, and leaped out of her doggy door to play in her backyard outside. As she was playing with her favorite ball, Tori saw an opening in the fence. Excited, she ran over to the fence and squeezed out. She had never been on the street by herself before. Tori ran down the sidewalk, and happily barked at all the other dogs she passed. She loved to wag her tail in the summer breeze and was having a great time. All of a sudden, Tori was picked up by Ben and Mike, and thrown into a truck. She was lost and confused. Poor Tori didn't know what to do! The truck pulled up to a building with a big sign that said \\"Animal Control\\". Tori knew this was the place that people keep animals who are lost on the street. Once the workers took her inside, they put her into a cage. She was scared that Patty wouldn't know where to find her, but she knew Patty's phone number was on her collar.

Q: Given a question and a context passage, generate the answer having the word or phrase from the context passage. Here, the answer should be a shortest continous span from the passage. Context: Freshwater below Earths surface is called groundwater. The water infiltrates, or seeps down into, the ground from the surface. How does this happen? And where does the water go? Water infiltrates the ground because soil and rock are porous. Between the grains are pores, or tiny holes. Since water can move through this rock it is permeable. Eventually, the water reaches a layer of rock that is not porous and so is impermeable. Water stops moving downward when it reaches this layer of rock. Look at the diagram in Figure 13.11. It shows two layers of porous rock. The top layer is not saturated; it is not full of water. The next layer is saturated. The water in this layer has nowhere else to go. It cannot seep any deeper into the ground because the rock below it is impermeable. The top of the saturated rock layer in Figure 13.11 is called the water table. The water table isnt like a real table. It doesnt remain firmly in one place. Instead, it rises or falls, depending on how much water seeps down from the surface. The water table is higher when there is a lot of rain and lower when the weather is dry. An underground layer of rock that is saturated with groundwater is called an aquifer. A diagram of an aquifer is shown in Figure 13.12. Aquifers are generally found in porous rock, such as sandstone. Water infiltrates the aquifer from the surface. The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge. Most land areas have aquifers beneath them. Many aquifers are used by people for freshwater. The closer to the surface an aquifer is, the easier it is to get the water. However, an aquifer close to the surface is also more likely to become polluted. Pollutants can seep down through porous rock in recharge water. An aquifer that is used by people may not be recharged as quickly as its water is removed. The water table may lower and the aquifer may even run dry. If this happens, the ground above the aquifer may sink. This is likely to damage any homes or other structures built above the aquifer. One of the biggest aquifers in the world is the Ogallala aquifer. As you can see from Figure 13.13, this aquifer lies beneath parts of eight U.S. states. It covers a total area of 451,000 square kilometers (174,000 square miles). In some places, it is less than a meter deep. In other places, it is hundreds of meters deep. The Ogallala aquifer is an important source of freshwater in the American Midwest. This is a major farming area, and much of the water is used to irrigate crops. The water in this aquifer is being used up ten times faster than it is recharged. If this continues, what might happen to the Ogallala aquifer? The top of an aquifer may be high enough in some places to meet the surface of the ground. This often happens on a slope. The water flows out of the ground and creates a spring. A spring may be just a tiny trickle, or it may be a big gush of water. One of the largest springs in the world is Big Spring in Missouri, seen in Figure 13.14. Water flowing out of the ground at a spring may flow downhill and enter a stream. Thats what happens to the water that flows out of Big Spring in Missouri. If the water from a spring cant flow downhill, it may spread out to form a pond or lake instead. Lake George in New York State, which is pictured in Figure 13.15, is a spring-fed lake. The lake basin was carved by a glacier. Some springs have water that contains minerals. Groundwater dissolves minerals out of the rock as it seeps through the pores. The water in some springs is hot because it is heated by hot magma. Many hot springs are also mineral springs. Thats because hot water can dissolve more minerals than cold water. Grand Prismatic Spring, shown in Figure 13.16, is a hot mineral spring. Dissolved minerals give its water a bright blue color. The edge of the spring is Question: An aquifer is recharged by A:","completion":"The water that enters the aquifer is called recharge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Space Race was a 20th-century competition between two Cold War rivals, the Soviet Union (USSR) and the United States (US), for supremacy in spaceflight capability. It had its origins in the missile-based nuclear arms race between the two nations that occurred following World War II, enabled by captured German rocket technology and personnel. The technological superiority required for such supremacy was seen as necessary for national security, and symbolic of ideological superiority. The Space Race spawned pioneering efforts to launch artificial satellites, unmanned space probes of the Moon, Venus, and Mars, and human spaceflight in low Earth orbit and to the Moon. The competition began on August 2, 1955, when the Soviet Union responded to the US announcement four days earlier of intent to launch artificial satellites for the International Geophysical Year, by declaring they would also launch a satellite \\"in the near future\\". The Soviet Union beat the US to this, with the October 4, 1957 orbiting of Sputnik 1, and later beat the US to the first human in space, Yuri Gagarin, on April 12, 1961. The Space Race peaked with the July 20, 1969 US landing of the first humans on the Moon with Apollo 11. The USSR tried but failed manned lunar missions, and eventually cancelled them and concentrated on Earth orbital space stations. A period of détente followed with the April 1972 agreement on a co-operative Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, resulting in the July 1975 rendezvous in Earth orbit of a US astronaut crew with a Soviet cosmonaut crew.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. how is Santolina and Araujia related? A:","completion":"Santolina and Araujia are two distinct plant genera belonging to different plant families, but they share some common traits which relate them to each other indirectly. Let's dive deeper into the characteristics, classification, and commonalities between these two genera. 1. Classification: Santolina: This genus belongs to the Asteraceae family, which is commonly known as the daisy or sunflower family. It consists of aromatic, evergreen shrubs that are native to the Mediterranean region. The most well-known species in this genus is Santolina chamaecyparissus, also known as the cotton lavender or lavender cotton. Araujia: This genus belongs to the Apocynaceae family, which is commonly known as the dogbane family. It consists of perennial climbing vines and shrubs that are native to South America, with some species also found in Australia. The most well-known species in this genus is Araujia sericifera, also known as the cruel plant or moth vine. 2. Morphology: Both Santolina and Araujia have unique morphological features that differentiate them from each other, yet they share some similarities as well. Santolina: These evergreen shrubs typically have dense, silver-gray to green foliage, with small, linear or needle-like leaves. The flower heads are arranged in a corymbiform inflorescence consisting of small, tubular, yellow disc florets. The fruit produced is an achene. Araujia: These climbing vines and shrubs have opposite, simple leaves with a twining tendril emerging from the petiole's base. The flowers are typically tubular or bell-shaped, and the color ranges from white to pink or purple. The fruit is a large, pear-shaped follicle that contains numerous seeds with tufts of silky hairs. 3. Habitat and Distribution: While Santolina is native to the Mediterranean region and thrives in dry, sunny, well-drained soils, Araujia originates from South America and can be found in diverse environments such as tropical rainforests, subtropical woodlands, and temperate regions. Both genera have been introduced to other parts of the world as ornamental plants and, in some cases, have become invasive species. 4. Uses and Significance: Both Santolina and Araujia have been used for various purposes throughout history, such as medicinal, ornamental, and ecological roles. Santolina: Santolina has long been used in traditional medicine for various purposes, including anti-inflammatory, antispasmodic, and antifungal remedies. Additionally, the plant's aromatic and insect-repellent properties make it a popular choice for garden borders and companion planting. Araujia: Araujia sericifera has been primarily used as an ornamental plant due to its attractive flowers and foliage. However, it should be noted that this species can be invasive and harmful to native environments, which is why caution must be taken while planting it. It also has ethnobotanical uses in some traditional South American cultures. In conclusion, while Santolina and Araujia belong to different plant families and have distinct characteristics, they are indirectly related through their shared roles in the natural world. Both genera serve important ecological functions, provide ornamental value, and have historical uses in human culture. Despite these connections, it's crucial to recognize and respect their differences, unique traits, and specific ecological requirements."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: People who traveled in the past had to put up with many discomforts which we do not have nowadays, and of course they traveled far more slowly. Roads were bad indeed and you often found you could not get along at all because of the mud. In dry weather many places were thick in dust and when it was stormy, trees might fall across the road and it was nobody's business to clear _ away. Ordinary people traveled on foot or on horseback, but everyone who could afford it kept a private coach. There were public coaches too. called \\"stage coaches\\" because long journeys took several days and were done in stages, with stops over night at inns. Some stage, coaches ran only in the summer months. Others all the year around. They were very slow and crowded and passengers often became in on the way because of the swaying . Break downs were frequent, since many roads were not smooth. So a coach might very easily turn right over. Early in the century coach and wagon builders were encouraged to put very wide wheels on their vehicles. So that these might level the roads a little. But many people complained of this since it slowed travel down a good deal. Most travelers during the 18th century wrote bitterly about the state of the roads. One visitor to Sussex took six hours to travel nine miles in his coach; another wrote to a friend that on time of his journeys \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\". Question: The sentence \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\" suggests that _ . Options: A: the coaches were of poor quality B: the writers liked to describe the road bitterly C: the road condition was really poor D: travelling about in the past was extremely slow A:","completion":"The sentence \\"almost every mile was marked by the overturn of a carriage\\" suggests that Option C: the road condition was really poor. The article describes the discomforts people experienced while traveling in the past, with a focus on the poor road conditions and how it impacted travel. The mention of overturned carriages demonstrates that the roads were in bad shape, which can be attributed to the mud, dust, and fallen trees that were mentioned earlier in the article. These challenges made travel difficult and slow for people using private coaches, public stage coaches, and other forms of transportation. While it could be argued that Options A, B, and D have some relevance to the topic, it is clear that the primary concern expressed in the quote is the poor road condition. The coaches may have been of poor quality (Option A), but this does not directly pertain to the quote stating that carriages were overturned during their journey. The writers may have described the road bitterly (Option B), but the focus of this quote is on the road's condition, not necessarily the writers' emotions. Traveling in the past was undeniably slower (Option D), and while this is evident in the article, it is the poor road condition that directly contributes to the overturned carriages, thus making Option C the best answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The lumbosacral joint is a joint of the body, between the last lumbar vertebra and the first sacral segment of the vertebral column. In some ways, calling it a \\"joint\\" (singular) is a misnomer, since the lumbosacral junction includes a disc between the lower lumbar vertebral body and the uppermost sacral vertebral body, as well as two lumbosacral facet joints (right and left zygapophysial joints). - Vertebrates comprise all species of animals within the subphylum Vertebrata (chordates with backbones). Vertebrates represent the overwhelming majority of the phylum Chordata, with currently about 64,000 species described. Vertebrates include the jawless fish and the jawed vertebrates, which include the cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays) and the bony fish. - The cecum or caecum (plural ceca ; from the Latin \\"caecus\\" meaning blind) is an intraperitoneal pouch that is considered to be the beginning of the large intestine. It is typically located on the right side of the body (the same side of the body as the appendix, to which it is joined). - In human anatomy, the thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air is drawn into the lungs. - An intervertebral disc (or intervertebral fibrocartilage) lies between adjacent vertebrae in the vertebral column. Each disc forms a fibrocartilaginous joint (a symphysis), to allow slight movement of the vertebrae, and acts as a ligament to hold the vertebrae together. Their role as shock absorbers in the spine is crucial. - The pelvic inlet or superior aperture of the pelvis is a planar surface which defines the boundary between the pelvic cavity and the abdominal cavity (or, according to some authors, between two parts of the pelvic cavity, called lesser pelvis and greater pelvis). - The ascending colon is the part of the colon located between the cecum and the transverse colon. - The thorax or chest (from the Greek \\"thorax\\" \\"breastplate, cuirass, corslet\\" via ) is a part of the anatomy of humans and various other animals located between the neck and the abdomen. The thorax includes the thoracic cavity and the thoracic wall. It contains organs including the heart, lungs, and thymus gland, as well as muscles and various other internal structures. Many diseases may affect the chest, and one of the most common symptoms is chest pain. - In anatomy, the abdominal wall represents the boundaries of the abdominal cavity. The abdominal wall is split into the posterior (back), lateral (sides) and anterior (front) walls. - The rectum (from the Latin \\" \\", meaning \\"straight intestine\\") is the final straight portion of the large intestine in some mammals, and the gut in others. The human rectum is about long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge. - The transverse colon is the longest and most movable part of the colon . It crosses the abdomen from the ascending colon at the hepatic or right colic flexure with a downward convexity to the descending colon where it curves sharply on itself beneath the lower end of the spleen forming the splenic or left colic flexure . In its course , it describes an arch , the concavity of which is directed backward and a little upward . Toward its splenic end there is often an abrupt U-shaped curve which may descend lower than the main curve . It is almost completely invested by peritoneum , and is connected to the inferior border of the pancreas by a large and wide duplicature of that membrane , the transverse mesocolon . It is in relation , by its upper surface , with the liver and gall - bladder , the greater curvature of the stomach , and the lower end of the spleen ; by its under surface , with the small intestine ; by its anterior surface , with the posterior layer of the greater omentum and the abdominal wall ; its posterior surface is in relation from right to left with the descending portion of the duodenum , the head of the pancreas , and some of the convolutions of the jejunum and ileum . The transverse colon absorbs water and salts . - The pubic symphysis or symphysis pubis is the midline cartilaginous joint (secondary cartilaginous) uniting the superior rami of the left and right pubic bones. It is located anterior to the urinary bladder and superior to it. In males, the suspensory ligament of the penis attaches to the pubic symphysis. In females, the pubic symphysis is intimately close to the clitoris. In normal adults it can be moved roughly 2 mm and with 1 degree rotation. This increases for women at the time of childbirth. - The sigmoid colon (pelvic colon) is the part of the large intestine that is closest to the rectum and anus. It forms a loop that averages about 35-40 cm in length. The loop is typically shaped like a Greek letter sigma () or Latin letter S (thus \\"sigma\\" + \\"-oid\\"). This part of the colon normally lies within the pelvis, but on account of its freedom of movement it is liable to be displaced into the abdominal cavity. - The pelvic brim is the edge of the pelvic inlet. It is an approximately apple-shaped line passing through the prominence of the sacrum, the arcuate and pectineal lines, and the upper margin of the pubic symphysis. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - A lymph node or lymph gland, is an ovoid or kidney-shaped organ of the lymphatic system, and of the adaptive immune system, that is widely present throughout the body. They are linked by the lymphatic vessels as a part of the circulatory system. Lymph nodes are major sites of B and T lymphocytes, and other white blood cells. Lymph nodes are important for the proper functioning of the immune system, acting as filters for foreign particles and cancer cells. Lymph nodes do not have a detoxification function, which is primarily dealt with by the liver and kidneys. - The abdominal cavity is a large body cavity in humans and many other animals that contains many organs. It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm, a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs, and its floor is the pelvic inlet , opening into the pelvis. - The descending colon is the part of the large intestine from the splenic flexure to the beginning of the sigmoid colon. The function of the descending colon in the digestive system is to store the remains of digested food that will be emptied into the rectum. - The spleen (from Greek \\"spln\\") is an organ found in virtually all vertebrates. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - The cephalothorax, also called prosoma in some groups, is a tagma of various arthropods, comprising the head and the thorax fused together, as distinct from the abdomen behind. (The terms \\"prosoma\\" and \\"opisthosoma\\" are equivalent to \\"cephalothorax\\" and \\"abdomen\\" in some groups.) The word \\"cephalothorax\\" is derived from the Greek words for head and thorax . This fusion of the head and thorax is seen in chelicerates and crustaceans; in other groups, such as the Hexapoda (including insects), the head remains free of the thorax. In horseshoe crabs and many crustaceans, a hard shell called the carapace covers the cephalothorax. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - Blood is a body fluid in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. - The large intestine, or the large bowel, is the last part of the gastrointestinal tract and of the digestive system in vertebrates. Water is absorbed here and the remaining waste material is stored as feces before being removed by defecation.

San Diego lost 22-10 to the Broncos after struggling offensively for the second consecutive week. After entering the game with the 6th best record in the AFC, the loss was a blow to the Chargers' (8-6) playoff chances. It was their second consecutive home loss to the two teams tied for the best record in their conference. Denver's Manning threw a scoring pass to Demaryius Thomas at the end of the third quarter for their only touchdown of the game. The Chargers pulled to within six points at 16-10 after a TD catch by Gates with 10 minutes left. The Chargers trailed only 9-3 at the half after holding the Broncos to a field goal each time they entered the red zone. Manning was sick coming into the game, and left late in the second quarter with a thigh injury. Set up by a 58-yard punt return by Royal, Novak kicked a 30-yard field goal before the half ended for the Chargers' first score. Manning began the third quarter, and finished the game completing 14 of 20 passes for 233 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions. Novak missed two field goals in the game: a 46-yard attempt that was tipped by Derek Wolfe in the second quarter, and a 37-yard attempt that hit the left upright in the third. The Chargers were using a new holder with punter Mat McBriar, who was replacing the injured Scifres, but Novak refused to use it as an excuse. Novak placed the blame of the loss on himself, whose missed kicks would have tied the score and kept the game in reach. Rivers completed 24 of 41 attempts for 232 yards with two interceptions. Gates' touchdown was his 10th of the season, tying him with Gronkowski for most seasons with at least 10 touchdown catches by a tight end. Allen exited the game in the third quarter after suffering both a broken right collarbone and an injured right ankle in the second quarter; the collarbone sidelined him for the final two games of the season. The Chargers' defense limited Denver to 111 yards on 39 carries, an average of 2.8 yards per rush. They also held the Broncos to 3-for-12 on third-down conversions.

The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out.

Translation from Czech to English In English: Concerns or complaints about working hours may refer to issues that employees have with their schedules, the number of hours they are required to work, or the distribution of those hours across the workweek. These concerns can lead to dissatisfaction, stress, or other negative consequences for employees, and it's essential for employers to address these complaints in a fair and effective manner to maintain a healthy work environment. There are various reasons why employees might have complaints regarding working hours, and addressing these concerns can involve understanding the specific issues that employees are experiencing. Some common complaints related to working hours include: 1. Long working hours: Employees may be unhappy with frequent overtime or extended shifts, which can lead to burnout, increased stress, and reduced work-life balance. 2. Unpredictable schedules: Unpredictable or frequently changing schedules can be challenging for employees to manage, especially when it comes to balancing other commitments such as childcare or personal responsibilities. 3. Insufficient breaks or rest periods: Inadequate rest breaks or lack of time to recharge during the day can contribute to fatigue and decreased productivity. 4. Inflexible working hours: Employees may have concerns if their work schedule does not allow for flexibility, such as adjusting start and end times or working from home when necessary. 5. Unequal distribution of work hours: Workers may feel unfairly treated if some employees are consistently given more favorable hours or if there is a lack of transparency in how hours are assigned. To address these complaints effectively, employers should consider implementing measures that promote a healthier and more balanced approach to working hours. Some possible solutions include: 1. Establishing clear policies regarding working hours and overtime, including maximum hours and required rest periods. 2. Offering more predictable and stable work schedules, allowing employees to plan around their work commitments more effectively. 3. Ensuring that sufficient breaks are provided throughout the day, including time for employees to eat, rest, and recharge. 4.

Relationships that drain our energy can manifest in a variety of personality types. Recognize the various forms psychic vampires can take. Narcissistic psychic vampires have grandiose senses of self importance and entitlement. They tend to lack empathy and become withholding or cold if you don't do things their way. This is because they have little to no capacity for unconditional love. Victim vampires tend to see the world through the lens of \\"poor me.\\" They believe the world is inherently against them and to blame for their unhappiness. They tend to drain energy by constantly complaining about problems but refusing to try any potential solutions you suggest. Alternatively, they may act as a martyr, claiming that they do things for others but are never appreciated. Controlling energy vampires have a need to control and manipulate your actions. They often invalidate your emotions in order to dominate you or put you down. Constant talking psychic vampires take over conversations by constantly sharing their own feelings and experiences without giving you an opportunity to contribute. They might also invade physical boundaries, moving in so close you can feel their breath on you. Drama queen psychic vampires drain energy by exaggerating small instances. Being late for a meeting is the end of the world, and they convey small matters in a way that over-inflates their own importance, for better or worse. Take a minute to assess your relationship with potential psychic vampires. Question whether or not you feel drained by these people and whether the relationship is mutually beneficial.

Do you frequently find yourself in relationships that feel one-sided? If a relationship seems draining, question whether it's mutually beneficial for both parties. Psychic vampires thrive on one-sided friendships and romances. Think of the last time you were in emotional distress. Was this person there for you? Did he or she strive to listen or make the situation about themselves? If you've encountered a psychic vampire, there are physical and emotional side effects. You might have a relationship with an energy vampire if you display any of the following symptoms: Heavy eyelids and an increased need for sleep Decreasing levels of self-confidence or self-esteem Questioning your choices, feelings, and behaviors Low mood Desire to binge eat carbs and other comfort foods Feelings of anxiety, depression, and negativity You feel put down frequently","completion":"The article discusses the concept of psychic vampires, which are individuals who emotionally and energetically drain those around them through various behaviors and personality traits, such as narcissism, victim mentality, controlling behavior, constant talking, and being a drama queen.

Article:The survey taken at polling stations across the UK suggests the Tories could get 314 MPs when all the results have been counted in Thursday's election. Labour would get 266, the Lib Dems 14, UKIP none and the SNP 34, the GFK/Ipsos MORI poll for BBC/ITV/Sky suggests. Early results are suggesting a small swing to Labour but it is too early to say if the exit poll is accurate. Turnout is so far up by 3 points on the 2015 general election, which means it could be close to 70% by the end of the night, the highest since 1997. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson, who held his West Bromwich East seat, said the \\"hours to come look very uncertain\\", but added: \\"Theresa May's authority has been undermined by this election. She is a damaged prime minister and her reputation may never recover.\\" Labour saw off a Conservative challenge to hold Darlington and took Stockton South back from the Conservatives, denting Theresa May's hopes of a revival in the North East of England and a landslide victory. Labour gained Rutherglen and Hamilton West from the SNP, with an 8.9% swing, suggesting, said polling expert John Curtice, that the SNP \\"are going to suffer quite substantial losses\\". The SNP has also lost Angus, in North East Scotland, to the Conservatives. Labour also held Wrexham, a top Conservative target in Wales and took the Vale of Clwyd from the Conservatives, it's first gain of the night from Mrs May's party. Labour also took Battersea, in South London, from the Conservatives, with Treasury Minister Jane Ellison losing her seat. Labour's Shadow Foreign Secretary Emily Thornberry told BBC News: \\"It is possible that we will form the next government.\\" She ruled out a coalition, saying Labour would form a minority government in the event of a hung parliament, asking the smaller parties such as the Lib Dems and the SNP to support its programme in a Queen's Speech. But veteran Conservative Ken Clarke said he believed his party would have a \\"small overall majority\\" when all the votes have been counted, although we might not know the result until much later on Friday. Sorry, your browser cannot display this content. Enter a postcode or seat name To get an overall majority, one party needs to get 326 seats. The exit poll suggests the Conservatives would be 12 short of an overall majority. It suggests Labour would gain 34 seats, the Conservatives would lose 17 seats, the Lib Dems would gain six and the SNP lose 22 seats. The Green Party would be unchanged with one seat and Plaid Cymru would still have three MPs, according to the poll. In total, 30,450 people were interviewed as they exited 144 polling stations across the UK. If these numbers are correct, Theresa May played a high risk political game and has lost it - she didn't have to call this election, and only did so in order to give herself a mandate and breathing space during the bumpy ride of Brexit. Just a few weeks ago at the start of all of this she seemed unassailable, but a shaky campaign and an insurgent Labour Party may have dashed the Tories' hopes. This exit poll result is not what either parties were predicting privately - this would be another political surprise - the public again defying the expectations of both the main sides. The Conservatives do look set to be the largest party, it's not clear on these numbers if they will be able to govern alone - Theresa May's promise throughout was to offer her catchphrase \\"strong and stable leadership\\" - instead she may end diminished - but only of course, your votes, and the real results, will determine through the course of the night what really happens next. Evening Standard editor George Osborne, who was sacked as chancellor last year by Theresa May, said, if borne out by actual results, the \\"catastrophic\\" exit poll figures would put Mrs May's future as Conservative leader in doubt. SNP Deputy Leader Stewart Hosie said it would be an \\"extraordinary thing\\" for Theresa May \\"to call this election for narrow party advantage and then, if these numbers are correct, to blow it incredibly\\". He said the SNP would still win the election in Scotland, despite the exit poll forecasting substantial losses. A Lib Dem source said it was \\"too early\\" to comment on the exit poll, but added: \\"In this election holding our own is a good night.\\" The party ruled out going into coalition with either the Conservatives or Labour. Green co-leader Caroline Lucas said she could \\"hardly dare hope\\" that the exit poll was right, adding: \\"To be clear, Greens will never support a Tory government.\\" UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said: \\"If the exit poll is true then Theresa May has put Brexit in jeopardy. I said at the start this election was wrong. Hubris.\\" The Conservatives could still secure an overall majority if, as the exit poll suggests, they perform relatively well in constituencies that Labour are defending where a majority of all voters voted Leave in last year's EU referendum. They would also need to do better in marginal seats they are defending. If neither of these patterns materialises, but the exit poll's estimate of the overall levels of support for the parties is correct, then the Conservatives could lose their overall majority. In addition, there is some evidence from the exit poll that the Conservatives will perform relatively well in Wales. If the exit poll is correct the SNP could suffer heavier losses than was widely anticipated in advance of polling day. Indeed this, together with clear evidence of a Conservative revival north of the border, may yet provide the Tories with the extra seats that they might need to secure an overall majority. A total of 650 Westminster MPs will be elected, with more than 45 million people entitled to vote. Some votes had been cast before Thursday through postal voting, which accounted for 16% of the total electorate at the 2015 general election, when the overall turnout was 66%.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: In 1861 Saint-Saëns accepted his only post as a teacher, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse, Paris, which Louis Niedermeyer had established in 1853 to train first-rate organists and choirmasters for the churches of France. Niedermeyer himself was professor of piano; when he died in March 1861, Saint-Saëns was appointed to take charge of piano studies. He scandalised some of his more austere colleagues by introducing his students to contemporary music, including that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner. His best-known pupil, Gabriel Fauré, recalled in old age: After allowing the lessons to run over, he would go to the piano and reveal to us those works of the masters from which the rigorous classical nature of our programme of study kept us at a distance and who, moreover, in those far-off years, were scarcely known. ... At the time I was 15 or 16, and from this time dates the almost filial attachment ... the immense admiration, the unceasing gratitude I [have] had for him, throughout my life. Saint-Saëns further enlivened the academic regime by writing, and composing incidental music for, a one-act farce performed by the students (including André Messager). He conceived his best-known piece, The Carnival of the Animals, with his students in mind, but did not finish composing it until 1886, more than twenty years after he left the Niedermeyer school.In 1864 Saint-Saëns caused some surprise by competing a second time for the Prix de Rome. Many in musical circles were puzzled by his decision to enter the competition again, now that he was establishing a reputation as a soloist and composer. He was once more unsuccessful. Berlioz, one of the judges, wrote: We gave the Prix de Rome the other day to a young man who wasn't expecting to win it and who went almost mad with joy. We were all expecting the prize to go to Camille Saint-Saëns, who had the strange notion of competing.

Any high school students lucky enough to be accepted to Harvard University can easily count themselves among the country's best and brightest. The story of David Boone's journey from sleeping on a park bench to one of Harvard's dorm rooms, certainly stands out from the crowd of his peers. David, a 17-year-old senior at a MC2 Stem, a high school in Cleveland, Ohio that focuses largely on engineering and science classes with the help of a grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, was offered a full-ride scholarship to Harvard in the fall. His family life has been complicated for the past few years after gangs and economic hardships resulted in him being separated from his family and forced to look after himself on the streets and park benches in Cleveland. Because both his grandmother and mother could not afford to house the teenagers, his siblings split up to stay with various family friends, but because of space issues and his allergies to the families pets, David was unable to stay. He ended up in the safer neighborhood of Coventry where there was a safer park with fewer dangers. \\"All of these life lessons have shaped me into who I am, transforming my dreams and aspirations and allowing me to free myself from what was becoming an unproductive environment,\\" he wrote in his blog post. David's thirst for knowledge had never been reduced and his enthusiasm for engineering and science was growing. A short while later, Jeff McClellan, the principal of MC2 Stem was immediately impressed by David's dedication in the face of adversity, as well as his academic talent. \\"Here's a kid who's doing everything in his power to get where he wants to go and we had the available resources to provide a little additional support, \\"Mr McClellan told the local ABC News. At MC2 Stem, David found the exact fit, where it seems he was born to absorb what they were offering.

After a home discussion with his wife, McClellan decided to offer David a place to live until he could find another home. Mr McClellan and his wife took the teen in and helped him before he found a permanent solution. When it came to his next step, David aimed high and applied for a list of top colleges, including the University of Pennsylvania, MIT, Princeton, Cornell, Yale, Harvard and Washington University in St. Louis. In the end, only MIT rejected his application and he was left to choose his own fate from the selective prestigious and mostly Ivy League schools.

Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween.

Write an article based on this summary: Fifty-nine inmates have been killed in a single northern Brazilian prison this year, according to a judicial report. Article:","completion":"Title: Judicial Report Reveals Alarming Death Toll in Northern Brazilian Prison Introduction: A recent judicial report has highlighted a concerning issue in Brazil's prison system, revealing that fifty-nine inmates have been killed in a single northern Brazilian prison this year. This news has sparked outrage and raised questions about prison conditions and the need for criminal justice reform in the country. Background: The judicial report, which documents the number of fatalities in Brazilian prisons, has revealed a shocking death toll in a specific northern Brazilian prison. With fifty-nine inmates losing their lives in this particular facility, this number is considered alarming by human rights advocates and those familiar with prison conditions in Brazil. Prison Conditions and Overcrowding: One of the primary reasons behind the high death toll may be attributed to the overcrowded and inhumane living conditions in the prison. Inmates are often housed in extremely cramped spaces, with little to no access to basic necessities such as proper hygiene facilities, medical care, and sufficient nutrition. Additionally, the lack of well-trained prison staff exacerbates the problem as they may not be able to efficiently manage and control the prison population. Gang-Related Violence: Another factor contributing to the deaths is the prevalence of gang-related violence. Brazilian prison gangs often exercise significant power within the facilities, leading to territorial disputes and violence between rival groups. This brutal gang culture is known to perpetuate violence and creates an atmosphere of constant fear among inmates. Call for Criminal Justice Reform: The judicial report's findings emphasize the urgent need for criminal justice reform in Brazil. Advocates are urging the government to address the issues of overcrowded prisons, harsh living conditions, and gang-related violence through various measures. These include investing in staff and infrastructure, increasing the availability of rehabilitation programs, and implementing strategies to break down power structures within prison facilities. Conclusion: The troubling revelations of this report have put a spotlight on Brazil's prison system and the pressing need for reform. As citizens, officials, and human rights advocates call for change, it is crucial that the Brazilian government takes decisive action to address these concerning issues and to put an end to the needless loss of life behind bars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What did Chartwell have extensive views of? , can you please find it? Chartwell is a country house near the town of Westerham, Kent in South East England. For over forty years it was the home of Winston Churchill. He bought the property in September 1922 and lived there until shortly before his death in January 1965. In the 1930s, when Churchill was excluded from political office, Chartwell became the centre of his world. At his dining table, he gathered those who could assist his campaign against German re-armament and the British government's response of appeasement; in his study, he composed speeches and wrote books; in his garden, he built walls, constructed lakes and painted. During the Second World War Chartwell was largely unused, the Churchills returning after he lost the 1945 election. In 1953, when again Prime Minister, the house became Churchill's refuge when he suffered a devastating stroke. In October 1964, he left for the last time, dying at his London home, 28, Hyde Park Gate, on 24 January 1965. The origins of the estate reach back to the 14th century; in 1382 the property, then called Well-street, was sold by William-at-Well. It passed through various owners and in 1836 was auctioned, as a substantial, brick-built manor. In 1848, it was purchased by John Campbell Colquhoun, whose grandson sold it to Churchill. The Campbell Colquhouns greatly enlarged the house and the advertisement for its sale at the time of Churchill's purchase described it as an \\"imposing\\" mansion. Between 1922 and 1924, it was largely rebuilt and extended by the society architect Philip Tilden. From the garden front, the house has extensive views over the Weald of Kent, \\"the most beautiful and charming\\" Churchill had ever seen, and the determining factor in his decision to buy the house. In 1946, when financial constraints forced Churchill to again consider selling Chartwell, it was acquired by the National Trust with funds raised by a consortium of Churchill's friends led by Lord Camrose, on condition that the Churchills retain a life-tenancy. After Churchill's death, Lady Churchill...","completion":"Chartwell has extensive views of the Weald of Kent.

This can be done by searching for reliable sources of information, such as medical journals, websites, and expert recommendations. It's important to consider the pros and cons of each remedy and make sure to avoid self-prescribed treatments without proper guidance. Step 2: Maintain a food journal Keeping track of the food consumed and symptoms experienced can help in identifying potential triggers and making the necessary adjustments to the diet. This will aid in managing gastroparesis symptoms more effectively. Step 3: Consume smaller, more frequent meals Eating smaller portions of food spread throughout the day can be helpful in managing this condition. Breaking the meals into 5-6 smaller portions can prevent the stomach from becoming overly full and reduce the strain on the digestive system, making it easier to process the food. Step 4: Choose easily digestible foods Selecting foods that are easily digestible, such as low-fat, low-fiber, and soft-textured items, can help in easing the strain on the stomach and promoting better digestion. Step 5: Stay hydrated Drinking enough water is crucial for overall health and digestion. Ensure that you consume an adequate amount of fluids throughout the day, avoiding carbonated and caffeinated drinks, as they can exacerbate gastroparesis symptoms. Step 6: Engage in gentle activities after meals Engaging in mild physical activities like walking or doing simple stretches after meals can promote proper digestion and reduce the likelihood of experiencing gastroparesis symptoms. Step 7: Consider natural supplements Certain herbal supplements and enzymes have been suggested to help improve digestion and alleviate gastroparesis symptoms. Speak with a healthcare professional about the use of natural supplements to support digestive health and ensure they do not interfere with any existing medications. Step 8: Manage stress Stress can negatively impact the digestive system, so it's essential to implement stress-reducing activities like meditation, yoga, and deep breathing exercises to maintain a healthy mind and body. Step 9: Seek professional guidance As mentioned initially, visiting a doctor or dietitian is crucial for creating a personalized diet plan and getting expert advice tailored to the individual's needs. In conclusion, treating gastroparesis naturally involves researching the condition, making dietary adjustments, staying hydrated, engaging in gentle activities, managing stress, and seeking professional guidance for a personalized approach.

Okay it was an older house that need some renovation work, but there was something about the place that just did not seem right. But despite that, it was available for purchase at what seemed to be a very attractive price … always a good starting point. Anyway, the real estate agent finished taking me around the property answering the questions that I had, and I left with a plan to do some costings before making a decision. But something was niggling me and making me feel a little uncomfortable, so I decided to investigate the property further. A couple of days later I was around at a friends house. He was in the Police force and as it happened he was in the same neighbourhood, I mentioned this particular property that I was looking at buying. He asked me the actual address after which he ‘kindly’ informed me that that that house had been the scene of a murder 6 months previously. It turned out that the property had been rented to a homosexual couple and that after an argument, one had murdered the other in the bath and then proceeded to cut his head off. Apparently the head was subsequently discovered a week later in the trunk of a car that had been abandoned up by a local golf-course. Less than impressed that the real estate agent had been less than forthcoming with me, I made the decision to not to proceed with the purchase. As they say in the property business ‘Location, Location, Location’ is always an important factor in determining the value of a property.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Most chemical reactions within organisms would be impossible under the conditions in cells. For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . Essentially, enzymes are biological catalysts. Now, I have a new situation: Mark is a biologist. He is trying to see how to make chemical reactions within organism easier. To that end, he conducts two tests, test A an test B, on an organism. In test A he reduces catalysts from the organism, but in test B he induces catalysts in the organism. He needs to observe the outcomes of these tests. Answer this question please: Would test B see reactions taking place slower or faster than test A? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided background information, test B would see reactions taking place faster than test A. In test A, Mark reduces the catalysts (enzymes) from the organism. Since catalysts are responsible for speeding up chemical reactions, reducing their presence would result in slower reaction rates within the organism. This could potentially hinder the organism's ability to carry out essential life processes efficiently. In test B, Mark induces (increases) catalysts in the organism.

He quickly became confused and lost, so he just kept driving. The last 60 miles of his journey consisted of a low speed police chase. This poor man was scared to death and only pulled over when his vehicle ran out of gas. A request was made for us to send an officer to transport this gentleman the 200 miles back to his home. Because we were at minimum shift strength, the Sergeant determined that a family member would have to go and get him. I returned to work the following night and at nightly briefing, I asked if anyone had an update on the man’s transport. The sergeant said he hadn’t heard anything, which is when a junior patrolman spoke up. He said that man is from my neighborhood and after I got home from work this morning, I drove the 400 mile round trip and picked up my neighbor and returned him home to his wife. I just got back into town about an hour ago, so I changed into my uniform, and I’m here for my shift!

So this officer stayed up all day after a working the midnight shift and used his own car for the 400 mile trip. The officer said when he picked the man up at the station; he looked at the officer and smiled. He recognized his neighbor.

TMZ Sports has learned. First off, we're told Janoris was out of the state when the body was discovered early Tuesday morning -- but sources connected to the NFL player tell us his camp is aware of the situation. We don't know if cops have identified a suspect or even have a working theory on how the person died. Sources tell us the body was discovered in the basement by a worker at the house. Law enforcement officers in Bergen County raced to the scene. We're told the coroner showed up a short time later. The identity of the victim is unclear -- we know investigators are actively working the case. One source connected to Jenkins says the NFL player has been in Florida and was not at the home when cops arrived. We've reached out to JJ's reps for comment -- but, so far, no word back. ||||| The body of a music producer was found Tuesday inside a Fair Lawn home owned by New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins. The dead man was identified Tuesday night as 25-year-old Roosevelt Rene, a Jenkins family friend. Jenkins, a Florida native, has reportedly been in that state since Giants mini-camp broke early this month. Rene produced music under the name Trypps Beatz and numerous fans took to Twitter Tuesday night to post condolences. How Rene died has not yet been determined, and is pending an autopsy by the Bergen County Medical Examiner's Office, authorities said. Public records show that Rene previously lived in Dallas, Georgia, and Spring Valley, N.Y. Jenkins was a second round pick by St. Louis Rams in 2012 and has been with the Giants since 2016, when he was selected to the Pro Bowl. He also raps under the name Rabbit during his time away from football. TMZ reported that Rene's body was discovered in the basement by a worker at the home.

Metzler declined to give specifics about the investigation, but said police have never been called to Jenkins' home in the past. A neighbor at the scene, who identified herself only as Debbie, said Jenkins lives at the home with his brother. She said she never had any issues with either of them and was shocked when she heard the body was found at the home. Investigators were seen digging through the contents of a white Lexus sedan with Florida plates in the driveway as well as a Land Rover. They also removed several small brown paper bags from the home and loaded them into an unmarked prosecutor's office SUV. Prosecutor's office detectives left the home around 9 p.m. and only a marked Fair Lawn Police car remained at the scene. The Giants said that they were aware of, and monitoring the situation. Jenkins, voted to his first Pro Bowl in 2016 is a key member of the Giants' secondary. However, he is coming off a season-ending ankle injury suffered in Week 9 against Washington last year. Despite the injury cutting his season short, Jenkins intercepted three passes and returned two of them for touchdowns, in addition to making 26 tackles.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Peter Gill told the BBC that UK courts would not accept forensic tests whose details are kept secret due to commercial confidentiality issues. He said this would prevent proper scrutiny of forensic techniques. Professor Gill also warned the National DNA Database needed upgrades urgently. And that without them, the UK resource would fall behind comparable systems used in other countries. Late last year, the government said the Forensic Science Service would be wound up, adding that as many of its operations as possible were to be transferred or sold off. The Home Office, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the National Policing Improvement Agency (NPIA) agreed to set up a working group to ensure a \\"smooth transition\\" as the Forensic Science Service (FSS) was wound down. Now based at the University of Oslo, Norway, Peter Gill helped develop the DNA fingerprinting technique used widely by crime scene investigators - along with Sir Alec Jeffreys at the University of Leicester. \\"Courts will not accept secret tests that have not been subject to rigorous peer review and challenge,\\" Professor Gill has said in his submission to the House of Commons science committee's inquiry into the closure of the Forensic Science Service (FSS). \\"The public will not accept sub-standard tests being used in any laboratory.\\" He added: \\"An exploratory framework is needed to discover whether laboratories are providing sub-standard results.\\" Professor Gill cited one recent court case where the judge criticised the FSS for using an internally developed \\"commercial in confidence\\" database. \\"This case... demonstrates that a serious mismatch exists between the government's aspiration to privatise forensic science, versus the court requirement for openness, disclosure, and scientific peer review,\\" said Professor Gill. \\"It is easily demonstrated, therefore, that the framework to utilise forensic science in the UK, where the market is entirely privatised, is already fatally flawed.\\" The FSS analyses evidence from crime scenes in England and Wales, but has been losing about £2m a month. It employed 1,600 people and handled more than 120,000 cases each year. \\"The NPIA, ACPO and Home Office will continue to work with the Forensic Science Service to ensure that transition arrangements are in place to manage the wind-down of their forensic services,\\" said a joint statement from ACPO and the NPIA. The government wants private enterprise, which currently makes up 40% of the market, to fill the gap left behind by the FSS. However, many experts are sceptical that this can work and point out that the UK's private forensics sector is shrinking. There are also concerns that an over-emphasis on profits could threaten the quality of science. At the time of the government's announcement, Crime Reduction Minister James Brokenshire said private sector competition for police contracts was enabling forces to achieve greater efficiency. He said that the Forensic Science Regulator should ensure that quality standards are maintained. Professor Gill said the UK's National DNA Database was already out of date, and in urgent need of upgrades to bring it in line with standards rapidly being adopted elsewhere in the European Union. He said there was no timescale or coherent strategy for the adoption of these standards in the UK. \\"Being locked in the past, the inevitable consequence is that casework is carried out with less efficiency than would otherwise be the case elsewhere in the EU. Cases will effectively be 'lost' - i.e. they will fail to provide probative results in laboratories not equipped with the latest technology,\\" said Peter Gill.

Older learners are often more motivated to learn and have a greater grasp on their current reading level. Ask them for their self-assessed reading level and what they're comfortable reading now. Start there and make adjustments as necessary. It's also a good idea to get an idea of what their interests are so that you can meet their needs. You could ask questions like these: \\"What are your favorite genres?\\" \\"What do you find interesting to read about?\\" or \\"What do you think makes reading the most difficult?\\" Adolescent and adult learners understandably don’t want to read children’s books. For these students, search for crime fiction or other adult themes tailored to low literacy levels. You could also look for edited versions of the classic authors, such as Shakespeare. Some possible choices are: Reading Shakespeare with Young Adults by Mary Ellen Dakin The Fire Next Time by James Baldwin Before We were Free by Julia Alvarez Divide students into small groups. Have them read the title of their assigned reading, as well as the captions to any illustrations in the reading. By reserving time for this activity in class, you’ll emphasize the importance of previewing in their future readings. Some examples of guiding questions for this assignment are: This book is called How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents. Based on that title, what do you think this book is about? What information does this photograph of Civil Rights activists sitting at a “Whites Only” counter give us about the newspaper article? Dictionaries are great, but looking up individual words can make readers lose their focus of the subject matter of their assignment. Teach students the importance of figuring out the meanings or significance of words from the context of the sentence or paragraph. You can teach context though: Fill-in-the-blank questions. Students complete by choosing one of three possible words under or to the side of the question. Antonym exercises. Students must figure out the meaning of one word by analyzing the use of its antonym (a word they already know) in the same sentence. An example would be: While Mrs. Smith welcomed all immigrants, her neighbor was xenophobic. What does xenophobic mean? Have your students plan which strategies they’ll use for their assigned readings. For the next class, ask them which strategies helped the most. Examples of reading strategies are: Skimming Using context Trying to predict what will happen next in a narrative Summary:","completion":"To help older learners improve their reading skills, start by asking them about their self-assessed reading level and preferred genres.

Finally, encourage students to plan and apply different reading strategies, such as skimming and predicting, and discuss which strategies worked best for them in the next class.

The answer is:","completion":"Gaston Camille Charles Maspero, a prominent figure in the field of Egyptology, was born on June 23, 1846, in Paris, France. His fascination with the ancient world, coupled with his academic pursuits, led him to contribute significantly to our understanding of ancient Egypt and its culture. In his youth, Maspero showed an extraordinary appetite for learning and soon found his interests veering towards ancient civilizations. His birthplace, Paris, with its renowned libraries and museums, served as an excellent canvas for nurturing his curiosity about Egypt. Maspero's prime years were dedicated to the academic exploration of Egypt's ancient past. His occupation as an Egyptologist entailed rigorous research, interpretation, and teaching. His work significantly enriched the field of Egyptology. His profound interest in hieroglyphics, Egyptian artifacts, and their underlying significance led to considerable advancements in our understanding of ancient Egyptian civilization. Interestingly, Maspero's enthusiasm for Egyptology was passed down to the next generation of his family. His son, Henri Maspero, followed in his father's footsteps, building on the scholarly foundation laid by his father to further enhance the study of ancient civilizations, particularly the Far East region. Notably, the Maspero lineage of scholars didn't stop there. François Maspero, Gaston's grandson, also carried forward his family's legacy in the academic realm, though he adopted a different but no less important field. Gaston Maspero's life was a testament to the power of academic curiosity. His relentless dedication to the study of ancient Egypt led to significant revelations about the civilization's culture, rituals, and everyday life. He spent his life educating others and expanding the understanding of a civilization that existed thousands of years ago. In addition to his professional endeavors, Gaston Maspero's life was marked by personal relationships. Family stood as a pillar of strength in his life, with his relatives playing a vital role in shaping his personal and professional journey, providing a framework of support, encouragement, and inspiration. However, even a life as remarkable as Maspero’s had to meet an end. He passed away in Paris on June 30, 1916. His passing marked the end of a monumental chapter in the history of Egyptology. Today, his contributions are immortalized not just in the volumes of knowledge he left behind, but also through his image, captured in the photograph gaston_maspero.jpg. This image, frozen in time, encapsulates the spirit of an individual who ventured into the depths of history and brought back gems of wisdom and knowledge. In conclusion, Gaston Camille Charles Maspero's life was a blend of extensive scholarly pursuits and familial bonding. Born into a world rapidly advancing, he sought solace in the mysteries of the past, unveiling secrets of an ancient civilization. His dedication and hard work resonate through the halls of academic institutions even today, inspiring a new generation of Egyptologists. His life and remarkable contributions to Egyptology narrate a story of intellectual pursuit, undying curiosity, and familial continuity. His legacy survives, reaching across the boundaries of time and space, emphasizing the relevance of past civilizations in shaping our understanding of human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
