While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: This is the most efficient, and often preferred, way of performing a partial water change, especially in larger tanks. Attach the device directly to your faucet and then insert one of the connected hoses and siphon attachments into your tank. The device will automatically suck out water for you, until you switch it off. Then, flip the switch again and insert the faucet hose to refill the tank. This method is especially useful for those people unable to haul multiple buckets of water around in order to perform regular cleanings. It also minimizes the potential to create a watery mess. Just make sure that the new water that you are adding is close to the original temperature of the tank. Check this before starting the automatic suctioning process. If you don’t have an all-in-one system, then you will need to perform the water switch by hand. Start by placing the tube end of your siphon into a bucket. Then, place the siphon tip into the tank’s substrate, usually gravel or sand. Repeatedly insert the siphon deep into the sand at an angle, drawing out both debris and tank water. Don’t feel as if you have to perfectly clean all of the gravel during each change. In fact, it is better if you section off your tank and clean certain areas of the gravel each time. This lessens the impact of the change for your fish. As you move your siphon around, you will notice that your bucket begins to fill with dirty gravel and murky tank water, this is perfectly normal and what you want. However, don’t take it too far. Use your siphon to remove a maximum of 30% of the tank’s water. Going beyond this can irreparably alter your tank’s chemistry. For example, if you have a 10 gallon tank, it is a good idea to use a 3 gallon bucket for water changes. Then, when the bucket is full, you know that you’ve removed the right amount of water. Now that your tank is less full, spend a bit of time checking out the status of your tank from an inside view. If you don’t fully remove your decorations, then perhaps pick them up and look them over for any damage. Check to make sure that all of your heating and filtration systems seem okay in structure. If you have a tank-side thermometer, make a quick note of the temperature of the water post-drain. Otherwise, it is a good idea to dip a thermometer into the water to get a reading. Then, test the temperature of the clean, treated water that you will add to the tank in a bit. Make sure that the two temperatures match. If not, you may need to give it a some more time before completing the change. Water temperature fluctuations can make fish more susceptible to illness. Make sure to take the tank’s temperature again after you’ve added in the fresh water. At this point, you will want to move the pretreated water from the bucket into the tank. You can do this by pouring the water into a pitcher and then emptying the pitcher into the tank. Or, you can hold the bucket with both hands and empty it directly into the tank. Whichever method you choose, just make sure that the water doesn’t rush in super-fast and disturb the gravel and your decorations. Some people like to use their hand, or a plate, to lessen the direct flow of the water into the tank. If you’ve taken out any of your artificial decorations, you can add them back in either immediately before, or directly after, refilling the tank. You can use this as an opportunity to move items around, or to leave items out entirely for a new look. All of the functioning systems that you unplugged at the start of this process now need to be hooked up again. Make sure your hands are dry and carefully reinstall and restart all of these items. Some types of filers, such as the hang-on ones, will need 1-2 cups of water directly fed into the system before they will start working. Create a designated area where you keep all of your tank cleaning supplies. You will want to allow your buckets, scrubbers, and siphon to air dry before storing. Keeping up with regular storage procedures may keep you from having to buy replacements. Summary:","completion":"This article describes a preferred method for partial water changes in larger aquariums using a faucet-attached device. The device simplifies the process of removing and replacing water, helps avoid watery messes, and reduces the need to carry heavy buckets. It's important to ensure the temperature of the new water matches the original tank's temperature to prevent fish from getting sick. During the water change, users can also check the tank's interior, equipment, decorations, and reposition them if needed. After completing the water change, allow cleaning supplies to air dry before storing them and ensure all tank systems are properly reinstalled and functioning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Obamas and Bidens spent hundreds of thousands of taxpayer dollars on three separate vacation trips during last year's President's Day weekend, records show. The total tab for he U.S. Secret Service came to at least 295,437. President Barack Obama spent that weekend golfing in West Palm Beach, Florida with Tiger Woods' former coach, and appeared briefly with the golf superstar. The first lady and the Obamas' daughters took their annual three-day weekend jaunt to the Colorado ski resort town of Aspen, where they might have bumped into Vice President and Mrs. Biden – who were there on a separate vacation trip. The watchdog group Judicial Watch obtained records from the Secret Service through a Freedom of Information Act request, learning that the cost of protecting the president that weekend came to 98,135.79. That total included 32,406.50 for flights, 16,466.25 for rental cars and 48,490 for hotel rooms. President Obama played golf for three days in Florida while Secret Service agents kept watch and blocked traffic for his motorcade -- all at a steep price. The first lady and the Obama children hti the slopes in Aspen, billing the taxpayers tens of thousands of dollars in related security expenses. The U.S. Secret Service protects current and past presidents, vice presidents and their families year-round, whether they're at work in Washington or just vacationing on a golf course somewhere. 'The Obamas and Vice President Biden are oblivious to the costs to taxpayers for their vacation travel,' Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. Michelle Obama's trip cost the government at least 81,523.64 to keep her, Sasha and Malia safe, including 13,221.30 for flights, 3,925 for rental cars and a whopping 64,377.34 in weekend hotel bills. Not to be outdone, the Bidens' ski weekend cost the most in hard dollars: 115,777.61. The vice presidential family's security detail spent 92,596 on lodging, 17,866.61 on car rentals and 5,315 on flights. President Obama's trip also carried another substantial cost: Air Force One is among the world's most expensive aircraft to operate. The president's private Boeing 747 costs taxpayers 179,750 per hour to fly, according to government estimates published in 2012. First lady Michelle Obama schussed down hills at the Buttermilk ski area in Aspen, trailed by Secret Service the whole way. Actual size: Air Force One costs nearly 180,000 PER HOUR to operate. Who, me? -- Michelle Obama's security detail for a three-day ski trip last year set taxpayers back more than 81,000. The Obama administration has come under fire for the expenses it incurs on personal travel and parties. There have been no estimates yet on the cost of Mrs. Obama's 50th birthday soiree at the White House.

Carney referred him to the East Wing, where Mrs. Obama's office is located, for the answer.

Afterwards, I will compare the questions to determine whether their meanings overlap. Step 1: Investigate the differences between Lyft Line and UberPool Lyft Line and UberPool are both services offered by their respective companies, Lyft and Uber. They are designed to be more affordable options by allowing riders heading in the same direction to share a ride. The main differences between Lyft Line and UberPool lie mostly within the pricing structure, the companies' footprints, and customizability of the ride. However, both services mostly operate with the same objective: to save passengers money while reducing the number of cars on the road. Step 2: Check if Lyft Line or UberPool allows reservations for 2 passengers Lyft Line and UberPool typically allow riders to reserve a ride for up to 2 passengers. However, this may depend on the specific market and availability of the service in the area since both companies have altered their shared ride options recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

You guys don’t drink.’ The weekend incident comes two years after Ford’s drunken St. Patrick’s Day party inside the mayor’s office and months after he swore off drinking entirely after he admitted to smoking crack cocaine while in a 'drunken stupor.' After his crack-smoking confession last November, Ford swore off booze entirely, claiming that he had a ‘come to Jesus moment.’ He admitted to drinking again in January after video surfaced online of him inside the Steak Queen restaurant in Etobicoke where he appeared intoxicated as he swore and ranted in Jamaican patois.

Your flock may get territorial of their food and water dishes since they will feel more dominant in the run. Add at least 1 additional food and water station inside the pen when you plan on bringing in your new chickens. Keep the new stations away from the existing ones so your chickens don’t fight one another when you introduce them. After your chickens are familiarized with one another, try letting the new chickens into the run while the rest of the flock is inside the coop. Let the new birds explore the chicken run for 10-15 minutes so they can get accustomed to the new space. Keep watching the chickens to see how they interact with the space to make sure they’re comfortable in the new pen. It doesn’t matter if you raise your chickens in a pen or free-range. Always let the new chickens explore the area first so they get used to the space. After your new chickens have spent a little bit of time in the run, let the rest of the flock out of the chicken coop so your birds can intermingle with one another. Make sure to watch your birds the whole time to make sure they interact well with each other. Let the birds act naturally and don’t try to force them together since they could get aggressive. It’s normal for your chickens to get into small fights with one another since they need to establish a new pecking order to determine which bird is dominant. While it’s normal for your chickens to get into small fights with one another, they can get more aggressive if the fights escalate. If you notice any birds that are bleeding, take them out of the run so they don’t get any permanent injuries. Take the chickens that attack any other birds and keep them alone in separate pens so they don’t hurt one another again. Keep the birds in isolation for 1-2 days before reintroducing them. Distract the chickens with treats so you can break up any fights before they even happen. After your chickens are comfortable around one another, they may join the rest of the flock in the coop at night. If the new chickens follow the flock into the coop, let them stay there for the night so they can continue familiarizing themselves with one another. If the chickens return back to their own pen or crate, then allow them to get comfortable on their own. It may take 4-5 times for your new chickens to feel comfortable with the rest of the flock. If the chickens return to their own crate, then you can transfer them into the coop at night so they wake up with the rest of the flock. Summary:","completion":"1. Add extra food and water stations in the pen for the new chickens. 2. Let new chickens explore the run while the existing flock is in the coop. 3. Monitor their interactions and comfort level in the new pen. 4. Introduce the rest of the flock and continue monitoring their interactions. 5.

Step 1: Read and comprehend the review provided. The review is in French, so if you don't understand French, you can use a translation tool like Google Translate to get an idea of what the review is about. Step 2: Identify the positive and negative aspects mentioned in the review. Positive aspects: - Nice selection of Asian restaurants in the area. - GaNaDaRa is a small, friendly, and welcoming Korean restaurant. - Offers typical Korean dishes such as Ramens, Bibimbap, Bulgogi, and Kimchi. - Food is decent (Ramens are correct, Bibimbaps are good). - Attracts a diverse clientele, mostly Korean and Asian students. - Good value for money (as an example, a bowl of Ramens accompanied by rice costs around 7). - Ideal place to fill up for a small price after an evening in the city center or after a night class at the university. Negative aspects: - Not the best Korean restaurant in Montreal. - Bibimbaps could be more flavorful and spicy. - Cuisine lacks refinement. Step 3: Weigh the positive and negative aspects, and provide a rating based on the overall impression.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the last names of the two people who are thought to be rustlers by the bar patrons? In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford). Martin claims that he purchased the cattle from Kinkaid but received no bill of sale. No one believes Martin, and the posse decides to hang the three men at sunrise. Martin writes a letter to his wife and asks Davies, the only member of the posse that he trusts, to deliver it. Davies reads the letter, and, hoping to save Martin's life, shows it to the others. Davies believes that Martin is innocent and does not deserve to die.

Sentence 1: \\"Perhaps that thought crossed his mind because Hunt Rennie stood by the fireplace moving the toe of his boot back and forth across a smear of gray powder.\\" This sentence tells us that Hunt Rennie is standing by the fireplace and performing a specific action with his boot. In addition, it suggests that there might be a thought crossing Hunt's mind, which is the reason for his action. Sentence 2: \\"Hunt stood by the fireplace while thinking.\\" This sentence simply states that Hunt is standing by the fireplace and thinking. Now, we need to determine if the information from Sentence 1 entails the information from Sentence 2. Let's break down the details of each sentence: - Both sentences mention that Hunt Rennie is standing by the fireplace. - Sentence 1 implies that Hunt is thinking since the thought is crossing his mind, and Sentence 2 explicitly states that Hunt is thinking.

Information: - A fixed-wing aircraft is an aircraft, such as an aeroplane, which is capable of flight using wings that generate lift caused by the vehicle's forward airspeed and the shape of the wings. Fixed-wing aircraft are distinct from rotary-wing aircraft, in which the wings form a rotor mounted on a spinning shaft, and ornithopters, in which the wings flap in similar manner to a bird. - General Dynamics Corporation is an American aerospace and defense multinational corporation. Formed by mergers and divestitures, it is the world's fifth-largest defense contractor based on 2012 revenues. General Dynamics is headquartered in West Falls Church, Fairfax County, Virginia. - In military tactics, close air support (CAS) is defined as air action by fixed or rotary-winged aircraft against hostile targets, that are in close proximity to friendly forces, and which requires detailed integration of each air mission with fire and movement of these forces. - In the broadest definition, a sensor is an object whose purpose is to detect events or changes in its environment and sends the information to the computer which then tells the actuator (output devices) to provide the corresponding output. A sensor is a device that converts real world data (Analog) into data that a computer can understand using ADC (Analog to Digital converter) - A fire-control system is a number of components working together, usually a gun data computer, a director, and radar, which is designed to assist a weapon system in hitting its target. It performs the same task as a human gunner firing a weapon, but attempts to do so faster and more accurately. - The Lockheed AC-130 gunship is a heavily armed, long-endurance ground-attack variant of the C-130 Hercules transport fixed-wing aircraft. It carries a wide array of anti-ground oriented weapons that are integrated with sophisticated sensors, navigation, and fire-control systems. Unlike other military fixed-wing aircraft, the AC-130 relies on visual targeting. Because its large profile and low operating altitudes (around 7,000 ft) make it an easy target, it usually flies close air support missions at night. - Navigation is a field of study that focuses on the process of monitoring and controlling the movement of a craft or vehicle from one place to another. The field of navigation includes four general categories: land navigation, marine navigation, aeronautic navigation, and space navigation. - The General Dynamics GAU - 12/U Equalizer is a five - barrel 25 mm Gatling - type rotary cannon . The GAU - 12/U is used by the United States , Italy and Spain , which mount the weapon in their fighter jets such as the AV - 8B Harrier II , airborne gunships such as the Lockheed AC - 130 , and land - based fighting vehicles . - An 'electric motor is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. The reverse of this is the conversion of mechanical energy into electrical energy and is done by an electric generator. - A multinational corporation\\"\\" or worldwide Enterprise is a corporate organization that owns or controls production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country. It can also be referred as an international corporation, a transnational corporation, or a stateless corporation. - A gunship is a military aircraft armed with heavy guns, primarily intended for attacking ground targets. - A rotary cannon, rotary autocannon, or Gatling-type cannon is a rapid-firing weapon that utilizes multiple barrels in a rotating cluster to provide a sustained rate of fire greater than single-barreled machine guns or automatic cannon of equivalent caliber. The loading, firing, and unloading functions are performed simultaneously in different barrels as they rotate, and the rotation also permits the barrels some time to cool. The rotating barrel cluster on most Gatling-type guns is powered by an external force such as an electric motor, although gas-operated versions have also been developed. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - A cannon (plural: \\"cannon\\" or \\"cannons\\") is any piece of artillery that uses gunpowder or other usually explosive-based propellants to launch a projectile, which may or may not be explosive. Cannon vary in calibre, range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire, and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. The word \\"cannon\\" is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as \\"tube\\", \\"cane\\", or \\"reed\\". In the modern era, the term \\"cannon\\" has fallen into decline, replaced by \\"guns\\" or \\"artillery\\" if not a more specific term such as \\"gun\\", \\"mortar\\" or \\"howitzer\\", except for in the field of aerial warfare, where it is often used as shorthand for autocannon.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. The answer to the question: What is the name of the full name of the man that the titular counselor studied under starting in 1861? is inside the article: Tchaikovsky was born in 1840 in Votkinsk, a small town in present-day Udmurtia, formerly the Imperial Russian province of Vyatka. A precocious pupil, he began piano lessons at the age of five, and could read music as adeptly as his teacher within three years. However, his parents' passion for his musical talent soon cooled. In 1850, the family decided to send Tchaikovsky to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence in Saint Petersburg. This establishment mainly served the lesser nobility or gentry, and would prepare him for a career as a civil servant. As the minimum age for acceptance was 12, Tchaikovsky was sent by his family to board at the Imperial School of Jurisprudence's preparatory school in Saint Petersburg, 800 miles (1,300 km) from his family home in Alapayevsk. Once Tchaikovsky came of age for acceptance, he was transferred to the Imperial School of Jurisprudence to begin a seven-year course of studies.Music was not a priority at the School, but Tchaikovsky regularly attended the theater and the opera with other students. He was fond of works by Rossini, Bellini, Verdi and Mozart. Piano manufacturer Franz Becker made occasional visits to the School as a token music teacher. This was the only formal music instruction Tchaikovsky received there. From 1855 the composer's father, Ilya Tchaikovsky, funded private lessons with Rudolph Kündinger, a well-known piano teacher from Nuremberg, and questioned Kündinger about a musical career for his son. Kündinger replied that nothing suggested a potential composer or even a fine performer. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.Tchaikovsky graduated on May 25, 1859 with the rank of titular counselor, a low rung on the civil service ladder. On June 15, he was appointed to the Ministry of Justice in Saint Petersburg. Six months later he became a junior assistant and two months after that, a senior assistant. Tchaikovsky remained there for the rest of his three-year civil service career.In 1861, Tchaikovsky..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"In 1861, Tchaikovsky began studying music under the renowned Russian composer and pianist Anton Rubinstein, who was the founder and director of the Saint Petersburg Conservatory. Anton Rubinstein played a significant role in Tchaikovsky's musical development, providing him with a solid foundation in music theory, composition, and performance. Under Rubinstein's tutelage, Tchaikovsky honed his skills and began to establish himself as a composer, ultimately leading to a successful and influential career in the world of classical music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His sparkling blue eyes hold myriad emotions; the apprehension of the descent momentarily replaced with the inviting, twinkling excitement of new adventures. The camera also catches the radiant, contagious nature of his youthfulness.

The nine-man group, which included Arnett, Browne, AP photographer Horst Faas, David Halberstam, Neil Sheehan of United Press International, and CBS's Peter Kalischer and photographer Joseph Masraf waited outside the building with their equipment. After an hour-long religious ceremony, the Buddhist monks, numbering around 300, filed out of the pagoda into a narrow alley along a side street, where they were blocked and ordered to stop by plain-clothed policemen. The Buddhists did not resist, but Arnett and Browne began taking photos of the confrontation. The police, who were loyal to Ngo Dinh Nhu, thereupon punched Arnett in the nose, knocked him to the ground, kicked him with their pointed-toe shoes, and broke his camera. Halberstam, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his coverage of the Buddhist crisis, was a tall man, standing around 20 centimetres (8 in) taller than the average Vietnamese policeman. He waded into the fracas swinging his arms, reportedly saying \\"Get back, get back, you sons of bitches, or I'll beat the shit out of you!\\" Nhu's men ran away without waiting for a Vietnamese translation, but not before Browne had clambered up a power pole and taken photos of Arnett's bloodied face. The police smashed Browne's camera, but his photographic film survived the impact. The other journalists were jostled and rocks were thrown at them. Photos of Arnett's bloodied face were circulated in US newspapers and caused further ill-feeling towards Diem's regime, with the images of the burning Thich Quang Duc on the front pages still fresh in the minds of the public. Halberstam's report estimated that the altercation lasted for around ten minutes and also admitted that the pressmen had tried to apprehend the policeman who had smashed Browne's camera but were shielded by the rock-wielding policeman's colleagues.

Harli Jordean, the 8-year-old kid, soon to be 9, is just too lovely. He was born in Stoke Newington, London in spring 2003. He started up an Internet marble company where he sells the toys. And recently the 8-year-old student was written into the record books for being the youngest founder and chief executive officer (CEO) of an Internet company. Harli's love for marbles got rolling when he was 6. According to Tina, Harli's mother, he loved the colcorful toys so much that he would go to sleep talking about marbles and the first thing in the morning he did was talking about marbles. And his family started calling him \\"the Marble King\\". \\"I like the patterns and designs of marbles. You can collect hundreds of different color1s, shaps, and sizes. It's fun,\\" Harli told WR News. \\"And I really enjoy looking at them, touching them, holding them, studying them and playing them with my friends.\\" Harli Jordean's marble company has a long history. After losing his marbles to an older boy, Harli and his mom turned to the Internet for ordering more marbles. However, they couldn't find a Web site that sold the toys. That gave Harli an idea-to start a Web site where people could find different types of marbles. With his family's help, Harli created a Web site that sells marbles and marble accessories. His collection includes tiny and large marbles, along with clear and color1ful ones. Since starting his business, Harli has learned how to work with marble suppliers and fill orders. In the past two years, he's received orders from customers around the world. Some of the countries where he has sold the most marbles are Brazil, Italy, and the United States. Most kids just love marbls! So how does Harli feel about being the world's youngest CEO? \\"It feels marvelous . I like having my own company. I like being the boss,\\" he says. \\"It really ...surprised me and probably ... my teachers too. I don't think they believed me when I used...

I read this background article the other day: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one. I am facing a new situation today: Jacob recently contracted the HIV virus and is going to his first support meeting. While there, he meets Dan and strikes up a conversation with him. Dan says that he has had HIV for over a decade at this point and has learned ways to live with it. He is able to give Jacob some good advice on how to handle things and Jacob is very grateful to have someone to talk with. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has more T cells, Jacob or Dan? Answer:","completion":"It is not possible to definitively determine who has more T cells, Jacob or Dan, based solely on the information provided. The number of T cells in an individual with HIV can vary widely depending on factors such as the stage of the infection, effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy, and the individual's response to treatment. However, since Jacob has recently contracted HIV, it is likely that his T cell count hasn't declined as much as Dan's, assuming Dan has experienced the typical decline over a decade of living with the virus. Nevertheless, to draw a more accurate conclusion, specific information about their T cell counts and treatment history would be needed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You are given a new situation: Two teams of researches studied Antarctica's climate. The team studied two different regions. The US team studied East Antarctica, while the Swiss team studied West Antarctica. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person Auber believed had more promise than Léonce Cohen? , can you please find it? In 1848, at the age of thirteen, Saint-Saëns was admitted to the Paris Conservatoire, France's foremost music academy. The director, Daniel Auber, had succeeded Luigi Cherubini in 1842, and brought a more relaxed regime than that of his martinet predecessor, though the curriculum remained conservative. Students, even outstanding pianists like Saint-Saëns, were encouraged to specialise in organ studies, because a career as a church organist was seen to offer more opportunities than that of a solo pianist. His organ professor was François Benoist, whom Saint-Saëns considered a mediocre organist but a first-rate teacher; his pupils included Adolphe Adam, César Franck, Charles Alkan, Louis Lefébure-Wély and Georges Bizet. In 1851 Saint-Saëns won the Conservatoire's top prize for organists, and in the same year he began formal composition studies. His professor was a protégé of Cherubini, Fromental Halévy, whose pupils included Charles Gounod and Bizet.Saint-Saëns's student compositions included a symphony in A major (1850) and a choral piece, Les Djinns (1850), after an eponymous poem by Victor Hugo. He competed for France's premier musical award, the Prix de Rome, in 1852 but was unsuccessful. Auber believed that the prize should have gone to Saint-Saëns, considering him to have more promise than the winner, Léonce Cohen, who made little mark during the rest of his career. In the same year Saint-Saëns had greater success in a competition organised by the Société Sainte-Cécile, Paris, with his Ode à Sainte-Cécile, for which the judges unanimously voted him the first prize. The first piece the composer acknowledged as a mature work and gave an opus number was Trois Morceaux for harmonium (1852).

Thorne goes with the group to their compound. Griswold stays with the boat, to come ashore later. The situation in the compound is less than safe. During evening cocktails, Thorne becomes aware of a life-threatening situation. Marlowe Cragis performs well-meaning research on serums and uses shrews as test animals. The doctor's purpose is to make humans half-size in order to reduce world hunger; smaller humans will eat less food on a planet with a limited food supply.

The scientist and his staff barricade themselves inside their compound each evening. Thorne and Ann begin to fall in love, causing jealousy in Jerry.

These additional responsibilities indicate that they are preparing the space and settling their work before their departure. The slideshow's completion is an essential component of this wrap-up process, and there is pressure to achieve it as other tasks are dependent on it. In conclusion, the pressure on getting the slideshow done is a combination of factors, including time constraints, responsibilities, expectations, the slideshow's impact, the transition to a new group and preparing for the next phase.

Article:","completion":"Title: Discovery of a Millennia-Old Treasure: 2,000 Gold Coins Unearthed from Caesarea's Ancient Harbor Subtitle: Divers Chance Upon an Enigmatic Piece of the Fatimid Caliphate's Economic Legacy The mysteries of the past continue to unravel themselves as nearly 2,000 gold coins laid submerged and hidden at the seabed of Caesarea's ancient harbor for approximately a millennium before being accidentally discovered by a team of divers. This remarkable find not only sheds light on the economic history of the region but also offers unparalleled insight into the intricacies of the once-powerful Fatimid Caliphate. Caesarea, a city located along the Mediterranean coastline of Israel, has long been a treasure trove of archaeological finds. Having been home to various civilizations throughout history, such as the Romans, Byzantines, and Crusaders, the richness and diversity of its past continue to captivate both researchers and visitors alike. It is amidst this vast expanse of historical wealth that the divers stumbled upon a formidable collection of gold coins, which have since captured the imagination of historians and numismatists worldwide. The cache of gold coins, hidden from the world for around a thousand years, has piqued the interest of researchers, providing a rare glimpse into the economic mechanisms that once undergirded the vast territories ruled by the Fatimid Caliphate. The Fatimid dynasty, a Shia Muslim caliphate, spanned a vast area encompassing modern-day Tunisia, Egypt, parts of the Middle East, and even parts of the Mediterranean. At its zenith, the Fatimid Caliphate was the epicenter of trade, commerce, culture, and learning—a true powerhouse in every sense of the word. Among the unearthed coins, most hail from the Fatimid Caliphate period, which lasted roughly from the 10th to the 12th centuries. They bear the unmistakable marks of the Fatimid's exceptional craftsmanship and design skills. With inscriptions in Arabic, each coin tells a vivid story of the era when it was minted. Experts have been able to discern information about the denominations, dates, and even places of mintage from the engravings imbued upon the coins. The meticulous analysis of these relics offers historians and archaeologists invaluable insight into the then-flourishing economy and monetary system of the Fatimid era. The discovery of these coins, far beyond the territorial bounds of the vast Fatimid Caliphate, is testament to the extensive reach and influence of the Islamic empire as they actively participated in global trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange. However, questions still persist. How did such a significant amount of gold end up sunk beneath the depths of the Mediterranean? Is it possible that these coins were on board a vessel that succumbed to the unforgiving waters of the ancient harbor? Or were these treasures purposefully hidden to escape the grasping hands of invaders and usurpers? While the answers to these queries may forever remain elusive, the implications of this extraordinary find cannot be understated. Undoubtedly, the recent discovery of these ancient gold coins has opened a new chapter in the understanding of the Fatimid Caliphate's history, providing researchers a unique opportunity to unravel the enigmatic layers of an empire that once held sway over vast swaths of land. As the echoes of the past reverberate through time, the allure of history is further enriched by the knowledge gleaned from these long-forgotten treasures. And as we continue to learn more about our shared ancestry, the once-proud Fatimid Caliphate's legacy lives on through the shimmering gold relics of its bygone age of prosperity."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The unsettling incident was part of a two-day bender that the group of friends engaged in during their vacation. The video, which has since been removed by Facebook and YouTube, quickly went viral, generating a plethora of negative reactions from both Australians and Canadians alike. The act itself has not only been condemned for its irresponsibility, but also for the callous disregard for the safety and wellbeing of the unconscious individual involved. The group of young men, who remain unidentified, were reportedly on a booze-fuelled rampage across Canada when they decided to participate in the dangerous stunt. While the motive behind the act remains unclear, it is evident that the individuals involved had been consuming excessive amounts of alcohol, impairing their judgement and causing them to participate in reckless behaviour. Social media users were quick to condemn the Aussie boys, as platforms erupted with an outpouring of shock and disgust. The video prompted discussions around alcohol consumption, the influence of social media on young people's behaviour, and the responsibility of platforms like Facebook and YouTube in curbing the spread of such content. The quick measures taken by Facebook and YouTube to remove the video demonstrates the platforms' commitment to policing harmful and inappropriate content. The swift action taken by these companies, however, has not stopped the video from being shared via other social media platforms and instant messaging services. As the video continues to circulate and spark outcry, rumours have it that Canadian police are investigating the matter. The consequences the young men may face for their actions remain uncertain but it is likely that they will be subject to legal penalties, should they be charged for their reckless behaviour. This incident serves as a somber reminder of the potential dangers and repercussions of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly among young people. It highlights that there is a need for ongoing conversations around responsible drinking and the need for intervention by friends and family to prevent such instances from occurring. The repercussions of this dangerous prank not only affect the individuals involved but also reflect poorly on the Australian community as a whole. Friends, families, and authorities must continue to educate young people on responsible behaviour, especially while abroad, to ensure that this reckless act does not become a dangerous trend or tarnish the reputation of the broader Australian community. In conclusion, the shocking balcony prank has elicited strong reactions from people all over the world, invoking conversations around alcohol abuse and the role of social media in influencing behaviour. Social media platforms like Facebook and YouTube have shown their commitment to curbing such dangerous content, and it is hoped that this incident will serve as a lesson and deterrent for others who may be tempted to engage in similarly risky actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Their eyes meet, and it is love at first sight.They meet again that very evening at the ball at Stoltenhof, which marks the opening of the social season.

Options: - water and soap - singing - watch tv - train - getting wet Explain why a human would choose \\"getting wet\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"A human might choose \\"getting wet\\" as the answer to the question because washing clothes manually involves hands-on interaction with water, which usually results in the person getting wet themselves. Despite being provided with various options like water and soap, singing, watching TV, or trains, \\"getting wet\\" is the most relevant and accurate response for a few key reasons: 1. Physical Involvement: Manually washing clothes involves directly immersing the garments in water and soap, and then rubbing and scrubbing them to remove dirt and stains. This physical process requires the individual to come into contact with water, increasing the chances of getting wet. 2. Water Splashing: As clothes are agitated, soaped, and rinsed during manual washing, water can splash out of the container or basin, leading to wet hands, arms, and clothes. This possibility makes \\"getting wet\\" a reasonable answer. 3. Rinsing and Wringing: After washing, clothes need to be rinsed to remove soap residue, and then wrung out to eliminate excess water before hanging up to dry. During rinsing, a person's hands and arms are in contact with water, leading to wetness. Wringing clothes out also often results in water dripping and splashing, which can make the person and their surroundings wet. 4. Lacks Alternatives Relevance: The other options offered, such as singing, watching TV, and trains, do not necessarily have a direct correlation with the act of washing clothes manually. These activities can be done alongside manual washing, but they aren't inherent to the process itself. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"getting wet\\" as the answer to the question because manually washing clothes requires direct interaction with water, soap, and the clothes themselves, which often results in the person becoming wet. The hands-on nature of the task, combined with the likelihood of water splashing and dripping, makes \\"getting wet\\" the most logical and appropriate response among the provided options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Intellectual property (IP) is a product of the mind that has commercial value. The concept dates back to 1623, when the first patent law to protect IP rights was passed. IP rights protect an artist from having his/her creative ideas copied by another. For example, if somebody generated an idea for a novel, that idea is protected by IP rights. If someone else wishes to represent the idea or develop it further, he/she must consult the original artists, who will normally be rewarded financially for its use. Back in the 17thcentury, IP rights were primarily carried out to protect newly developed manufacturing processes against stealing, but today intellectual property rights are also enjoyed by those who create music, art and literature. In recent years, IP rights have been the focus of a great deal of discussion because of a technology which looks set to weaken them altogether: the Internet. Many years ago, if you wanted a recoding of a song, you would have to purchase it from a music store; if a novel, from a book store. In those days, IP rights were easily protected since it was very difficult to obtain intellectual property without paying for it. However, a lot of IP, including songs, films, books and artwork, can be downloaded today free of charge using the internet. This practice has now taken the world by storm, dramatically affecting the way in which we view IP rights. According to the writer, in the beginning, IP rights were mainly of use to _ .

Analyze entailment: For a premise to entail a hypothesis, the truth of the premise must lead to the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the premise contradicts the hypothesis. If the premise is true, it is impossible that the hypothesis is also true. 5. Draw a conclusion: Since the premise does not lead to the truth of the hypothesis, it does not entail the hypothesis.

Dr. Sarah Williams, an innovative surgeon and prosthetics researcher, sees potential in Jeff to showcase advancements in medical technology. Jeff's sister, Emma, plays a supportive role throughout his journey to recovery. Step 2: Establish the setting The movie is set in a contemporary urban city with a prominent sports culture and a breakthrough medical research facility where Dr. Williams works. Step 3: Outline the primary plot After the accident, Jeff falls into depression and loses all hope of ever being able to compete again. Dr. Williams approaches Jeff with a revolutionary proposal: to amputate his legs and replace them with cutting-edge prosthetics, allowing him to potentially regain his athletic abilities and have a second chance at life. Jeff reluctantly agrees to the surgery, realizing that it may be his only hope to obtain a sense of normalcy again. Step 4: Present the main challenges Post-surgery, Jeff faces multiple challenges: 1. Physical therapy and learning to walk again with prosthetic legs 2. Dealing with public skepticism surrounding the ethics of artificial limbs in competitive sports 3. Internal struggles with accepting his new body and identity 4. Financial issues arising from the high costs of his treatment and prosthetics Step 5: Show character growth and development Throughout these challenges, Jeff's determination and resilience surface, driven by his passion for the sport and the support of his sister Emma and Dr. Williams, who continue to encourage him. Jeff makes exceptional progress in his recovery and learns to appreciate the strength and adaptability of his new legs. Step 6: Introduce a culminating event An opportunity arises for Jeff to compete in a national sports event, where he can prove both his capabilities and the advancements in prosthetics technology to the world. However, he faces opposition from sports purists who question the fairness of using artificial limbs in competition. Step 7: Resolve the conflict Jeff competes in the event, silencing his critics with an outstanding performance that showcases his grit, intelligence, and relentless pursuit of success. This leads to more acceptance and opportunities for athletes requiring prosthetics, and Jeff sets up a foundation to help others achieve their dreams regardless of physical disabilities. Step 8: Conclude the story The movie ends on a hopeful note, with Jeff inspiring many as a symbol of strength, perseverance, and the limitless potential of human capabilities. Dr. Sarah Williams continues her work, expanding her research scope to include prosthetics for other disabilities, while Emma, proud of her brother's achievements, becomes an advocate for disability rights and sports equality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let me explain them one by one. Question 1: This is about your personal relationships and emotions. When you're going away for higher education, it might make it harder for you and your girlfriend to see each other often. You'll need to think about whether you both can handle the distance and if you want to keep your relationship. Talk with your girlfriend and try to understand what both of you want. Question 2: This question is about a specific scientific paper. Imagine that we have a robot that wants to learn how to recognize different things, like toys. To do this, it needs to look at them carefully, just like how you would look closely at a picture book to understand the story. The \\"glimpse sensor\\" is like the robot's eye to help it see. But, since the robot's eye works in a tricky way, the paper talks about a special way to teach the robot. This special way is called \\"training with the non-differentiable glimpse sensor,\\" which helps the robot become better at recognizing different toys and objects.

The critic consesnsus is: The Dark Crystal's narrative never quite lives up to the movie's visual splendor, but it remains an admirably inventive and uniquely intense entry in the Jim Henson canon.. What reviews supported this critic consensus?","completion":"The critic consensus of The Dark Crystal has been formed through a combination of reviews from various respected film critics and publications. These reviews typically share a similar sentiment, admiring the film's visual splendor and creativity, while expressing concern over its narrative shortcomings. Here are some reviews that amplify key points within the mentioned consensus: 1. Roger Ebert from Chicago Sun-Times (1982): As one of the first film critics to review The Dark Crystal, Ebert praised the movie for its outstanding visuals and set design, but also mentioned that the film's story lacked complexity and characters felt one-dimensional. He wrote, \\"The Dark Crystal is a technical marvel, a triumph of design and special-effects expertise, and it’s incredible that it was made without any human actors. What it is less successful at, however, is creating a world we really care about.\\" 2. Richard Schickel from TIME Magazine (1982): Schickel was impressed with the film's innovative puppetry and enchanting world-building, but felt that its story and characterization were wanting. He comments, \\"Virtue occasionally triumphs in real life; it always does in Henson movies. What ought not to triumph - here or elsewhere - is designing. It should never inhibit the creation of characters and stories we can care about.\\" 3. Janet Maslin from The New York Times (1982): In her review, Maslin highly complimented the movie's inventive visuals and artistic efforts. However, she found the movie's story to be less engaging than its visual elements. She stated, \\"The sheer pomposity of the film's tone will discourage most ordinary children, who will be baffled by the film's slow pace and elaborate details. The movie's extraordinary look deserves better than to be appreciated, as children are likely to appreciate it, as a very long, very quirky installment of 'Sesame Street.'\\" 4. Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian (2011): Written nearly 30 years after the film's release, Bradshaw reinforced the belief that praise for the movie is largely based on its spectacular visuals. He appreciated the imaginative world created by Henson and his team but found the narrative to be subpar. He remarked, \\"It is ravishing to look at - genuinely inventive, with wonderful costumes and sets - but the story feels stilted and hammy.\\" 5. Mark Kermode from The Observer (2011): Kermode agreed that The Dark Crystal showcases a meticulously crafted world with rich details and extraordinary visuals. However, its narrative strength wasn't on par with its imaginative world. He commented, \\"The problem with this 1982 puppet-animation feature from Jim Henson and Frank Oz is that it's so technically ambitious that the demands of the visuals overshadow the narrative.\\" These reviews illustrate a shared sentiment among critics, acknowledging the film's praiseworthy visual aspects while also pointing out the limitations of its narrative. It's through these evaluations that the critic consensus for The Dark Crystal is formed and maintained."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Q:Information: - Theoretical computer science, or TCS, is a division or subset of general computer science and mathematics that focuses on more abstract or mathematical aspects of computing and includes the theory of computation. - In theoretical computer science, a computational problem is a mathematical object representing a collection of questions that computers might be able to solve. For example, the problem of factoring - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time . - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\" - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions. - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

Why is the ozone content of the stratosphere important to living organisms?","completion":"To provide the answer, I will first analyze the question to understand its main components: 1. Ozone content 2. Stratosphere 3. Importance to living organisms Step 1: Define key terms - Ozone: It is a form of oxygen, composed of three oxygen atoms (O3), and has a pale blue color with a strong odor. It occurs naturally in the Earth's atmosphere and has the ability to absorb ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. - Stratosphere: It is the second layer of Earth's atmosphere, located above the troposphere and below the mesosphere. Its lower boundary is approximately 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) above the Earth's surface, while its upper boundary is around 50 kilometers (31 miles) high. - Living organisms: All life forms on Earth, including plants, animals, and microorganisms. Step 2: Explain the relationship between ozone, stratosphere, and living organisms The ozone content in the stratosphere is crucial to all life forms because it forms a protective layer that absorbs harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun. The ozone layer prevents most of the UV-C, all of the UV-C and the majority of UV-B radiation from reaching the Earth's surface, which is essential to the survival of living organisms. Step 3: Identify and explain the importance of the ozone content in the stratosphere to living organisms 1. Protection against harmful UV radiation: By absorbing the majority of the UV-B and all of the UV-C radiation, the ozone layer significantly reduces the detrimental effects of UV radiation on living organisms. High exposure to UV radiation can cause skin cancer, cataracts, and weaken the immune system in humans and other animals. Moreover, it can also harm aquatic organisms, such as phytoplankton and fish, by affecting their reproduction and growth. 2. Preservation of ecosystems: By shielding life forms from harmful UV radiation, the ozone layer helps maintain the integrity of ecosystems and biodiversity. Any disruption caused by high levels of UV radiation could lead to declines in plant and animal populations, altering the balance of ecosystems, and affecting food chains. In conclusion, the ozone content of the stratosphere is vitally important to living organisms, as it acts as a shield against harmful ultraviolet radiation, protecting individual organisms' health and ensuring the stability of ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"thanks\\" is very important. We have to use them very often. We say them when someone gives us drink, helps us to pick up things, hands us a letter or lends us a book. It is rude to ask someone to do something without saying \\"please\\". We have to use it when we ask for something, too. It may be a book or a pencil, more rice or help. We have to use \\"please\\" to make request pleasant. We have to learn to say \\"sorry\\", too. When we have hurt someone, we'll have to go up and say we're sorry. When we have forgotten something, we will say \\"sorry\\". We can make people forget wrong by saying it. These three words are simple but important. Our children must learn to use them. They are pleasing words to use in any language. When we have troubled someone, we will say \\"_\\".

When you receive a present for your birthday, it is considerate to express your gratitude by writing a thank-you note. The word \\"thanks\\" plays a vital role in acknowledging the thought and effort someone has put into choosing a gift for you. The word \\"please\\" is indispensable when making a request or asking for something.

These three words, though simple, carry significant importance in our social interactions and relationships. It is imperative to teach children to use these words appropriately as they grow up because they are universally recognized gestures of politeness and respect, regardless of the language spoken. In conclusion, when you have troubled someone, it is most appropriate to say \\"sorry.\\" This word helps in conveying your regret for causing inconvenience and sets the tone for making amends with the affected individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It seems you forgot to mention the methods you want me to compare. However, I can still give you a simple explanation of how to make pulled pork and two common methods you might use. Making pulled pork involves cooking a pork shoulder or a similar cut of meat slowly at a low temperature until it becomes tender enough to shred easily with forks. Here are two popular methods to make pulled pork: 1. Slow Cooker Method: This is a very easy and reasonable method for making pulled pork. - First, season your pork shoulder with your choice of spices, like salt, pepper, paprika, or a mix of spices. - Put the seasoned pork in a slow cooker. - Pour a liquid over it, such as BBQ sauce, beer, apple juice, or broth. - Cover the slow cooker and cook on low heat for 6-8 hours. - After the pork is cooked and tender, shred it using two forks. 2. Oven Method: This method involves using an oven but still delivers delicious pulled pork. - Season your pork shoulder with your choice of spices. - Preheat your oven to about 300°F (150°C). - Place the pork shoulder in a roasting pan or a Dutch oven. - Pour a liquid of your choice, like BBQ sauce, beer, or broth, over the pork. - Cover the pan with foil or a lid to trap the moisture. - Cook the pork in the oven for 4-6 hours, until it becomes tender and easy to shred. - After the pork is cooked, shred it using two forks. Both methods will give you tasty pulled pork. The slow cooker method might be more reasonable because it requires less effort and attention while cooking. But, if you don't have a slow cooker, the oven method will work well too! Just pick the one that is more convenient for you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Adolescent summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain, Crown Heights, Brooklyn - is/was the same for us all. A lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school. Welcome heat and idleness. But if this experience of adolescence is universal, the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe as foreign a country as any. Young bodies carving new silhouettes...beckoning new territory...the maze towards adulthood. The young mind coming into itself, speaking for itself, saying this is who I am, this is who I want to try to be. It is/was always thus. But this is how it plays out in Brooklyn in the late 90s. Jim McKay is the writer/director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him. The opening title slide \`A film by' seems to list everyone in the universe. It's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one. [The closing titles also have some of the most on-the-money and appreciative credits I've read.] The vivid sound recording by Jan McLaughlin deserves to be especially noted. McKay's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it's his three graces Lanisha, Maria and Joycelyn. They're the real thing, their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality. This ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life. It has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare. Hanging out with them, we don't quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in. These are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life. We are witness to the modern math of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed and solved. Small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout. Lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job - it's the only way she gets to spend time with him. We see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood. In a connected scene, Lanisha defends her dad to her mom, and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return. Later, the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy/funny kids are and more tragically, how realism hammers idealism these days. And at the end, Maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself. We see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay. She demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable. \`Our Song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and enlivening, that intimacy can, in the next, just turn and drift away.

Though physiographically a part of the continent of North America, Greenland has been politically and culturally associated with Europe (specifically Norway and Denmark, the colonial powers, as well as the nearby island of Iceland) for more than a millennium. The majority of its residents are Inuit, whose ancestors migrated began migrating from the Canadian mainland in the 13th century, gradually settling across the island. - Nynorsk, literally New Norwegian or New Norse, is one of the two written standards of the Norwegian language, the other being Bokmål. From 1885, when the parliament declared them official and equal, until new voting in 1929, their names were Landsmål and Riksmål. The Landsmål language standard was constructed by the Norwegian linguist Ivar Aasen during the mid-19th century, to provide a Norwegian-based alternative to Danish, which was commonly written, and to some extent spoken, in Norway at the time. The official standard of Nynorsk has since been significantly altered. A minor purist fraction of the Nynorsk populace has stayed firm with the Aasen norm, which is known as Høgnorsk (analogous to High German). - Vest-Agder \\"(West Agder)\\" is a county in Norway, bordering Rogaland to the west and Aust-Agder to the east.

The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän. - Jan Mayen is a volcanic island in the Arctic Ocean and a part of Norway. It is long (southwest-northeast) and in area, partly covered by glaciers (an area of around the Beerenberg volcano).

The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - Bohuslän is a Swedish province in Götaland, on the northernmost part of the country's west coast.

To the east, Ryfylke borders the districts of Setesdal and Sirdal, to the south is Jæren, and to the west is Haugalandet. Ryfylke is one of the 15 districts in Western Norway. - A monarchy is a form of government in which a group, usually a family called the dynasty, embodies the country's national identity and one of its members, called the monarch, exercises a role of sovereignty. The actual power of the monarch may vary from purely symbolic (crowned republic), to partial and restricted (\\"constitutional\\" monarchy), to completely autocratic (\\"absolute\\" monarchy). Traditionally and in most cases, the monarch's post is inherited and lasts until death or abdication, but there are also elective monarchies where the monarch is elected. Each of these has variations: in some elected monarchies only those of certain pedigrees are, whereas many hereditary monarchies impose requirements regarding the religion, age, gender, mental capacity, and other factors. Occasionally this might create a situation of rival claimants whose legitimacy is subject to effective election. Finally, there have been cases where the term of a monarch's reign is either fixed in years or continues until certain goals are achieved: an invasion being repulsed, for instance. Thus there are widely divergent structures and traditions defining monarchy. Monarchy was the most common form of government until the 19th century, but it is no longer prevalent. Where it exists, it is now usually a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch retains a unique legal and ceremonial role, but exercises limited or no official political power: under the written or unwritten constitution, others have governing authority. Currently, 47 sovereign nations in the world have monarchs acting as heads of state, 19 of which are Commonwealth realms that recognise Queen Elizabeth II as their head of state. All European monarchies are constitutional ones, with the exception of the Vatican City which is an elective monarchy, but sovereigns in the smaller states exercise greater political influence than in the larger. The monarchs of Cambodia, Japan, and Malaysia \\"reign, but do not rule\\" although there is considerable variation in the degree of... - Rogfast or the Rogaland Fixed Link is a planned sub-sea road tunnel between the municipalities of Randaberg (near the city of Stavanger) and Bokn in Rogaland county, Norway. The project will be a world record with respect to its length and its maximum depth of below sea level. This will be a part of the main European route E39 highway along the west coast of Norway and it will link the cities of Kristiansand Stavanger Haugesund Bergen. - Queen Maud Land is a c. 2.7 million-square-kilometre (1 million sq mi) region of Antarctica claimed as a dependent territory by Norway. The territory lies between 20° west and 45° east, between the British Antarctic Territory to the west and the Australian Antarctic Territory to the east. On most maps there had been an unclaimed area between Queen Maud Land's borders of 1939 and the South Pole until June 12, 2015 when Norway formally annexed that area. Positioned in East Antarctica, the territory comprises about one-fifth of the total area of Antarctica. The claim is named after the Norwegian queen Maud of Wales (18691938). - Bokmål (literally \\"book tongue\\") is an official written standard for the Norwegian language, alongside Nynorsk. Bokmål is the preferred written standard of Norwegian for 85% to 90% of the population in Norway, and is most used by people who speak Standard Østnorsk. - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages. - Stavanger is a city and municipality in Norway.

The municipality is the fourth most populous in Norway. Located on the Stavanger Peninsula in Southwest Norway, Stavanger counts its official founding year as 1125, the year the Stavanger Cathedral was completed. Stavanger's core is to a large degree 18th- and 19th-century wooden houses that are protected and considered part of the city's cultural heritage.

In 2013, as the Obama administration was weighing a response to the Syrian government after it violated President Barack Obama's \\" red line \\" for its use of chemical weapons, Trump argued that the US should \\"stay the hell out of Syria\\" and criticized the administration for \\"broadcasting\\" its strategy. \\"Why do we keep broadcasting when we are going to attack Syria.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 31, 2013 Read More ||||| WASHINGTON/BEIRUT (Reuters) - Western powers said on Saturday their missile attacks struck at the heart of Syria’s chemical weapons program, but the restrained assault appeared unlikely to halt Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s progress in the 7-year-old civil war. The United States, France and Britain launched 105 missiles overnight in retaliation for a suspected poison gas attack in Syria a week ago, targeting what the Pentagon said were three chemical weapons facilities, including a research and development center in Damascus’ Barzeh district and two installations near Homs. The bombing was the biggest intervention by Western countries against Assad and his superpower ally Russia, but the three countries said the strikes were limited to Syria’s chemical weapons capabilities and not aimed at toppling Assad or intervening in the civil war. The air attack, denounced by Damascus and its allies as an illegal act of aggression, was unlikely to alter the course of a multisided war that has killed at least half a million people. U.S. President Donald Trump called the operation a success. He proclaimed on Twitter: “Mission accomplished,” echoing former President George W. Bush, whose use of the same phrase in 2003 to describe the U.S. invasion of Iraq was widely ridiculed as violence there dragged on for years. “We believe that by hitting Barzeh, in particular, we’ve attacked the heart of the Syrian chemicals weapon program,” U.S. Lieutenant General Kenneth McKenzie said at the Pentagon. However, McKenzie acknowledged elements of the program remain and he could not guarantee that Syria would be unable to conduct a chemical attack in the future. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, said at an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council that Trump told her that if Syria uses poisonous gas again, “The United States is locked and loaded.” The Western countries said the strikes were aimed at preventing more Syrian chemical weapons attacks after a suspected poison gas attack in Douma on April 7 killed up to 75 people. They blame Assad’s government for the attack. In Washington, a senior administration official said on Saturday that “while the available information is much greater on the chlorine use, we do have significant information that also points to sarin use” in the attack. Speaking at a summit in Peru, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence seemed less sure of the use of sarin, saying that Washington may well determine that it was used along with chlorine. ASSAD ‘RESILIENCE’ Ten hours after the missiles hit, smoke was still rising from the remains of five destroyed buildings of the Syrian Scientific Research Center in Barzeh, where a Syrian employee said medical components were developed. There were no immediate reports of casualties. Syria released video of the wreckage of a bombed-out research lab, but also of Assad arriving at work as usual, with the caption “Morning of resilience”. Late on Saturday Syria time, a large explosion was heard in a Syrian government-controlled area in a rural region south of Aleppo, according to the Britain-based war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The Observatory said the cause of the explosion was unknown, as well as its target. Russian and Iranian military help over the past three years has allowed Assad to crush the rebel threat to topple him. The United States, Britain and France have all participated in the Syrian conflict for years, arming rebels, bombing Islamic State fighters and deploying troops on the ground to fight that group. But they have refrained from targeting Assad’s government, apart from a volley of U.S. missiles last year. Although the Western countries have all said for seven years that Assad must leave power, they held back in the past from striking his government, lacking a wider strategy to defeat him. Syria and its allies also made clear that they considered the attack a one-off, unlikely to do meaningful harm to Assad. A senior official in a regional alliance that backs Damascus told Reuters the sites that were targeted had been evacuated days ago thanks to a warning from Russia. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the strikes were “unacceptable and lawless.” Syrian state media called them a “flagrant violation of international law,” while Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called it a crime and the Western leaders criminals. Russia had promised to respond to any attack on its ally, but the Pentagon said no Russian air defense systems were used. Syria fired 40 unguided surface-to-air missiles - but only after the Western strikes had ended, the Pentagon said. “We are confident that all of our missiles reached their targets,” McKenzie said. A U.S. Air Force B-1B Lancer, deployed to Al Udeid Air Base, launches a strike as part of the multinational response to Syria's use of chemical weapons is seen in this image from Al Udeid Air Base, Doha, Qatar released on April 14, 2018. U.S. Air Force/Handout via REUTERS British Prime Minister Theresa May described the strike as “limited and targeted,” with no intention of toppling Assad or intervening more widely in the war. Washington described the strike targets as a center near Damascus for the research, development, production and testing of chemical and biological weapons; a chemical weapons storage site near the city of Homs; and another site near Homs that stored chemical weapons equipment and housed a command post. The Pentagon said there had been chemical weapons agents at one of the targets, and that the strikes had significantly crippled Syria’s ability to produce such weapons. Trump spoke to May and French President Emmanuel Macron to discuss results of the strikes, the leaders’ offices said. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all Security Council members to exercise restraint and avoid escalation in Syria, but said allegations of chemical weapons use demand an investigation. In Sydney, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull urged Russia to drop its “pretence” that Syria was not behind the chemical attack on Douma and use its influence to force the Assad government to destroy its chemical weapons. “Russia has used its position as a member of the United Nations Security Council to veto resolutions designed to ensure that this chemical weapons crime is thoroughly investigated and cannot be repeated,” he told a news conference on Sunday. “It should stop all the denial and the pretence that it wasn’t an action by the Syrian government and ensure that the chemical weapons are destroyed, that the ability of the regime to use chemical weapons is eliminated and that this type of criminal conduct does not occur again.” WEAPONS INSPECTIONS Inspectors from the global chemical weapons watchdog OPCW were due to try to visit Douma on Saturday to inspect the site of the suspected gas attack. Moscow condemned the Western states for refusing to wait for their findings. Russia, whose relations with the West have deteriorated to levels of Cold War-era hostility, has denied any gas attack took place in Douma and even accused Britain of staging it to whip up anti-Russian hysteria. The Western countries took precautions to avoid unexpected conflict with Russia. French Defence Minister Florence Parly said Russians was warned beforehand to avert conflict. Dmitry Belik, a Russian member of parliament who was in Damascus and witnessed the strikes, told Reuters: “The attack was more of a psychological nature rather than practical. Luckily there are no substantial losses or damages.” In Douma, site of the suspected gas attack, the last buses were due on Saturday to transport out rebels and their families who agreed to surrender the town, state TV reported. That effectively ends all resistance in the suburbs of Damascus known as eastern Ghouta, marking one of the biggest victories for Assad’s government of the war. Slideshow (18 Images) The Western assault involved more missiles than a U.S. attack last year but struck targets limited to Syria’s chemical weapons facilities. The U.S. intervention last year had effectively no impact on the war. Syria agreed in 2013 to give up its chemical weapons after a nerve gas attack killed hundreds of people in Douma. Damascus is still permitted to have chlorine for civilian use, although its use as a weapon is banned. Allegations of Assad’s chlorine use have been frequent during the war although, unlike nerve agents, chlorine did not produce mass casualties as seen last week. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Donald Trump and Theresa May spoke on the phone on Thursday evening and agreed Bashar al-Assad’s regime had “a pattern of dangerous behaviour” with chemical weapons that cannot go unchallenged. Both leaders are yet to announce what action they will take in Syria alongside France. The French government said it had “proof” that the Syrian regime was responsible for Saturday’s alleged chemical attack in Damascus, which reportedly killed at least 50 people and injured hundreds, according to president Emmanuel Macron. The US defence secretary, James Mattis, said Washington was gathering evidence about who carried out the attack and his main concern about the American military response was how to stop the tensions “escalating out of control”. Preparations for a possible Russian counterattack on the British base RAF Akrotiri in Cyprus were under way on Thursday in the event of US-led military action in Syria. American TV network NBC reported that blood and urine samples from the victims of Saturday’s attack had traces of a nerve agent and chlorine, indicating that Assad’s government was responsible. President Trump stepped back from his promise of an imminent missile strike in Syria, tweeting that he “never said when an attack on Syria would take place. Could be very soon or not so soon at all!” Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are set to arrive in Damascus to start an investigation into the chemical attack. They are not due to visit the site of the incident until Saturday, however. Russia’s UN ambassador said his top diplomatic priority was to avert war in Syria, but he did not rule out the possibility of US-Russian conflict. Sweden has proposed a draft resolution to UN security council that would include immediately sending a high-level disarmament mission to Syria to address outstanding issues on the use of chemical weapons “once and for all” in a bid to de-escalate the situation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Which of the two are older, the Talking Heads, or Charlie Simpson? Answer:","completion":"To accurately compare the age of the Talking Heads and Charlie Simpson, it is essential to understand who they are and when they became active in the music industry. Talking Heads: Talking Heads was an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City. The band was active from 1975 until their official disbandment in 1991. The core members of the group include David Byrne (lead vocals and guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). They were known for their energetic live performances and avant-garde approach to rock and new wave music, which they often infused with African rhythms and funk grooves. Talking Heads released their first album, \\"Talking Heads: 77,\\" in September 1977. Some of their well-known singles include \\"Psycho Killer,\\" \\"Once in a Lifetime,\\" and \\"Burning Down the House.\\" Charlie Simpson: Charlie Simpson is an English singer-songwriter and musician who was born on June 7, 1985. He initially gained fame as a member of the British pop band Busted, which was formed in 2001. Busted was active from 2001 to 2005, when they disbanded, and then reformed in 2015. Simpson left the band in 2005 to form another group, Fightstar, which he is still a member of today. Fightstar was active from 2003 to 2010, took a hiatus, and have been active again since 2014. In addition to his band projects, Simpson has also released solo work, starting with his debut album, \\"Young Pilgrim,\\" in August 2011. In conclusion, Talking Heads, formed in 1975, are significantly older than when Charlie Simpson began his music career in 2001. Talking Heads' formation predates Simpson's own birth. Therefore, it is clear that the Talking Heads are older than Charlie Simpson by approximately 26 years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Joseph Guilherme Raposo, OIH (February 8, 1937 - February 5, 1989) was a Portuguese-American composer, songwriter, pianist, television writer and lyricist, best known for his work on the children's television series Sesame Street, for which he wrote the theme song, as well as classic songs such as \\"Bein' Green\\" and \\"C Is For Cookie\\". He also wrote music for television shows such as The Electric Company, Shining Time Station and the sitcoms Three's Company and The Ropers, including their theme songs. In addition to these works, Raposo also composed extensively for the DePatie-Freleng Enterprises such as Halloween Is Grinch Night, Pontoffel Pock, Where Are You? and The Grinch Grinches the Cat in the Hat. Raposo is best known for the songs he wrote for Sesame Street from its beginning in 1969 through the mid-1970s, and also for a time in the 1980s. He wrote the \\"Sesame Street Theme\\" - various versions of which have opened every episode - as well as many of its most popular songs, such as \\"Bein' Green\\", \\"C is for Cookie\\", \\"Sing\\" and \\"ABC-DEF-GHI\\". A version of \\"Sing\\" recorded by The Carpenters in 1973 reached #3 on the Billboard top singles chart. For many years, most of the music used in Sesame Street's film segments was also written -- and often sung -- by Raposo. Aside from his musical contributions, Raposo performed several uncredited stock characters on Sesame Street during the early 1970s. According to his son Nicholas in a 2002 telephone conversation, Joe Raposo usually chose to portray anonymous, silly characters in these segments, which were nearly always produced on 16 mm film. He also did voice-overs for a few animated segments. The Sesame Street character Don Music maintained a framed and autographed glamour photograph of Raposo on the wall of his Muppet atelier. Raposo was very fond of sweets according to many who knew him. One favorite food of his was cookies. It has been rumored the Wheel-Eating Monster created for commercial advertisers in the 1960s by Jim Henson may have been altered by Henson specifically into a \\"cookie\\" monster after Henson observed Raposo's unusual propensity for cookies; this has never been substantiated. Raposo was actually the first puppeteer to operate Cookie Monster on television for Sesame Street. His widow Pat Collins-Sarnoff celebrated his life with a milk and cookies reception. One of Raposo's Sesame Street compositions, \\"The Square Song\\", was used in the film Close Encounters of the Third Kind.

In the spring of 1800, Napoleon and his troops crossed the Swiss Alps into Italy, aiming to surprise the Austrian armies that had reoccupied the peninsula when Napoleon was still in Egypt.[note 5] After a difficult crossing over the Alps, the French army entered the plains of Northern Italy virtually unopposed. While one French army approached from the north, the Austrians were busy with another stationed in Genoa, which was besieged by a substantial force. The fierce resistance of this French army, under André Masséna, gave the northern striking force precious time to carry out their operations with little interference. After spending several days looking for each other, the two armies finally collided at the Battle of Marengo on June 14. General Melas had a numerical advantage, fielding about 30,000 Austrian soldiers while Napoleon commanded 24,000 French troops. The battle began favorably for the Austrians as their initial attack surprised the French and gradually drove them back. Melas concluded that he'd won the battle and retired to his headquarters around 3 pm, leaving his subordinates in charge of pursuing the French. However, the French lines never broke during their tactical retreat; Napoleon constantly rode out among the troops urging them to stand and fight. Late in the afternoon, a full division under Desaix arrived on the field and dramatically reversed the tide of the battle. A series of artillery barrages and fortunate cavalry charges managed to decimate the Austrian army, which fled chaotically over the Bormida River back to Alessandria, leaving behind 14,000 casualties. The following day, the Austrian army agreed to abandon Northern Italy once more with the Convention of Alessandria, which granted them safe passage to friendly soil in exchange for their fortresses throughout the region.

Wolfenstein 3D is being released as a free in-browser game by Bethesda Software to mark the 20th anniversary of the game’s release. Wolfenstein 3D, which can be played here, is considered one of the earliest first-person shooters, and the game that made the genre popular on PC. It was developed by John Carmack at id Software and published by Apogee Software in 1992. The game originally was released for free as shareware, but then was later released as a paid PC game and on several consoles. The browser version is the full release of Wolfenstein 3D; you play an American soldier in WWII attempting to escape from the Nazi stronghold of Castle Wolfenstein. You must navigate the 3D maze while fending off Nazi soldiers, attack dogs and mutant monsters. Wolfenstein 3D was not the only stop for Carmack and designer John Romero; the duo later developed DOOM, the mega-popular 1993 FPS that was downloaded by 10 million people in the first two years. Bethesda Software also announced they would be dropping the price of the iOS version of Wolfenstein 3D (iTunes link) to commemorate the anniversary. For a limited time, gamers will be able to pick up the classic for free on their iPhone, iPod touch, and iPad on Wednesday.. Are you excited about the rerelease of Wolfenstein 3D? Do you have fond memories playing the title when it came out 20 years ago? Let us know in the comments.

When the Lumière brothers of France premiered their first motion picture footage in Paris on December 28, 1895, little did they know how rapidly it would ignite a new age of photographic documentation. These brothers invented an apparatus, patented in February 1895, which they called the \\"Cinématographe\\" (from which the word \\"cinematography\\" is derived). It is not surprising that this apparatus soon showed up in Baku at the turn of the 19th century, this bay town on the Caspian was producing more than 50 percent of the world's supply of oil. Just like today, the oil industry attracted foreigners eager to invest and to work. A Frenchman by the name of Alexandre Michon was among the first entrepreneurs who came and settled in Baku. A photographer and cameraman by profession, he is believed to have lived in Baku for more than 25 years where he set up a photo studio. Mishon became active in forming a scientific photo circle in Baku and became its secretary. From 1879 to 1905, he documented landscapes, episodes from oil extraction, the refining process, as well as the oil gushers and terrifying fires that broke out in the oil fields. In 1898, Mishon began shooting motion pictures that depicted everyday life in Baku. It was his intention to exhibit them in Paris. - Kutaisi (; ancient names: \\"Aea\\"/\\"Aia\\", \\"Kotais\\", \\"Kutatisi\\", \\"Kutaïsi\\") is the legislative capital of Georgia, and its 3rd most populous city.

Background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. Paragraph: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which organism ATP molecules would be produced, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. Step 1: Understand the relationship between respiration rate and ATP production. From the background information provided, we know that the respiration rate correlates with energy use. Cellular respiration is the process where energy is converted from glucose, in the presence of oxygen, into several ATP molecules. Step 2: Analyze the given information about sample A and sample B. We are told that sample A has a higher induced respiration rate, while sample B has no induced respiration rate. Step 3: Determine which sample produces ATP molecules based on their respiration rates. Since cellular respiration is responsible for the production of ATP molecules and sample A has a higher respiration rate, it is more likely that ATP molecules would be produced in sample A. In contrast, sample B has no respiration rate, which means there is no cellular respiration happening, and therefore, it would not produce ATP molecules."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A woman who murdered her 'sugar daddy' ex-boyfriend with the help of another lover and then hid the mutilated body in a freezer was jailed for life today. Sharon Swinhoe, 44, battered retired civil servant Peter McMahon to death in a sustained assault which saw the 68-year-old's eyes gouged out. Along with her accomplice, one of her other lovers Joseph Collins, 54, Swinhoe wheeled Mr McMahon's body in a suitcase from her home to Collins's flat in Elswick, Newcastle, where they hid the body in his freezer. Sharon Swinhoe, 44, left, was jailed for 25 years today for the murder of her ex-boyfriend Peter McMahon, right. Police found the badly decomposed body some time later. A third boyfriend of Swinhoe's Ronald Douglas, 77, also helped the pair move the body, Newcastle Crown Court heard. Swinhoe plundered Mr McMahon's bank account after his death. All three denied murder during a six week trial, but Swinhoe was jailed for a minumum of 25 years and Collins for a minimum of 20 years after they were found guilty yesterday. Douglas, from Blaydon, Gateshead, admitted conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and was sentenced to four years in jail. Jailing Swinhoe, Mr Justice Globe said that she appeared to show no remorse for the killing, adding: 'You appear to care more about the rats you kept as pets than the man who loved you and asked to marry you and bought you an £1,100 engagement ring. Jailed: Another of Swinhoe's former lovers Joseph Collins, pictured, was jailed for a minimum of 20 years for the killing. 'Peter McMahon was a well-liked respected, generous, mature man living comfortably on his two pensions in the Newcastle area. 'In common with the two men sitting alongside you Sharon Swinhoe, his downfall was that he fell victim to your charm that has attracted men to you like magnets. 'Ultimately he fell victim to your much more sinister, controlling and violent personality.' More than £2,600 found in her flat after the murder must be repaid to the family, the judge ordered. During the trial, twice-married Mr McMahon was described as being besotted with Swinhoe, who was 24 years his junior. He would buy her presents and she was described by the prosecution as seeing Mr McMahon as a sugar daddy. Prior to his body being discovered in the second-hand chest freezer, Mr McMahon’s son phoned from New Zealand to tell his father he had become a grandfather. Swinhoe answered the call and said he could not come to the phone because he was sleeping - despite it being early evening. David Jeremy QC, defending Collins, said his client’s existence 'consisted of little more than orbiting the life of Sharon Swinhoe'. Mr Justice Globe said Swinhoe and Douglas’s relationship had finished by the time of the murder, but she continued to use him as a taxi service and recruited him to help move the body. Douglas was jailed for four years, down from eight years, on account of his age, and his guilty plea, the judge said. Chilling: Sharon Swinhoe, Joseph Collins, and Ronald Douglas pictured in the lifts at Collins's flat after the murder of Mr McMahon last year. Sentenced: The trio were all jailed for their part in the horrific murder at Newcastle Crown Court today. After the case Detective Chief Inspector Paul Young said: 'Peter McMahon was a decent, hard-working man who was looking forward to becoming a grandfather. 'Swinhoe and Collins targeted him for financial gain, preying on his generosity and then plundering his bank accounts after his death. 'Mr McMahon believed they were his friends, but they brutally murdered him and then conspired with Ronald Douglas to cover up their crime by hiding the body and denying responsibility.' 'You appear to care more about the rats. you kept as pets than the man who loved you and asked to marry you and. bought you an £1,100 engagement ring.' Mr Justice Globe. In a statement, Mr McMahon’s family described Swanhoe as 'cruel, calculated and cold hearted. The statement said: 'He (Mr McMahon) will be greatly missed by his family and friends. 'It is particularly tragic that he not only had his life taken from him, but that these people showed utter disrespect for it afterwards. 'He was also denied the chance to learn he had become a grandfather which he had always dearly wanted. 'We still can’t believe that anybody could be so cruel, calculated and cold hearted against our dad. 'Rest in peace dad.' The family thanked Northumbria Police and the CPS for bringing Mr McMahon's killers to justice. Following the verdict, Gerry Sydenham, head of the Crown Court Unit at CPS North East, said: 'It is clear from the evidence in this case that Swinhoe manipulated Peter McMahon in the same way that she manipulated the two men who would later assist her in his murder and the disposal of his body. 'It is evident that Peter had genuine affection for Swinhoe but she chose to exploit those feelings and, on October 18 last year, she led Peter to believe that he was leaving his home to rekindle their relationship. The truth is that she was leading him to his eventual death. 'After the murder, Swinhoe and Collins showed not a scrap of remorse. 'Their every action from that point was a calculated attempt to evade justice, including their inhuman treatment of Mr McMahon’s remains and the web of lies they told, both to Peter’s family and to police. 'Ultimately, the only thing that they have achieved through their despicable actions is to prolong the suffering of Peter’s family and friends. 'I am pleased with the sentences passed today and I would hope that they give some measure of comfort to those who knew Peter McMahon at what must be a very difficult time for them.'","completion":"In 2013, a woman named Sharon Swinhoe, together with her two accomplices - her former lovers, Joseph Collins and Ronald Douglas, gruesomely murdered and mutilated her ex-boyfriend, Peter McMahon.

Anquetil was the son of a builder in Mont-Saint-Aignan, in the hills above Rouen in Normandy, north-west France. He lived there with his parents, Ernest and Marie, and his brother Philippe and then at Boisguillaume in a two-storey house, \\"one of those houses with exposed beams that tourists think are pretty but those who live there find uncomfortable.\\" In 1941, his father refused contracts to work on military installations for the German occupiers and his work dried up. Other members of the family worked in strawberry farming and Anquetil's father followed them, moving to the hamlet of Bourguet, near Quincampoix. Anquetil unfailingly beat Raymond Poulidor in the Tour de France and yet Poulidor remained the more popular. Divisions between their fans became marked, which two sociologists studying the impact of the Tour on French society say became emblematic of France old and new. The extent of those divisions is shown in a story, perhaps apocryphal, told by Pierre Chany, who was close to Anquetil: The Tour de France has the major fault of dividing the country, right down to the smallest hamlet, even families, into two rival camps. I know a man who grabbed his wife and held her on the grill of a heated stove, seated and with her skirts held up, for favouring Jacques Anquetil when he preferred Raymond Poulidor. The following year, the woman became a Poulidor-iste. But it was too late. The husband had switched his allegiance to Gimondi. The last I heard they were digging in their heels and the neighbours were complaining. Jean-Luc Boeuf and Yves Leonard, in their study, wrote: Those who recognised themselves in Jacques Anquetil liked his priority of style and elegance in the way he rode. Behind this fluidity and the appearance of ease was the image of France winning and those who took risks identified with him. Humble people saw themselves in Raymond Poulidor, whose face - lined with effort - represented the life they led on land they worked without rest or respite. His declarations, full of good sense, delighted the crowds: a race, even a difficult one, lasts less time than a day bringing in the harvest. A big part of the public therefore finished by identifying with the one who symbolised bad luck and the eternal position of runner-up, an image that was far from true for Poulidor, whose record was particularly rich. Even today, the expression of the eternal second and of a Poulidor Complex is associated with a hard life, as an article by Jacques Marseille showed in Le Figaro when it was headlined \\"This country is suffering from a Poulidor Complex\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"One interesting aspect about this article is the way it highlights the deep division among French cycling fans between Anquetil and Poulidor, and how this rivalry reflects the broader societal changes happening in France at the time.

Continue writing the following text. The dictator gained power of the other country by using tanks rather than the planes because the Choose your answer from: (1). tanks were advanced. (2). planes were advanced.","completion":"The dictator gained power of the other country by using tanks rather than planes because the tanks were advanced. The decision to opt for tanks instead of planes was a strategic move that played a critical role in the successful takeover of the neighboring nation. In fact, the increased capabilities in tank technology allowed the dictator to effectively employ land forces, dominate the battlefield and swiftly topple the opposing forces. There are several reasons behind the choice of advanced tanks over advanced planes. 1. Terrain dominance: One of the biggest factors was the reinforcement of ground supremacy that advanced tanks provided. By using tanks, the dictator was able to control and dominate strategic land-based positions, which offered significant advantages over air power alone. With tanks on the ground, the military had the capability to directly secure resources, key cities, and hold essential territory. In contrast, air power often has limited persistence and engagement at the ground level. 2. Resilience to defenses: While advanced planes undoubtedly have their own merits, they are typically more vulnerable to ground defenses and anti-air systems operated by the defending nation. The dictator deemed that tanks, with their enhanced armor and reinforced designs, could better withstand the enemy's anti-tank assets, and thus offered a better chance at victory. In addition, due to the low altitude trajectory of tanks, they tend to maintain a higher level of stealth on the battlefield, evading early detection and enemy counters. 3. Logistics and transportation: The use of tanks also provided the dictator's forces with increased logistical capabilities, as they could be easily transported via rail or carrier systems into the targeted nation. In contrast, air deployments would have required much more extensive preparations, including arranging airfield locations, refueling stops, and added maintenance needs. 4. Infantry support: Another benefit of implementing advanced tanks was their compatibility with infantry forces. Tanks are designed to not only serve as powerful offensive weapons but also to protect and provide support to infantry troops. This cooperation between tanks and infantry is critical for maintaining momentum in land warfare, whereas planes often struggle to offer the same level of support. 5. Psychological impact: The sight of a large and menacing line of advanced tanks advancing towards a city or base has a significant impact on enemy morale. The psychological effect of tanks can be intimidating, ultimately leading to a decrease in enemy resistance and quicker capitulations. Planes, on the other hand, tend to have a less immediate impact on morale due to their rapidly shifting positions and temporary presence on the battlefield. At the end of the day, the dictator's choice of advanced tanks over planes in the conquest of the neighboring country demonstrated a strategic understanding of the resources at hand and a practical execution on the battlefield. The advanced tank technology proved to be a highly effective way to exert control, bolster the advancing forces, and instill fear in the hearts of any opposing factions. As a result, the dictator was able to successfully take control of the targeted nation, solidifying their power in the region and beyond."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The European Union (EU) is a significant political and economic union of 27 member countries located primarily in Europe. Within the boundaries of the EU, there is a wide age demographic spanning from infants to the elderly. However, a crucial segment of this population is the youth, those aged between 15 and 29. This population segment is notably large, with approximately 96 million individuals falling into this age range. This equates to almost one fifth, or 20%, of the total population of the EU. The significance of this age demographic cannot be overstated. This age group is crucial as it represents the upcoming workforce, future leaders, and key contributors to innovation and societal development in the region. Their general health, education, employment status and overall wellbeing are central to the EU's future economy and society. It is relevant to note that this specific age range typically includes those in their late school years, through to higher education and into the early stages of their careers. Consequently, policies and legislation related to education, employment, social development, and opportunities for young people have a significant impact on this population segment. The EU has various programs and initiatives specifically tailored to support and empower young people, to ensure they get the best possible start in life, and are adequately prepared to contribute to society. Furthermore, the diversity within this age group can be considerable due to the vast cultural, economic, and societal differences scattered throughout the 27 member countries. Understanding and addressing the needs and challenges faced by these young people require precise, informed, and flexible strategies and policies. Finally, this substantial youth population also represents a significant consumer group within the EU, impacting many industries such as entertainment, technology, fashion, and education. This leads to a wide range of economic activities and trends influenced and driven by the preferences, behaviors, and needs of these young people.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What is the reason I 'll complain about winter ?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the main subject and the relevant information. The main subject is \\"I\\" and the relevant information is about complaining about winter. Step 2: Locate the sentence mentioning the complaint about winter. The sentence is \\"Then I can complain about winter!\\" Step 3: Analyze the context surrounding the complaint about winter. The passage talks about the sun going down, cooling off, and summer being over soon. This signifies that the user is not very comfortable in hot weather (above 90 degrees). Step 4: Make a connection between the context and the complaint about winter. Since the user mentions that they want to complain about winter after summer is over, it implies that they also find the winter season uncomfortable or unsatisfactory in some way. Step 5: Summarize the reason for complaining about winter. The reason the user will complain about winter is that they seem to find the colder season uncomfortable or unsatisfactory, just as they did with the hot summer weather."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"Don't repeat the mistake. Resolve Learn from what happened.\\"","completion":"Title: Break the Cycle: Embrace Resilience through Learning from Mistakes Introduction Mistakes are an inevitable part of life. No matter how much we strive for perfection, there will always be moments where we stumble or fall. But it isn't the mistake itself that defines us. Instead, it is how we respond and evolve from those setbacks that truly demonstrates our strength and resilience. This article will outline the importance of not repeating mistakes, learning from them, and effectively resolving them to continue growing and progressing. Failing Forward: The Power of Mistakes The concept of \\"failing forward\\" encourages us to take chances, make mistakes, and adapt through iterative learning. Despite being afraid of failure, we must understand that we can't improve nor progress without confronting it. As the saying goes, \\"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.\\" It is essential to analyze why a particular error occurred, learn from it, and develop resolution strategies to avoid repeating the same mistake. This process, which requires patience and introspection, demonstrates emotional intelligence and the ability to adapt and evolve when faced with adversity. These qualities are instrumental in developing resilience in any facet of life. Embracing Growth Mindset: The Art of Reflecting on Mistakes A growth mindset entails the belief that a person's talent, skills, and intelligence can be improved upon through hard work, perseverance, and training. In other words, it recognizes the potential for positive change and continuous improvement. Adopting a growth mindset encourages individuals to focus on learning and growing from their errors rather than dwelling on them or feeling discouraged. Reflecting on mistakes is critical in nurturing a growth mindset. Perform a detailed dissection of what led to the mistake. Ask yourself the difficult questions: Could it be a lack of knowledge or understanding? Was it due to poor communication? Or perhaps it originated from a lapse in judgment? By identifying the root cause, it becomes feasible to develop a plan to address these issues and avoid repeating the same mistake. The Learning Circle: How to Resolve and Learn from Mistakes 1. Acknowledge the Mistake Refrain from denial or deflecting blame. Accept responsibility for the error, and recognize the impact it may have on others. Sincerely apologize to those affected by the mistake. 2. Analyze the Situation Examine the context leading up to the error and identify its root cause. Investigate how external factors may have influenced the decision-making process during that time. Strive to see the situation from different perspectives to create a comprehensive understanding of the events leading to the mistake. 3. Strategize and Implement Solutions Create a plan of action based on the insights gleaned from your analysis and develop strategies to mitigate the risk of recurrence. Communicate these strategies with those affected and collaborate to implement the necessary changes. 4. Review and Evaluate Monitor the effectiveness of the implemented changes to determine if they are successfully preventing further occurrences of the mistake. If you notice the error persists, reevaluate your approach and make adjustments as needed. 5. Share Your Experience When you share your experience, you not only solidify your learning but also potentially help others avoid similar missteps. Encourage open discussion about errors to establish a culture driven by continuous learning and improvement. Conclusion Repetition of mistakes can be a significant detriment to personal and professional growth, limiting our potential for success. By embracing resilience and a growth mindset, we can learn from our errors, adapt, and progress. Following the learning circle framework offers us the tools to face our mistakes head-on and build valuable insights from our experiences. Only then can we move closer to fulfilling our potential and breaking the precarious cycle of repeating mistakes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: building, london, michigan, cobblestones, paris Why is \\"paris\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"Paris is an answer aligned with human common sense as the most fitting choice for multiple reasons: 1. Romantic Association: Paris is often known as the \\"City of Love\\" and has a strong association with romance. Many couples dream of sharing romantic moments in Paris, which makes it a logical destination for a romantic vacation. 2. Iconic Locations: Paris is home to iconic landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, The Louvre, and the Notre-Dame Cathedral, which are often considered romantic settings. 3. Café Culture: Paris has a rich café culture, and sitting at an outdoor café is an integral part of the Parisian experience. The streets of Paris are lined with charming café terraces, which create a romantic atmosphere for couples. 4. Context Clues: Among the other given options for answers, none provides the same level of romantic association. The other options – building, London, Michigan, and cobblestones – do not evoke the same feelings of love and romance as Paris does. London is a city that can be considered romantic but is more known for its history, culture, and architecture, rather than being as closely associated with romance as Paris. Michigan is a U.S. state, which is not as specific as mentioning a romantic city or location. Cobblestones and building are generic elements that can be found in many places and do not convey a particular romantic atmosphere.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? There are several ways to organize a compare-and-contrast essay. Which one you choose depends on what works best for your ideas. Remember, you can change your organization later if you decide it isn’t working. Subject by subject. This organization deals with all of the points about Topic A, then all of the points of Topic B. For example, you could discuss all your points about frozen pizza (in as many paragraphs as necessary), then all your points about homemade pizza. The strength of this form is that you don’t jump back and forth as much between topics, which can help your essay read more smoothly. It can also be helpful if you are using one subject as a “lens” through which to examine the other. The major disadvantage is that the comparisons and contrasts don’t really become evident until much further into the essay, and it can end up reading like a list of “points” rather than a cohesive essay. Point by point. This type of organization switches back and forth between points. For example, you could first discuss the prices of frozen pizza vs. homemade pizza, then the quality of ingredients, then the convenience factor. The advantage of this form is that it’s very clear what you’re comparing and contrasting. The disadvantage is that you do switch back and forth between topics, so you need to make sure that you use transitions and signposts to lead your reader through your argument. Compare then contrast. This organization presents all the comparisons first, then all the contrasts. It’s a pretty common way of organizing an essay, and it can be helpful if you really want to emphasize how your subjects are different. Putting the contrasts last places the emphasis on them. However, it can be more difficult for your readers to immediately see why these two subjects are being contrasted if all the similarities are first. Outlining your essay will help you work out the main organizational structure and will give you a template to follow as you develop your ideas. No matter how you decided to organize your essay, you will still need to have the following types of paragraphs: Introduction. This paragraph comes first and presents the basic information about the subjects to be compared and contrasted. It should present your thesis and the direction of your essay (i.e., what you will discuss and why your readers should care). Body Paragraphs. These are the meat of your essay, where you provide the details and evidence that support your claims. Each different section or body paragraph should tackle a different division of proof. It should provide and analyze evidence in order to connect those proofs to your thesis and support your thesis. Many middle-school and high-school essays may only require three body paragraphs, but use as many as is necessary to fully convey your argument. Acknowledgement of Competitive Arguments/Concession. This paragraph acknowledges that other counter-arguments exist, but discusses how those arguments are flawed or do not apply. Conclusion. This paragraph summarizes the evidence presented. It will restate the thesis, but usually in a way that offers more information or sophistication than the introduction could. Remember: your audience now has all the information you gave them about why your argument is solid. They don’t need you to just reword your original thesis. Take it to the next level! Let's say you're working with the following statement: \\"When deciding between whether to go camping in the woods or spend a day at the beach, one should consider the following points: the weather, the types of activities each location offers, and the facilities at each location.\\" A subject-by-subject comparison would deal first with the woods, and then with the beach. This method of organization can be unwieldy, so if you choose it, be sure not to let your paragraphs become page-long lists of points about each subject. You can still have a paragraph per point about each subject; you’ll just put all the paragraphs about each subject together. A subject-to-subject body paragraph outline could look like this: Introduction: state your intent to discuss the differences between camping in the woods or on the beach. Body Paragraph 1 (Woods): Climate/Weather Body Paragraph 2 (Woods): Types of Activities and Facilities Body Paragraph 3 (Beach): Climate/Weather Body Paragraph 4 (Beach): Types of Activities and Facilities Conclusion This is the more common method used in the comparison and contrast essay. You can write a paragraph about each characteristic of both locations, comparing the locations in the same paragraph. For example, in this case, you could write one paragraph describing the weather in both the woods and the beach, one paragraph describing the activities in each location, and a third describing the facilities in both. Here's how the essay could look: Introduction Body Paragraph 1: Discuss first difference between woods and beaches: climate/weather. Woods Beach Body Paragraph 2: Discuss second difference between woods and beaches: types of activities. Woods Beach Body Paragraph 3: Discuss third difference between woods and beaches: available facilities. Woods Beach Conclusion This type of organization works best for when you want to emphasize the contrasts between your subjects. First, you discuss how your subjects are similar. Then, you end with how they’re different (and, usually, how one is superior). Here’s how your essay could look with this organization: Introduction Body Paragraph 1: Similarity between woods and beaches (both are places with a wide variety of things to do) Body Paragraph 2: First difference between woods and beaches (they have different climates) Body Paragraph 3: Second difference between woods and beaches (there are more easily accessible woods than beaches in most parts of the country) Body Paragraph 4: Emphasis on the superiority of the woods to the beach Conclusion Once you've chosen an organizational method for your body paragraphs, you'll need to have an internal organization for the body paragraphs themselves. Each of your body paragraphs will need to have the three following elements: Topic sentence: This sentence introduces the main idea and subject of the paragraph. It can also provide a transition from the ideas in the previous paragraph. Body: These sentences provide concrete evidence that support the topic sentence and main idea. Conclusion: this sentence wraps up the ideas in the paragraph. It may also provide a link to the next paragraph’s ideas.

It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The Southern Hemisphere is the half sphere of Earth which is south of the equator. It contains all or parts of five continents (Antarctica, Australia, about 90% of South America, the southern third of Africa, and several southern islands off the continental mainland of Asia), four oceans (Indian, South Atlantic, Southern, and South Pacific) and most of the Pacific Islands in Oceania. Its surface is 80.9% water, compared with 60.7% water in the case of the Northern Hemisphere, and it contains 32.7% of Earth's land. - Crayfish, also known as crawfish, crawdads, freshwater lobsters, mountain lobsters, mudbugs or yabbies, are freshwater crustaceans resembling small lobsters, to which they are related; taxonomically, they are members of the superfamilies Astacoidea and Parastacoidea. They breathe through feather-like gills. Some species are found in brooks and streams where there is running fresh water, while others thrive in swamps, ditches, and rice paddies. Most crayfish cannot tolerate polluted water, although some species such as \\"Procambarus clarkii\\" are hardier. Crayfish feed on living and dead animals and plants. - The South Pole, also known as the Geographic South Pole or Terrestrial South Pole, is one of the two points where the Earth's axis of rotation intersects its surface. It is the southernmost point on the surface of the Earth and lies on the opposite side of the Earth from the North Pole. - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations.

About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - In geology, a supercontinent is the assembly of most or all of Earth's continental blocks or cratons to form a single large landmass. However, the definition of a supercontinent can be ambiguous. Many earth scientists, such as P.F. Hoffman (1999), use the term \\"supercontinent\\" to mean \\"a clustering of nearly all continents\\". This definition leaves room for interpretation when labeling a continental body and is easier to apply to Precambrian times. Using the first definition provided here, Gondwana (a.k.a. Gondwanaland) is not considered a supercontinent, because the landmasses of Baltica, Laurentia and Siberia also existed at the same time but physically separate from each other. The landmass of Pangaea is the collective name describing all of these continental masses when they were in proximity to one another. This would classify Pangaea as a supercontinent. According to the definition by Rogers and Santosh (2004), a supercontinent does not exist today. Supercontinents have assembled and dispersed multiple times in the geologic past (see table). The positions of continents have been accurately determined back to the early Jurassic. However, beyond , continental positions are much less certain. - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of . The country's capital, Honiara, is located on the island of Guadalcanal. The country takes its name from the Solomon Islands archipelago, which is a collection of Melanesian islands that also includes the North Solomon Islands (part of Papua New Guinea), but excludes outlying islands, such as Rennell and Bellona, and the Santa Cruz Islands. - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - Parastacidae is the family of freshwater crayfish found in the southern hemisphere . The family is a classic Gondwana - distributed taxon , with extant members in South America , Madagascar , Australia , New Zealand and New Guinea , and extinct taxa also in Antarctica . - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Madagascar, officially the Republic of Madagascar, and previously known as the Malagasy Republic, is an island country in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Southeast Africa. The nation comprises the island of Madagascar (the fourth-largest island in the world), and numerous smaller peripheral islands. Following the prehistoric breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana, Madagascar split from the Indian peninsula around 88 million years ago, allowing native plants and animals to evolve in relative isolation. Consequently, Madagascar is a biodiversity hotspot; over 90% of its wildlife is found nowhere else on Earth. The island's diverse ecosystems and unique wildlife are threatened by the encroachment of the rapidly growing human population and other environmental threats. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart. - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - In paleogeography, Gondwana, also Gondwanaland, is the name given to an ancient supercontinent. It is believed to have sutured between about 573 and 510 million years ago (Mya), joining East Gondwana to West Gondwana. Gondwana formed prior to Pangaea, and later became part of it. - Procambarus clarkii is a freshwater crayfish species, native to the Southeastern United States, but found also on other continents, where it is often an invasive pest. It is known variously as the red swamp crawfish, red swamp crayfish, Louisiana crawfish, Louisiana crayfish or mudbug. - Lobsters comprise a family (Nephropidae, sometimes also Homaridae) of large marine crustaceans. What is the relationship between 'parastacidae' and 'parastacoidea'? Answer:","completion":"Parastacidae is a family within the infraorder Parastacoidea. In other words, Parastacidae is a group of freshwater crayfish species that belong to the larger infraorder called Parastacoidea.

Plot title: MASH Movie plot: The plot is told as a series of (presumably chronological) vignettes surrounding the life of the namesake Mobile Army Surgical Hospital where it is set. While the episodic film lacks the cohesion of an overarching singular plot with a traditional narrative structure, the vignettes do present a clear means for the film to explore the themes of military life. Set in 1951 in South Korea, the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital is assigned two replacements: Captains \\"Hawkeye\\" Pierce and \\"Duke\\" Forrest, who arrive in a stolen Jeep. They are insubordinate, womanizing, mischievous rule-breakers, but they soon prove to be excellent combat surgeons. As the film progresses, further scenes introduce additional characters. Some characters are already at the camp when Hawkeye and Duke arrive, such as the bumbling commander Henry Blake, his hyper-competent chief clerk Radar O'Reilly, the morose dentist Walter \\"Painless\\" Waldowski, the incompetent and pompous surgeon Frank Burns, and the contemplative Chaplain Father Mulcahy. Other characters arrive after Hawkeye and Duke, and become integrated into camp life, such as surgeon Trapper John and Nurse Margaret Houlihan. After the characters are introduced, which forms the opening act, further comedic episodes explore the evolving relationships between the characters. The main characters in the camp divide into two factions; Hawkeye, Duke, and Trapper John form one faction; all three were drafted into the army and are not as dedicated to the mission or lifestyle of the military. They are prone to pranks and heavy drinking. The other faction forms around the romantic relationship between Majors Houlihan and Burns, who are both career military personnel.

It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

It has special powers like stopping bad germs from getting in and keeping your body from losing too much water. Your superhero suit also helps you stay at the right temperature.

The sweat goes onto your skin and then goes away, and when it does, your body feels cooler. The second way your body cools down is by making tiny tunnels in your skin called blood vessels get bigger. This lets more of your warm blood go close to the surface of your skin so the heat can go out into the air, like opening a window to let the warmth out of a hot room.

Given these two elements, we can infer that the character's previous experience has led them to make a comparison between what they have seen on stage and this particular situation, leading them to believe that this may not be just another illusion. Now, let's examine the hypothesis statement: \\"He had a feeling that this was real magic.\\" To evaluate the validity of this hypothesis, we have to consider the factors that might contribute to the character coming to this conclusion. 1. The notable difference in the situation compared to prior experiences with stage illusions may lead the character to question the nature of what they are witnessing. This difference could stem from the complexity, execution, or result of the act – or even the seemingly impossible nature of what has been achieved. 2. The character's familiarity with stage illusions could put them in a position to be more skeptical and discerning about whether what they are witnessing is merely a trick or possibly something more. 3. One's belief in real magic might also come into play. If the character believes in the existence of real magic, they might be more open to the possibility that what they are witnessing is more than just a clever illusion. Taking into account all of these factors, it can be suggested that the hypothesis \\"He had a feeling that this was real magic.\\" is a plausible interpretation of the premise. The character's prior experience with stage illusions, combined with the distinct differences they notice in the situation, could reasonably lead them to question whether what they are witnessing might, in fact, be real magic. However, it is essential to note that the hypothesis remains a subjective interpretation. The character's feeling that this might be real magic is not definitive proof of its existence, and there may be alternative explanations for the observed differences. But based on the information provided in the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"He had a feeling that this was real magic.\\" is a valid interpretation of the character's thoughts and emotions in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University consist entirely of chairback seating.) - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court.

Background: Arthur Antunes Coimbra (Portuguese pronunciation: [aR'tuR a'tunis ko'ibra], born 3 March 1953 in Rio de Janeiro), better known as Zico (['ziku]), is a Brazilian coach and former footballer, who played as an attacking midfielder. Often called the \\"White Pele\\", he was a creative playmaker, with excellent technical skills, vision, and an eye for goal, who is considered one of the most clinical finishers and best passers ever, as well as one of the greatest players of all time. Arguably the world's best player of the late 1970s and early 80s, he is regarded as one of the best playmakers and free kick specialists in history, able to bend the ball in all directions. Context: After receiving offers from A.S. Roma and A.C. Milan, moving to Italy seemed right and a four-million dollar proposal from Udinese was on the table. Such amount of money made bigger clubs pressure the FIGC (Italian Football Federation) that blocked the transfer expecting financial guarantees. This caused a commotion in Udine as enraged Friulians flocked to the streets in protest against the Italian federation and the federal government. Historical reasons would make them shout \\"O Zico, o Austria!\\" (\\"Either Zico or Austria\\"). At the end of the controversy, the deal went through and though leaving Flamengo fans in sadness, Zico made the Friulians fans finally dream of better days. In the 1983-84 Serie A, his first in Italy, his partnership with Franco Causio promised to take Udinese to a higher level, gaining respect from giants Juventus and Roma. His free kicks caused such an impact that TV sports programs would debate how to stop them. Despite his excellent performance, the club's season ended in disappointment as Udinese, in spite of scoring almost twice as many goals as the previous year, only gathered 32 points and was ninth in the final standing, losing three places in comparison to 1982-83. His personal top scoring dispute against Juventus's Michel Platini was exciting - Zico scored 19 goals, one fewer than top scorer Platini, having played 4 fewer matches than the French footballer due to an injury. Plus, he was voted 1983 Player of the Year by World Soccer Magazine. His following season would be punctuated by injuries and suspensions for openly attacking referees. He also used to complain about the board's lack of ambition for not signing competitive players, which made the team too dependent on him. Furthermore, Italian tax officials pressed charges against him for tax evasion. Pressured, Zico delivered an amazing display against Diego Maradona's Napoli, his last match as a bianconero, and returned to Brazil and Flamengo, sponsored by a group of companies. He became a fan favorite with his spectacular goals and is still adored now by all Udinese fans. Question: when did he become involved with Udinese?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Zico became involved with Udinese in 1983 when he signed with the club after a four-million dollar proposal was accepted.

Please answer the following question: This article: Wilfred Glendon is a wealthy and world-renowned English botanist who journeys to Tibet in search of the elusive mariphasa plant. While there, he is attacked and bitten by a creature later revealed to be a werewolf, although he succeeds in acquiring a specimen of the mariphasa. Once back home in London he is approached by a fellow botanist, Dr. Yogami, who claims to have met him in Tibet while also seeking the mariphasa. Yogami warns Glendon that the bite of a werewolf would cause him to become a werewolf as well, adding that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease. Glendon does not believe the mysterious Yogami. That is, not until he begins to experience the first pangs of lycanthropy, first when his hand grows fur beneath the rays of his moon lamp (which he is using in an effort to entice the mariphasa to bloom), and later that night during the first full moon. The first time, Glendon is able to use a blossom from the mariphasa to stop his transformation. His wife Lisa is away at her aunt Ettie's party with her friend, former childhood sweetheart Paul Ames, allowing the swiftly transforming Glendon to make his way unhindered to his at-home laboratory, in the hopes of acquiring the mariphasa's flowers to quell his lycanthropy a second time. Unfortunately Dr. Yogami, who is revealed to be a werewolf, sneaks into the lab ahead of his rival and steals the only two blossoms. As the third has not bloomed, Glendon is out of luck. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who says that the mariphasa is a temporary antidote for the disease?, what is it ?

Only M6 crews fit my plasma. After installed, turned on the TV, my plasma dead and I found out the bottom of my plasma has a little crack. I researched online, people said that because of the TV mount caused the stress on the screen to crack. Now I am hesitance to hang my other new Samsung LCD with this mount. :-( Answer: Answer:","completion":"No, this product review is not positive. The reviewer describes a series of issues they encountered while using the product, which led to their dissatisfaction. 1) The product came with a missing part - the wrench stated in the picture. This indicates that the package and its contents were incomplete, causing inconvenience for the reviewer to assemble the product. 2) The reviewer experienced issues with the upper hook and bottom not snapping on perfectly. This highlights the poor design or assembly of the product and may potentially lower its safety and stability when mounting the TV. 3) The package provided a lot of screws, leading to confusion in selecting the correct size for the reviewer's TV. After identifying the M6 screws as suitable for their Panasonic plasma TV, the reviewer discovered their TV had stopped working and there was a crack at the bottom of the screen. This suggests that the product itself caused damage to the user's television, which is a significant issue. 4) Due to the negative experience with this product, the reviewer is now hesitant to use it with their new Samsung LCD TV, fearing that it may also cause damage to this device. Based on these points, it is clear that the reviewer is not satisfied with the product and does not recommend its usage. The issues highlighted in the review may deter potential buyers from purchasing this TV mount, as it appears to be of low quality, poorly designed, and carries the risk of damaging the user's TV."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review can be considered as mixed but leans towards being more negative. Explaining in detail, there are both positive and negative aspects listed in the review. The mention of \\"great service and atmosphere\\" indicates the reviewer had a positive experience with staff interaction, service speed and enjoyed the ambiance of the venue. This is an example of a positive sentiment, and it indicates that the overall experience was not completely unfavorable. However, the reviewer expresses more critical sentiments towards the most important aspect i.e., the food itself. The dissatisfaction related to the food being \\"overpriced\\" and not living up to the expected quality, specifically in regards to the blackened salmon not being properly blackened, outweighs the positive experiences. Dissatisfaction with the essential aspect of a restaurant's offering, which is the food, creates a largely negative perspective. Furthermore, the concluding statement that the reviewer would \\"come back for a drink but not the food\\" solidifies the largely negative sentiment of this review. This suggests that, while other aspects of the establishment were satisfying, the primary reason for a restaurant visit—enjoying tasty food—was not met. Therefore, while it has elements of a positive review, overall this review carries a negative sentiment because the dining experience did not meet the reviewer's expectations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"How did I get into this place? \\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"How was I not able to get in?\\" true?","completion":"Step 1: Understanding the premise The premise \\"How did I get into this place?\\" is asking for information or explanation about how someone managed to arrive or enter a specific location. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis \\"How was I not able to get in?\\" questions the inability to enter a specific location. It is not a statement with a true or false value, but rather a related question exploring a hypothetical (and opposite) situation. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis Upon comparing, we can see that the premise and the hypothesis are related in the sense that they both refer to the person's ability to enter a place. However, the premise asks for information about how the person entered the place, while the hypothesis is about the inability to enter, implying a scenario where they did not gain entry into the place. Step 4: Evaluating the truth-value of the hypothesis based on the premise The hypothesis \\"How was I not able to get in?\\" cannot directly be labeled as true or false based on the premise \\"How did I get into this place?\\" because they address two different scenarios; the premise focuses on the successful entry, whereas the hypothesis focuses on the inability to enter. Conclusion: The hypothesis \\"How was I not able to get in?\\" cannot be determined as true or false based solely on the premise \\"How did I get into this place?\\" as they address different scenarios – successful entry and inability to enter, respectively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Fist bumping, a form of greeting popularized by President Obama, spreads significantly fewer germs than the more traditional alternative, according to a new study. A fist bump transmits just one-twentieth the amount of bacteria that a handshake does. It is also a less germy option than a high-five, which still spreads less than half the amount of germs typically spread through a handshake, the new research found. In the study, published in the August issue of the American Journal of Infection Control, researchers wanted to see whether alternative greetings would transmit fewer germs than the traditional handshake. One greeter immersed a sterile-gloved hand into a container of germs. One the glove was dry, the greeter exchanged a handshake, fist bump or high-five with a sterile-gloved recipient. Then the researchers examined the number of bacteria on transferred during the experiment. The study was conducted in response to the recent call from the journal JAMA to ban handshakes from the hospital environment. \\"Adoption of the fist bump as a greeting could substantially reduce the transmission of infectious diseases between individuals,\\" study author David Whitworth of Aberystwyth University in the United Kingdom said in a statement. \\"It is unlikely that a no-contact greeting could supplant the handshake; however, for the sake of improving public health we encourage further adoption of the fist bump as a simple, free, and more hygienic alternative to the handshake.\\" Healthcare providers' hands can spread potentially harmful germs to patients, which may lead to healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). HAIs are some of the leading causes of preventable harm and death in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that one in 25 hospitalized patients develops an HAI and 75,000 patients with HAIs die during their hospitalization each year. A fist bump is more sanitary than a handshake because of the smaller amount of surface area in contact between the two hands, the study suggests. \\"It's a novel study,\\" though the results are not surprising, said Mary Lou Manning, president-elect of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology. Manning's organization publishes the journal. Manning said that she hasn't seen much fist-bumping or high-fiving in hospitals, where handshakes are more common. However, they must be followed by good hand-washing, she added. Whitworth said he hopes that these habits change. \\"In a hospital, you really don't want people to shake hands. It's an unnecessary risk,\\" he told the AP. ||||| Also Meets CME requirements for: Accreditation Information The American Medical Association is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

A new study shows that when you fist bump someone, you share fewer germs than when you shake hands or even high-five them. This is because there is less skin touching, so it's harder for germs to move from one person to another. In hospitals, where germs can make people sick, it might be a good idea for doctors and nurses to use fist bumps instead of handshakes. This could help keep patients healthier and stop the spread of infections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). After reading the above, is \\"Parent and child\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\"? Available options: (1). no (2). yes","completion":"Yes, \\"parent and child\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"What kind of relationships did Confucius say must be hierarchical and dictatorial, and if they are not what would happen?\\". Confucius emphasized the importance of proper and harmonious relationships between various roles in society, which included those between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, and the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial, with potential consequences if the order was disturbed. Specifically, the text indicates that the disobedient son who defied his father's authority would risk bringing disaster upon himself and his family."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among the commodities exchanged when foreign ships called were Hawaiian women, who soon gained a measure of economic independence through prostitution and other endeavors involving outsiders. Does it follow that \\"Hawaiian women were considered a commodity at one point in time.\\"? Possible answers: a). yes. b). it is not possible to tell. c). no.","completion":"a). Yes. The statement given suggests that Hawaiian women were indeed considered a commodity at one point in time, as they were among the commodities exchanged when foreign ships called. In the context provided, it appears that during this period, the women gained a measure of economic independence through prostitution and other endeavors involving outsiders. Historically, this can be traced back to the times when Western ships started frequenting the Hawaiian Islands, as early as the late 1700s, with the arrival of explorers such as Captain James Cook. As contact between Hawaiians and Westerners increased, the interactions led to a shift in the indigenous culture and economy. With more ships calling in at the islands, there was a growing demand for supplies, companionship, and entertainment for the crew members, leading to the exchange of commodities including Hawaiian women. It is important to note that considering human beings as commodities is morally and ethically wrong, and would not be accepted in present-day society. However, in the past, such instances have occurred in various places around the world, reflecting a darker side of human history. As prostitution and other economic activities involving outsiders provided a means for these women to achieve a degree of financial independence, it can be inferred that they were viewed as commodities at that moment in time. However, it is essential to understand this in its historical context when evaluating the changing perceptions and values concerning women and respecting the dignity of human life."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Premise: Before the conquests, the Aryans were organized in three warriors, priests, and commoners. Hypothesis: The Aryans considered themselves civilized. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise? Choices: [I] yes. [II] it is not possible to tell. [III] no. And the answer is:","completion":"[II] it is not possible to tell. The premise provided briefly describes the organizational structure of the Aryan society before the conquests, dividing them into three main groups: warriors, priests, and commoners. This information highlights a social structure in place among the Aryans, but it does not provide enough evidence to support the hypothesis that the Aryans considered themselves civilized. To determine if the Aryans considered themselves civilized, more information would be needed. For example, insights into their cultural values, beliefs about their society, their level of technological or social development, or their relationships with neighboring societies would paint a clearer picture of how they perceived themselves in terms of civilization. It is important to remember that the concept of civilization is subjective and can vary across time and different cultures. Therefore, to establish if the Aryans considered themselves civilized, a more comprehensive understanding of their self-perception, culture, and societal values needs to be established."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The body of Giulio Regeni, which showed clear signs of torture, was dumped beside a road near Cairo on 3 February. Egypt's interior ministry said on Thursday that police had found his bag in a flat linked to members of a criminal gang killed in a shoot-out. The UK academics called for an inquiry into Mr Regeni's death. The 28-year-old Italian student had been researching trade unions, a politically sensitive subject in Egypt. Human rights groups and opposition figures have speculated that he was killed by members of the Egyptian security forces - claims Egyptian officials have strongly denied. Dr Andrea Teti, senior lecturer at the University of Aberdeen, said the official claim that Mr Regeni had been murdered by a criminal gang was the \\"latest and greatest implausible statement in a long line of risible official positions\\". Dr John Chalcraft, associate professor from the Department of Government at the London School of Economics, said: \\"The allegation that a criminal gang abducted, tortured and killed Giulio is inherently implausible and unlikely. \\"The threat of criminal gangs targeting foreigners has not registered in any university risk assessments in regard to researchers in Cairo, as far as I am aware.\\" Professor William Brown, Emeritus Master of Darwin College, who worked with Mr Regeni, is one of six Cambridge University lecturers who have written to the Egyptian embassy in London demanding answers.

I realize many people will probably stare me down in disgust, but I will not be held to liking a place just because so many others do. Perhaps I am just not on board with the traditional Japanese dining experience this place supposedly offers. I am not a fan of the menu on the walls. Why can't I get a menu? They are hindering those of us who happen to have prescriptions, but sometimes do not like to wear our glasses for a night out, as was my case on the night I went here. I went with a friend for her birthday (and I was picking up the bill, hurray!). She had been here many times before me, so I let her lead the way. First off I was incredibly disappointed with their service from the get-go. They offered us a table, but let us know that the table would be needed in about an hour for a large party that was coming in. Um, okay, then why offer us the table? Why not put us on a wait list for a table that is not going to be needed? ANYWAY, we figured we wouldn't take over an hour to eat since it was just the two of us and we were starving, so we took the table. I had no idea what to order, and especially since I do not know Japanese food that well, the menu was a little scary for me. I mean, I am very apt to try things I've never heard of, but the server wouldn't even come around to explain some dishes. My friend ordered us a pretty decent salad. Something else that had a BUNCH of kimchee in it, which I quickly had a bite of and ignored. Lastly, we ordered the Honey Toast dessert, which I absolutely adored and ate half of because I had had barely anything for actual DINNER. Oh right - dirty silverware I had to have taken back and brought out to me, but waited for it for about 20 mins. This place is over-hyped and you can tell because it gets incredibly packed and very loud. The service is mediocre at best. All in all I would not make a return visit.","completion":"The review provided is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with their experience at Ichiza, specifically noting issues with the menu format, service, and ambiance. They found the menu on the walls inconvenient, especially for those who have vision difficulties. The reviewer also experienced poor service including being offered a table with a time constraint, an unhelpful server when it came to explaining dishes, and having to wait for clean silverware. Additionally, they found the place to be over-hyped, packed, and very loud, which diminished their overall dining experience. Although they enjoyed the Honey Toast dessert, it was not enough to counteract their negative impression of Ichiza, ultimately leading to a 2-star review and an unwillingness to return."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This allowed Charles' sisters Maria Theresa and Margaret Theresa to pass their rights onto the children of their marriages with Louis XIV and Emperor Leopold. Despite being opponents for many years, Louis and William III attempted to resolve the Succession by diplomacy. This resulted in the 1698 Treaty of the Hague and 1700 Treaty of London or the First and Second Partition Treaties between France, Britain and the Dutch Republic.Maria Antonia , daughter of Leopold and Margaret, married Maximillian Emanuel of Bavaria in 1685 and they had one surviving son, Joseph Ferdinand. The 1698 Treaty made the six year old heir to the bulk of the Spanish Monarchy and divided its European territories between France and Austria. Imposing a solution to such an important issue on Spain and Austria always seemed unlikely, even without the deep levels of mutual mistrust between the signatories. The Spanish refused to accept the division of their Empire and on 14 November 1698, Charles published his Will, making Joseph Ferdinand heir to an independent and undivided Spanish Monarchy. When he died of smallpox in February 1699, an alternative was required.

Berliner's earliest discs, first marketed in 1889, but only in Europe, were 5 inches (13 cm) in diameter, and were played with a small hand-propelled machine. Both the records and the machine were adequate only for use as a toy or curiosity, due to the limited sound quality. In the United States in 1894, under the Berliner Gramophone trademark, Berliner started marketing records with somewhat more substantial entertainment value, along with somewhat more substantial gramophones to play them. Berliner's records had poor sound quality compared to wax cylinders, but his manufacturing associate Eldridge R. Johnson eventually improved the sound quality. Abandoning Berliner's \\"Gramophone\\" trademark for legal reasons, in 1901 Johnson's and Berliner's separate companies reorganized to form the Victor Talking Machine Company, whose products would come to dominate the market for many years.

Here is a question about this article: Typical American families did not fare as well, nor did those \\"wealthy-but-not wealthiest\\" families just beneath the pyramid's top. On the other hand, half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis. The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009, and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all Americans declined in that period. 77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth, while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease. What is the answer to this question: How many of the poorest families did not have any wealth decline during the financial crisis?","completion":"To find the answer to the question, let's break down the given information: 1. Half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines during the crisis. 2. The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households. Since half of the poorest families did not experience a wealth decline, we need to determine how many of those families were in the bottom half. Step 1: Calculate the number of poorest families. 50% of the families are considered the poorest families. Number of poorest families = 0.5 * Total number of households surveyed Number of poorest families = 0.5 * 4,000 Number of poorest families = 2,000 families Step 2: Calculate the number of poorest families who did not experience wealth decline. 50% of the poorest families did not have a decline in wealth. Number of poorest families without a wealth decline = 0.5 * Number of poorest families Number of poorest families without a wealth decline = 0.5 * 2,000 Number of poorest families without a wealth decline = 1,000 families So, 1,000 of the poorest families did not have any wealth decline during the financial crisis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Controversatul proces a 196 de persoane acuzate de complot în vederea răsturnării guvernului a adâncit neîncrederea în rândul facţiunilor politice din Turcia. Translate to English","completion":"The controversial trial of 196 people accused of plotting to overthrow the government has deepened the mistrust among political factions in Turkey. The extensive trial involving a significant number of 196 individuals accused of conspiring to overthrow the government has led to increased distrust and tension among various political factions in Turkey. This controversial trial has not only impacted the political climate in the country but also triggered broader concerns regarding the transparency and fairness of the judicial system. The charged individuals are said to be involved in a highly-coordinated effort with the aim of destabilizing and eventually overthrowing the existing government, leading to serious consequences for the nation's democratic processes. It is essential to note that the political factions involved in the conspiracy may have different motivations and ultimate goals, further complicating the already intricate situation. The main reasons behind the deepening mistrust among political factions are the scale and scope of the alleged conspiracy, public reaction to the proceedings, and possible repercussions on Turkey's international relations. As a result, this trial has become a precedent, adding fuel to the ongoing debates on political freedom, separation of powers, and the judiciary's independence in Turkey. One of the consequences of this mistrust is that it has created a highly polarized environment in which different factions cannot engage in meaningful dialogue and negotiation on critical issues. This political polarization has proven harmful to national unity as it hinders the development of consensus on crucial subjects relevant to Turkey's future, thereby affecting its economic growth, social cohesion, and international standing. Moreover, the emergence of such a large-scale conspiracy also raises questions about the effectiveness of Turkey's intelligence and security apparatus. The fact that such a plot could be devised and potentially implemented without being detected earlier suggests potential weaknesses in the country's defense mechanisms. Another concern is the potential abuse of power by various stakeholders involved in the trial, including politicians, judiciary officials, and law enforcement agencies. The controversial nature of the case, along with the high stakes involved, may lead to exploitation and corruption in pursuit of political or personal goals. This could further undermine the public's confidence in the justice system and fuel even more mistrust among political factions. In conclusion, the controversial trial of 196 people accused of plotting to overthrow the government is a pivotal event that has deepened the mistrust among political factions in Turkey. The significance of this trial, its potential implications on the political climate and national unity, and the questions it raises about the effectiveness of the country's security and the fairness of the justice system are all factors that contribute to this heightened sense of mistrust and insecurity among Turkey's political players."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Possible answers: -Use a stiff nail brush to scrub the racks.; -Use a plastic comb to scrub the racks.;","completion":"To properly clean the oven racks, it is crucial to use the most appropriate tool for the task. Between the two possible solutions provided - using a stiff nail brush and using a plastic comb - the more sound option in terms of naive physics reasoning would be to use a stiff nail brush to scrub the racks. There are several factors that contribute to this choice being more reasonable: 1. Material: A stiff nail brush is typically made of sturdier material than a plastic comb. This means that the brush can withstand the pressure, friction, and possible corrosiveness of oven cleaning agents used during the cleaning process. A plastic comb, on the other hand, may not be as robust and its teeth might break or get damaged when scrubbing the oven racks. 2. Bristle design: The stiff bristles of a nail brush are designed to effectively remove dirt and grime, making it particularly well-suited to cleaning oven racks. These bristles can reach into the crevices and corners of the racks and help dislodge stubborn, baked-on food particles. A plastic comb does not have these bristles and, as such, would not provide the same level of cleaning efficacy. 3. Ergonomics: A stiff nail brush usually has a design that allows for a firm grip, making it more comfortable for extended use when cleaning oven racks. A plastic comb may not offer the same ergonomic comfort during the cleaning process, and it may also be challenging to apply the necessary pressure using a plastic comb without it slipping or breaking. 4. Effectiveness: Overall, the stiffness and design of a nail brush offer greater effectiveness in achieving a thorough clean of the oven racks. The bristles can penetrate and scrub surfaces more efficiently, and they can endure pressure and scrubbing motions better than a plastic comb. In conclusion, using a stiff nail brush to clean oven racks is the more sound solution when considering naive physics reasoning. The brush is better equipped to handle the task due to its material, design, ergonomics, and overall effectiveness compared to a plastic comb."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Problem:Question: Which is the fourth planet from the sun? Answer: mars Solution:","completion":"To support the answer that Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun, we can provide the following facts and explanations: 1. Order of the planets: In our solar system, the order of the planets from the Sun is Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. As we can see, Mars comes right after Earth, making it the fourth planet in the sequence. 2. Mars' distance from the Sun: Mars orbits at an average distance of about 227.9 million kilometers (141.6 million miles) from the Sun. This distance places Mars as the fourth planet in our solar system, following Earth at around 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles) from the Sun. 3. Mars' orbital period: The time it takes Mars to complete one orbit around the Sun is about 687 Earth days, which is close to two Earth years. This orbital period further confirms its position as the fourth planet from the Sun, as the planets' orbital periods generally increase with their distance from the Sun. 4. Mars' characteristics: Mars is the second smallest planet in our solar system and is known as the 'Red Planet' due to its reddish appearance from the iron oxide (rust) on its surface. It has the largest volcano and the longest canyon in our solar system, further proving its uniqueness as the fourth planet from the Sun. 5. Mars exploration: Many space missions have been targeted at Mars, such as NASA's Mars Exploration Rover program, which includes the rovers Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity, as well as the recent Perseverance mission. The focus on Mars exploration provides additional evidence of its position in our solar system, as the fourth planet from the Sun."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Answer based on context: While attending to his pastoral duties, Laestadius continued his interest in botany and authored a number of articles on plant life in Lapland. Because of the wide recognition for his knowledge of botany and the Sami, the French Admiralty invited Laestadius to participate in the La Recherche Expedition to Samiland of 1838-40. As an expedition member, Laestadius served as field guide for the islands and the interior of Northern Norway and Sweden, studying both plant life and the culture of the Sami inhabitants. During the expedition, Laestadius at the request of the organizers began his manuscript. Eventually published for the first time more than 150 years later Fragments of Lappish Mythology provides a snapshot of Sami traditional religious beliefs that by the 1830s were passing into history due to the Church of Sweden's Christianization mandate in full swing at that time. However, Laestadius did not finish the manuscript until long afterward. Then the completed work was lost for many years. Due to these and other reasons, the manuscript was not published until 1997, over 150 years after the expedition. For his participation in the La Recherche Expedition, Laestadius was awarded the Medal of Honor of the Legion of Honor of France after 1841. He was the first Scandinavian to receive this honor. The Church of Sweden was causing what culture's beliefs to die off?","completion":"The Church of Sweden was causing the traditional religious beliefs of the Sami culture to die off. This was due to the Christianization mandate that the church was enforcing at that time, which aimed at converting the Sami people to Christianity and, as a consequence, led to the decline of their traditional beliefs and practices. The Sami people, also referred to as Laplanders or Saami, are indigenous people inhabiting the Arctic areas of Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia, collectively known as Sápmi or Samiland. Lars Levi Laestadius, a Swedish pastor, botanist, and author, was instrumental in documenting the Sami culture and traditional beliefs. During the La Recherche Expedition, he began writing a manuscript on Lappish mythology which provided a valuable insight into the fading religious beliefs of the Sami people. However, the publication of this manuscript was delayed for multiple reasons and ultimately appeared more than 150 years later in 1997. Laestadius's efforts to document Sami culture helped preserve an important part of their heritage. Although the Christianization efforts of the Church of Sweden in the 19th century significantly impacted Sami beliefs and practices, the work of scholars like Laestadius has contributed to a better understanding of the traditional religious beliefs of this unique indigenous culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we're going to talk about something really important. Have you ever felt like you wanted something that someone else has or wished you could do something you know you shouldn't? Well, it happens to everyone, even grown-ups! We have a lot of feelings inside us, and sometimes they can be tricky, but don't worry, we're here to help you understand them better. 1. Separate fantasy from reality: When we really, really want something, we might start to imagine how amazing it would be to have it. But sometimes, it's just make-believe, like when we watch cartoons or play pretend. So, remember to tell yourself that not everything we imagine can happen in real life, and that's okay! 2. Realize that you don’t always have to act on your feelings: Just like we don't always get to eat our favorite ice cream flavor, we don't always get to do what our feelings tell us. We can feel sad, angry or jealous, but we don't have to act on them. Instead, we could talk to someone we trust about what we're feeling, like a parent, teacher or friend. 3. Remember that the grass isn’t always greener: You might look at your friend's toy and think theirs is better than yours, but remember that everyone has different things and that's okay! People have different toys, clothes, and friends, and it doesn't mean one is better than the other. It's like how we have different flavors of ice cream; we all like different things! 4. Set boundaries: Imagine you're playing in a sandbox. It's important to know where the edges of the sandbox are so that you don't get sand all over the place. The same thing goes for our feelings and actions. We need to learn when to say \\"no\\" and when to stop doing something if it makes us or someone else feel yucky. This can help us play nicely with others and make good decisions. 5. Give yourself time: Sometimes, our feelings can feel very big and heavy, like a giant backpack. When this happens, it's important to remember that it might take some time for our feelings to feel smaller and lighter. So, give yourself some time to breathe, relax, and maybe even talk to someone you trust about what's going on. In conclusion, it's important to learn about our feelings and how to handle them in a good way. By separating fantasy from reality, not acting on our feelings all the time, remembering that the grass isn't always greener, setting boundaries, and giving ourselves time, we can make good choices and be happier! Remember, if you ever need help understanding your feelings, it's always great to talk to a grown-up you trust. Now go out and have some fun!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These programs should focus on providing the necessary skills and qualifications for workers to excel in industries such as renewable energy, sustainable construction, environmental conservation, waste management, and organic agriculture. By adapting the curriculum and offering specialized courses, educational institutions can ensure that the workforce is better prepared for the growing demands of the green job market. 4. Collaboration Between Stakeholders The creation of green jobs requires a holistic approach, with collaboration between various stakeholders, including governments, businesses, labor organizations, and educational institutions. By fostering partnerships, sharing resources, and working on joint initiatives, various sectors and individuals can benefit from the growing green economy. This collaboration can lead to the development of innovative solutions, resulting in more job opportunities and a better-prepared workforce. 5. Raising Public Awareness and Encouraging Social Responsibility Educating the public on the importance of green jobs and sustainable practices is crucial for the development of a thriving green economy. Through comprehensive marketing campaigns, environmental education programs and corporate social responsibility initiatives, businesses and governments can raise awareness about the benefits of eco-friendly practices and encourage individuals to prioritize sustainability. Increased public awareness can lead to heightened demand for green products and services, thus stimulating the growth of the green job market. Conclusion In summary, the creation of green jobs is essential to address the dual crisis of economic slowdown and environmental degradation. By adopting supportive policies and regulations, investing in clean technologies and infrastructure, implementing comprehensive education and training programs, fostering collaboration between stakeholders, and raising public awareness on the importance of sustainability, we can create a greener and more prosperous future. While the transition to a green economy will require concerted effort and commitment from all sectors, it presents a unique opportunity to build a more sustainable and equitable global society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Part #3: Create all possible lists by dropping one item each time. Usage: By removing each item one-by-one from the input list, we create the following new lists: 1. ['6', 'V', 'f', 'e', '1'] (dropped '5') 2. ['5', 'V', 'f', 'e', '1'] (dropped '6') 3. ['5', '6', 'f', 'e', '1'] (dropped 'V') 4. ['5', '6', 'V', 'e', '1'] (dropped 'f') 5. ['5', '6', 'V', 'f', '1'] (dropped 'e') 6. ['5', '6', 'V', 'f', 'e'] (dropped '1') Part #4: Compile all the created lists into a single list. Usage: Combine all the new lists created by dropping one item from the input list, resulting in the final output list: [['6', 'V', 'f', 'e', '1'], ['5', 'V', 'f', 'e', '1'], ['5', '6', 'f', 'e', '1'], ['5', '6', 'V', 'e', '1'], ['5', '6', 'V', 'f', '1'], ['5', '6', 'V', 'f', 'e']].

When Steve sees this man he freaks out a bit but won't tell Darren why. After the show, Steve tells Darren to go home, and that he will follow later. Darren says yes, but instead sneaks upstairs to see what Steve is up to. He sees Steve talking to Mr. Crepsley and overhears their conversation. Steve tells Mr. Crepsley that he knows that his real name is Vur Horston and is a Vampire. He tells Larten that he would like to join him and become an apprentice.

I was very happy and excited to use this brewer and k-cups, and it worked fine for approx. 8 months. I followed the cleaning and de-scaling instructions, but it would intermittently have trouble brewing. It would work after re-booting, but progressively got worse. The coffee maker lasted for a year and a half, and at that point it completely quit. De-scaling didn't work, and it seemed that the system sounded like it was trying to brew a cup, but the water would never come out. The support line was extremely unhelpful. All they recommended was cleaning the system, and unclogging the tips. After telling them I did this twice in one week with no help, all they could offer me was a 70 discount towards a new Keurig coffee maker since it was past the one year warranty.

As the children went back to their classes, the suspect went on the attack, injuring at least 14 kids, officials add. \\"[She] just ran at them with a knife. The teachers were dumbstruck,\\" one local resident tells CNN. Video making the rounds online shows children being led to ambulances, some bleeding, with apparent knife wounds on their faces; the South China Morning Post has a short video of the chaos after the stabbing. All of the attacked children were said to have been treated at the hospital. The suspect, who Gulf News reports was eventually stopped by teachers and guards, was arrested and taken into custody. No motive has yet been offered. The AP notes that in China, the sale and possession of firearms is restricted, so attacks are usually carried out with knives or DIY explosives. (In 2010, more than two dozen kids were stabbed at a Chinese kindergarten.)

According to reports by the Associated Press (AP) and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), the suspect, a 39-year-old woman identified only by her last name, Liu, managed to infiltrate the school premises at approximately 9:30 am while the children were participating in their daily recreational activities. As the unsuspecting kindergartners headed back to their classrooms, the attacker went on a rampage, resulting in at least 14 children being wounded. A local resident provided a chilling account of the scene to CNN, saying, \\"[She] just ran at them with a knife. The teachers were dumbstruck.\\" Following the attack, circulating videos on the internet showcase the aftermath of the terrifying incident, depicting children being guided towards ambulances, some bleeding profusely, with apparent knife-inflicted injuries to their faces. The South China Morning Post has also published a brief video capturing the chaos that unfolded immediately after the stabbings. Fortunately, all of the injured children have received medical treatment at a local hospital. The suspect, who was eventually subdued by teachers and security guards in a commendable act of courage, has been apprehended and placed under arrest. At the time of writing, no motive for the brutal attack has been determined or offered. The AP highlights that, in China, due to the strict regulations surrounding the sale and possession of firearms, attackers usually resort to using knives or improvising explosive devices to carry out their violent intentions. In 2010, a similar incident occurred where more than two dozen children were stabbed at a Chinese kindergarten. This tragic event has raised questions and concerns about school safety and security measures, particularly regarding how the attacker was able to access the premises so easily. It serves as a painful reminder that even seemingly safe spaces like schools can be vulnerable to unforeseen acts of violence. It is essential for educational institutions to continually assess and improve their security measures to ensure the well-being, safety, and peace of mind of students, staff, and parents alike. As the community struggles to come to terms with this appalling act of violence, the importance of increased vigilance, heightened security measures, and continuous threat assessments within schools has become all the more pressing. As parents and educators grapple with the impact of such events on the emotional wellbeing of their children, the dialogue on creating safer school environments must remain at the forefront of public consciousness."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I’m on strong painkillers, which have side effects that make me very drowsy. I’m also dealing with a number of mental health issues, one of which is anxiety about whether or not I deserve help/special treatment (this is relevant) So last week, I had very bad cramps. They were so bad that while I was in school, I was curled up on the floor of the common room unable to move. I end up having to miss a mandatory assembly because I can’t move. My teacher is an amazing woman and is completely understanding when the situation is explained to her. I end up missing two assemblies, but that was last week, and I assume the situation is over. Fast forward to today, and I’m having a really bad day mentally. I’m exhausted, and extremely self loathing, and I’m contemplating skipping lunch (also mandatory) I skipped lunch every day last week, which has resulted in teachers monitoring who goes to lunch. I tell my friend I don’t think I can go to lunch (I have an issue with food, and anxiety around people eating). She is usually very understanding with my mental and physical limitations, so I assumed she’d be okay with it. Instead, she rolled her eyes and said ‘oh yeah, like you skipped assembly last week’. I was rather taken aback, but I reminded her that I skipped because I couldn’t move. She said ‘yes you could have, it wasn’t your legs, was it?’ At this point I’m starting to freak out internally. I’m thinking, if she (my best friend) doesn’t believe me when I say I can’t do something due to a physical limitation, what does everyone else think? I’m getting very anxious, and I go on the defensive. We have an argument, and I say that I think she’s being very insensitive to my situation-I don’t enjoy having to miss out on things because of my period, especially since it’s for a month every week (I miss out on good stuff as well, I often spend whole days in bed when I can’t move) She takes offence to this, and tells me about all the times she’s supported me with my mental health issues (which she has, brilliantly) and how ungrateful I’m being. I tell her that I’m extremely grateful for what she’s done for me, and I end up apologising for calling her insensitive. She apologises too, but begrudgingly, and I can tell she doesn’t understand why I’m upset, but I don’t dare try to explain for fear she’ll get mad again.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the premise and hypothesis Premise: We need to track Miss Vandemeyer again. Hypothesis: A new plan to locate Miss Vandemeyer will be resource intensive. Step 2: Analyze the connection between the premise and the hypothesis To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to evaluate whether the need to track Miss Vandemeyer again necessarily leads to the creation of a resource-intensive plan. Step 3: Consider possible scenarios There are several scenarios to consider: Scenario 1: A new plan to locate Miss Vandemeyer is developed, but it is not resource intensive; perhaps new information or technologies help streamline the process. Scenario 2: A new plan to locate Miss Vandemeyer is developed, and it is resource intensive; possibly due to the lack of information, her evasive tactics, or the need to use more resources to find her. Step 4: Evaluate if the premise entails the hypothesis From the possible scenarios, we can see that the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. While it is possible that a new plan to locate Miss Vandemeyer may be resource intensive, it is not guaranteed. Other factors, such as available information, technologies, and circumstances, can affect the resource intensity of a new plan. Conclusion: The premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Let's solve this math problem together. We need to find the value of 'p' in the given equation: -99*p - 3743 + 1606 = -320*p + 8913 First, let's simplify the equation by combining the numbers: -99*p - 2137 = -320*p + 8913 Now, we want to get all the 'p' terms on one side of the equation and the numbers on the other side. Let's start by adding 320*p to both sides of the equation to move all the 'p' terms to the left side: -99*p + 320*p - 2137 = 8913 221*p - 2137 = 8913 Now, move the -2137 to the right side by adding 2137 to both sides: 221*p = 11050 Finally, we need to divide both sides by the number in front of 'p' (221) to get the value of 'p': p = 11050 / 221 p = 50 So the solution to the math problem is p = 50.

Hotel California My first thought: I was going crazy. Twenty-four hours of silence (vacuum, remember); was I hallucinating noises now? I heard it again. It was a fine bell, reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals I'd seen in documentaries. And accompanying the bell, I saw a light. Now, there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense. First, the whole in-a-vacuum why's-there-a-bell thing. Second, I was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship, and any conceivable light sources were not within view; starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright. These signals were the heralds of my saviors. The first words they said to me meant nothing. I wasn't listening; I didn't care; I was going to live; I was going to keep breathing. Next to those, nothing else mattered. The recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth, and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about life-giving substances and how breathing was like sex, only better. (I reserved the right to revise this opinion later.) When I was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue, I looked around. The ship, it was odd and old, either so outdated or so heavily modified that I couldn't tell what make it was, and somehow, the crew standing around me fit the same description, a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk. And me, I guess I was one more piece in their puzzle. I was one more scrap to weld onto the rest, one more stranded survivor who was found. I was now one of them.

However, it might also indicate a potentially negative aspect, as some people may perceive \\"weighty issues\\" as serious, heavy, or difficult subject matter. 4. \\"colorfully wrapped up\\" - This phrase is generally considered positive, as it implies that the presentation of the weighty issues is visually appealing and not dull or plain. 5. \\"in his own idiosyncratic strain of kitschy goodwill\\" - This phrase seems mostly positive. \\"Idiosyncratic\\" means unique and personal, which can be considered a positive trait as it points to the artist's originality. \\"Kitschy goodwill\\" might have mixed connotations, as \\"kitschy\\" could imply a lack of taste or tackiness, but \\"goodwill\\" evokes a positive, friendly atmosphere.

It works like this: someone posts a topic to their blog that is critical or controversial. This person can either be a community member, commentator, employee or otherwise; it doesn’t matter who the person is. Then what happens is a series of comments are posted to that blog entry from readers that are critical of the post, thus challenging the author on their views. The author then either deletes the blog entry or disables the comments based on the feedback. In other words, a viewpoint is shared, an invitation for comment is provided, but that invitation is then revoked when the author of the blog post is dissatisfied with the response from their readers. I have seen this happen countless times over the years and I don’t like this. I believe we should all be accountable for our words. Our words have the ability to inspire, to entertain, to challenge, but to also hurt. Actions have consequences, and so do words. As such, when I see someone openly share their thoughts on their blog and invite their readers to provide comments, I see that as a wonderful demonstration of accountability and engagement; debate is a beautiful thing when executed with politeness and respect. To then close that door, seemingly because people disagree with you, is in my mind the equivalent of walking out of a room in the middle of a debate. The excuse when folks are criticized of this behavior is typically “it is my blog and I can run it how I like“. This is true: it is your blog, and you can run it how you like, but the true measure of a person is not just in what they say, but also in the conversation and discourse that follows.

A correct answer is one that correctly and completely answers the question. Do not write answers that address the question partially or incorrectly. The correct answer must be contained in the given paragraph. Input: Paragraph- Sent 1: In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. Sent 2: in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. Sent 3: So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. Sent 4: You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. Sent 5: The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Sent 6: Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. Sent 7: These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. Sent 8: If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. Sent 9: The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Sent 10: Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Sent 11: Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. Sent 12: During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. Sent 13: It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Sent 14: Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. Sent 15: One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Sent 16: Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). Sent 17: With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. Sent 18: After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). Question: What is the current name of the Province that the eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to?. Output:","completion":"Part #1: Identify the key information from the question. Usage: \\"Province that the eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to\\" Explanation: This part is critical because it directly relates to finding our answer in the given paragraph.

Gerald Clamson is a bank examiner who loves fishing on his annual two-week holiday. Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit. Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach. They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden. There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess. While searching for the diamonds, he needs to avoid the hotel staff after inadvertently hurting the manager. Gerald disguises himself as a character noticeably similar to Professor Julius Kelp from The Nutty Professor, while trying to stay one step ahead of the other gangsters who are on his tail, as well as the hotel detectives led by the manager—all the while courting Suzie. As each of the gangsters see Gerald, an identical lookalike to the deceased Syd, they have nervous breakdowns; one imagining himself a dog, one turning into a Larry Fine lookalike, the other (Charlie Callas, in his usual character) becoming a hopeless stutterer. The one man Gerald meets who believes him, and identifies himself as a FBI special agent, turns out to be an escapee from an insane asylum.

A brown dog runs on the sand, holding a stick. Give the answer on a scale from 0 - 5, where 0 is \\"not similar at all\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\".","completion":"On a scale from 0 to 5, I would rate the similarity of these two sentences as a 1. Here is a detailed explanation of the rating: The two sentences describe entirely different subjects: the first one is about a boy skateboarding, while the second one is about a brown dog running. This is the most significant dissimilarity since they involve different beings – humans and animals. Although both sentences describe some action being performed (skateboarding and running), the actions are different and not equivalent. Moreover, the first sentence refers to a specific location – down a metal handrail, which is an urban setting, while the second sentence mentions \\"the sand\\", which implies either a beach or a sandy area. The locations make the actions even more distinct. Also, the time of day mentioned in the first sentence is \\"night\\", whereas the second sentence has no specification of when the event takes place. The time factor sets the sentences apart, as it indicates different contexts. However, what makes these two sentences share a rating of 1 for similarity is that they both convey the idea of a subject performing a physical action. Furthermore, a skateboarding boy and a running dog demonstrate the concept of motion, which can be associated with activities we might witness during recreational time. Considering all the information presented, a rating of 1 feels justifiable, as the sentences have a few similar elements, such as movement and recreational activities, but the differences in subjects, actions, locations, and timing sets them apart significantly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church.

The rebel force being reinforced by a small unit of Spaniards attacked the nearby Ottoman fort of Cerna. The fort was simultaneously attacked from three directions by 1,300 men, of whom only 300 were equipped with arquebuses. Initially a group of 100 Spaniards managed to capture part of the fort raising their flag, killing 80 Ottoman soldiers among whom the commander of the fort. However the Himariotes being confused about this turn of the battle withdrew from the battlefield. This gave the opportunity to the Ottomans to launch a successful counterattack.

Balloting underway in Nevada, South Carolina Candidates in the 2016 White House race face key, early-state voting on Saturday — Democrats in the Nevada caucus and Republicans in the South Carolina primary. The Democratic Caucus between front-runner Hillary Clinton and surging Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders appears too close to call, with the polls having opened at 11 a.m. local time. Clinton has until recent weeks held a double-digit lead in Nevada, after narrowly winning the Iowa Democratic caucus, then losing to Sanders in the party’s New Hampshire primary. The former first lady and secretary of state leads Sanders roughly 49 to 46, according to the latest RealClearPoltics.com poll average. Her campaign had hoped to stop Sanders as the primaries move into the Southern and Western states, in which Clinton has strong support from minority voters and unions. In South Carolina, national front-runner Donald Trump holds onto a double-digit lead with GOP Sens. Ted Cruz, Texas, and Marco Rubio, Florida, deadlocked for second place with roughly 19 percent of the vote, compared to 32 percent for Trump, the billionaire businessman. Still, many voters said before the polls opened that they were still undecided. Former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush is close behind the lead pack. He is hoping to do well in the largely conservative state, whose electorate includes lots of military and ex-military voters. Bush said Saturday that he’s “excited where we stand” and that he going to “work hard for the day” and await results after the polls close at 7 p.m. local time. He also remarked that a lot of people claiming they’re undecided this late is “interesting.” The former Florida governor entered the 2016 presidential race as an early favorite. But Bush may need a third-place finish, if not better, in South Carolina to compete in the GOP primary next week in Nevada, then in the large number of states voting on March 1. A Trump victory could foreshadow strong showings in the Southern states that vote on March 1 — when he could pile up the delegates that determine the nominee.

Consumption of small quantities of alcohol (less than one drink in women and two in men) is associated with a decreased risk of cardiac disease, stroke and diabetes mellitus. The long term health effects of continuous, moderate or heavy alcohol consumption include the risk of developing alcoholism and alcoholic liver disease. A total of 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol. Alcoholism often reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years. Alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States.

Process: - Put water in an ice cube tray - Put the ice cube tray in the freezer - Wait 5 to 6 hours - Take the ice cube tray out of the freezer - Bend the tray slightly to get the ice cubes out and into a drink. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose ice cubes will take longer to form happens, how will it affect LESS ice cubes being made. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned suggests that if ice cubes take longer to form, it would result in fewer ice cubes being made. Here, we can analyze whether the supposed perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process. First, let's clarify the process: 1. Fill an ice cube tray with water. 2. Place the ice cube tray in the freezer. 3. Wait for 5 to 6 hours (depending on your freezer's temperature setting and efficiency) to allow the water to freeze into ice cubes. 4. Remove the ice cube tray from the freezer. 5. Bend the tray slightly to release the ice cubes, so they can be used in a drink or other purpose. Now, let's examine the possible effects of the perturbation hypothesis: 1. Direct effect: The perturbation hypothesis implies that the rate at which water freezes into ice cubes is affected. However, this extended freezing time does not directly impact the number of ice cubes that can be made. The ice cube tray's capacity remains the same, and it can still hold the same quantity of water, eventually forming the same number of ice cubes, albeit at a slower rate. 2. Indirect effect: Considering the extended freezing time, the perturbation's indirect effect could be that fewer ice cubes are produced over a certain timeframe. As the time required to form ice cubes increases, individuals using this process might not be able to replenish their ice cube stock as efficiently as before. This could lead them to prioritize the usage of ice cubes and potentially reduce the overall number of ice cubes made in the long run to avoid constant refilling and waiting for the freezing process to complete. In summary, the perturbation hypothesis affects the process indirectly rather than directly. Although the ice cube tray can still accommodate the same number of ice cubes, the extended freezing time might lead users to produce fewer ice cubes over a given timeframe because of the longer waiting period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which works require three voices including a narrator? ? (English: \\"Armida abandoned\\") After the rejection of Licori, Monteverdi did not immediately turn his attention to Armida. Instead, he went to Parma, having been commissioned to provide musical entertainments for the marriage celebrations of the youthful Duke Odoardo Farnese of Parma and Margherita de' Medici. He spent several weeks in Parma working on these; nevertheless, on 18 December 1627 he was able to tell Striggio that the music for Armida had been completed and was being copied. In the relevant section of Tasso's poem, the enchantress Armida lures the noble Rinaldo to her enchanted island. Two knights arrive to persuade Rinaldo to return to his duty, while Armida pleads with him to stay, or if he must depart, to allow her to be at his side in battle. When he refuses and abandons her, Armida curses him before falling insensible.Carter indicates several structural similarities to Il combattimento; both works require three voices, one of which acts as the narrator. Despite these similarities, Armida abbandonata, unlike the earlier work, is generally considered by scholars of Monteverdi to be an opera, although Denis Stevens, translator of Monteverdi's letters, has termed it a \\"parergon\\" (subsidiary work) to Il Combattimento.Plans for Armida's performance were, however, cancelled when Duke Vincenzo died at the end of December 1627. On 4 February 1628, Striggio was still asking for a copy of Armida, perhaps to use in connection with the next duke's coronation. Monteverdi promised to send him one, but there is no confirmation that he did so. No trace of the music has been found, though Tomlinson has deduced some of its likely characteristics from Monteverdi's correspondence, including extensive use of the stile concitato effect. Although there is no record that Armida was ever performed in Mantua, Stevens has mooted the possibility that it may have been staged in Venice in 1628, since Monteverdi's reply to Striggio's February letter indicates that the work was in the hands of Girolamo Mocenigo, a wealthy... Answer:","completion":"The works that require three voices, including a narrator, are \\"Armida Abbandonata\\" and \\"Il Combattimento,\\" both composed by Monteverdi. These works share structural similarities, particularly their requirement of three voices, with one voice acting as the narrator."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I drove to the shop (which is 30 minutes from where i live), and was promptly greeted by a technician who tested by battery to confirm that it needed replacement. The battery did need replacement, so a sales associate ushered me inside to pay for the new battery. The associate selects the battery, rings up the purchase, and adds a 20 installation fee. Up until this point, my experience had been very pleasant. I told the associate that the price I had been quoted on the phone did not include an installation fee. He said that it was a standard fee, and I again stated that an installation fee had not be quoted to me over the phone. He said that I could take the battery and install it myself, but that I would have to return the old battery to the shop. I told him that while I was happy to install the battery myself, driving 30 minutes back to their shop to return a car battery was not convenient. He ran into the shop, to stop the technician from removing my old battery. I waited... a different associate returned. This new associate was pushy and abrasive. He told me that I had two options: 1) to pay them 20 to install the battery now or 2) to pay full price (120) for a new battery, install it at home, and return the defective battery to their store (requiring an additional hour of driving on my part) to receive the warranty credit. I again told this technician that an installation fee had not been quoted to me over the phone and paying full price for the battery now to get a credit later also had not been quoted to me. He said because I told him driving an extra hour roundtrip to return the battery was inconvenient, he would not give me the warranty credit because I was unlikely to return the defective battery. I told the associate that neither of these choices was the option quoted to me over the phone. He said that he didn't have a technician in the shop that was willing to work for free, so he could not waive the installation fee (although if the battery had been less than 3 yrs old instead of 3.25 yrs old, installation on replacement batteries is free). I have no problem with installation fees as long as they are quoted to customers. This allows the customer to make an informed decision. Because this fee was not included in my quote, I opted to drive to Sears to get a replacement battery. IF YOU DON'T QUOTE AN INSTALLATION FEE, DON'T CHARGE ONE! This is the mistake of the shop, not the customer, so the shop should fix it. The associate made no attempt to correct the mistake. Instead they were pushy and unflexible.

The article is about Billy Tauzin becoming the head of the pharmaceutical industry's top lobbying group. This is related to business because the pharmaceutical industry is a part of the economy, and lobbying is a form of political strategy often used by businesses to impact policy and legislation. As for other topics: -World: Although the political nature of lobbying could fall under world affairs, without an international context or connection to global issues, it's less appropriate than Business. -Sports: This topic is not applicable because the article does not discuss any sporting events, sports figures, or sports industry-related activities. -Science/Tech: While the pharmaceutical industry does involve a lot of science and technology, this article is more about a personnel change and industry politics, which falls under business realm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. A sentimental story with a sentimental sound track. It's about a little girl ( with a voice impediment ) who treasures her green parrot Paulie. The parrot thinks and talks like a human being and gives help and advice to his constant companion. The parrot is definitely the star of the film. At times mischievous and at times in fits of depression the bird captures the mood in a most remarkable and expressive way. The synchronised voice too is very well done and within a minute or two you can actually believe that this intelligent little bird exists. Early in the film her father gives the bird to a pawnbroker and the subsequent scenes tell the story of Paulie's constant struggle over many years to be re-united with his mistress. One of the many memorable scenes is when he falls into bad company and is encouraged to spy on people using the automatic teller machines. Paulie it seems has a phenomenal memory. The ending is predictable, but who would want it otherwise. Children will love this film and anybody who keeps a bird as a pet will delight in Paulie's antics.

Stan reminds his wife that he had to be hard on Billy because he does not want their son to be reading such \\"crap\\". As Billy sits upstairs cursing his father with hopes of him rotting in Hell, he hears a sound at the window, which turns out to be a ghostly apparition in the form of The Creep from the comic book, beckoning him to come closer. Father's Day[edit] (First story, written by King specifically for the film) Nathan Grantham, the miserly old patriarch of a family whose fortune was made through bootlegging, fraud, extortion, and murder-for-hire, is killed on Father's Day by his long-suffering spinster daughter Bedelia. Bedelia was already unstable as the result of a lifetime spent putting up with her father's incessant demands and emotional abuse, which culminated in his orchestrating the murder of her sweetheart, Peter. The sequence begins in 1980, when the remainder of Nathan's descendantsâincluding Nathan's granddaughter Sylvia, his great-grandchildren Richard, Cass, and Cass' husband Hankâget together for their annual dinner on the third Sunday in June. Bedelia, who typically arrives later than the others, stops in the cemetery outside the family house to lay a flower at the grave site and drunkenly reminisce about how she murdered her insufferable, overbearing father. When she accidentally spills her whiskey bottle in front of the headstone, it seems to have a reanimating effect on the mortal remains interred below. Suddenly, Nathan's putrefied, maggot-infested corpse emerges from the burial plot in the form of a revenant who has come back to claim the Father's Day cake he never got.

WASHINGTON — Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton called Republican rival Donald Trump dangerous and unqualified for the presidency in a blistering foreign policy speech Thursday in San Diego, California. \\"He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\\" Clinton said. \\"This is not someone who should ever have the nuclear codes.\\" Trump “doesn’t understand America, or the world,” she said. \\"It’s not hard to imagine Donald Trump leading us into a war just because somebody got under his very thin skin.\\" In anticipation of the address, Trump attacked his Democratic opponent on Twitter. “Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin’ Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions,” he tweeted. Clinton emphasized her own experience as first lady, senator and secretary of state, saying she would provide the steady diplomacy the country needs. “National security is the foundation of how we make sure our interests are pursued in the world,” said Louis Goodman, Emeritus Dean of International Relations at American University in an interview with VOA. With polls show terrorism is a major concern among Americans, Clinton targeted Trump's positions on the issue. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has promised to temporarily block Muslims from crossing U.S. borders. \\"The struggle against radical Islam also takes place in our homeland. There are scores of recent migrants inside our borders charged with terrorism. For every case known to the public, there are dozens more. We must stop importing extremism through senseless immigration policies,\\" Trump said in a foreign policy speech in April. Trump's other anti-terrorism proposals include a pledge to torture and murder the families of suspected terrorists and target Islamic State. \\"I have a simple message for them,\\" Trump said. \\"Their days are numbered.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump seek to pursue the interests of the United States and its citizens in their respective foreign policy positions. However, they have different approaches and perspectives on how to achieve this goal. Clinton emphasizes her experience in diplomacy and stresses the importance of steady diplomacy to ensure national security. On the other hand, Trump focuses on adopting stronger immigration policies and taking a more aggressive stance against terrorism. Clinton implies that her expertise in international relations would enable her to better understand and navigate the complexities of global politics, therefore safeguarding and promoting the interests of the United States and its citizens more effectively. In contrast, Trump believes that his proposed anti-terrorism measures, including temporarily blocking Muslims from entering the U.S. and targeting the Islamic State through undisclosed military tactics, would help in protecting American interests and eliminating the threats of terrorism and extremism. While both candidates aim to serve the interests of the United States and its citizens, their contrasting views on foreign policy result in differing strategies and priorities.

He later stated that he used the album to distance himself from Pink Floyd. Soon afterwards, Waters began touring his first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Wright formed Zee with Dave Harris and recorded Identity, which went almost unnoticed upon its release. Mason released his second solo album, Profiles, in August 1985.Following the release of The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking, Waters publicly insisted that Pink Floyd would not reunite. He contacted O'Rourke to discuss settling future royalty payments. O'Rourke felt obliged to inform Mason and Gilmour, which angered Waters, who wanted to dismiss him as the band's manager. He terminated his management contract with O'Rourke and employed Peter Rudge to manage his affairs. Waters wrote to EMI and Columbia announcing he had left the band, and asked them to release him from his contractual obligations. Gilmour believed that Waters left to hasten the demise of Pink Floyd. Waters later stated that, by not making new albums, Pink Floyd would be in breach of contract—which would suggest that royalty payments would be suspended—and that the other band members had forced him from the group by threatening to sue him. He then went to the High Court in an effort to dissolve the band and prevent the use of the Pink Floyd name, declaring Pink Floyd \\"a spent force creatively.\\" When his lawyers discovered that the partnership had never been formally confirmed, Waters returned to the High Court in an attempt to obtain a veto over further use of the band's name.

Write an article that answers the following question: What did the two tribes disagree on concerning their attack on the German cantonment?","completion":"Title: The Two Tribes and Their Disagreement on Attacking the German Cantonment Once upon a time, in a land far, far away, there were two tribes who were not very good friends. They both wanted to protect their homes and families, but sometimes they disagreed on how to do it. One day, they found out about a group of people called the \\"Germans\\" living in a place called a \\"cantonment.\\" Now, a cantonment is a fancy word for a place where soldiers live and train. The two tribes thought that these German soldiers might be a problem for them. They believed that the soldiers might want to take over their land or even be mean to their families. So, the tribes had to decide how to protect themselves. The chiefs from both tribes had a big meeting to talk about what to do about the German soldiers. The chief of the first tribe said, \\"We should attack the German cantonment when the sun is shining bright and the birds are singing. This way, we can surprise the soldiers and protect our people.\\" But the chief of the second tribe didn't agree. He said, \\"No, we should wait until it's dark and quiet. We can sneak into the cantonment, and the German soldiers won't see or hear us coming. That way, we can protect our families without any fighting.\\" The two chiefs had a long talk and tried to find a way to agree, but it was really hard for them. The first tribe still wanted to attack during the daytime, and the second tribe still wanted to wait until nighttime. The disagreement between the two tribes about the best time to attack the German cantonment meant that they couldn't work together. This was a problem, because when people work together, they can usually achieve more and be better at protecting themselves and their families. However, when they don't listen to each other or can't agree, it can sometimes lead to not getting anything done. In the end, the two tribes continued to disagree on the best way to deal with the German cantonment. They couldn't find a way to work together, which teaches us that it's important to listen to others and try to find a solution that everyone agrees with. Communication and understanding are key when trying to solve problems together, whether it's in a world of tribes and cantonments or in our everyday lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Jr., a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-Woo what is perceived (at first) to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip to shadow his young mistress, Heesoo (Shin Min-a), for fear that she may be cheating on him with another, much younger man, with the mandate that he must kill them both if he discovers their affair. As he performs his duty following Heesoo, and escorting her to a music recital one day he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence, as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent.When he does come to discover Heesoo's secret lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him, but seeing the girl's traumatized state causes him to take pause, pulled by his attraction to her. He thus spares the two on the condition that they no longer see each other again, causing her to harbour enmity towards him, despite the fact he had saved their lives at his own expense.Meanwhile, Sun-woo continues to be embroiled in personal business with Baek Jr., over having beaten up several of his henchmen earlier for overstaying their welcome at the hotel.

As he relaxes in his apartment later one night, he is suddenly kidnapped by Baek's men to be tortured, but before they can do so, they receive new orders via phone call, and he is abruptly carried off to Kang, who has returned from overseas and has found out about his attempted cover-up of Heesoo's affair.

The French forward, who has been instrumental for the Reds since joining the club, suffered a severe knee injury during a recent match. Although initially, it was believed that his recovery would only require a few weeks, further scans have revealed the extent of the damage to be much more severe than first thought, putting an abrupt end to Sinama-Pongolle's season. The start to Florent Sinama-Pongolle's career in the Premier League proved to be promising. His combination of speed and technical ability made him a perfect fit for Liverpool's attacking lineup. Fans of the team quickly grew to admire and appreciate his tireless efforts on the pitch. Despite his relatively young age, Sinama-Pongolle has proven to be a mature and confident player, consistently delivering crucial goals and assists for the team throughout the season. However, Sinama-Pongolle's untimely injury presents a considerable challenge for Liverpool's coaching staff as they now have to rethink their attacking strategy for the rest of the season. The French forward's unique ability to unlock defences and create goal-scoring opportunities has played a significant role in securing victories for the club. His absence on the pitch will undoubtedly impact the team's overall performance as they struggle to fill the void left by one of their star players. Furthermore, the loss of Sinama-Pongolle could potentially affect Liverpool's chances of securing a spot in a European competition next season. With a tough remainder of the season ahead, the Merseyside club will be fighting tooth and nail to secure their position in the league table. The absence of their top striker may present a considerable obstacle to their success in the coming weeks. It remains to be seen how Jürgen Klopp will adapt his squad and tactics to cope with the loss of his prized striker. Young talents from the reserves and academy may be given a chance to prove their worth in the first team, while potential January transfer window signings could strengthen the squad and provide much-needed relief upfront. Additionally, existing players will have to step up and take on the goal-scoring responsibility in Sinama-Pongolle's absence. In conclusion, Florent Sinama-Pongolle's injury comes as a crushing blow to Liverpool and their fans. The versatile striker has been an essential cog in the team's attacking setup and will be sorely missed on the pitch. It is now up to Jürgen Klopp and his coaching staff to rally the troops and devise a plan to ensure the team remains competitive in the Premier League without their star forward. Undoubtedly, the coming weeks will be a true test of Liverpool's character and resolve, and fans worldwide will be hoping for a strong finish to their season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Will Smidlein, who lives just outside Cleveland, Ohio, sabotaged the app by rewriting computer code that prevents users from uploading videos more than six seconds long.

The passage mentions that Will Smidlein crashed the Android version of Twitter's video-sharing app Vine. Once his prank was successful, it makes sense that representatives from the impacted company, in this case, Twitter's engineering department, would reach out to him to rectify the situation. Let's look at why the other options are less likely: - 'Android engineering': Android is the operating system on which the Vine app was running. But it's Twitter's Vine app that was tripped up, not the Android system; Android isn't the one with the embarrassing problem, Twitter is. That's why Twitter contacted him. - 'Cleveland engineering', 'Ohio engineering' refers to a geographical region, but there is no evidence of a specific company or corporation named either Cleveland or Ohio engineering. - 'Daniel Miller engineering' and 'Will Smidlein engineering' refer to individuals and it's not likely that individual persons would have their own engineering departments. - 'Prankster engineering' and 'Rickrolling engineering' refer to the act and the specific prank carried out, but they are not organizations that would communicate with the teenager. - 'Rick Astley engineering' Rick Astley is the musician whose video was used in the prank. It's unlikely he would have an engineering department to handle such an issue. - 'Vine engineering' Vine is the app owned by Twitter and while it's plausible that Vine itself has an engineering department, it's more likely that Twitter, as the parent company, would have handled the situation."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

One of India's most successful actresses, Kajol is the recipient of numerous accolades, including six Filmfare Awards, and alongside her aunt Nutan, she holds the record for most Best Actress wins at the ceremony, with five. In 2011, the Government of India awarded her with the Padma Shri, the fourth highest civilian honour of the country. Kajol was born in Mumbai to the Mukherjee-Samarth film family of Bengali-Marathi descent. Her mother, Tanuja, is an actress, while her father Shomu Mukherjee was a film director and producer. Shomu died in 2008 after suffering cardiac arrest. Kajol's younger sister, Tanishaa Mukherjee is also an actress.

Context: Have you ever wondered whether it’s worth your while to encourage an older person to start exercising? In 2014, the top-notch journal JAMA published the results of a fantastic research project: a study in which 1635 sedentary older adults (aged 70-89) were assigned to get either a structured exercise program, or a program of “successful aging” health education. The researchers called it the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study. (You can read the full study here.) During the LIFE study, the two groups were followed for a little over 2.5 years. And by the end of the study, guess which group of volunteers was more likely to still walk a quarter of a mile (without a walker)? That’s right. When it came to avoiding “major mobility disability” — which the researchers defined as becoming unable to walk 400 meters or more — a structured exercise program was better than a program of healthy aging education. Specifically, the researchers found that 30% of the exercisers experienced a period of major disability, compared to 35.5% of the seniors enrolled in the healthy aging education program. This is a very encouraging finding! That said, it’s also a bit sobering to realize that even with exercise, almost 1 in 3 older adults experienced a period of limited mobility, of which half lasted 6 months or more. In this post, I’ll share some more details on this study, because the results provide a wonderful wealth of information that can be helpful to older adults, family caregivers, and even geriatricians such as myself.

No kitten around Video Image Cat worth 140,000 in house sale 0:59 Play video A real-estate sale has included a cat after the buyers agreed to meet the reserve only if the feline was included in the sale. THE Perceval family prize their pet cat, Tiffany. But she’s not priceless. In fact, she’s worth her weight in Tiffany’s jewellery: 140,000, to be exact. No kitten around. Would you sell your pet? Scroll down to vote and have your say It’s cat over cash, say heraldsun.com.au readers Opinion:The very least you owe a pet is loyalty The Percevals auctioned their five-bedroom Glen Iris home of 19 years on Saturday. The property was passed in at 2,060,000. And it was then, as real estate agent Glen Coutinho negotiated to try to close a deal, that a cat clause entered the sales contract. Mr Coutinho, of RT Edgar, said that a child of one of the bidders had fallen in love with Tiffany during the inspections of the home. “Tiffany decided she would sit on the couch,” Fran Perceval told the Herald Sun. “People would come through, and she’d observe them and be patted. “She loved all the attention — she does look a bit ornamental,” she said. Ms Perceval had even jokingly suggested to Mr Coutinho that Tiffany could be included in the sale, because after all “she believes the house is her property”. But then the bidder offered to buy the home for 2.2 million — as long as Tiffany was included in the deal. Ms Perceval said they agreed to terms — but her son, Sam, 19, isn’t too pleased and they’re still negotiating with him. Sam bought Tiffany from a pet shop. “She was at the pet shop, the last of the litter, and he felt sorry for her,” Ms Perceval said. “We’re thinking we’ll put 20,000 in a pile next to the cat and say to Sam: you choose.” She said Sam was planning to travel overseas next year and the extra money from the sale could help pay for his trip. “And he can’t take a cat with him,” Ms Perceval said. Given her 140,000 price tag, the new owners better hope Tiffany, 4, has nine lives. Ms Perceval said that the family — who also have two dogs, two rabbits and fish — would be sad to say goodbye to Tiffany. “We’re an animal-friendly family ... She’s a bit of a princess. She’s beautiful to look at,” Ms Perceval said. “OK, she’s an expensive cat — but she’s our cat. “It is quite difficult to part with her.” The Percevals are considering adopting a cat from the RSPCA when they move to their new home.

The bizarre property 'claws' came after a potential buyer saw the house and said they would buy it as long as the cat, named Tiffany, was included in the sale. The cat's owners, the Perceval family, didn't pussyfoot around, agreeing to let the buyers take their home in a leafy Melbourne suburb along with its feline resident. The house is in the leafy Melbourne suburb of Glen Iris Fran Perceval told reporters that when the five-bedroom house in Glen Iris was being viewed Tiffany got numerous admirers. \\"We jokingly said all the people coming through are loving her,\\" she said. \\"We said to the agent, 'She goes with the house, hahaha' not expecting at all to actually have a clause written into the contract saying it includes the cat.\\" The house was auctioned at the weekend and bidding reached just over AU2.06m (£1.125m). Tiffany was included in the price But at the last minute a bidder got the house by a whisker. He upped the stakes, offering 2.2m (£1.2m) if the cat was included. The agent, Glen Coutinho, told Channel Nine: \\"I've had plenty of people say they'll throw in their partners but not pets. It's a first.\\" One person who might not be so happy with the deal is Michael and Fran Perceval's 19-year-old son, Sam.

His parents have told him they may well soon be making a trip to the local animal shelter. ||||| Summary:","completion":"An Australian family has sold their pet cat, Tiffany, for an additional 140,000 AUD (£75,000) as part of their home sale.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"the changes in species that have been seen over time required\\" is \\"exercise\\", given that mutations are required for species to change over time? A:","completion":"No, I don't think the right answer to the question \\"the changes in species that have been seen over time required\\" is \\"exercise.\\" It is essential to comprehend the broader context within which species change over time and the concept of mutations, natural selection, and evolution. First, let's address the mutating process for species change over time. Genetic mutations are the primary driver of species change. In the DNA of living organisms, these random errors may result in varied characteristics in their offspring. While some mutations may be harmful, others may drive evolution in a way that enables the species to adapt better to their environment. For mutations to play a vital role in determining the changes in species over time, they often need external factors, like environmental pressures or random genetic events. Considering natural selection, it is essential to note that species change over time as they evolve through adaptation to their surroundings. This mechanism was famously proposed by Charles Darwin. According to the theory, environmental conditions will favor organisms with the most advantageous traits, allowing them to survive and reproduce over others with less beneficial characteristics. As generations pass, the favorable traits will become more prevalent within the species, causing the species to evolve. Now let's discuss the concept of exercise. Although exercise is vital for maintaining the overall health and well-being of individuals within a species, it doesn't directly cause the changes in species observed over time. Exercise may only have indirect effects on the evolution of a species, as the organisms that were better equipped or adapted to exercise may have had a higher chance of survival and reproduction. Thus, their favorable traits would have been passed down to the next generation. Nonetheless, exercise itself is an insufficient answer to address the root cause of species change over time. In conclusion, although exercise may contribute indirectly to the evolution of a species, the right answer to the question \\"the changes in species that have been seen over time required\\" is not \\"exercise.\\" The role of exercise in species change is comparatively minor when compared to the broader concepts of genetic mutations and natural selection driving evolution. Therefore, a more appropriate response would be that species change over time through genetic mutations, natural selection, and adaptation to the ever-changing environmental conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Town A disposed of the biomedical waste from their hospital conventionally in a regular dump site for 10 years because it was more convenient, while town B took them to an ecological site where they wouldn't affect ground water and spread disease. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town is experiencing less bad odor?","completion":"Based on the information provided, Town B is likely to be experiencing less bad odor due to its responsible handling of biomedical waste. Biomedical waste contains a range of hazardous materials, such as infectious agents, chemicals, and radioactive materials, that can negatively impact human health and the environment. The proper handling and disposal of this waste are crucial to reduce its potential harmful effects and prevent the contamination of groundwater and the spread of disease. In Town A, the biomedical waste has been disposed of in a regular dumpsite. The presence of organic materials in the waste promotes microbial decomposition, which in turn leads to the formation of noxious smells. Since a conventional landfill is not designed to handle biomedical waste, the containment measures in place are likely inadequate, leading to the emission of foul odors from the decomposition of hazardous waste. On the other hand, Town B has chosen to dispose of its biomedical waste in an ecological site specifically designed to handle such waste. Specialized waste management methods are employed in these ecological sites, typically including sterilization, incineration, chemical neutralization, and secure containment. These procedures not only prevent the spread of disease and contamination of groundwater but also help to minimize the emission of harmful substances and odors. Due to the strategic and environmentally-conscious handling of biomedical waste in Town B, the likelihood of bad odor emission is significantly lower compared to Town A. Consequently, Town B would be experiencing less bad odor due to its sustainable waste disposal practices and efforts to minimize the environmental and health risks associated with biomedical waste."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sometime after 4 p.m. on December 6, 1989, Marc Lépine arrived at the building housing the École Polytechnique, an engineering school affiliated with the Université de Montréal, armed with a semi-automatic rifle and a hunting knife. Lépine purchased a rifle on November 21, 1989, in a Checkmate Sports store in Montreal. He had told the clerk that he was going to use it to hunt small game. Lépine had been in and around the École Polytechnique building at least seven times in the weeks leading up to December 6. Lépine first sat in the office of the registrar on the second floor for a while. While there, he was seen rummaging through a plastic bag. He did not speak to anyone, even when a staff member asked if she could help him. Lépine left the office and was subsequently seen in other parts of the building before entering a second-floor mechanical engineering class of about sixty students at about 5:10 p.m. After approaching the student giving a presentation, he asked everyone to stop everything and ordered the women and men to opposite sides of the classroom. No one moved at first, believing it to be a joke until he fired a shot into the ceiling.Lépine then separated the nine women from the approximately fifty men and ordered the men to leave. He asked the remaining women whether they knew why they were there, and when one student replied \\"no,\\" he answered: \\"I am fighting feminism.\\" One of the students, Nathalie Provost, said, \\"Look, we are just women studying engineering, not necessarily feminists ready to march on the streets to shout we are against men, just students intent on leading a normal life.\\" Lépine responded, \\"You're women, you're going to be engineers.

The story centers on high school student Kenji Koiso, a wiz in mathematics but ill-adept socially, who spends his time in OZ, a massive computer-simulated virtual reality world, as a part-time low-end moderator. At the beginning of summer vacation, he is asked by Natsuki, one of the most popular girls in his school, to help in celebrating her great-grandmother's 90th birthday. Although Kenji does not know the details of the plan, he agrees and goes with Natsuki to her grandmother's estate in Ueda, Nagano Prefecture. Much to Kenji's surprise, he is introduced at the Shinohara family house as Natsuki's fiancé.As Kenji tries to act the part, meets over a dozen of Natsuki's relatives, and deals with Natsuki's \\"first love\\" crush on her uncle Wabisuke Jinnouchi, he receives a mysterious e-mail with a mathematics code. He cracks the code and returns it to the sender but finds himself at the center of a developing news story the following day. Overnight, OZ has been hacked and he is the prime suspect. Using Kenji's account and avatar, the real \\"hacker\\", which is actually the advanced artificial intelligence system Love Machine, wreaks havoc on the virtual world of Oz which is affecting the real world that is deeply ingrained into Oz' system. With car navigation systems disabled and computer systems malfunctioning, Japan grinds to a halt. With his math skills Kenji is able to crack the passcode and returns control of Oz back to the moderators and Oz' engineers. Meanwhile Natsuki's great-grandmother, Sakae Jinnouchi, uses the level of influence she's created in her 90 years of life and calls various people in important positions in Japan's society and her family who work in various emergency services. She encourages them all to work their hardest, to see through this troubling time of turmoil, reducing the potential chaos and damage that could have occurred. But her actions do not go unnoticed by Love Machine, which leads to an unfortunate tragedy for the Shinohara clan. Although no longer controlling Oz itself, Love Machine continued to steal user accounts, numbering over 10 million at the time, with one being linked to a heart monitoring system for Natsuki's great grandmother. This causes delayed care and ultimately her death when her heart fails her in her sleep. In order to prevent similar incidents and get revenge, Kenji enlists the help of fellow mod and best friend Takashi Sakuma, Natsuki's cousin Kazuma Ikezawa (who is the legendary Oz fighter King Kazma), and the rest of the Shinohara family to defeat Love Machine.After escaping from a trap and winning a combat online, Love Machine takes control of a satellite and sets it on a crash course with a nuclear power plant somewhere on Earth where the fallout could destroy life on the planet. Kazuma tries to fight Love Machine again, now embodied in over 400 million stolen accounts as an almost living botnet, but he is no match and is absorbed by Love Machine. Needing a way to take back the 400 million stolen accounts and find the one linked to the satellite and its GPS, Kenji uses the fact that Love Machine sees everything as a game and has Natsuki's family provoke Love Machine into a game of Koi-Koi in Oz' casino world. There they wager the accounts of the Shinohara family and eventually that of the people throughout the world. Natsuki defeats Love Machine and manages to regain almost all the accounts stolen and in the process stopping the satellite from crashing into the nuclear power plant. However, Love Machine is able to set the satellite navigation and in revenge directs it toward the Shinohara household instead. Using his moderator level of access to Oz and math skills, Kenji manages to hack into the GPS of the satellite and redirects it away from the house, while Love Machine is deleted by the newly rescued King Kazuma. In the aftermath, Natsuki's family celebrate the victory in the memory of their late grandmother. Under the pressure of Natsuki's family, who suggest that the two should marry for real after lying to the family about their engagement, Kenji and Natsuki kiss.

He was spotted by Fred Coe, NBCs manager of program development, who increasingly gave him bigger parts. Steiger considered television to be what repertory theatre had been for an earlier generation, and saw it as a place where he could test his talent with a plethora of different roles. Soon afterward he began receiving positive reviews from critics such as John Crosby (media critic), who noted that Steiger regularly gave \\"effortless persuasive performances\\".

What was the name of the oil tanker wrecked off the Isles of Scilly in 1967?","completion":"The oil tanker that wrecked off the Isles of Scilly in 1967 was named the Torrey Canyon. It was a Liberian-registered supertanker that ran aground in a maritime disaster on March 18, 1967. The Torrey Canyon was one of the first generation of supertankers with a carrying capacity of 120,000 tons of crude oil, and it was en route from Kuwait to Milford Haven in Wales. The disaster occurred when the Torrey Canyon, captained by Pastrengo Rugiati, took a navigational shortcut through the treacherous Seven Stones reef, located between the Cornish mainland and the Scilly Isles. At that time, the ship was equipped with advanced navigation and radar systems. However, due to a navigational error and the prevailing conditions, it struck the Pollard's Rock in the reef. The tanker's hull was breached, and it started leaking crude oil at an alarming rate. The spill resulted in a massive maritime environmental disaster, as it became one of the largest oil spills the world had ever seen, discharging an estimated 25 to 36 million gallons of crude oil into the sea. The oil slick spread across the sea surface, causing severe damage to marine life, birds, and the surrounding coastline. The British and French governments' response to the crisis involved several unsuccessful attempts to refloat the stricken vessel. These efforts resulted in further breakage and cracking in the ship's structure, aggravating the spill. Eventually, they decided to use detergents and chemical dispersants to break up the oil and minimize the environmental impact. In a final attempt to minimize the spread of the oil, the Royal Air Force conducted bombing raids on the wreck, aiming to set it on fire and consume the remaining oil onboard before it could leak any further. The Torrey Canyon disaster taught valuable lessons in marine safety, navigation, and environmental response to oil spills. In the wake of the incident, numerous measures were put in place, including stricter regulations on shipping routes, new legislation concerning the responsibility of vessel owners and insurers, and improved collaboration under international conventions established, particularly the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (CLC) of 1969 and the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution From Ships (MARPOL) of 1973. Ultimately, the wreck of the Torrey Canyon in 1967 served as a significant turning point in the history of maritime transport and environmental awareness, leading to positive changes and paving the way for future responses to similar disasters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). and the situation: The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year. Answer the following question: Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Danube River. Given the information provided, we can infer that the speed of the Danube River decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea, resulting in a larger and faster-growing delta when compared to the Volga River. The size and rate of growth of a river delta are dependent on several factors. These include, but are not limited to, the amount of sediment carried by the river, the speed and gradient of the river as it nears the body of standing water (like a sea or lake), the rate at which the sediment is deposited by the river, and the characteristics of the standing water body into which the river flows. In the case of the Danube and Volga rivers, we are informed that the Danube's delta is larger and growing at a faster rate every year when compared to the delta formed by the Volga. This suggests that the rate at which sediment is being deposited by the Danube is higher than the rate at which sediment is being deposited by the Volga. When a river reaches the sea, its speed decreases rapidly as it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This decrease in speed diminishes the river's ability to transport sediment, causing the sediment to fall out of the flow and deposit, hence forming a delta over time. This is particularly the case when the gradient of the river channel becomes lower. Given that both rivers form large deltas, both rivers' speed would decrease when they reach the sea. However, given that the Danube's delta is larger and grows more quickly, we can infer that its speed must decrease more rapidly. This is because a more rapid decrease in speed would result in a quicker deposition of sediment, leading to a faster-growing and larger delta. In addition, the fact that the Danube's delta is growing more rapidly could also suggest that it carries more sediment than the Volga, further contributing to the faster growth rate and larger size of its delta. However, without specific data on the sediment load of both rivers, this can only be considered as a probable contributing factor, not a definite one."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now, the claim is that this \\"freedom of movement\\" makes it hard to control who comes in and out, like when your friends come to play without permission. Here are some reasons people say this is true: 1. No border checks: Just like there are no doors or walls between your rooms, the Schengen countries don't have people checking passports when you move from one country to another. This makes it hard to count how many people are coming or going. 2. More people can move easily: Because there are no borders, people who want to come to the Schengen area (like your friends who want to play with your toys) can easily move between countries. If each country had its own rules for entering and leaving, it might be harder for people to move around. 3. Harder to track people: If you let your friends come and go anytime they want, it might be hard for you to know exactly who is in your room playing with your toys. Similarly, when people can freely move between countries, it's difficult to keep track of who is where. These are some of the reasons why people think the freedom of movement in the Schengen area can make it hard to control immigration. They say that without borders, it's like having a big playroom where everybody can come and go as they please, making it harder to know who's coming in and who's going out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: When I ordered this from Blockbuster's website I had no idea that it would be as terrible as it was. Who knows? Maybe I'd forgotten to take my ADD meds that day. I do know that from the moment the cast drove up in their station wagon, donned in their late 70's-style wide collars, bell-bottoms and feathered hair, I knew that this misplaced gem of the disco era was glory bound for the dumpster. The first foretelling of just how bad things were to be was the narration at the beginning, trying to explain what cosmic forces were at play to wreak havoc upon the universe, forcing polyester and porno-quality music on the would-be viewer. From the opening scene with the poorly-done effects to the \\"monsters\\" from another world and then the house which jumps from universe to universe was as achingly painful as watching an elementary school production of 'The Vagina Monologues'. Throughout the film, the sure sign something was about to happen was when a small ship would appear. The \\"ship\\" was comprised suspiciously of what looked like old VCR and camcorder parts and would attack anyone in its path. Of course if moved slower than Bob Barker's impacted bowels, but it had menacing pencil-thin armatures and the ability to cast a ominous green glow that could stop bullets and equipped with a laser capable of cutting through mere balsa wood in an hour or two (with some assistance). Moving on... As the weirdness and bell bottoms continue... We found out that they're caught in a \\"Space Time Warp\\". How do we garner this little nugget of scientific information? Because the oldest male lead tells his son that, in a more or less off-the-cuff fashion, like reminiscing about 'how you won the big game' over a cup of joe or an ice-cold bottle of refreshing Coca-Cola. Was pops a scientist? Nope, but he knew about horses and has apparently meddled as an amateur in string theory and Einstein's theories. The recording I watched on DVD was almost bootleg quality. The sound was muddy and the transfer looked like it had been shot off a theater screen with the video recorder on a cell phone, other than that, it was really, really, really bad. (There's not enough 'really's' to describe it, really). I know some out there love this movie and compare it to other cult classics. I never saw this film on its original release, but even back then I think I would've come to the same conclusion: bury this one quick.","completion":"This review is very negative.

Is \\"The customer was immediately taken to the police station.\\" true if \\"The customer walked into the bank and stabbed one of the tellers. He was immediately taken to the police station.\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"The customer was immediately taken to the police station\\" is true based on the sentence \\"The customer walked into the bank and stabbed one of the tellers. He was immediately taken to the police station.\\" The reason for this is because they both refer to the same sequence of events. According to the scenario presented, the customer, who is the subject of both statements, committed a violent act by stabbing one of the tellers after entering the bank. Immediately after the incident, he was apprehended and taken to the police station. This sequence validates the essential part of the first statement which is concerning the customer being taken to the police station. Therefore, the first statement can be seen as a shorter summary or a highlight of the longer narrative. It provides key information about an essential event, omitting the details about the customer's violent act and the victim, focusing directly on the aftermath, which is the immediate transportation of the customer to the police station. The immediate implication of the phrase \\"immediately taken to the police station\\" means that the customer was instantly or without delay apprehended and transported to law enforcement custody, likely by the police. This phrase doesn't necessarily mean that the customer was officially arrested or charged yet. However, it does imply that the customer is being held in a law enforcement capacity at the police station for his egregious act of violence, pending further legal actions. In conclusion, the statement \\"The customer was immediately taken to the police station\\" is indeed true if given the longer context \\"The customer walked into the bank and stabbed one of the tellers. He was immediately taken to the police station.\\" given that both pertain to the same person (the customer) and describe the same sequence of actions, specifically, his transportation to the police station immediately after the incident."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a question about the following movie plot: Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt has ordered the death of all the firstborn Hebrew male infants after hearing the prophecy of the Deliverer, but a Hebrew mother named Yoshebel saves her own infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses. Many years later, Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and then entering Egypt into an alliance with them. Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. An incident occurs when an elderly woman is almost crushed to death when her sash gets caught under the slab of stone, prompting Moses to scold overseer Baka. Moses frees the elderly woman, not realizing that she is his natural mother, Yoshebel. Moses institutes numerous reforms concerning the treatment of the slaves on the project, and eventually Prince Rameses, Moses's \\"brother\\", charges him with planning an insurrection, pointing out that the slaves are calling him the \\"Deliverer\\".

In 1816, François Magendie discovered that dogs fed only carbohydrates (sugar), fat (olive oil), and water died evidently of starvation, but dogs also fed protein survived, identifying protein as an essential dietary component.

With a reputation as the leading organic chemist of his day but with no credentials in animal physiology, Liebig grew rich making food extracts like beef bouillon and infant formula that were later found to be of questionable nutritious value.

C) In the future , there will be enough jobs for everybody D) Machines will do the work instead of people A:","completion":"From the passage, we know that A) it's not possible for everybody to find work and D) Machines will do the work instead of people. The passage describes the difficulty faced by people in finding jobs. The world economy needs a growth of 4% each year just to maintain the existing number of jobs, which is often not achievable. This results in an increase in unemployment. The rising use of machines across various sectors, including factories and farms, further contributes to the job crisis. Machines have the advantage of performing tasks quickly, and they do not demand additional financial benefits such as higher wages or longer holidays. The automation and mechanization of jobs have led to a reduction in job opportunities for people. The passage also highlights that every day, about 75,000 people move to cities in search of work, but only around 70% of them can successfully find jobs. This information emphasizes that finding work has become even harder in today's scenario. In conclusion, the passage suggests that due to the increasing dependence on machines and the demands of the global economy, it is becoming challenging for everyone to find work. Machines are taking over a plethora of roles traditionally occupied by people, not just in factories but across various sectors.

Explanation: Sentence 1, \\"Good economic news, as the man once said, always comes bundled with bad,\\" implies that whenever there is positive news in economics, it is accompanied by some negative aspects or consequences. This sentence suggests a sense of caution when interpreting good economic news, as there may be undesirable factors accompanying such news. On the other hand, Sentence 2, \\"Good news always comes with better news,\\" conveys an entirely different meaning. This statement implies that whenever there is good news, it is always followed or accompanied by even better news. It communicates optimism and a positive outlook, where good news is expected to lead to even more favorable outcomes. Based on these interpretations, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence because the two sentences convey different, and even opposing, messages. While the first sentence does acknowledge the presence of good news, it emphasizes the negative aspects that come with it. The second sentence, in contrast, focuses on an optimistic view that good news will lead to even better news. Therefore, the correct answer is (III) no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: \\"The Masterstroke of Artistic Brilliance: A Review of Inception\\" When we talk about films that have revolutionized the modern cinema experience, Christopher Nolan's contemporary science fiction thriller, \\"Inception\\", certainly earns its place at the top. From its intriguing storyline to its amazing visuals, it is an unconventional masterpiece that demands more than just one viewing. \\"Inception\\" is an intricate labyrinth set in the mind-bending concept of dreams within dreams. The movie centers around a group of experts led by Leonard DiCaprio (Cobb), skilled in navigating through the subconscious to extract and implant ideas. It's a complex yet engaging story that requires the viewer's undivided attention, rewarding them with a provocative narrative unlike any other. The brain behind this masterpiece, Christopher Nolan, is applauded for not just weaving a grandeur sci-fi drama, but also for creating a perspective bending reality that strikes a conversation about the power and influence of the unconscious mind. Nolan’s audacious screenplay isn’t confined to typical cinematic norms. Instead, he allows the audience to question and explore, making the film a unique conversation starter. The superb ensemble cast, led by Leonardo DiCaprio, thrusts the story forward with exceptional performances. DiCaprio brings rawness and vulnerability to the nuanced character of Cobb, a man battling with his inner demons while navigating through the layered world of dreams. The supporting cast, too, brings substantial depth to the film. Marion Cotillard as Mal gives an eerily captivating performance, while Ellen Page, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and Tom Hardy each play their roles brilliantly, resonating solidity and gravity to the film's multifaceted narrative. The technical aspects of the film are equally riveting. The cinematography opens up visual spectacles that are ethereal, leaving the audience marveling at the seemingly limitless boundaries of dreamscapes. Exceptional editing helps maintain the rhythm of the film across multiple narrative layers, while Hans Zimmer's throbbing score adds an extra layer of tension, making the film an immersive experience. Attractions like the iconic \\"rotating hallway\\" scene or the \\"city folding upon itself\\" scene are striking examples of the visual spectacle Nolan has created. Mind-bending and audacious, these scenes stay with the audience long after the movie has ended. \\"Inception\\" is not just a film; it is an intellectual journey that plunges viewers into a world that surpasses the mundane. It redefines the boundaries of cinematic storytelling by questioning reality and manipulating scenery in the realm of dreams. It encapsulates audiences with its real-world physics-defying dreamscapes and its exploration of our subconscious. Packed with a thought-provoking plot, compelling performances, mesmerizing visuals, and an atmospheric score, \\"Inception\\" lays out a cinematic experience that is as dreamlike as the subject it portrays. To sum up, \\"Inception\\" is a brilliant blend of science fiction, heist thriller, and a psychological study that will leave viewers on the edge of their seat even after the movie ends. It is an art without the canvas, a masterpiece that undeniably cements Christopher Nolan's status as a visionary director in the film industry. It's a cinematic exploration that is both spellbinding and compelling, and therefore, a must-watch."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.\\", answer the following question.

The father of George Zimmerman, the man accused of shooting and killing an unarmed black teen, says the teen threatened to kill Zimmerman and then beat him so badly that it forced Zimmerman to shoot him. \\"Trayvon Martin said something to the effect of, 'You're going to die now' or 'You're going to die tonight,' something to that effect,\\" Robert Zimmerman told Orlando TV station WOFL. \\"He continued to beat George. At some point, George pulled his pistol. Did what he did.\\" In the interview Robert Zimmerman, his face obscured because he says he fears for his safety, vehemently defended the shooting, which has caused outrage throughout the nation, moved President Barack Obama to call it a tragedy, and prompted a federal investigation. Robert Zimmerman told the news station that Martin confronted his son first and pummeled his son continually. \\"He was punched in the nose. His nose was broken,\\" Robert Zimmerman said. \\"He was knocked to the concrete. Trayvon Martin got on top of him and just started beating him. In the face. In his nose, hitting his head on the concrete.\\" Robert Zimmerman was not there the night of the shooting and did not say during the interview how he knew the details of the altercation. The elder Zimmerman's account was disputed by Martin's family attorney and several other legal experts. A surveillance video taken the night of the incident at police headquarters shows Zimmerman, his hands cuffed, exiting a patrol car. The video, first broadcast Wednesday by ABCNews.com, shows an officer looking at the back of Zimmerman's head. The video does not provide a close-up of Zimmerman's head, but some say it shows Zimmerman did not have significant injuries to his face. \\"The injuries that made it sound as though he really should have been on a stretcher are not apparent in this tape at all,\\" said Marcia Clark, the former prosecutor in the O.J. Simpson trial. \\"He moves freely. He moves fluidly, not like someone who has just been through a beating in any way, shape or form, someone whose head has been pounded on the pavement as hard as described, someone whose nose was broken and bleeding. That tells you a great deal.\\" Sybrina Fulton, Martin's mother, said the video is another strong piece of evidence proving her son was killed unjustly. \\"I believe that this video is the icing on the cake,\\" she said. \\"This is not the first part of the evidence that they have had. They have had the 911 tapes and they have also have witnesses. This is in addition to what the Sanford Police Department has always had. There is no problem with this case and he needs to be arrested.\\" The 17-year-old was shot to death February 26 by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, as Martin was walking back to his father's fiancee's house in Sanford, Florida. He was wearing a hoodie and carrying Skittles candy and a can of iced tea he had purchased from a nearby convenience store. Evolution of the hoodie. Zimmerman says he killed Martin in self defense after the teen attacked him in the gated community. Zimmerman has not been arrested, and authorities have said he has not been charged because there are no grounds to disprove his account of what happened. The shooting has hit a nerve in the nation, sparked a debate about racial profiling, and ignited protests and calls for Zimmerman's arrest. Spike Lee apologizes for retweet error. Robert Zimmerman said his son is having a hard time dealing with the criticism. \\"I never foresaw so much hate coming from the president, the Congressional Black Caucus, the NAACP. Every organization imaginable is trying to get notoriety or profit from this in some way,\\" Robert Zimmerman told WOFL. \\"But there's so much hate that I have never been involved in hate and George hasn't. It's really unbelievable.\\" Robert Zimmerman said his son is not racist and race had nothing to do with the incident. \\"He would do anything to help anybody at any time. He's colorblind when it comes to any race,\\" Robert Zimmerman said. Tracy Martin, Trayvon Martin's father, said Wednesday that the 911 tape shows Zimmerman was profiling his son. In a recording of Zimmerman's call to police, some people have said they hear what sounds like a possible racial slur. CNN enhanced the sound of the 911 call, and several members of CNN's editorial staff repeatedly reviewed the tape but could reach no consensus on whether Zimmerman used a slur. Angela Corey, the special prosecutor assigned to investigate the case, said Tuesday that investigators would look into the allegations that Zimmerman used a racial slur. Martin, who lived in Miami, was visiting Sanford after receiving a 10-day suspension from school, a family spokesman has said. An empty plastic bag found in his book bag had been determined to contain marijuana residue. Benjamin Crump, Martin's parents' attorney, said information regarding the suspension was irrelevant and amounts to a smear campaign against the youth. Florida law allows the use of deadly force anywhere a person feels a reasonable fear of death or serious injury. It has been cited in a number of justifiable homicide cases in Florida. But as more and more information surfaces, the picture of what happened becomes more complicated. What the witnesses are saying. Despite the twists and turns in the case, Fulton, Martin's mother, says she still has faith in authorities investigating her son's case. \\"I feel confident that they're going to do a thorough investigation,\\" Fulton said. \\"We're trying to be patient, even though it's been over a month. We're trying to be patient, and we're trying to press on for justice.\\" CNN's Umaro Djau, Deirdre Walsh, Ed Payne and Tracy Sabo contributed to this report.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: Which chemical element has the symbol Cn?","completion":"The chemical element with the symbol Cn is Copernicium. Copernicium is a synthetic element, which means that it does not occur naturally and can only be produced artificially, typically through nuclear reactions. It was first synthesized and identified in 1996 by a team of scientists at the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (GSI) in Darmstadt, Germany, led by Peter Armbruster and Gottfried Münzenberg. The element is named after the renowned astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus in recognition of his pioneering contributions to science and our understanding of the universe. Copernicium is a member of Group 12 in the periodic table, which also includes elements such as zinc (Zn), cadmium (Cd), and mercury (Hg). With an atomic number of 112, Copernicium is a heavy and highly unstable element. The element's isotopes exhibit extremely short half-lives, ranging from milliseconds to mere seconds, due to their rapid radioactive decay into lighter elements via alpha decay, spontaneous fission, or electron capture. As a result of its instability and fleeting existence, Copernicium has no practical applications and is primarily of interest to researchers in the fields of chemistry and nuclear physics. Its chemical properties are not well understood due to the challenges associated with studying such short-lived isotopes. However, predictions based on its position in the periodic table and relativistic calculations suggest that Copernicium might exhibit properties similar to those of its homologs in Group 12 and could be a volatile metal. In summary, the chemical element with the symbol Cn is Copernicium, a synthetic and highly unstable element first synthesized in 1996. It belongs to Group 12 of the periodic table and is named in honor of astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. Although Copernicium has no practical applications due to its short half-lives and instability, it remains an intriguing subject of study for scientists in chemistry and nuclear physics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Solids that change to gases generally first pass through the liquid state. However, sometimes solids change directly to gases and skip the liquid state. The reverse can also occur. Sometimes gases change directly to solids. Q: When solids change to gasses, they generally pass through what other state? A: A:","completion":"When solids change to gasses, they generally pass through the liquid state as an intermediate phase. This process typically occurs in two stages - first, the solid melts into a liquid through a process known as melting or fusion, which happens when the solid reaches its melting point. At this temperature, the particles within the solid gain enough kinetic energy to break free from the lattice structure they were previously locked in, allowing the material to flow and take on the characteristics of a liquid. Once the solid has transitioned fully into a liquid, it will then undergo another transition into a gas through a process called vaporization or evaporation. During this stage, the liquid particles experience a further increase in kinetic energy as the temperature rises, causing them to overcome the intermolecular forces that held them together as a liquid. This results in the particles breaking away and forming a gaseous phase, with the material now exhibiting the properties of a gas – free-flowing particles that can expand and contract to fill any container they occupy. Although most substances pass through the liquid state when transitioning from a solid to a gas, some materials are capable of undergoing sublimation, a process in which solids transition directly into gasses without first becoming a liquid. In this case, the kinetic energy of the particles within the solid is sufficient to overcome both the lattice structure of the solid and the intermolecular forces of the liquid state, allowing for an immediate change to the gaseous phase. The reverse process, in which gases transition directly into solids, is called deposition. In conclusion, when solids change to gasses, they generally pass through the liquid state as an intermediate step. This transformation process involves the solid first melting into a liquid and then vaporizing into a gas. However, some substances can undergo sublimation or deposition, skipping the liquid phase altogether and transitioning directly between solid and gaseous states."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One in every five young people has a sleep problem, so you're not alone; Getting enough sleep has become as important as eating vegetables and exercising regularly. It's very important for your body. Most young people only get seven hours of sleep each night, when they actually need nine hours. And making up for lost sleep during the week by sleeping in on weekends doesn't really work. In fact, sleeping late on weekends may actually do you more harm than good, if you have sleep problems. What happens if you don't get enough sleep? If your sleep problem continues for a few nights, you could suffer serious problems. Lack of sleep can affect learning and memory. Worse , if your sleep difficulties last a long time , that could lead to anxiety or depression . Therefore, you've got to have some healthy sleep habits. Below are some suggestions: * GO TO BED AT THE SAME TIME--including weekends , if possible . * WAKE UP AROUND THE SAME TIME EVERY MORNING . When you sleep late just one morning during the week, it may disturb your body clock. This will make it hard for you to sleep that night. * DO SMOETHING REALXING before going to bed . * EXERCISE DURING THE DAY . Don't exercise right before going to bed. * AVOID DRINKING ALCOHOL. Alcohol makes you excited. This prevents you from falling asleep or wakes you up during the night. * DON'T SMOKE . Smoking is always bad for the body. Smoking before bedtime keeps you awake.

Would \\"Congress has a total of 535 voting members: 435 members in the House of Representatives and 100 members in the Senate.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, stating the number of voting members in the House of Representatives and the Senate does not address the question about the specific powers each house of Congress holds. Instead, the response should focus on explaining those specific powers unique to each house. Here is a possible answer: \\"The United States Congress consists of two houses: the House of Representatives and the Senate. Both are granted unique powers by the Constitution. The House of Representatives specifically maintains the power to initiate revenue bills. This means that any bill regarding taxation or spending must originate in the House. The reasoning behind this provision arises from the belief that representatives, being more directly and frequently accountable to voters due to their two-year term, should be given the primary responsibility of determining revenue generation. The House also has the exclusive power to initiate impeachment proceedings. This authority gives the House the ability to issue charges against the President, Vice President, or other federal officials for malfeasance in office. On the other hand, the Senate also has particular powers of its own. Primarily, it confirms or denies nominations for positions like Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, and ambassadors. This is frequently referred to as the Senate's 'advice and consent' role. The Senate also holds the power to conduct impeachment trials. While the House can impeach an official, it is the Senate that reviews the evidence, hears the arguments, and ultimately votes on whether or not to convict and remove the official from office. Finally, the Senate has distinct power relating to foreign policy - all treaties with foreign nations must be ratified by a two-thirds vote in the Senate. While both the House and Senate share many powers, such as declaring war, raising an army, regulating commerce, and making all laws necessary and proper for the functioning of the government, these are some of the specific powers that are unique to each house of Congress.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Knowing that \\"preferences are generally learned characteristics\\", how would one answer \\"Which would be a learned trait?\\"","completion":"When addressing the question \\"Which would be a learned trait?\\", it is essential to understand the key components surrounding the concepts of preferences and learned characteristics. Let's begin by examining the components individually and then identifying examples of learned traits. Preferences refer to an individual's predisposition or inclination towards a specific choice or liking for something. These choices can encompass various aspects of life, including food, hobbies, communication styles, and social interactions, to name a few. Preferences are not innate or hardcoded in our genes; instead, they are developed as we grow and interact with our environment. Learned characteristics, on the other hand, are those attributes or behaviors that individuals acquire through their experiences and exposure to different circumstances in their lives. Essentially, these characteristics are not inherited biologically but are developed and nurtured through external influences. Now that we've established the relationship between preferences and learned characteristics let's look at a few examples of learned traits: 1. Language: The ability to speak and understand a language is a learned characteristic. From early childhood, individuals learn their native language through exposure to their families and social environments. This learning further expands as one gets exposed to other languages in their community, school, or travels. 2. Cultural norms: Adherence to particular traditions, rituals, and practices of a culture is a result of learning from one's family and community. As an individual grows up in a specific cultural setting, they assimilate the values, customs, and beliefs that govern their society. 3. Taste in music, art, and other cultural products: Preferences on music, art, and other cultural media often develop through exposure and experience. As individuals encounter various forms of music, art, and media, they start determining the types of art that resonate with their personality and emotions. 4. Work ethic: The development of a strong work ethic can be considered a learned characteristic. This trait may be acquired through observing parents or role models who emphasize the importance of hard work and discipline. Educational institutions, workplaces, and cultural norms can also nurture this trait. 5. Social and communication skills: Interpersonal skills like active listening, empathy, and maintaining a healthy conversation are learned traits. These skills are acquired over time through various interactions in various environments, such as family, friend circles, schools, and workplaces. 6. Food preferences: People develop particular preferences for the food they have been exposed to throughout their upbringing, based on factors like taste, cultural significance, and availability.

The owners of a 4million Cincinnati mansion that was destroyed in a massive fire a year ago are suing their insurance company for 60million for allegedly refusing to cover the blaze. Jeffrey Decker, who owns an Ohio home building company, and wife Maria claim that they still haven't been paid by Chubb National Insurance Co. for the January 8, 2014 fire that destroyed their home in Indian Hill, Ohio. Despite the family paying nearly 20,000 a year in premiums, the Deckers say that their insurance company breached their contract for coverage 'without reasonable justification,' WLWT reports. Even though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and a slew of local agencies have investigated the blaze, the cause still has not been determined more than a year later. This 4million, 22-room mansion outside Cincinnati, Ohio, burned to the ground in January 2014. The cause of the blaze has still not been determined, despite the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives investigating - along with state and local authorities. Jeffery and Maria Decker are suing their homeowner's insurance company for 60million because the company has allegedly refused to pay their claim. The 10,000-square-foot, 22-room mansion was 90percent destroyed in the fire, which took crews more than seven hours to bring under control. No one was home at the time and there were no injuries. The Deckers are suing for 15million in damages for alleged breach of contract and asking for nearly 45million more in punitive damages. Chubb National has declined to comment on the lawsuit. The family estimated damages from the fire totaled about 5million - including the contents of the home. The Deckers carried a policy of about 8.8million on the home and 4.4million on the property inside. There were also riders for 208,400 in jewelry, 18,687 in furs and 5,705 in art. Four cars carried an insurance of value of 83,000. No one was home when the mansion caught fire. It took crews seven hours to extinguish the blaze, which caused an estimated 5million in damage.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Chicago shooting: 13 wounded in late-night attack Chicago detectives at the scene where 12 people, including a three-year-old, were reportedly shot in a city park on the South Side. Photograph: Paul Beaty/AP A three-year-old boy who was among 13 people wounded in a late-night attack on a southwest Chicago park was alert when he arrived at the hospital and was apparently doing well, his family and friends said early Friday. The attack late Thursday in the city's Back of the Yards neighbourhood left three victims, including the boy, in critical condition. The others were reportedly in serious or fair condition. The child's uncle, Julian Harris, told the Chicago Sun-Times that dreadlocked men in a gray sedan shot at him Thursday night before turning toward nearby Cornell Square Park and opening fire. He said his nephew was shot in the cheek. \\"They hit the light pole next to me, but I ducked down and ran into the house,\\" Harris said. \\"They've been coming round here looking for people to shoot every night, just gang-banging stuff. It's what they do.\\" Police officials declined to discuss details of the investigation. Ron Gaines, a department spokesman, said no arrests had been made and that victims were being interviewed to try to determine the circumstances surrounding the attack, which happened shortly after 10 pm. Officer Amina Greer said at least 10 ambulances responded to the scene and took victims to several area hospitals. One victim transported himself to a hospital, police said. Among the 13 victims were at least two other minors, ages 15 and 17. The 3-year-old boy was taken to Mount Sinai Hospital. Hospital officials declined to disclose his condition, but fire officials said the boy's condition was critical. The Rev Corey Brooks, a pastor at New Beginnings Church, spoke with family members outside the hospital and said the boy was resting with his mother. \\"He was talking when they first brought him in, but he's heavily sedated now,\\" he said. \\"They say he's good,\\" said Semecha Nunn, the boy's grandmother. \\"They're going to have to do a little plastic surgery on him, but he's OK.\\" Francis John, 70, said she was in her apartment when the shooting occurred. She said she went down to see what was going on and \\"a lot of youngsters were running scared.\\" A 30-year resident, she said she was surprised by what had happened. She told the Sun-Times there hasn't been much gun violence in the neighborhood in recent years, adding the neighborhood went from good to bad 10 years ago, to better recently. The shooting comes nearly three weeks after Chicago saw an outburst of violence over the Labor Day weekend that ended with eight dead and 20 others injured. Following a surge in homicides and shootings last year, the police department stepped up its crime-fighting efforts by, among other things, paying overtime to add patrols to some neighbourhoods, including the Back of the Yards.","completion":"A bad thing happened in a park in Chicago at night where some men in a car shot at people and hurt 13 of them, including a 3-year-old boy.

Right or wrong? You decide. Compared with 50 years ago, when I was just four years old, people now make nearly three times as much money, eat one third more food and expect to live one third longer. In fact, it's hard to find any areas of the world that's worse off now than it was then, even though the world population has more than doubled over that period. One reason we are richer, healthier, taller, cleverer, longer-lived and freer than ever before is that the four most basic human needs--food, clothing, fuel and shelter--have grown much cheaper. Take one example: In 1800, a candle providing one hour's light cost six hours' work. In the 1880s, the same light from a lamp took 15 minutes' work to pay for. In 1950, it was eight seconds. Today, it's half a second. In these terms, we are 43,200 times better off than in1800. In the United States, rivers, lakes, seas and air are getting cleaner all the time. A car today produces less pollution traveling at full speed than a parked car did from leaks in 1970. Although the world population is growing, the rate of increase has been falling for 50 years. Across the world, national birth rates are lower now than in 1960, and in the less developed world, the birth rate has almost halved. According to a research report from the United Nations, population will start falling once it reaches 9.2 billion in 2075. After all, there are already seven billion people on earth, and they are eating better and better. In 1970s, there were 550 billion barrels of oil reserves in the world, and in the 20 years that followed the world used up 600 billion. So by 1990, reserves should have been overused by 50 billion barrels. Instead, it is reported there are 900 billion today. They will last for many years and people will find something in place of oil long before they run out. The more we develop, the more we can... Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements is NOT true according to the article by science writer Matt Ridley? A) People today make nearly three times as much money compared to 50 years ago. B) The four most basic human needs have become more expensive over time.

Options: - homework - smart - study hard - take test - study last minute The answer is \\"study hard\\" because Answer:","completion":"The answer to the given question is \\"study hard\\" because to remain a part of the team, the student had to meet the academic requirements set by the school or institution. In most cases, such requirements are put in place to ensure that student-athletes maintain a balance between their academics and extracurricular activities, emphasizing the importance of education alongside sports. In order to pass the class and meet the academic criteria, the student realized that he needed additional help and sought out the assistance of a tutor. The tutor's primary goal was to aid the student in gaining a better understanding of the class material, reinforcing crucial concepts and academic skills. Thus, the two of them started to study hard in order to achieve this goal. Studying hard means dedicating time, effort, and focus on learning the subject matter and mastering the skills required for a particular class. This involves rigorous and comprehensive study sessions, which usually include reviewing class notes, reading textbooks, discussing important topics, practicing problem-solving techniques, and seeking clarification on any confusing concepts. Working with a tutor is an effective strategy for studying hard, as tutors can provide personalized instruction, address individual learning needs, and offer reinforcement of key ideas. Tutors can also help students develop valuable study habits and techniques that may improve their overall academic performance, not just in that specific class but in future endeavors as well. In this case, the student knew that merely completing homework, seeking to become smarter overnight, taking tests, or cramming last-minute study sessions would not be enough to ensure he could stay on the team. Responsible and sustained hard work in combination with the support from a dedicated tutor were necessary components to achieve his goals. Therefore, the answer is \\"study hard\\" because it best illustrates the student's commitment to improve his academic standing and maintain his position on his team while demonstrating the value of hard work and seeking assistance when needed.

Process: - A machine called a pulverizer grinds the coal into a fine powder - The coal powder mixes with hot air, which helps the coal burn more efficiently, and the mixture moves to the furnace - The burning coal heats water in a boiler, creating steam - Steam released from the boiler powers an engine called a turbine, transforming heat energy from burning coal into mechanical energy that spins the turbine engine - The spinning turbine is used to power a generator, a machine that turns mechanical energy into electric energy - This happens when magnets inside a copper coil in the generator spin - A condenser cools the steam moving through the turbine - As the steam is condensed, it turns back into water - The water returns to the boiler, and the cycle begins again - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more people are using some solar power happens, how will it affect LESS coal arriving at the power station. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If more people start using solar power, it could potentially lead to less coal being consumed at the power station. This reduced demand for coal has both direct and indirect effects on the coal power generation process. Direct effects: 1. Less coal will be required in the pulverizer, which grinds the coal into a fine powder. This results in reduced wear and tear on the pulverizer and lower operational costs. 2. As less coal and hot air mix is burned in the furnace, the boiler will produce less steam, reducing the load on the turbine and generator. This also leads to less pressure and wear on these components. Indirect effects: 1. With more solar power being used, there will be a reduced dependence on fossil fuels, leading to a decrease in coal demand overall. As a result, power stations may face challenges in terms of keeping their large-scale coal operations profitable or sustaining employment. 2. The reduction in coal demand can also have positive environmental effects; lower coal consumption results in decreased greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution, preserving the environment and public health. 3. As more people adopt solar power and other renewable energy sources, the need for large-scale investments in coal-based power plants and associated infrastructure might also decline. This decrease in investments can accelerate the transition to a more sustainable and diversified energy sector. While these effects might not directly change the underlying process of coal power generation, it is essential to note that a widescale shift towards solar energy and other renewables will have a significant impact on the coal industry and its power plants. Eventually, this change could lead to improvements in energy efficiency, cost savings, and overall long-term sustainability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Marco Antonio Rubio (; born May 28, 1971) is an American politician, attorney, and the junior United States Senator for Florida. A Republican Party member, he was previously Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Rubio is a Cuban American from Miami, with a B.A. from the University of Florida and a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law. In the late 1990s, he was a City Commissioner for West Miami and was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, representing the 111th House district. Later in 2000, the majority leader of the House, Mike Fasano, promoted Rubio to be one of two majority whips. National Journal described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them. Fasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano. Rubio volunteered to work on redistricting, which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders. In December 2002, Rubio was appointed House Majority Leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd. He persuaded Speaker Byrd to restructure the job of Majority Leader, so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whip's office, and Rubio would become the main spokesperson for the House GOP. According to National Journal, during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a centrist \\"who sought out Democrats and groups that don't typically align with the GOP\\". He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students. As a state representative, Rubio requested legislative earmarks (called \\"Community Budget Issue Requests\\" in Florida), totaling about 145 million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter. Additionally, an office in the executive branch compiled a longer list of spending requests by legislators, including Rubio, as did the non-profit group Florida TaxWatch. Many of those listed items were for health and social programs that Rubio has described as \\"the kind of thing that legislators would get attacked on if we didn't fund them.\\" A 2010 report by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald said that some of Rubio's spending requests dovetailed with his personal interests. For example, Rubio requested a 20 million appropriation for Jackson Memorial Hospital to subsidize care for the poor and uninsured, and Rubio later did work for that hospital as a consultant. A spokesman for Rubio has said that the items in question helped the whole county, that Rubio did not lobby to get them approved, that the hospital money was necessary and non-controversial, and that Rubio is \\"a limited-government conservative ... not a no-government conservative\\".

Diplo added, \\"She came through and she wanted to meet me 'cause she'd heard my single and the funk mix from one of her A&Rs and she just thought I was right up her alley.

Context: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things.

I can use this background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Now, I have a new situation: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend. Mary decided to candy the fruit, while Ann decided to eat them fresh, Mary received plums, peaches, apples and oranges. Ann got pears, quince, cherries and blackberries. Answer this question please: Which fruit retained their quality longer peaches or cherries?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, candied fruit can retain its quality for up to a year due to the sugar preservation process. In the given situation, Mary decided to candy the fruit she received, which included peaches, while Ann decided to eat her fruit fresh, which included cherries. Considering that candied fruits have a longer shelf life than fresh fruits, the peaches that Mary candied would retain their quality longer than the fresh cherries Ann received. Fresh cherries would typically last for a few days to a couple of weeks, depending on the storage conditions, which is a shorter time compared to the preserved peaches."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Process: - Dirty dishes are rinsed - Placed into the dishwasher - A detergent is added to the detergent dispenser - The dishwasher is closed - The power is turned on - In about 1.5-2 hours, the dishes are clean - Question: suppose there is less detergent available happens, how will it affect more detergent is needed to clean the dishes. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"The answer is A: more. When there is less detergent available for use in the dishwasher, it can lead to several potential effects on the cleaning process. Detergents are essential in breaking down and removing food particles, grease, and stains on dishes during the washing cycle. Therefore, if insufficient detergent is added, the dishwasher might not be able to perform its cleaning function as effectively as it would with an adequate amount of detergent. Firstly, less detergent would decrease the efficiency of the cleaning process. This is because detergents contain surfactants that help to lower the surface tension of water, allowing it to penetrate into the smallest crevices and spaces of the dishes. It facilitates the even distribution of water and helps to soften the food stains and residues to make them easier to remove. Insufficient detergent would mean lesser surfactants, leading to the water's diminished penetrating ability and consequently, reduced cleaning efficacy. Secondly, less detergent would mean less enzymes and cleaning agents present to break down and remove food stains, proteins, and fats. Dishwasher detergents usually contain enzymes like proteases and amylases, which are effective in breaking down protein and carbohydrate-based stains, respectively. A lower concentration of these enzymes due to the reduced amount of detergent would mean that stubborn stains might not be adequately removed, and the dishes might still appear dirty or greasy after the wash cycle. As a result, you may need to use more detergent than usual in the next wash cycle to clean the dishes effectively. The additional detergent will help to compensate for the lower cleaning power of the previous cycle and assist in breaking down any leftover stains, grease, or residue. Alternatively, you may also need to run the dishwasher for an additional cleaning cycle to ensure the dishes are thoroughly clean. In conclusion, less detergent available for use in the dishwasher can lead to diminished cleaning performance and the need to use more detergent in subsequent cycles to ensure thorough and effective cleaning. It is always recommended to follow the manufacturer's instructions for optimal detergent usage to ensure the best possible results for clean and hygienic dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first sentence says that George Stephanopoulos outlines the keys to an Al Gore presidential victory. This tells us that George thinks there are specific actions or strategies that Al Gore can use to increase his chances of winning. 2. The key to victory mentioned is for Al Gore to express a clear agenda, which implies that George believes if Al Gore follows this advice, his chances of becoming president would likely improve. Now let's look at the second sentence: 1. The second sentence says that George Stephanopoulos believes Al Gore has a chance at becoming president. From the information provided in the first sentence, we can infer that George thinks Al Gore's chance of becoming president could improve if he follows the outlined key.

Conditions vary too widely.But the villages I stayed in had much in common--poverty, dirt, ignorance. Often the villagers themselves were puzzled, suspicious. Why had I come? I had put aside my work as a political journalist because my ideas had changed. I had come to believe that what was happening in the Third World was more important than anything else. But to understand how three quarters of the world's people live, and how their future might affect ours, I felt that I first had to try and share their way of life.In the end I chose a mountain village because it was a little cooler than those in the plains. I took the bus from town along a bumpy road. Then came a rough walk down a steep path to the river. After this I began the climb into the Mils. Whenever I stopped to catch my breath, there was a magnificent view. After several hours' walk the village came into view.

Simon King 2). the boys 3). the Craigs 4). their mother Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Deep in the wilderness of northern Kenya, two boys found a pair of crying cheetah cubs . The cubs' mother had been killed by a lion. The cheetahs were only a few weeks old. In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \\"heroes\\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

Melgares's successor, Governor José Antonio Vizcarra met Navajo leaders at Paguate on 12 February 1823. His terms essentially stated that the Spanish would settle the Navajo in pueblos and energetically convert them to the Catholic religion. The Navajo were not interested in either of these proposals. They rejected the treaty and renewed the fight. Six New Mexicans were killed at Socorro in April and eight more at Sabinal in May. On 18 June 1823, Vizcarra led 1,500 troops in a 74-day expedition against the Navajo of western New Mexico. His route took him through the Chuska Mountains to the Hopi mesas in what is now Arizona, then north towards Utah, reaching Oljeto Creek in what is now San Juan County, Utah. Thirty-three Navajo were killed, of whom eight were women, and about 30 were captured. The expedition reached Canyon de Chelly in what is now eastern Arizona. In retaliation for Vizcarra's expedition, the Navajo raided Socorro again, and attacked Tome, Albuquerque and reached the outskirts of Santa Fe. The 1823 raid marked the start of a long period of raids and counter raids lasting until 1848 as New Mexicans took Navajo captive to work as slaves, and as Navajo raided to recover their people and to obtain livestock. Answer this question: How many Navajo men were killed by Vizcarra?","completion":"To find out how many Navajo men were killed by Vizcarra, let's look at the information provided: \\"Thirty-three Navajo were killed, of whom eight were women, and about 30 were captured.\\" We know that 33 Navajo were killed in total and 8 of them were women. To find the number of men killed, we can subtract the number of women killed from the total number of Navajo killed: 33 (total Navajo killed) - 8 (women) = 25 So, 25 Navajo men were killed by Vizcarra."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Touring internationally in June and July, the Beatles staged 37 shows over 27 days in Denmark, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

They were meeting a friend and hanging out at the bar. There's no indication of whether they enjoyed this experience or not. 2. \\"While the Hooters girls there looked good,\\" This part of the review has a positive sentiment, as the reviewer is complimenting the Hooters girls' appearance. However, this statement might hold lesser weight in the overall sentiment analysis compared to the other criticisms mentioned. 3. \\"the service overall was very slow, and clearly the girls were overwhelmed.\\" This portion of the review is negative, as it criticizes both the speed of service and the staff's ability to manage the workload. It implies that the service at the establishment was unable to meet the customer's expectations. 4. \\"As for the casino itself, it looked very old and 'runned-down.'\\" Again, a negative sentiment arises from this segment, as the reviewer criticizes the physical appearance of the casino, stating that it is old and worn out. This implies dissatisfaction with the establishment's ambiance or upkeep.

Write a title for this article: When local police fail to protect eloping couples from honor killings, “Love Commandos” swoop to protect citizens. According to the group’s founder, Sanjoy Sachdev, nearly 10,000 “love marriage” murders occur each year in India. A poor Muslim woman is being guarded by India’s \\"Love Commandos,\\" a group which protects eloping couples, after relatives murdered her husband. When pregnant Mehwish eloped with her husband Abdul Hakim, a 29-year-old bank clerk from Uttar Pradesh, her parents objected to their relationship because he was from a lower caste. A council of village elders announced a 50,000 Rupee bounty (917) for his murder and 200,000 Rupees (3671) if both Abdul Hakim and Mehwish were killed. His father was allegedly lynched by supporters of Mehwish's family. Last week, Hakim was killed in his village of Bulandshahr after he quietly returned, to care of his ailing, elderly mother. Now Mehwish, 25, is living in fear for her life as well as her two-year-old daughter's, but fortunately they are under the care of India's \\"Love Commandos,\\" who have vowed to do all they can to protect her. The couple called the Delhi-based \\"commandos\\" last year, and was taken to one of its seven safe houses where it protects more than 50 couples facing death threats from their families for rejecting arranged suitors in favor of a \\"love marriage.\\" The group took the couple to India's National Commission for Women in June last year which ordered their local police and government to protect them, but no action was taken against her relatives. Last summer the couple appeared on the popular current affairs series Satyamev Jayate, hosted by Aamir Khan, a Bollywood star known as a campaigner for liberal causes, along with dozens of other eloping couples. Hakim's murder has raised serious questions about the reluctance and failure of police and government to protect those under threat or take action against the perpetrators, he said. \\"The police were trying to find ways to not protect them,\\" said Sanjoy Sachdev, the \\"Love Commandos\\" founder. \\"Officers who failed to prevent after getting information have to be booked for criminal conspiracy. The police are all out to save their own officers. The entire nation is having a hard discussion about this killing.\\" More than 1,000 honor killings are linked to 'love marriages' every year. Sachdev said the true figure is closer to 10,000. Many of the killings are ordered by caste councils who have publicly demanded the right to kill those who marry against local traditions. Sachdev established his group last year to protect eloping couples and challenge religious fundamentalist views on relationships in India after an earlier involvement in a group which defended young couples under attack from Hindu extremists for public displays of affection on St Valentine's Day. At one 'Love Commandos' safe house last week six couples were hiding in two tiny rooftop rooms as they sought court orders to protect them from family threats. Rahul Rastogi, a Hindu, and Noorin Akif, a Muslim, both 27, eloped in September after a secret five-year courtship at a Nokia customer care center in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. They eloped after her parents threatened to kill her and themselves if she did not marry a Muslim of their choice. \\"My family have filed false charges against Rahul for kidnap, forced marriage and rape. Rahul's family are in hiding to save their lives. My brothers have threatened they will take his sister. Even his [older] married sister has been threatened by the police and Muslims. They burned Rahul's house and almost destroyed it,\\" she said. Sachdev said the tradition of arranged marriages was perpetuated by both Hindu and Muslim fundamentalists, but neither religion's scriptures opposed 'love marriages.' He said Hindu Gods Lord Ram and Lord Shiva both married women from their own sub-caste, which caste elders regard as marrying a sibling and deserving of death. Lord Krishna and Radha were unmarried boyfriend and girlfriend, he added. \\"Indian tradition and culture [in fact] supports love marriage. Families have no right to arrange a marriage or feel that the young person is their property. There is no honor in killing or torturing. It is the fundamentalists who create this atmosphere.\\" Title:","completion":"\\"Love Commandos: The Unsung Heroes Defending Love Marriage in the Face of Honor Killings in India\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: BEIJING -- The rescue operations at a coal mine accident have ended with 105 miners dead. The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity. This mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident. How did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month? In response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _ We appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines. But at the same time we have reason to question how governments at various levels supervise these mines. The sad fact that such a mine with serious safety problems could pass three consecutive local government safety inspections in a month is enough to tell us how ineffective the safety inspections were. What if these inspections were just a formality ? What if the inspectors were bribed by the mine owners to turn a blind eye to the safety dangers? We can well imagine what would happen if reports about mine problems were handled by such officials. So a thorough probe must find out who are responsible for the death of so many miners. A real safety inspection and management system must be established to guarantee that safety dangers will be removed. Question: What can we infer from the passage?

Article: Both hard and soft cat carriers will allow you to safely carry your cat to and from the vet. The harder ones are better for vehicle transport. Training your cat to enter the carrier could take a few hours or a few weeks. In order to have sufficient time to test it out before use, try to obtain a carrier 1-4 weeks prior to the appointment. If you already have a carrier, make sure that he can still fit inside of it. If you do not have a carrier, one can be purchased at your local pet store, department store, or online. As an alternative, you could ask to borrow a carrier from a friend or possibly find one at your local thrift store, but be sure to clean and dry it thoroughly before use. A little vinegar added to mild soap and water will help eliminate odors. Carriers should be large enough for your cat to turn all the way around in it. If you choose to purchase a carrier online, do so far in advance of the appointment to ensure that you receive the carrier in time to habituate your cat to it. It is likely that your cat will turn tail when she sees the carrier, so don't pull it out from storage right before leaving for the appointment. This could make her remember the last time you went to the vet, if that experience was traumatizing. Use the carrier at nap and play time. This will help eliminate negative associations your cat might have to the carrier. To get him used to the carrier (again), first line it with shredded newspapers and a couple of small towels or large strips of fabric that contain a scent familiar to your cat. Put cat treats in and around the carrier to lure her inside. It might take some time for your cat to enter the carrier, so add fresh treats when needed. Once she seems comfortable in and around the carrier, you can put her in it. Quietly close the carrier door, and speak soothingly to her. Be gentle when placing your cat in the carrier. If she still refuses, do not force her in. Instead, give her more time to get used to it. \\" Once inside the carrier, taking your cat on short drives through the neighborhood could help ease your cat's anxiety. Gently carry your cat to your vehicle, or to the train, subway, or bus stop. On public transportation, use a large towel to cover the carrier, so that your cat will be less anxious. Place the carrier on a seat. If you are driving, buckle the carrier in for safety. Speak soothingly to your cat, or play soft music during the drive.

This is what I hit myself in the mouth with. The curved end glance off my left front central incisor. It hurt some, my lips were lacerated, I scared my wife when I came in to take a look at it in the mirror but the pain to come was far worse. Tooth was intact thank goodness and was a bit wobbly and I said to myself yup, this could be a problem. A month or two later I hit it again when I was putting a portable step fence panel in the bed of the truck and it bounced and split the bridge of my nose and hit the tooth again. did not break or get displaced. Thank goodness I have a particularly thick head. Tooth trauma is a strange thing. It can blow up anywhere up to a year later. So almost 6 months later I was flying to a meeting in Orlando and of course the tooth decided to react to changes in atmospheric pressure just so I could experience the exquisite pain of barodontalgia. Kind of pain that makes you want to pry the top of your head off with a pitchfork because it would take your mind off the pain. Problem was it did not resolve after landing or anytime during the 4 days I was at the meeting. A combo regimen of acetaminophen and ibuprofen manage the pain well enough until I could get home and have it seen to. Pain did not end but the Xray showed no fracture or endodontic lesion. Strange. Then as suddenly as it occurred, the pain ceased. Strange x 2. Snapped another film and there was no pathology. Tooth was vital on pulp testing. So I did nothing more.

To do this, we need to bring all the q terms on one side of the equation and all the constant terms on the other side. Start by subtracting 48*q from both sides: 169*q - 48*q + 29 = 48*q - 48*q - 92 Which simplifies to: 121*q + 29 = -92 Step 2: Move the constant term to the other side of the equation. Subtract 29 from both sides: 121*q + 29 - 29 = -92 - 29 Which simplifies to: 121*q = -121 Step 3: Solve for q. Now with q isolated, we can solve for q by dividing both sides by 121: 121*q / 121 = -121 / 121 Which simplifies to: q = -1 So, the solution to the equation 169*q + 29 = 48*q - 92 is q = -1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road.

Given the question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. Question: suppose a person has done hard physical exercise happens, how will it affect more water is drunk. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"More effect Physical exercise stimulates production of sweat which is the body's natural way of cooling down. The sweat is mostly composed of water plus some trace amounts of minerals. As such, after doing hard physical exercise, our body loses a substantial amount of water and therefore becomes dehydrated which triggers thirst. This in turn leads to an increased intake of water when we drink to quench the thirst. When it comes to the kidneys, the increased water intake directly affects its function of filtering unwanted waste from our blood. As the second effect mentions, there's a processing moment in the kidneys that lets waste and fluid pass while preventing larger molecules from passing. Here, the nephrons in the kidneys which are primarily responsible for filtration let in small molecules like water and wastes while leaving out larger ones like proteins and blood cells. The perturbation here refers to the increased intake of water post-exercise, and this translates to more fluid for the kidneys to filter. In this scenario, the process of filtration in the kidneys is influenced in the following ways: More water intake implies more fluid entering the kidneys for processing. This leads to an increased filtration rate as the kidneys work to remove the excess water together with the waste products from the bloodstream. This increased fluid volume in turn stimulates the process of diuresis or increased urine production. This is the body's way of eliminating the excess water consumed and helps in maintaining the body's fluid balance. But, more fluid volume also makes it harder for the renal tubules in the kidneys to reabsorb water and wastes. This could potentially lead to more waste being excreted in the urine and less being reabsorbed back into the bloodstream. In summary, hard physical exercise followed by more water intake leads to increased fluid volume that the kidneys need to process. This directly relates to the second effect mentioned, which refers to the processing moment in the kidneys which allows waste and fluid to pass. Hence, the supposed perturbation leads to a more pronounced effect on the filtration process in the kidneys."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Jeans are very popular especially with teenagers. It's said that the material came originally from Nimes, a city in France. These jeans were particularly created for the sailors, who loved wearing jeans very much. These jeans could be worn when wet and it could even be rolled over with ease. This was particularly useful when the sailors were busy with their everyday work. Our favorite pair of blue, jeans was originally worn by workers particularly during World War II. Perhaps the strong and durable look made these blue jeans popular among all the factory workers. A strange thing that can be noticed happened in the early period of the 1950s when blue jeans worn by teens were considered to be a form of being against others. Besides, adults who wore blue jeans were not allowed to enter a movie theatre. It was only during the 1960s that blue jeans were accepted as a fashion trend in the United States of America. Movie stars wore them in films and in public. Many young people follow them. The different looks of the regular blue jeans which are enjoyed by people were introduced by the mid 1950s. It was Donald Freeland who gave jeans a whole new look and brought it to the front. Originally, jeans were always worn loose. At first, jeans worn by men had the zipper on the front. However, for women, it was on the side. By the late 1960's , the zipper finally was on the front side for women as well. Today, there are many new designs that are being created by fashion designers to meet the increasing demands from jean lovers!

United Planet cruiser C57D is a year out from Earth base on the way to Altair for a special mission. Commander J.J Adams (Leslie Neilsen) orders the crew to the deceleration booths as the ship drops from light speed to normal space.Adams orders pilot Jerry Farman (Jack Kelly) to lay in a course for the fourth planet. The captain then briefs the crew that they are at their destination, and that they are to look for survivors from the Bellerophon expedition 20 years earlier.As they orbit the planet looking for signs of life, the ship is scanned by a radar facility some 20 square miles in area. Morbius (Walter Pigeon) contacts the ship from the planet asking why the ship is here. Morbius goes on to explain he requires nothing, no rescue is required and he can't guarantee the safety of the ship or its crew.Adams confirms that Morbius was a member of the original crew, but is puzzled at the cryptic warning Morbius realizes the ship is going to land regardless, and gives the pilot coordinates in a desert region of the planet. The ship lands and security details deploy. Within minutes a high speed dust cloud approaches the ship. Adams realizes it is a vehicle, and as it arrives the driver is discovered to be a robot (Robby). Robby welcomes the crew to Altair 4 and invites members of the crew to Morbius' residence.Adams, Farman and Doc Ostrow (Warren Stevens) arrive at the residence and are greeted by Morbius.

Early visitors describe extensive fields cleared for cultivation. The tribe also fished the Kennebec River. French Jesuits established an early mission at the village, which was located at Old Point. But Father Sebastien Rale , appointed missionary in 1694, was suspected of abetting the tribe's raids on English settlements. Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head. British troops attacked the village in 1705 and again in 1722, but both times Father Rale escaped into the woods. But on August 23, 1724, during Father Rale's War, soldiers attacked the village unexpectedly, killing 26 warriors and wounding 14, with 150 survivors fleeing to Canada. Among the dead was Father Rale. Settled by English colonists about 1773, the land would be surveyed in 1791. In 1775, Benedict Arnold and his troops would march through Norridgewock Plantation, as it was known, on their way to the ill-fated Battle of Quebec.

Write a text based on \\"israel s barak promises to make life easier for palestinians but not to remove checkpoints\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Israel's Barak Promises to Improve Palestinian Lives but Not to Remove Checkpoints – A Step Forward or a Mere Gesture? Introduction Despite ongoing efforts from various quarters for achieving peace and stability in the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unresolved. With tensions prevalent for decades, many obstacles stand in the way of a peaceful resolution. One such longstanding issue is the presence of Israeli security checkpoints that restrict the movement of Palestinians in the occupied territories. Recently, Israel's Defense Minister, Ehud Barak, has promised to make life easier for Palestinians but has not committed to removing these checkpoints. This text aims to discuss Barak's stance and analyze its potential impact on the Palestinian population and future prospects of the peace process. Barak's Proposal – Relief for Palestinians? Amid international criticism for Israel's hardline approach and extensive security infrastructure, Ehud Barak has signaled an intention to ease the living conditions of Palestinians in the West Bank. The Defense Minister has expressed Israel's willingness to consider removing unnecessary roadblocks, enhance freedom of movement for Palestinian civilians, and potentially offer economic incentives. Barak's statements suggest a more compassionate approach, possibly recognizing the daily hardships faced by Palestinians. However, the promise of \\"making life easier\\" might not extend to the removal of security checkpoints - a central cause of concern for the Palestinian population. Checkpoints, alongside the extensive security barrier surrounding the West Bank, hinder the free movement of Palestinians and have severe consequences on their daily lives, including restricted access to education, healthcare facilities, and employment opportunities. Hence, the assurance of improvements without addressing the issue of checkpoints falls short of satisfying many Palestinians and international observers. Implications of Barak's Stance on the Peace Process Barak's commitment to easing Palestinians' lives can be considered as a potential opening for diplomatic dialogue and confidence-building between Israelis and Palestinians. Implementation of these proposals could improve the situation on the ground, creating a conducive environment for resuming peace negotiations, which have been stalled for many years. However, the unwillingness to remove checkpoints raises questions about the extent of the proposed changes. For many Palestinians and their supporters, the persistence of checkpoints symbolizes a lack of genuine commitment to resolving the conflict. This reluctance to remove checkpoints can also foster disappointment or frustration among the Palestinian population, possibly leading to increased mistrust between the conflicted parties and undermining the progress towards peace. The Role of International Actors While the situation remains at an impasse, the role of international actors is crucial in promoting peace talks and conflict resolution in the region. The United States, European Union, United Nations, and Arab League can encourage Israel to take additional steps to remove checkpoints or other barriers, which can contribute to restarting the peace process. Moreover, these international actors can also work on providing incentives for both Israeli and Palestinian governments to negotiate in good faith and lay a foundation for lasting peace in the region. Conclusion In conclusion, Ehud Barak's promise to make life easier for Palestinians is a potentially positive development, but the reluctance to address the issue of checkpoints may limit the impact of these efforts. For genuine progress towards peace and stability in the region, it is necessary to remove restrictions on freedom of movement for Palestinians and work towards more transparency and trust-building measures. It remains to be seen whether Barak's proposal leads to further concessions on Israel's part, and it is crucial for international actors to remain vigilant and committed to achieving comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the below context: On a train trip, lawyer Richard Grant tells fellow passengers that, based on his long experience both prosecuting and defending murder cases, murder is sometimes justified and a clever man should be able to commit it undetected. He is traveling to the isolated estate of his wealthy client and friend, Gordon Rich; his young adult daughter Barbara surprises him at the train station, where she informs him that she has already been there a week. Grant's view is soon put to the test. Rich asks him to rewrite his will, including bequests to all his former mistresses (except one who is dead already; she was just 16, and Grant believes it was suicide). When Rich explains that he wants a new will because he intends to marry Barbara, Grant is appalled. He repeats what he said on the train. Rich deserves to be murdered, and if that is what it takes to stop the marriage, Grant will do it and get away with it. Rich retorts that if necessary he will retaliate from beyond the grave. Grant pleads with his daughter, pointing out the great age difference and Rich's indecent character. But she loves Rich and is adamant. Nor has Tommy Osgood, a young man Barbara had been seeing, been able to change her mind. At a dinner party that night, Rich announces the wedding and says it will take place in the morning. His longtime girlfriend, Marjorie West, is dismayed, but after the party he assures her that, as usual, he will return to her once he exhausts his obsession with Barbara. He is only marrying Barbara because she would not go to bed with him otherwise. Rich orders two servants to watch Grant's bungalow on the estate, but Grant uses a cutout mounted on a record player to cast a moving shadow on the curtain to make it appear that he is pacing restlessly, and slips back to the main house.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Border Patrol statistics show changing migration pattern Most of the people the Border Patrol stopped from sneaking into the country last year were from countries other than Mexico, according to agency statistics, a shift that might have provided fodder for politicians leading up to Tuesday’s election. But they didn’t get much of a chance. The Border Patrol’s annual statistics were posted on the U.S. Customs and Border Protection Web site for about five hours on Oct. 10, then taken down. Now some are questioning whether that decision was an example of the Obama administration playing politics with public information. Even before Tuesday, the administration said it was waiting until after the elections to deal with immigration reform so that any losses would not be blamed on the Democrats’ proposal. For some, removing the apprehension statistics — which both parties could use to criticize U.S. immigration laws — was a political move. “It worries me that they may have been taken down for purely political reasons,” said Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah). “If the information is ready, it should be made available.” But Customs and Border Protection spokesman Christopher O’Neil said in an e-mail that the decision to remove the briefly released data had nothing to do with the midterm elections. Rather, he said, it was an effort to provide all of the agency’s statistics — and not just the Border Patrol’s — “in one concise and comprehensive package.” He said the agency had intended to publish the data by Oct. 31. But administrative delays in gathering statistics by operational elements caused the date to be pushed back several days. Customs and Border Protection now plans to publish before Nov. 15, he wrote. The early release, he said, was due to miscommunication. “Someone got ahead of us, and then, someone else gave them to a reporter [without] coordinating with us,” he wrote, adding that in past years, the agency didn’t release statistics until well after January for the previous fiscal year. “No conspiracy, no politics, just good governance.” The fact that the Border Patrol caught mostly foreign nationals not from Mexico might be an anomaly, but it underscores the border’s changing dynamics. The federal government still faces challenges in understanding who may be trying to enter the country without authorization. With immigration a long-simmering issue, apprehension data have been leveraged by Democrats and Republicans. Current and former officials speculate that CBP may have wanted to stay out of the political debate as Election Day neared by not highlighting 2014 statistics. Victor Manjarrez, a retired Border Patrol chief in Tucson, said the numbers can be interpreted — and exploited — in different ways, depending on the political party. Many Border Patrol chiefs continue to feel “an incredible amount of pressure,” said Manjarrez, now the associate director of the National Center for Border Security and Immigration, a research group at the University of Texas at El Paso. “The fear is timing. If this was next year, it wouldn’t be a big deal.” Since the 2014 fiscal year ended Sept. 30, bits and pieces of the annual statistics have dribbled out. The data show mixed results for the Obama administration, which has touted its border apprehensions, largely from Mexico, as the lowest level in decades. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson spoke about the number of apprehensions on the southwestern border in a speech at a Washington think tank on the state of border security shortly after fiscal 2014 ended. Using slides to illustrate his remarks at the Center for Strategic and International Studies on Oct. 9, Johnson announced that the Border Patrol had made 479,377 apprehensions last year on the border. He saluted CBP for recently making public an internal report and new policy on the agency’s use of force. And he underscored “a commitment to transparency.” The new annual statistics were posted and taken down within hours the next day. The agency has kept posted data relating to the surge of unaccompanied minors from Central America caught at the border, which was a driving factor in the spike in “other than Mexican” apprehensions in 2014. But the full data set, obtained by the Center for Investigative Reporting, shows a mixed bag. Apprehensions on the border have increased for the past three years. Yet border deaths fell to the lowest level since 1999. A majority of migrants — 252,600, or about 53 percent — caught on the border in 2014 were not Mexican. In contrast, a decade ago, Mexicans accounted for 93 percent of apprehensions, according to government statistics. This article was produced by the Center for Investigative Reporting, an independent, nonprofit newsroom based in the San Francisco Bay area. Summary:","completion":"Last year, the Border Patrol in the United States stopped more people from countries other than Mexico from sneaking into the country. This shows that the pattern of migration is changing. Some people think the government is having a hard time understanding who may be trying to enter the country without permission.

The protest by delegates against the U.S.-led military operation in Najaf highlights the international conflicts, debates, and diplomatic issues that are commonly associated with this topic. The situation described in the statement involves the U.S.-led military operation in Najaf, which is a city in Iraq. Najaf has significant religious importance for Shia Muslims since it houses the Imam Ali Shrine. The U.S. military presence in the region during the Iraq War led to various confrontations with insurgent groups. The conference mentioned in the statement could refer to any political, diplomatic, or international gathering where representatives from different countries and organizations have come together to discuss pressing global issues. Considering the disruptive nature of the protests, it seems likely that the delegates were passionately opposed to the military actions taking place in Najaf, which caused the conference to devolve into chaos. This chaotic turn of events would fit under the \\"World\\" category as it signifies the broad political, cultural, and societal implications of ongoing international conflicts and their impact on diplomatic processes. Events like this could potentially lead to discussions of the use of military force, the efficacy of diplomatic relations, and efforts to find workable solutions for conflict resolution – all of which are themes that are directly relevant to global affairs and politics. In contrast, it is evident that this event does not fit the other options given, namely \\"Sports,\\" \\"Business,\\" and \\"Science/Tech,\\" as they are primarily focused on different areas of interest: - Sports: This option generally deals with athletic contests, related news, and events focused on professional or amateur physical competitions.

The Business category would be more relevant if the issue discussed at the conference were centered around financial, economic, or corporate topics directly associated with the ongoing conflict. - Science/Tech: This option pertains to the realm of scientific research, technological advancements, and their applications in various sectors. The event described in the statement is a political conflict and has no direct connection to scientific or technological issues. As such, the appropriate selection for the topic of the given statement is \\"World,\\" given its focus on international relations, political disputes, and military actions.

Sleeping is, by definition, a state of rest and non-activity; meanwhile, hula-hooping is a physically engaging activity. Given these two premises, the only logical conclusion when comparing the two situations is that both cannot exist concurrently. A little girl cannot be hula-hooping and sleeping at the same time. Therefore, if \\"The little girl is sleeping, in bed,\\" the premise \\"A little girl hula-hooping with 2 hula hoops on her hips.\\" is false."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize: Well, that's the ambition that sits at the top of the agenda as Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe undertakes a week-long trip to Washington, though a final announcement is unlikely to be this week. Abe's visit is being termed historic as he is the first Japanese PM to be invited to address both houses of Congress on Wednesday, and any remarks that he makes on the 70th anniversary of World War Two will be closely monitored. Yet for Abe and perhaps also US President Barack Obama, it's their progress on a trade deal that is at the top of the agenda. Abe has said that they are near agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would create the largest free trade area in the world, linking the countries in Asia Pacific ranging from central America to southeast Asia. I've written before about the ambitious TPP, which notably excludes China - a notable exception at that. Given all of Japan's economic challenges - struggle to defeat deflation as price increases have fallen back to zero - and low productivity to name a few, would a trade pact really make a huge difference? Estimates by economists put the gains at 0.66% of GDP that increases to 2% by 2020 if factors like foreign direct investment are included. For an economy that is struggling to grow, these are not huge amounts but certainly not negligible. Why Obama allies are against Pacific trade deal So why is it the big focus in Abe's visit to Washington? For one, it's a tangible example of a structural reform that is the crucial third arrow of Abenomics - Abe's ambitious reform plans. Monetary and fiscal stimulus make up the first two arrows, but it's the third one that is the key to raising economic growth that has come under criticism for lacking focus. In other words, there are numerous policies that have been put forward by the Abe government, but few concrete initiatives to cite. One exception is Womenomics, where increasing female labour force participation to the same rate as men's would add some 14% to GDP. Even with respect to that policy, it's unclear how it can be achieved. So a new trade pact that puts Japan at the centre of the world's biggest free trade area certainly has its appeal. But it's not only up to Japan - the US also has to agree. And it's not just the usual hurdles of opening up agriculture or the auto sector to contend with. TPP has been described in the US media as \\"Nafta on steroids\\". The North American Free Trade Agreement was a contentious free trade area linking the US with Canada and Mexico under the last Democratic President Bill Clinton. Free trade has been blamed for the loss of US manufacturing jobs, for instance. But before that stage, President Obama also needs \\"fast-track\\" authority for trade negotiations. The Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) allows the president to present to Congress an agreed trade deal and they can't pick it apart. Unsurprisingly, it's key for getting trade deals through Congress. One is in the works but is unlikely to get through Congress by the end of May, much less this week. For President Obama's Asia Pivot, where he's reorienting American foreign policy more towards Asia, the TPP is a centrepiece. And one of the few areas where he may indeed be able to claim a legislative victory given that the Republican-controlled Congress makes it tricky for his last two years in office. I understand that the president may well be relying on executive orders like what he announced on immigration to put forward policies. So for both Japan and the US a win on the TPP would be welcome. For Abe, walking away with a concrete example of an economic policy that will boost growth would certainly make his historic trip to Washington worthwhile. Summary:","completion":"The Prime Minister of Japan, Shinzo Abe, went on a trip to Washington for a week. This was a very important visit because he was the first Japanese leader to speak to both parts of the United States Congress. During his trip, he talked about important things including the 70th anniversary of World War Two, but trade was the biggest topic. He and the President of the United States, Barack Obama, talked a lot about a big trade deal called the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which would connect many countries in Asia and the Americas. This deal would be good for Japan and the US, so they both hope it can happen. However, there are still many things to be worked out before the trade deal is agreed upon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Felicia was kept in the hospital while Tanya was released, because Possible answers: [+] Felicia tested positive for the disease.. [+] Tanya tested positive for the disease..","completion":"Felicia was kept in the hospital while Tanya was released, because Felicia tested positive for the disease. The detection of the disease in Felicia's body required her to receive appropriate and prompt medical treatment and close monitoring to ensure her health, safety, and safeguard against potential complications. Timely intervention is crucial in such cases, and keeping her in the hospital allows healthcare professionals to have constant supervision of her condition and administer the necessary care. On the other hand, Tanya was released because her tests came back negative for the disease. Consequently, she was considered to be healthy and did not require hospitalization. Her discharge from the hospital not only benefited her but also helped in managing the hospital's resources more efficiently, enabling them to allocate their resources to patients who are in more urgent need of care and attention. Moreover, discharging Tanya also reduces her risk of contracting an illness while in the hospital since healthcare facilities often carry germs and pathogens. Tanya's negative test result does not guarantee immunity, so it is safer for her to be away from potentially infectious sources. Even though Felicia and Tanya faced contrasting outcomes due to their respective diagnostic results, both the decision of keeping Felicia in the hospital and releasing Tanya serve their best interests. Healthcare providers must make these decisions carefully, as they play a significant role in protecting the health and wellbeing of all patients, ensuring that those who require close monitoring and care are allocated appropriate resources and those who do not, are swiftly discharged. Moving forward, Felicia will likely undergo additional evaluations, testing, and treatment, while Tanya can continue monitoring her health from home. Felicia's family and friends can provide her with emotional support during this challenging time, while Tanya's network can celebrate her good health.

He informs her that a young scientist named Durand-Durand went missing sometime during a mission to the North Star and is believed to have landed somewhere in the Tau Ceti star system. Not much is known about this region of space-- the President worries that Durand's invention, the positronic ray, may fall into the hands of a primitive culture; beings who might seek to use this technology as a weapon and launch an intergalactic war.

The only living creature in his 'environment,' Rango has fancied himself as an actor, with several inanimate object as his friends and fellow thespians. In his self-contained world, Rango's 'friends' tell him that even though he fancies himself a hero, he needs a challenge.The world goes awry when something in the road causes the car to jolt, and the chameleon and his aquarium fly out the back of the vehicle he's in, shattering to the ground. Getting up, the chameleon sees an armadillo in the road, it's mid-section squashed in by a tire. The creature asks for help to get to the other side, and the chameleon assists. Not being used to the heat, the chameleon asks the armadillo where he can find water. The creature tells him he can find it in dirt, a day's journey away.tThe chameleon follows his shadow through the desert, but is almost eaten by a hawk. Taking refuge in a storm drain, the chameleon wakes the next morning to a small rush of water that quickly evaporates in the sun. Close by, he comes across a female lizard named Beans (Isla Fisher). Though at first hostile, Beans gives the chameleon a ride into town. The chameleon attempts to blend in with the locals, and makes his way to a nearby saloon. Going in, he arouses the suspicion of almost everyone in the bar. Several ask to know who he is, and after seeing the word 'Durango' on a bottle of cactus juice, the chamelon claims that his name...is Rango.Rango then attempts to spin a story that makes him seem like a hero. When someone asks if he killed some outlaws known as The Jenkins Brothers, Rango claims to have done it with just one bullet. As he talks, a couple of outlaws enter the room, led by a lizard named Bad Bill (Ray Winstone). Rango attempts to act intimidating, but instead rouses Bill's ire, leading to the two having a showdown in the middle of the town.Rango thinks he's scared off Bad Bill and his boys when they run away...only to realize the hawk...

Story continuation: The woman tried to hide the junk food in the desk but the desk was too small. Frustrated, she glanced around the room for a better hiding spot, knowing her children could return home at any moment. The sound of the school bus outside sent her into a panic. She spotted a large decorative vase in the corner of the room, where she had been storing her collection of silk flowers. With no time to lose, she hastily removed the flowers and shoved the junk food inside. Taking a step back, she scattered the flowers on the nearby coffee table, hoping her children wouldn't notice the haphazard arrangement. Just as she sat down to catch her breath, the front door swung open, and her two children burst into the living room. \\"Mom, we're home!\\" they yelled in unison. \\"Hi, sweethearts!\\" she replied, trying to hide her nervousness. \\"How was school?\\" As they excitedly shared stories of their day, she couldn't help but glance over at the vase, praying they didn't discover her secret stash. Unbeknownst to her, the children had noticed her suspicious behavior and had already hatched a plan to discover what she was hiding. That night, after the woman had gone to bed, they decided to investigate. The moment they lifted the vase, they discovered the collection of chocolate bars, potato chips, and candies. Grinning at each other, they decided to pull off the ultimate prank. The following morning, the woman found her junk food stash on the kitchen table, neatly arranged and surrounded by the silk flowers. Next to the display lay a note from her kids: \\"Nice try, Mom. Better luck next time!\\" Realizing she had been caught, the woman couldn't help but laugh and appreciate her children's efforts. From that day on, they decided to enjoy the occasional junk food snack together as a family, teaching them the importance of moderation and trust."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Article: prefix = st1 /Gland, Switzerland - Rivers on every continent are drying out, threatening severe water shortages, according to a new WWF report. The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone. They are the Yangtze, Mekong, Salween, Ganges and Indus. Europe's Danube, the America'sLa Plataand Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Africa's Nile-Lake Victoria andAustralia's Murray-Darling also make the list. Dams along the Danube River -- one of the longest flowing rivers in Europe -- have already destroyed 80 per cent of the river basin's wetlands and floodplains. Even without warmer temperatures threatening to melt Himalayan glaciers, the IndusRiverfaces scarcity due to over-extraction for agriculture. Fish populations, the main source of protein and overall life support systems for hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide, are also being threatened. The report calls on governments to better protect river flows and water allocations in order to safeguard habitats and people's livelihoods. \\"Conservation of rivers and wetlands must be seen as part and parcel of national security, health and economic success,\\" Pittock adds. \\"Emphasis must be given to exploring ways of using water for crops and products that do not use more water than necessary.\\" In addition, cooperative agreements for managing shared resources, such as the UN Watercourses Convention, must be ratified and given...

He spent the early years of his life with his extended family under a matriarch, his grandmother. On Sméagol's birthday, he and his relative Déagol went fishing in the Gladden Fields north of Lothlórien. There, Déagol found the Ring in the riverbed after being pulled into the water by a fish. Sméagol fell immediately under the Ring's influence and demanded it as a birthday present; when Déagol refused, Sméagol strangled him. Sméagol later used the Ring for thieving, spying and antagonizing his friends and relatives, who nicknamed him \`\`Gollum'' for the swallowing noise he made in his throat, until his grandmother expelled him from the family. He wandered in the wilderness for a few years until he finally retreated to a deep cavern in the Misty Mountains.

Why one veteran VC is investing, despite seeing a bubble Joe Horowitz has been in venture capital for three decades, so he knows how to spot a tech bubble. Perhaps needless to say, the current market has him more than a little spooked. His evidence? The number of start-ups that are being valued at 1 billion or more. Reaching that mark is such a feat that Silicon Valley observers have taken to calling such companies \\"unicorns.\\" But according to CB Insights, there are now 42 members of the billion-dollar club. \\"When we start throwing around the billion dollar valuation number in such a casual way, then it is a sign that we are losing some perspective,\\" said Horowitz, managing general partner at Icon Ventures, which until last week was called Jafco Ventures. \\"Building a company that is truly worth a billion dollars or more takes a lot of work and a lot of smart people. You have to be at the right place at the right time to truly disrupt a big market relative to traditional players.\\" Read MoreWe're not in a tech bubble, but it's pretty hot: VC For Horowitz, that's a painful reality, because his Palo Alto, California-based firm just last year closed a 260 million fund, an increase of 110 million over Jafco's biggest prior fund. So Horowitz has to put money to work in a market that he admits is overheated. If he were a public market investor, it would be a perfect time to go conservative, with cash, bonds and dividend-paying stocks. But playing it safe is not part of a venture capitalist's lexicon. Start-up investing is, by definition, high risk and high reward. \\"We still have to be in the market and try to navigate either headwinds or even winds at our back appropriately,\\" Horowitz said. Venture investors poured 48.4 billion into U.S. start-ups last year, by far the most since the peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, according to the National Venture Capital Association. Venture firms, including Icon, reeled in 29.8 billion, the largest haul since 2007, the association said. Read More2015: The year Uber gets an IPO? Horowitz said his firm increased the fund size because it's having to write bigger checks. In the Jafco days, the firm would invest around 8 million as part of a 15 million financing round. Now, Icon is leading rounds of up to 25 million by putting in as much as 15 million. A big problem with the swarm of billion-dollar start-ups is not just the risk that private market investors are overpaying, but also that there's less upside for the public markets if and when those companies conduct share sales. If public investors aren't getting desired returns, they'll be less likely to participate in future offerings, which could clog the whole system. \\"You need to leave room for the public to make money—that's what drives an IPO market,\\" Horowitz said. \\"When we had companies going public at half a billion dollars and within a few years worth 3 to 4 billion, then the public feels rewarded for taking those risks.\\" Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Joe Horowitz, a venture capitalist with 30 years of experience, is investing in start-ups even though he believes the market is in a bubble. This is because there are many start-ups being valued at 1 billion or more, which he thinks might be too much."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mr Abe and US officials were among thousands who gathered to remember some 250,000 people who died in Japan's only land battle of World War Two. More than 100,000 were civilians, and residents are resentful that they must continue to host US troops. About 100,000 Japanese soldiers died over a period of three months in a bloody battle with Allied forces. More than 100,000 Okinawans also died, with many ordered to take their own lives by Japanese military commanders. More than 12,000 US troops also died on the island, about 340 miles (550 km) south-west from mainland Japan. The prime minister being jeered is something that almost never happens in Japan, but to this day there is deep bitterness at the sacrifice of so many Okinawan lives, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo. Many Okinawans accuse Tokyo and Washington of continuing to treat the island like an imperial possession, ignoring the wishes of the islanders to have US military bases removed, our correspondent says. In 1945, the strategic island was seen by the Allies as a launchpad for an invasion of Japan. The assault never came as Tokyo surrendered following the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August 1945. Okinawa remained occupied by the US military until 1972, when Tokyo regained control of the island. However, Japan's southernmost prefecture is still home to about 26,000 US troops and several bases which occupy a fifth of the island.

(CNN) Health officials across the United States are still urging people to get their flu vaccines as the virus continues to spread in 40 states and Puerto Rico and has been associated with 20 pediatric deaths, seven of them reported in the week ending February 4. Flu activity is \\"high\\" to \\"extremely high\\" in 24 regions. Alabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Georgia, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Wyoming rank as the states with the highest levels of flu and flu-like illness activity. \\"It looks like it is picking up again, which is pretty typical during this time of year, especially when all the schools and colleges, in particular, go back in session,\\" said Dr. David Topham, director of respiratory pathogens at the University of Rochester. \\"We are hitting at the peak right now, which is pretty typical for late January mid-February for influenza.\\" The CDC and the medical community continue to emphasize the importance of getting vaccinated to protect yourself and others from contracting or spreading the virus. \\"With the flu season that's going on right now, it is not too late for a vaccine,\\" said Dr. James Steinberg, chief medical officer at Emory University Hospital Midtown in Atlanta. \\"It wasn't an early season, and if people haven't gotten the vaccine, there is still time to get it,\\" he said of the best way to guard against the spread of the virus. Flu vs. cold Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection and is more severe than the common cold. \\"There is some overlap between the common cold and the flu, but the flu often starts with an abrupt onset of symptoms,\\" Steinberg said. Symptoms include a fever or chills, headache, soreness and the \\"feeling that you don't want to get out of bed.\\" Some groups, such as children, elderly and those with chronic conditions, are at a higher risk of complications. When it comes to the types of influenza, not all are created equal. There are four types of the virus: A, B, C and D. In humans, influenza A and B are the two that routinely cause the seasonal flu each year. Influenza A viruses are broken down into subtypes, based on two proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). This naming system is how scientists identify the subtypes of Influenza A. H1N1 became well-known in 2009 after causing the first influenza pandemic in over 40 years. Influenza B viruses don't have subtypes but are broken down by strains and lineages. Since humans are natural hosts of influenza B and the virus mutates much slower than influenza A, pandemics rarely occur with this type. \\"Some types of strains are more severe for certain people,\\" CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said. \\"We know from previous experience that H3N2 is more severe for young children and those 65 and older.\\" Steinberg emphasized the importance of vaccinations for people living with high-risk individuals. \\"(High-risk recipients') response to the vaccine isn't as good as somebody who's not elderly or not a small infant,\\" he said. \\"If you live in the household or take care of somebody who's at risk for severe influenza, I think that's a strong reason for those people to get the vaccine, because they can protect their loved ones who are at higher risk of complications.\\" \\"While flu spreads every year, the timing, severity and length of the season varies from one year to another,\\" Nordlund said. Typically, flu season in the United States begins in October and reaches its seasonal peak between December and March before slowing through spring. Topham stresses the potential dangers of contracting the illness, which has been a leading cause of death across the US and around the world for decades. \\"The reality is, getting the flu can be a serious thing. It can make children and the elderly in particular, who are our most vulnerable populations, very ill. Get vaccinated, because you protect yourself and you protect the people around you.\\" What to do if you have the flu Most people who experience mild symptoms do not need to seek immediate medical attention. \\"Most healthy people who get influenza infection do fine with getting plenty of fluid and rest,\\" said Dr. Pritish Tosh, an infectious disease physician and researcher at the Mayo Clinic. \\"They should stay home from school or work and ensure that they are getting the rest and fluids they need.\\" Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. But Tosh said there are times when going to the doctor is necessary. \\"They should seek medical attention if there are concerns for severe infection such as difficulty breathing.\\" Tosh also said patients in high-risk groups who experience flu-like symptoms should seek medical attention. \\"Older adults, infants and those with substantial underlying medical problems have a higher risk of complications from influenza infection and should seek medical attention, including consideration for antiviral medications.\\" People often mistake symptoms of stomach flu, gastroenteritis, for the seasonal flu virus, but the two are not related. \\"We call a lot of things the flu,\\" Topham said. \\"It's a completely different infection, different virus.\\" Still, the CDC says that the best way to protect yourself and others from influenza is to get vaccinated. ||||| All data are preliminary and may change as more reports are received. An overview of the CDC influenza surveillance system, including methodology and detailed descriptions of each data component, is available at http://www.cdc.gov/flu/weekly/overview.htm. Influenza activity remains elevated in the United States. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, influenza A(H3N2), and influenza B viruses continue to co-circulate.

CDC characterizes influenza viruses through one or more tests including genomic sequencing, hemagglutination inhibition (HI) and/or neutralization assays based Focus Reduction assays (FRA). These data are used to compare how similar currently circulating influenza viruses are to the reference viruses used for developing new influenza vaccines and to monitor evolutionary changes that continually occur in influenza viruses circulating in humans. Antigenic and genetic characterization of circulating influenza viruses gives an indication of the influenza vaccine's ability to induce an immune response against the wide array of influenza viruses that are co-circulating every season. However, annual vaccine effectiveness estimates are needed to determine how much protection was provided to the population by vaccination. For nearly all influenza-positive surveillance samples received at CDC, next-generation sequencing is performed to determine the genetic identity of circulating influenza viruses and to monitor the evolutionary trajectory of viruses circulating in our population. Virus gene segments are classified into genetic clades/subclades based on phylogenetic analysis. However, genetic changes that classify the clades/subclades do not always result in antigenic changes. “Antigenic drift” is a term used to describe gradual antigenic change that occurs as viruses evolve changes to escape host immune pressure. Antigenic drift is evaluated by comparing antigenic properties of cell-propagated reference viruses representing currently recommended vaccine components with those of cell-propagated circulating viruses. CDC has antigenically or genetically characterized 562 influenza viruses collected September 30, 2018 – January 12, 2019, and submitted by U.S. laboratories, including 341 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses, 163 influenza A(H3N2) viruses, and 58 influenza B viruses. Influenza A Viruses A (H1N1)pdm09: Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from 341 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses showed that all belonged to clade 6B.1. One hundred thirty-six A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses were antigenically characterized, and 134 (98.5%) were antigenically similar (analyzed using HI with ferret antisera) to A/Michigan/45/2015 (6B.1), a cell-propagated A/Michigan/45/2015-like reference virus representing the A(H1N1)pdm09 component for the 2018-19 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. A (H3N2): Phylogenetic analysis of the HA genes from 163 A(H3N2) viruses revealed extensive genetic diversity with multiple clades/subclades co-circulating. The HA genes of circulating viruses belonged to clade 3C.2a (n=48), subclade 3C.2a1 (n=78) or clade 3C.3a (n=37). Six A(H3N2) viruses were antigenically characterized by FRA with ferret antisera, and all 6 (100%) A(H3N2) viruses tested were well-inhibited (reacting at titers that were within 4-fold of the homologous virus titer) by ferret antisera raised against A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016 (3C.2a1), a cell-propagated A/Singapore/INFIMH-16-0019/2016-like reference virus representing the A(H3N2) component of 2018-19 Northern Hemisphere influenza vaccines. Influenza B Viruses B/Victoria: Phylogenetic analysis of 18 B/Victoria-lineage viruses indicate that all HA genes belonged to genetic clade V1A, however genetic subclades which are antigenically distinct have emerged. Genetic subclades which are antigenically distinct include viruses with a two amino acid deletion (162-163) in the HA protein (V1A.1, previously abbreviated as V1A-2Del) and viruses with a three amino acid deletion (162-164) in the HA protein (abbreviated as V1A-3Del). Eight B/Victoria lineage viruses were antigenically characterized and 4 (50%) were antigenically similar with ferret antisera raised against cell-propagated B/Colorado/06/2017-like V1A.1 reference virus. Four (50%) reacted poorly (at titers that were 8-fold or greater reduced compared with the homologous virus titer) and belonged to clade V1A. B/Yamagata: Phylogenetic analysis of 40 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses indicate that the HA genes belonged to clade Y3. A total of 33 influenza B/Yamagata-lineage viruses were antigenically characterized, and all were antigenically similar to cell-propagated B/Phuket/3073/2013 (Y3), the reference vaccine virus representing the influenza B/Yamagata-lineage component of the 2018-19 Northern Hemisphere quadrivalent vaccines. The majority of U.S. viruses submitted for characterization come from state and local public health laboratories. Due to Right Size Roadmap considerations, specimen submission guidance to laboratories is that, if available, 2 influenza A(H1N1)pdm09, 2 influenza A(H3N2), and 2 influenza B viruses be submitted every other week. Therefore, the numbers of each virus type/subtype characterized should be more balanced across subtypes/lineages but will not reflect the actual proportion of circulating viruses. In the figure below, the results of tests performed by public health labs are shown on the left and CDC sequence results (by genetic clade/subclade) are shown on the right. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Flu activity across the United States is increasing, with high to extremely high levels of the virus reported in 24 regions, causing health officials to continue urging people to get their flu vaccines.

News article: The mother of Boston Marathon bomber Tamerlan Tsarnaev knew as early as 2011 that her son had been radicalized and sent text messages to family in Russia suggesting he was willing to die for Islam, the FBI told lawmakers this week according to two officials with knowledge of the Capitol Hill briefing. Tsarnaev, who was killed days after the April 15 bombing in a shootout with police, is said to have embraced radical Islam in recent years and recruited his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, to carry out the attack that killed three and wounded more than 180 near the finish line of the world's most prestigious road race. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was caught alive but wounded on Friday and charged with use of a weapon of mass destruction, for which he could get the death penalty. The FBI filed a federal criminal complaint against the 19-year-old on Sunday, and federal District Court Judge Marianne Bowler arrived at the hospital where he is being treated to preside over his initial hearing Monday, when she read him his Miranda rights. [FBI officials told The Associated Press Wednesday that Tsarnaev acknowledged to investigators his role in the attacks before he was advised of his constitutional rights. He reportedly said he was only recently recruited by his brother to be part of the attack.] But Fox News' sources say there was confusion about Bowler's timing, with some voicing concerns that investigators were not given enough time to question Dzhokhar under the \\"public safety exception\\" invoked by the Justice Department. Two officials with knowledge of the FBI briefing on Capitol Hill said the FBI was against stopping the investigators' questioning and was stunned that the judge, Justice Department prosecutors and public defenders showed up, feeling valuable intelligence may have been sacrificed as a result. The FBI had been questioning Tsarnaev for 16 hours before the judge called a start to the court proceeding, officials familiar with the Capitol Hill briefing told Fox News. Moreover, the FBI informed lawmakers that the suspect had been providing valuable intelligence, but stopped talking once the magistrate judge read him his rights. But Justice Department spokesman Dean Boyd disputed the claims, saying that the suspect’s initial appearance was scheduled following the filing of the criminal complaint in a manner “consistent” with procedure – and that the agents were aware. “The Rules of Criminal Procedure require the court to advise the defendant of his right to silence and his right to counsel during the initial appearance. The prosecutors and FBI agents in Boston were advised of the scheduled initial appearance in advance of its occurrence,” Boyd said. A federal law enforcement official also told Fox News that the courts, not the Justice Department, made the decision on when and where to hold the hearing. “The (FBI) agents and prosecutors were notified beforehand,” the official said, claiming those agents had already left the room when the judge came in. The exact timeline is unclear. A transcript of the court proceeding shows Bowler asking a doctor if Tsarnaev was \\"alert.\\" \\"You can rouse him,\\" she says in the transcript. \\"How are you feeling? Are you able to answer some questions?\\" the doctor asks Tsarnaev, who nods. Although Bowler advised Tsarnaev, an ethnic Chechen and U.S. citizen, of his Miranda rights, it remains to be seen whether anything he told investigators before Bowler arrived can be admitted as evidence against him -- or whether such interrogations would even be needed to convict him, given the amount of other evidence referenced in the criminal complaint signed by FBI Special Agent Daniel Genck. Some Republican lawmakers have criticized the Obama administration for deciding against treating Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant, which would allow more time for interrogating him. The public safety exception to Miranda lasts only 48 hours. Megyn Kelly currently serves as anchor of FOX News Channel's (FNC) The Kelly File (weekdays 9-10PM/ET) and is based in New York.

Her response indicated a belief that the bombings were staged: “You know, I saw a very, very interesting video last night that the marathon was something like a really big play. There is, like, paint instead of blood, like it is made-up something.” In return, Walsh challenged her: “You really believe that? I know it’s hard for you to believe what the American officials are saying, but do you believe the whole thing was a show? Why would it be a show?” “That’s what I want to know,” she concluded, “because everybody’s talking about it that this is a show, that’s what I want to know.” Watch the exchange below, via CNN: — — >> Follow Andrew Kirell (@AndrewKirell) on Twitter ||||| Anzor Tsarnaev, who calls himself father of Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the two suspects in the Boston Marathon bombings, gives an interview in Makhachkala in this video grab from footage via Reuters TV, April 19, 2013. MAKHACHKALA, Russia The father of two men suspected of carrying out the Boston bombings said on Thursday he would travel from Russia to the United States to bury his elder son. Anzor Tsarnaev and former wife Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, sitting side by side in the southern Russian city of Makhachkala, denied their sons had planted the bombs at the Boston marathon which killed three people and wounded 264, saying they had been framed. Banging the table in front of him, Anzor said: \\"I am going to the United States. I want to say that I am going there to see my son, to bury the older one. I don't have any bad intentions. I don't plan to blow up anything. \\"I am not angry at anyone. I want to go find out the truth,\\" said Anzor, who took off his sunglasses only when photographers asked him to. He said he would go as soon as possible but that he had not yet bought a plane ticket. Zubeidat Tsarnaeva, her face pinched under her black head scarf, criticized the U.S. police for shooting dead Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, four days after the bombing. The other son Dzhokhar, 19, was wounded and captured after a manhunt. He is in a fair condition in hospital and is charged with two crimes that carry a possible death penalty. \\"I wanted to scream to the whole world, 'What did you do?' What have you done with my son? He was alive. Why did you need to kill him? Why didn't you send him to Guantanamo or whatever? Why? Why? Why did they have to kill him? They got him alive, he was in their hands,\\" she shouted, her voice cracking. \\"It is some kind of show, spectacle,\\" she said in accented English. She recounted how she had called Tamerlan after the bombing and he had told her not to worry. \\"There is a lot that is unexplained,\\" she said, adding that she was considering giving up her U.S. citizenship. The Tsarnaev family lived in Makhachkala, the capital of the restive Dagestan region in Russia's volatile North Сaucasus, more than a decade ago before emigrating to the United States. Anzor and Zubeidat later returned to Russia and their two sons remained in the United States, although Tamerlan came to Dagestan during a six-month stay in Russia last year.

Write the answer: Which famous Australian singer had a dessert named after her","completion":"The famous Australian singer who had a dessert named after her is Dame Nellie Melba, a celebrated operatic soprano who was born as Helen Porter Mitchell on May 19, 1861 in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia. She became one of the most famous singers across Europe and the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Dame Nellie Melba adopted her stage name, Melba, as a shortened form of the name Melbourne, as a tribute to her hometown. Among her many achievements in the music world were her performances at important opera houses, such as La Scala in Milan, the Royal Opera House in London, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York. The dessert named after Dame Nellie Melba is known as “Peach Melba,” which is a classic, elegant dessert created by French chef Auguste Escoffier in the late 19th century while he was working at the Savoy Hotel in London. Escoffier's vision of a dessert honoring the singer coincided with her peak career years. Peach Melba consists of poached peaches that are sweetened and tender, placed atop a bed of rich vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with a succulent raspberry purée. The combination of colors and flavors symbolizes both the sweetness and vibrancy of Dame Nellie Melba's voice. In some variations of the recipe, raspberry sauce is replaced by a more complex red currant sauce, or the dessert is garnished with toasted almonds for added texture and depth. As the story goes, Escoffier was inspired by Dame Nellie Melba's love for both ice cream and peaches and decided to present this dessert in her honor. The first time Peach Melba was served publicly was at a dinner party in London thrown by the Duke of Orleans, and it was an instant hit. The dessert gained further popularity over the years and is now a timeless classic cherished by chefs and diners alike. Today, Dame Nellie Melba is celebrated not only for her legendary soprano performances but also as the muse that led to the creation of Peach Melba. The dessert continues to be a favorite in restaurants and households around the world, a true testament to both the singer's talent and the genius of the chef who created it in her honor."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Passage: Supernature contains music in the same pop and electronic dance styles featured on Goldfrapp's previous studio album, Black Cherry (2003)—especially its singles \\"Strict Machine\\" and \\"Twist\\"—although it focuses on subtle hooks instead of large choruses. Lead singer Alison Goldfrapp described the album's writing process as \\"an electronic/glam cross between Berlin, New York and North-East Somerset\\".Goldfrapp and Will Gregory recorded the bulk of Supernature in late 2004 in the countryside near Bath, England—the same place they recorded Black Cherry. They had rented a small house and spent some months writing music; they later explained that the unpopulated location kept them from distractions and that the majority of the process was \\"very basic\\". Goldfrapp called their writing relationship a \\"democracy\\", playing off one another while in the recording studio. The lyrical content of the song \\"Number 1\\", which became the album's second single, is about the importance and meaning of relationships, even though they do not necessarily last.In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Goldfrapp explained that they had never intended to create pop music. However, the singles released from Black Cherry became successes across nightclubs in North America, and as a result, they decided to write a more dance-oriented album. Although this made the duo nervous, \\"Ooh La La\\" was the group's first song to feature the electric guitar. Before its composition, the duo avoided the use of the guitar because of the guitar's overly recognisable rhythm. Four-on-the-floor bass drums are also present on several of the album's tracks, and the piano ballad \\"Let It Take You\\" features evening-effects composed on a synthesiser. \\"You Never Know\\" begins with Alison Goldfrapp executing a synthesised voice, supported by both pads and synthesisers.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"Yes, you should validate the answer provided, as it is accurate in stating that Vietnam is currently the largest producer and exporter of pepper, which includes ground pepper. However, it is essential to understand that ground pepper can come from multiple sources, not just Vietnam. Ground pepper is produced from the dried berries of the Piper nigrum plant, native to South Asia and Southeast Asia. Although Vietnam is the largest producer, other countries like India, Brazil, and Indonesia also contribute to the global pepper market. After harvesting, the berries are dried and then ground to create the ground pepper we use in our everyday cooking. So, while the statement is true regarding Vietnam's production dominance, ground pepper can come from various regions where the Piper nigrum plant is cultivated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For the most part, jogging can be a healthy way to stay fit. However, problems can also develop for those who jog in the heat. Excessive sweating can lead to electrolyte loss that could be life-threatening. Early symptoms of electrolyte deficiency can include nausea, fatugue, and dizziness. If not treated, individuals can experience muscle weakness and increased heart rate (which could lead to a heart attack). Many sports drinks can be consumed to restore electrolytes quickly in the body. Kevin and his cousin Darlene both enjoy jogging for exercise. One day, Kevin goes out for a jog in his local neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is quite high, and he begins to sweat a lot and starts to feel a bit dizzy. On the same day, Darlene goes jogging in her neighborhood when the amount of heat outside is low and she feels perfectly normal as she continues to jog. Who is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency. This conclusion is based on a number of factors detailed in the scenario. Firstly, jogging in hot conditions can lead to increased perspiration as the body tries to cool itself down. This particularly applies to Kevin, who is said to be sweating a lot due to his jog in high heat. Sweating is the body's way of cooling down, but it also leads to the loss of water and electrolytes from the body. Electrolytes are minerals that carry an electrical charge, and they are vital for several bodily functions such as maintaining water balance, nerve function, muscle contractions, and pH balance. They include minerals such as potassium, sodium, and magnesium. When these electrolytes are lost through sweat and not adequately replaced, that can lead to electrolyte deficiency or imbalance. Excessive electrolyte loss due to sweating can be potentially life-threatening as stated in the scenario, leading to symptoms such as nausea, fatigue, dizziness, muscle weakness, and increased heart rate. The fact that Kevin starts to feel dizzy might be an early symptom of electrolyte deficiency, as dizziness is commonly associated with such a condition. On the other hand, Darlene is jogging in a cooler environment where the heat outside is low. This means that her body is likely sweating less and therefore losing fewer electrolytes compared to Kevin. She doesn't exhibit any symptoms of electrolyte deficiency and feels perfectly normal, suggesting she's maintaining an adequate balance of electrolytes. It's worth noting though, even if the odds are lower, Darlene isn't immune from experiencing electrolyte deficiency. In many respects, the likelihood of experiencing electrolyte deficiency depends on factors like the intensity and duration of the exercise, the specific individual's health condition, and the adequacy of hydration and electrolyte replenishment. But based on the provided information, it can be concluded that Kevin is more likely to be experiencing electrolyte deficiency due to excessive sweating caused by jogging in high heat. He should stop exercising immediately, seek shade, hydrate, and consider consuming a sports drink that can quickly restore electrolytes. If his dizziness or other potential symptoms persist, he should seek medical attention. This can serve as a reminder of the importance of staying adequately hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance while exercising, especially in hot conditions. Precautionary steps such as adjusting the workout time to cooler parts of the day, wearing appropriate clothing, gradually acclimating to the heat, and proper hydration can be effective ways to prevent electrolyte deficiency."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of the word \\"flabbergasting\\" suggests that the young actors' performance in the movie \\"E.T.\\" are impressive, extraordinary, and quite unexpected considering their young age. This implies an admiration towards the young principal actors - Robert MacNaughton, Drew Barrymore, and Henry Thomas - for their outstanding contributions to the film. 2.

Which team had fewer runners with muscle weakness? Answer:","completion":"The Green team had fewer runners with muscle weakness. They ran the same distance as the Red team, but they did so in the cool morning weather. Cooler temperatures are generally more favorable for exercise, because they reduce the risk of excessive sweating and the subsequent loss of electrolytes. Lower rates of electrolyte deficiency can result in fewer incidences of health problems such as muscle weakness, as compared to the Red team who ran in the heat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: It is common for a person who feels fearful to be anxious about uncertain outcomes. This is a struggle because no situation can promise 100% certainty. Therefore, you must learn to become more comfortable with it. Uncertainty is an unavoidable part of your day-to-day life. How you respond to it is where you can make a change. One method would be to act “as if” you are comfortable with uncertainty. First, examine the things you do to avoid uncertainty just to feel more certain. Write down your answers to the following questions: Do you double and triple-check most of the things you do? Do you avoid events or procrastinate a lot? Do you need excessive amounts of reassurance from others? Do you need an abundance of information before making even small decisions? Next, identify the situations in which you feel anxious about uncertainty, and what you do to feel less anxious. Rank the situations on a scale of 1-10 with 10 being the highest level of anxiety, and 1 being the lowest. Next, start with the least anxiety-provoking activity and practice acting “as if” you were tolerant of uncertainty. For example, you could go to a movie without checking the crime rate in the area. Finally, keep a written record of your results. Ask yourself what you did, whether it was harder or easier than anticipated, whether everything turned out well, and how you adapted if it didn’t turn out as you had planned. Writing these things down will help you see the improvements you make and the way to change your behavior. You are stronger than you think. You will continue to improve your coping skills as you successfully deal with challenges. For example, take notice of the way you effectively cope with another type of fear in your life and apply the same technique. Also, observe how someone you admire copes with difficult situations. Ask them for suggestions that you can implement. Following a problem solving model will provide you a structure for creating change. You have identified your fear and associated emotions and now you must determine clear objectives, implement them, make adjustments as needed and monitor your progress. One objective may be that you set a schedule and keep a log of how much time you spend worrying about making it safely to school, work or the store. Self-monitoring leads to real change. You can examine your behaviors and develop ways to change them. It is important to keep the information you hear from others and the media in perspective. If you inundate yourself with negative thoughts and information, it will skew your perception of reality. Pause and think clearly and you will realize that the chances of the same crime happening again or even at all, are minuscule. When you're tempted to believe that the chances of getting murdered are increasing, stop and ask yourself something like: Are they really? And why do I think that? Are those facts credible? Taking the time to question your thoughts can break the cycle of being obsessed with them. Personal struggles can leave you feeling bad about yourself. Unfortunately, since feeling fearful involves worrying, you may be worrying that you are worrying too much. Anxiety and worry are a natural part of life, and you can learn to manage it rather than try to eliminate it or feel bad about yourself because of it. The cognitive behavior therapy you may be participating in will help you examine your thoughts and develop new, more effective ways of thinking about yourself as well as helping you manage anxiety and worry. Inhibitions are feelings that make you self-conscious and unable to act in a relaxed and natural way. In order to let go of what is holding you back you must feel safe with yourself, your surroundings and the people around you. Let go by rediscovering your playful side. As they say: laughter is the best medicine. When you play and laugh it increases feelings of freedom, which allows you to feel less anxious and worried. Play and laughter will help you remain positive and optimistic through difficult situations and has been shown to be healing. Schedule regular sessions of play on the calendar: meet with friends; play with children; host events that you enjoy; go with a friend to play golf, or bowl or sing karaoke. Most importantly, surround yourself with playful people.

Do any other animals feel empathy? Scientists recently found that rats do, too. Most people don't like rats. In many people's eyes, rats are only bad. But Jean Decety and his partners at the University of Chicago did an experiment. It showed that rats are kind, warm-hearted animals. They can feel each other's pain. Scientists placed pairs of rats in plastic cages for two weeks. During this time they got to know each other. Then they put one of the rats from each pair into a small container in the cages. The small container had a door. It was so designed as to fall to the side when the free rat touched it. Many of the trapped rats squeaked to show their discomfort. The other rats of the pairs could see their suffering friends clearly. In most pairs, the free rats would become very worried about their friends. They kept trying to save their friends again and again throughout the month. Scientists put the rats' favorite chocolate in the cages, but the rats didn't eat it until they had saved their friends successfully. Scientists also found that female rats seemed to act more empathetic than male rats. \\"The results are the first to show that rats take action in response to another's trouble,\\" Decety said. \\"Monkeys and chimpanzees have similar behavior.

Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first Eurovision semi-final.Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when Elisabeth Andreassen failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career. The introduction of weekly semi-finals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in Swedish. A CD of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a DVD of the semi-finals and final since 2003. Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as Anne-Lie Rydé, Tommy Körberg, and Lisa Nilsson. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including Baccara, Alannah Myles, Katrina Leskanich, and Cornelis Vreeswijk. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision. While local success for Melodifestivalen winners is common, most contestants return to obscurity and few have major international success. The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, \\"Symfonin\\" by Loa Falkman, topped the Swedish singles chart. The most recent occurrence was 2016 with Samir &...

During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly. The sniper sees Matthews and fires, injuring Matthews in the left shoulder as he crawled towards the wall, but a second shot kills him.","completion":"The full names of the people who wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear are U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews and Sergeant Allen Isaac."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

An aristocrat is fighting her neighbour's plans to build a vast cinema and games room underneath their £3.6m home in an exclusive street in north London. Pamela, Countess Listowel, 77, says rows over people digging 'mega-basements' beneath their homes are dividing the usually friendly community in a conservation area in Hampstead, where dozens have signed a petition against the application. She is one of 58 people to have objected to Camden council over the application by Iyabode Abiola to undertake extensive excavations beneath her Victorian house. Lady Listowel is one of dozens of locals objecting to a proposed basement in the smart north London street (file picture) Architects' plans submitted to Camden Council show the scale of the planned basement at Mrs Abiola's house. Lady Listowel, the widow of the 5th Earl of Listowel, William Francis Hare, said: 'It is sad that there is a row over the application as everyone usually gets on around here. 'These sorts of basements are being built all over Hampstead, but it's a conservation area and it's not in keeping with the street.' Mrs Abiola bought the house, which is close to Hampstead Heath, three years ago. Neighbours said the owners, whom they believed to be Nigerian, owned several properties in the UK and were not often at the house. An initial application featured plans to build a swimming pool under the house but was rejected by Camden Council in 2011. The new plans incorporate a basement that would extend under the house and into the garden. Neighbour Oliver Froment, 63, said he was concerned his house might collapse if Mrs Abiola's basement were built, and said it had happened in several similar cases in Hampstead. He told the Daily Telegraph: 'People are just trying to show off by building bigger and deeper, with no consideration for the character of the area or the people who live there.' Mrs Abiola's £3.6m house is in an expensive street in a conservation area near Hampstead Heath, pictured. Mr Froment, who works in financial services, has hired an independent expert who said he was concerned about the impact of the proposed works. Camden Council's Valerie Leach said: 'It is essential that the views of residents are taken into account and at present we have received a number of objections and reports that are being reviewed to ensure that planning officers can make a recommendation on the application.' Rows over vast basements are becoming increasingly common in London, where space is at a premium. Last month it emerged that a Labour peer was suing his neighbour for 'trespass' over his newly-dug basement, claiming that it went underneath his own property. Lord Mitchell claimed his Hampstead neighbour Daphne Gillian Singer had undertaken 'hidden' works by digging up a courtyard next to both of their homes. He and his wife have lodged a writ at the High Court and are seeking up to £200,000 in damages after Ms Singer allegedly built walls beneath his property without consent. Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik boasts London's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool under his Kensington home. Earlier this year a Russian businessman renovated his mansion in London's Kensington to include a pool in the basement which is believed to be the capital's only indoor/outdoor swimming pool. Leonard Blavatnik, who is Britain's second-richest man, built the 25m pool underneath his home in Kensington Palace Gardens, which is London's most expensive street. His basement also boasts a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine-cellar, and 'multi-storey' underground car park. Estate agents said Mr Blavatnik's property, which is yards from Kensington Palace, could be worth £200m after the tycoon undertook a massive renovation on the 13-bedroom, Grade II*-listed house. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This article focuses on a dispute in north London, involving Pamela, the Countess Listowel, and her neighbour's plans to build an extensive basement beneath their £3.6 million home. The Countess, one of 58 objectors to the scheme, has raised concerns over the impact of the proposed 'mega-basement' in the conservation area of Hampstead, warning that this and similar excavations are causing significant discord in what she describes as an otherwise friendly community. The plans, pitched to Camden council by the house's owner, Iyabode Abiola, entail vast excavations to create a cinema and games room under her Victorian residence. Abiola had previously proposed an underground swimming pool, but that was declined by the council back in 2011. The present plans include an extension under the house and into the garden, which has fuelled anxieties over potential structural damage to neighbouring houses. One such neighbour, Oliver Froment, has hired an independent expert to investigate these concerns. The property, near Hampstead Heath, was bought by Mrs. Abiola three years ago. Neighbours have commented that the primary owners, thought to be Nigerian, have several UK properties and are rarely at this specific house. Proposals for 'mega-basements' have become increasingly common in London, due to the lack of space combined with the desire for larger and more indulgent homes. The article also highlights that this is not an isolated incident, pointing out a complaint made by Lord Mitchell against his Hampstead neighbour for 'trespass,' as a new basement intruded under his property. Writs have been lodged in the High Court for over £200,000 in damages in this case. The piece concludes with the story of Russian tycoon Leonard Blavatnik's unique basement renovation, which included London's only known indoor/outdoor swimming pool in his Kensington Palace Gardens home. The posh property also features a hot tub, gym, massage room, cinema, wine cellar, and a 'multi-storey' underground car park. The renovation is estimated to have increased the property's value to approximately £200m. In summation, the dispute in Hampstead signifies a wider concern over the trend of 'mega-basements' in London's upscale neighbourhoods, with many residents seeing them as a threat to architectural integrity and community peace. The local authorities stress the importance of considering residents' objections and keeping the historical and aesthetic value of the conservation area intact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The lives of the crew and the loss of the bomber depends on the skill and training provided for the navigator who represents a \\"weak link\\" in the crew.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the individual known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies? , can you please find it? Pod was released in the UK on May 29, 1990 by 4AD. Watts-Russell planned the date to be not too close to the release of the Pixies' Bossanova two and a half months later, for more effective publicity of both albums. Watts-Russell believed the album would be better suited to a US independent distribution label rather than the Pixies' American distributor Elektra, and licensed Pod to Rough Trade America. When this division of Rough Trade went bankrupt, Elektra assumed distribution of Pod in the US. Deal has noted that the Breeders did not receive any royalties from initial US sales because of Rough Trade's bankruptcy.The album was widely anticipated by the British music press due to the involvement of Deal and Donelly—known from their highly regarded work with the Pixies and Throwing Muses, respectively—and Albini, who likewise had a strong reputation for his previous engineering work. It reached number 22 in the UK, where it was promoted by a full-page ad in Melody Maker, and number 73 in the Netherlands. Pod sold moderately well, although Deal has noted it \\"never sold [anything]\\" compared to their next album, Last Splash (1993), which was certified platinum in the US and silver in the UK.Deal took the idea for the album's title from a painting that she saw in Boston; for her, the word \\"pod\\" evoked a uterus, which Wiggs has noted relates to the theme of fertility and the group's name. The cover art was designed by longtime 4AD album designer Vaughan Oliver and employs photography by Kevin Westenberg. Oliver, in an attempt to seduce Deal, whom he believed would appreciate the humor, attached a belt of dead eels over his underwear, which he intended as phallic symbols. He performed a fertility dance, while Westenberg took pictures of him using a long exposure to achieve the blurring and other visual effects.

What is the proper response to having your butt slapped by a stranger in public? How can I make my father stop slapping my butt? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"The proper response to having your butt slapped by a stranger in public: Step 1: Regain composure and assess the situation without escalating it. It's important not to overreact but to remain calm and collected. Step 2: Clearly and firmly tell the person that their behavior is inappropriate and unwanted. This might be enough to put an end to the behavior and make them think twice before doing it to someone else. Step 3: If the person continues to be a threat or harass you, consider calling for help or alerting someone nearby. Your safety is the top priority. Step 4: After the situation has been resolved or you have left the vicinity, consider reporting the incident to law enforcement or the establishment's management, depending on the location. How can I make my father stop slapping my butt? Step 1: Find an appropriate time and place to discuss the issue privately with your father. Avoid addressing this in public or when either of you is upset or emotional. Step 2: Clearly and calmly express your feelings, and explain why you don't want your father to continue this behavior. Be honest and share any discomfort or negative emotions it causes you. Step 3: Offer alternatives for ways your father can show affection, support, or playful interaction without invading your personal boundaries. Step 4: Be prepared to maintain your stance, even if your father initially resists or dismisses your concerns. Remain calm and assertive, and reiterate your request as needed.

Steak at the Heart of Capitalism The Wall Street Journal published an article with the words \\"Meat Casino\\" in the headline this week, so at first I just naturally assumed it was a profile of one of Chipotle's suppliers.But it's really about price volatility in the live-cattle futures market. As far as literary criticism, the only gripe I have with this piece on the Meat Casino is that the phrase \\"high-steaks bets\\" is nowhere to be found. It makes one wonder if they left their brains in their other cargo shorts over at the Journal. Anyway, as you can see below, volatility in futures markets makes the Meat Casino as wild as it was during the financial crisis: Price swings in the cattle futures market have some calling it the Meat Casino Note: Historical volatility shows annualized standard deviation of price changes for the 20 and 100 most recent trading days. Compared, for example, with a stock market, where the current volatility makes the action look less like a casino and more like bingo night at the retirement home: Suppressed volatility in the S&P 500 has some worried of a calm before the storm Note: Historical volatility shows annualized standard deviation of price changes for the 20 and 100 most recent trading days. And a spike in prices over recent years should catch the attention of beef eaters everywhere: Front-month live cattle futures are almost 36 percent below their peak two years ago If you've read anything about markets in the past few years, you probably already know where people who have a beef with these price swings are pointing fingers: those flashy boys in the electronic trading world. The Meat Casino is entirely an electronic affair now. CME Group closed all the remaining pits last year, severely limiting the available opportunities for traders to wear cool cowhide print sportcoats. But the machines had taken over almost all the trading long before that. In addition to all the big banks, the list of the electronic casino's blackjack dealers is dotted with the legends of the electronic pits, from Jump Trading to Dorman to KCG to Timber Hill.Yet it's hard to picture the Chicago pits as some sort of victim of the shift to electronic trading because they were also some of the main spawning grounds of the new breed of data-center outcriers, as chronicled in this great Matt Leising obit of the pits from last year. In fact, Jump was named in honor of the jumping around that traders did in the open outcry pits.Anyway, if there's one thing I love, it's a story about \\"the pits,\\" even if they are now just a bunch of stacks of computer servers in a data center, not the mosh pits of capitalism made famous in movies like \\"Trading Places.\\" Mainly, for some reason, I like stories about trading in commodities I can eat. (Another recent such article was Whitney McFerron's scoop that the U.S. was sitting on a \\"mountain of cheese.\\" Maybe it's just the suburban Philadelphian in me, but I can't help but think that if we moved the Meat Casino next to Cheese Mountain, we'd only be some Amoroso's rolls and fried onions away from the Promised Land.)So with price swings this meaty, the Trade of the Week obviously is doubling down on the steak at the heart of capitalism in the Meat Casino. The runner-up award goes to Eve Plum, aka Jan Brady, who USA Today tells us sold the 55,000 Malibu dream house she bought during the great Brady Bunch bubble of 1969 for a cool 3.9 million. On the back of my envelope, that gives her a compounded annual growth rate of about 9.5 percent, and that's just the sort of middle-sister index-like return that's trendy these days.

Question: Given the following context: Since 1991, the anniversary of the massacre has been designated the National Day of Remembrance and Action on Violence Against Women, intended as a call to action against discrimination against women. A White Ribbon Campaign was launched in 1991 by a group of men in London, Ontario, in the wake of the massacre, for the purpose of raising awareness about the prevalence of male violence against women, with the ribbon symbolizing \\"the idea of men giving up their arms.\\" Commemorative demonstrations are held across the country each year on December 6 in memory of the slain women and numerous memorials have been built. The Place du 6-Décembre-1989 in the Côte-des-Neiges/Notre-Dame-de-Grâce borough of Montreal was created as a memorial to the victims of the massacre. Located at the corner of Decelles Avenue and Queen Mary Road, a short distance from the university, it includes the art installation Nef pour quatorze reines (Nave for Fourteen Queens) by Rose-Marie Goulet. It is the site of annual commemorations on December 6.A memorial erected in Vancouver sparked controversy because it was dedicated to \\"all women murdered by men\\", which critics say implies all men are potential murderers. As a result, women involved in the project ironically received death threats and the Vancouver Park Board subsequently banned any future memorials that might \\"antagonize\\" other groups.The event has also been commemorated through references in television, theatre, and popular music. A play about the shootings by Adam Kelly called The Anorak was named as one of the best plays of 2004 by the Montreal Gazette. Colleen Murphy's play \\"December Man\\" was first staged in Calgary in 2007 The movie Polytechnique, directed by Denis Villeneuve was released in 2009, and sparked controversy over the desirability of reliving the tragedy in a commercial film.

They are guitar-fronted and have experimented with different genres, including folk, electronica, world music and indie rock. The band were given the opening slot on 2006's V Festival after winning a competition. They subsequently released two EPs and their debut single \\"Evening/Morning\\". In September 2010 the band began working on their third studio album, returning to electric guitars following acoustic recordings for Flaws. On 7 June 2011, Zane Lowe revealed on BBC Radio 1 that their new album would be called A Different Kind of Fix. He also said that he would be playing a new song from the album, entitled \\"Shuffle\\", on 22 June before its release as a single the following day. The single reached #69 in the charts. The album was released on 29 August 2011 and included 12 tracks. \\"Beg\\" rounded off the album as its final release on 9 July 2012. The track failed to make the original physical version of the album but was available as a bonus track on the digital version.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What was the goal of the partition?\\" is in \\"The pro-decolonisation Labour government, elected at the 1945 general election and led by Clement Attlee, moved quickly to tackle the most pressing issue facing the empire: that of Indian independence. India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress and the Muslim League—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented. Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions. Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 1948. When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947. The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan. Millions of Muslims subsequently crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives. Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948.

Brett does not believe in owning guns, while Eric does, so","completion":"their conversations about gun control have always been impassioned and thought-provoking. Both Brett and Eric grew up in rural areas and were exposed to firearms at a young age. However, their experiences and beliefs regarding gun ownership have diverged significantly over the years. Brett, a firm believer in non-violence, had negative experiences involving guns in his youth that fostered a deep dislike for firearms. When he was twelve, a close friend was accidentally shot during a hunting trip, leaving a lasting impression upon him. As he grew older, his conviction only strengthened that guns should not be in the hands of civilians. Brett advocates for stricter gun control laws, mandatory background checks, and comprehensive regulations on firearm sales. He believes that reducing the number of guns in circulation will create safer communities overall. Eric, on the other hand, grew up in a family that embraced gun ownership and the Second Amendment. His parents taught him responsible firearm use and safety practice from a young age. Eric believes that owning a gun is a fundamental right, as long as individuals can demonstrate responsible use and understanding of firearm safety. He also thinks that gun ownership provides protection against potential threats and contributes to self-sufficiency. To Eric, responsible law-abiding citizens should not have to sacrifice their rights due to the actions of criminals and those who misuse firearms. Despite their stark differences in opinion, Brett and Eric maintain a respectful dialogue on the topic of gun control. They both understand that open communication and exchange of ideas are essential for reaching a common ground. One day, they decided to organize a public forum in their local community center, inviting other residents to join the discussion. This platform allowed them to engage with various perspectives, deepening their understanding of the complexities surrounding gun control. During the forum, they invited experts and representatives from both sides of the debate. Some shared personal anecdotes illustrating the dangers of unregulated gun ownership, while others explained how firearms have saved lives during emergencies. The event highlighted the importance of mental health support, those who might be prone to violence, and the need for effective law enforcement. As the forum progressed, both Brett and Eric recognized that the issue of gun control is not a one-dimensional problem. They acknowledged that any solution to this multifaceted issue must consider several factors, including the culture, geography, socio-economic environment, and personal experiences of those involved. The forum marked a significant moment for them as they began to empathize with each other's perspectives. While Brett and Eric remain staunch in their initial beliefs, their conversations have evolved over time. Now, they focus on exploring potential avenues to achieve the same goal: ensuring that their communities are safe and secure. Both agree that although they may continue to disagree on aspects of gun control, it is crucial to work together as they strive to find common ground in the best interest of everyone. Their journey reflects the importance of keeping an open mind and engaging in constructive conversation when dealing with divisive issues. Brett and Eric may not have changed each other's core beliefs regarding gun ownership, but they have fostered an environment where opposing views can be shared and understood. Their story reminds us that despite our differences, civil discourse and mutual respect are the bedrock of a healthy and functioning society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery - They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery - Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more teenagers become adults happens, how will it affect more urine is passed to the bladder. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned is based on the assumption that a higher number of teenagers becoming adults would potentially lead to an increase in urine production and transfer to the bladder. It's important to first understand the factors affecting urine production to determine if the proposed perturbation has any direct or indirect influence on the kidney's processes. Urine production and its transfer to the bladder are primarily influenced by factors such as fluid intake, diet, overall health, and kidney function, rather than age transition from teenage to adulthood. While it's possible that certain lifestyle changes may accompany the transition from adolescence to adulthood, these changes may not directly affect urine production or the process of urine being passed to the bladder. That being said, it is important to highlight that in general, as teenagers become adults, they may experience changes in their bodies due to growth and development. This may lead to an increase in total body mass, which could require the kidneys to filter a larger volume of blood per unit time. However, this increase would not be solely driven by the transition but other factors like growth, diet, and lifestyle. Additionally, it's worth noting that any effect on urine production due to life-stage transitions would occur on an individual basis. Since personal habits, lifestyle, and health conditions may vary across different individuals, it may not be appropriate to make generalizations about urine production as teenagers become adults. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation hypothesis does not have a clear direct or indirect effect on urine production and its transfer to the bladder. Factors like fluid intake, diet, overall health, and kidney function play a more significant role in determining urine production and transfer than the age transition from teenage to adulthood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This comes after a year-long study tracking where 23 patients in northern Mecklenburg County lived, worked and went to school. Uveal melanoma patients aren’t just students at Hopewell High School or residents of Huntersville. A geospatial study of the eyes of cancer patients in a northern part of Mecklenburg County found that a group of patients lived close to the border of Huntersville and Cornelius. Beyond this, scientist John Cassels didn’t find other patterns. “Nothing directly attributed to the cause of Uveal melanoma at this time,\\" he said. Huntersville commissioned Cassels to compare environmental issues like water, air and sites with chemicals near where the patients lived to see if there were any risk factors. Over the last several years, 23 people who at one time lived in Mecklenburg County have been diagnosed with the disease. Many of them young women. The disease affects about 2,500 people a year in the U.S. - many of them are older. >>Stay informed: Sign up for The Frequency newsletter and get WFAE headlines in your inbox every weekday.<< In 2015, the state looked into the Mecklenburg County cases and found the incidence of uveal melanoma wasn’t higher than expected. But that hasn’t deterred Kenny Colbert from trying to figure out what is going on. His daughter Kenan fought the disease for five years, but died at the age of 28 in 2014. He said that even though he's disappointed in the results, he's not surprised. “This just means we need to regroup and I don’t know what Plan B is,\\" Colbert said. \\"But this means we need to go to Plan B and Plan C and Plan D because the answer is out there somewhere if we keep digging.\\" Genetic testing ruled out a familial link. Doctors at Columbia University will be testing tumors of diagnosed patients. Huntersville town commissioners suggested starting a committee to continue researching the unusual cancer cases. Multiple cases of the same type of rare eye cancer were found in Auburn, Alabama, and Colbert thinks the two towns should work together to see if there are any links. ||||| Ocular melanoma, an extremely rare form of eye cancer, is being disproportionately diagnosed among young women in two Southern towns. Doctors do not know why these cases are confined to these cities, and efforts to raise funding to better study the mystery have so far been unsuccessful. In Auburn, Alabama, with about 60,000 residents, the only common trend between the 33 known cases of ocular melanoma is that every individual either lived or worked in the city between 1980 and the early 1990s, Healthline reported Monday. Of these, 31 were former students at Auburn University, a Facebook page on the phenomena reported. In Huntersville, North Carolina, with about 54,000 residents, the only connection in another 18 cases is having lived, worked or spent a large amount of time in the town since 2000. There are more cases of ocular melanoma in Alabama than any other U.S. state, WLTZ reported. Doctors do not believe the cases are a coincidence. Jason Redmond/AFP/Getty Images According to the National Institute of Health, ocular melanoma is a type of cancer that affects eye cells, beginning in the middle layer of the eye called the uvea. It is more common in older individuals and those with fairer skin tones and blue or green eyes. Signs of the condition include blurred vision, seeing floaters in your eyes or developing dark spots on the iris. The condition is also more common in men than women. Related: Why elephants don’t get cancer—and what that means for humans See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows But in the Southern cases, most of the patients are women, and they are typically younger in age. In February, Alabama Senator Larry Stutts attempted to get 100,000 in state funding to back research into the eye cancer cluster. The proposal was denied. Auburn University, the alma mater of many of the current patients, also refused to fund research into the cluster, WLTZ reported. The university, however, will lead a committee to find out why so many people associated with Auburn have been diagnosed with the cancer. Despite the recent setbacks in funding, there are other measures being taken to help identify why this problem is affecting so many Alabama and North Carolina residents. An ongoing study at Columbia University in New York is analyzing tissue from patients who have died or lost an eye to the cancer, The Charlotte Observer reported. Meanwhile, a state backed analysis is mapping patients’ entire lives in an attempt to find similarities. Carolinas HealthCare Systems has also offered free genetic counseling to residents in Huntersville to see if there is a genetic predisposition to the disease. ||||| Ocular melanoma, also known as uveal melanoma, is a very rare type of cancer. Each year, only 2,500 people — or about 5 in 1 million — receive a diagnosis with this type of eye cancer. That statistic is exactly why two small towns — Huntersville, North Carolina, and Auburn, Alabama — are such anomalies. Both towns are associated with a high number of ocular melanoma (OM) cases. Researchers want to know why. “We see patients from all over the country and some patients from outside of the country. Certainly if we have patients who know each other or who lived and grew up in the same town, that has been kind of a red flag for us in trying to figure out if there’s something else going on,” said Dr. Marlana Orloff, an oncologist at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia who specializes in the treatment and study of OM. Take Auburn, for example. The town of 63,000 people is in a state of just under 5 million people. It’s home to one of Alabama’s largest universities, Auburn University. Thirty-three people with connections to the town or university have received diagnoses of OM. The main common thread between them seems to be that they all lived or worked in the town between 1980 and the early 1990s. Huntersville, a small town north of Charlotte, is slightly smaller, with a population of almost 55,000. But 18 people who lived, worked, or spent substantial amounts of time in the town since 2000 have received diagnoses of OM. As the number of cases continues to grow in these areas, so does the interest in people who’ve developed the cancer — and, perhaps more importantly, what they all have in common. What is ocular melanoma? According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, OM is the most common primary cancer of the eye in adults. The cancer develops in the cells that produce the eye’s pigment. It can also develop on the conjunctiva, the mucus membrane that cover the eye and line the eyelid. Most eye melanomas develop in a part of the eye you can’t see. The early stages of the cancer rarely cause any signs or symptoms. That’s why you might not be able to spot this type of melanoma the way you might a freckle or unusual mole on your skin. However, people may spot warning signs of the cancer as it grows. Symptoms of OM include blurry or distorted vision, a blind spot in your vision, seeing “flashing” lights, or a dark spot in your field of vision. As the cancer progresses, you may notice that the shape of your pupil changes. A dark spot or “freckle” may develop on the iris. “Sometimes it will get picked up on a routine eye exam. Other times, patients will be having symptoms, often symptoms of a retinal detachment,” Orloff said. “They go to an eye doctor, they get referred to a retinal specialist, and then ultimately to an ocular oncologist who makes the diagnosis.” Ocular Melanoma Foundation statistics identify 55 years of age as the median age for an OM diagnosis. Those two facts alone make the cases in Huntersville and Auburn even more unique. In both towns, women have received diagnoses more frequently, Orloff says, and all of the individuals with OM have been younger, well below the median age of a typical diagnosis. Social networks spread awareness In 2001, Allyson Allred, an Auburn University graduate living in Hoover, Alabama, received an OM diagnosis. A year earlier, she told AL.com, Allred was sent a prayer request for an Auburn alum — and a woman who had lived in the same dorm as she during their freshman and sophomore years at the school — who had been diagnosed with this same rare cancer. When Allred received her diagnosis, she reached out to the woman, and they connected over the shared diagnosis. Eleven years later, in 2012, another woman with connections to Auburn and the same dorm joined their circle. While these three women bonded and helped one another through the ups and downs of the disease, across town and unbeknownst to them, another Auburn alum was fighting his own OM battle. Mark McWilliams, a 1994 and 1995 graduate of Auburn University, received a diagnosis of OM in 2011 at the age of 38. The Birmingham, Alabama, architect started experiencing vision problems in his right eye and went for an exam. That’s when his doctors discovered the cancer. “He had some sort of wave or distortion in his vision,” said Susan McWilliams, Mark McWilliams’ wife. The couple, who met as part of a supper club, started dating after his initial diagnosis. “He knew there was something weird about the vision in the right eye. We were all just stunned.” McWilliams was referred to Wills Eye Hospital and Dr. Takami Sato, director of the metastatic uveal melanoma program at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, both in Philadelphia. Orloff joined Sato after McWilliams was a patient. Under Sato’s treatment, McWilliams received plaque radiation, the standard treatment for this type of cancer. A few short months later, doctors told him the cancer was gone. However, they also warned him — and genetic tests confirmed — the likelihood of recurrence was high. “Most of the treatments are very effective at preventing the tumor from coming back in the eye,” Orloff said. “But what we see is there’s a good portion for patients who may recur with disease notably in their liver at some point down the line.” According to research from the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, half of all people with OM ultimately develop metastatic cancer and find new lesions in their body outside of the eye. Indeed, McWilliams found new cancerous spots on his liver, a year and a half after his first diagnosis. “We were going along, fighting it, and the whole family was doing research on it,” Susan said. “If we hadn’t had the doctors in Philadelphia, he might not have lived six months. We fought very hard for a few more years of life.” McWilliams died due to OM in 2014. Since his death, Mark’s parents, as well as Susan, have been involved with OM awareness groups. They hope to help patients and families learn about the cancer, including meeting with people from Auburn who may be impacted by the same disease that took Mark. “It seems like this is the thing they have in common,” Susan said. “It seems like that very much, but of course, they all came from different places, have now gone to different places. The higher the numbers get, really, it seems uncanny.” Orloff understands that concern. “If you have a bunch of people who went to the same university over a relatively short period of time, it would be abnormal for a lot of leukemia cases,” she said. “When you’re talking about more common cancers like breast cancer or lung cancer, they’re certainly more common, but when you’re talking about a rare cancer, it certainly raises a red flag.” Research holds the keys to understanding Orloff says Auburn and Huntersville are the only two towns or locations where researchers have found an increased incidence, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t more. “Just because of the rare nature of the disease, you wouldn’t expect people to know five or six people within their small group of friends who have this disease,” she said. That’s in part why she and other OM organizations are working to raise awareness — and funds — for research. Last April, Huntersville received a 100,000 grant from the North Carolina state legislature to begin studying possible causes of OM. Dr. Michael Brennan, a retired ophthalmologist in nearby Burlington, is helping spearhead the group. He works closely with the University of North Carolina, Duke University, and both Orloff and Sato at Jefferson in Philadelphia, according to The Charlotte Observer. The group’s first target for research was environmental exposures and genetic traits. Findings from these studies are set to be released this summer. As word about the Auburn University-related group spread north, some of these researchers also ventured down to meet with concerned former alumni, parents, and others. At their first meeting in February of this year, the researchers recorded information for people they met. They cast a wide net to hopefully discover more people who may have been impacted by this cancer but left the city or school years ago. “These cases aren’t always picked up accurately [by a cancer registry], especially because people are often diagnosed outside of the state,” Orloff said. “In Auburn and in North Carolina, it was a lot of younger women. They went to high school or college there. They could now be living somewhere else. For the sake of the cancer registry, although these people lived in the state for that narrow window of time, they weren’t diagnosed there, so they’d fall out of the calculation.” That, Orloff says, is a big target they’re aiming to correct. It begins with getting the word out about the rare cancer and the possible connections to these two small towns. Last month, an Alabama state senator requested 100,000 so research could begin for the Auburn-related cases, but the funding was denied. However, that’s not stopping Dr. Fred Kam, the executive medical director of Auburn University Medical Clinic. Kam was instrumental in bringing researchers from North Carolina and Philadelphia to the town. He’s also helping establish a committee to investigate and lobby for funding. “The committee’s initial goal will be to lobby for and apply to reputable national entities, such as the CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention], NIH [National Institutes of Health], or National Cancer Institute, to fund and be involved in a study looking for a cause if we have an increased incidence,” Kam said. “We also hope to bring knowledge and expertise in scientifically approaching and helping obtain answers to questions this cohort of people may have, from genetics to environment, causation, treatment, and prevention,” he said. Both groups have a presence on social media, which has helped several new cases come to their attention. In fact, the Auburn Ocular Melanoma Page on Facebook helped the group connect to more than a dozen individuals with the rare cancer just after going live in early 2018. The Huntersville Ocular Melanoma Cancer Cluster page on Facebook also shares updates and relevant information for people with OM and those interested in learning more. For now, Kam says, people with a connection to the university or anyone worried about their potential risk for OM should continue to have routine eye exams. ||||| Efforts Underway to Find Research Funding for Auburn University Ocular Melanoma Cases Share This Story: Twitter Facebook Linkedin More 1/1 Courtesy: Auburn Ocular Melanoma FB page We shared the story of Ashley McCrary. An Auburn University graduate who was diagnosed with a rare eye cancer, Ocular Melanoma. Doctors from Philadelphia and North Carolina came to Auburn in February to see if there’s a connection. Since then, 31 people have come forward, who attended or worked at Auburn University, from 1980 to the early 1990s, diagnosed with Ocular Melanoma. There are also more cases of Ocular Melanoma in Alabama than any other state in the United States. Now, they are trying to find some funding to do research on the rare eye cancer. It first started at the state level. Alabama State Senator Larry Stutts tried to pass 100,000 through the education budget. The legislature failed to approve the money. They suggested Auburn University to take it on. They will not be funding it as well. Senator Stutts said he’s not going to give up on this and make sure the University follows through. “My efforts in the State Senate is to make sure the issue doesn’t get pushed to the back burner and legitimate research is conducted and there will be the funding to do so. I met with representatives from Auburn University last week and I’m confident they will step up and ensure this goes through,” said Sen. Stutts. Dr. Frederick Kam, Executive Medical Director of Auburn University’s Medical Clinic, said he’ll lead a committee to find out why so many people in Auburn were diagnosed. “This is not a good type of cancer for a person to have. There’s no known cause, which makes it more challenging. So, I strongly believe and Auburn University strongly believes we need to be involved and help with the process because it’s the right thing to do and we will continue to pursue those efforts,” said Dr. Kam. They are in the process of forming a committee of physicians interested and knowledgeable about this cancer from UAB, to Philadelphia, even doctors at the state level, to North Carolina and here locally. “Then they are going to see when were these people here, what did they major in, where did they live, where did the work and then go forward from there,” said McCrary, who was diagnosed with Ocular Melanoma in 2012. McCrary will also be on this committee. “I think it’s gonna save lives and I hope we can find out information for treatment or a cure. It’s humbling to be a part of this and make a difference,” said McCrary. McCrary adds they are also working with Justin George, Alabama’s Director of Cancer Epidemiology. From there, they are going to see if the State Health Department, the Governor’s office, the CDC, National Cancer Institute or another entity will fund this research. “There’s no reason to cause any fear because we don’t know. We don’t know if there’s any causal factor for this type of cancer from the number of people that went to Auburn University, we don’t know. But, we want to help find out and if something did cause it let’s fix it. Let’s do something to make sure this doesn’t affect anyone else,” said McCrary. They are confident that the information they gather and the committee working on this, will finally bring some answers and the money they need to start the research. “I have a lot of confidence in the people who will join this committee and that it won’t fall through the cracks. We will get the funding we need. We just need to find out who it’s going to come from,” said McCrary. There are also studies going on in Huntersville, North Carolina and Albany, New York. Two other areas with high numbers of Ocular Melanoma. North Carolina has dedicated 100,000 to research the cases there. ||||| Jasmine H. Francis, MD, FACS* Alexander N. Shoushtari, MD** Christopher A. Barker, MD*** David H. Abramson, MD, FACS* *Ophthalmic Oncology Service **Melanoma and Immunotherapeutics Service ***Radiation Oncology Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center New York, NY Uveal melanoma, the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, represents approximately 5 percent of all melanomas recorded in the United States. The incidence of uveal melanoma has remained relatively constant, between five and six cases per million people in the United States and Europe.1 These melanomas vary in frequency depending on their location in the uveal tract: Approximately 5 percent occur in the iris, 5 percent in the ciliary body and at least 90 percent in the choroid. Choroidal, also called ciliochoroidal, melanoma, is the predominant form of the disease in the uveal tract, and the themes to be discussed here primarily concern that form of the disease. Uveal melanoma is most common among middle-aged Caucasians of European descent. Unlike cutaneous melanomas, uveal melanomas have no known association with ultraviolet (UV) light; nor is smoking believed to be a risk factor. However, we do know several obscure and controversial risk factors for the disease, including exposure to welding and use of L-dopa. Furthermore, the literature documents possible associations with melanosis oculi, neurofibromatosis, dysplastic nevus syndrome, myotonic dystrophy and BRCA-associated protein-1 (BAP-1) hereditary cancer syndrome.2 Females are typically diagnosed on routine ophthalmic exam, while males commonly present with visual symptoms and are subsequently found to have uveal melanoma. We can diagnose the disease clinically with a high degree of accuracy, so it does not warrant biopsy for diagnosis. Nonetheless, many centers perform biopsies to help determine prognosis based on molecular analysis of the tumor. Prognosis and Genetics Although 97 to 98 percent of patients with uveal melanoma have no evidence of metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis, and though the success rate for local treatment surpasses 90 percent, half of all patients ultimately develop metastatic disease. For this reason, there is great interest in narrowing in on prognosis for primary intraocular melanoma in patients with different risk profiles. This can be achieved with a limited degree of certainty. For instance, older and male patients are considered at higher risk for metastases. Uveal melanomas can also be divided by size, e.g., into small, medium and large, as was done by the Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study; increasing size portends a higher risk for developing metastases. Finally, tumors occurring in the ciliary body or with extraocular extension have a poorer prognosis. For tumors with adequate specimen (typically those that are enucleated), metastatic risk can be established with histopathological findings. For instance, epithelioid versus spindle cells are considered poorer prognosis. High mitotic index, increased lymphatic invasion and a diffuse infiltrating pattern are also considered higher-risk. Furthermore, microvascular networks or vasculogenic mimicry patterns have been identified in tumors with higher metastatic potential.3 Cytogenetics can further refine risk assessment for uveal melanoma.4 Many chromosomal and copy number alterations have been determined, including those on chromosomes 1, 6 and 8. Perhaps the most profound chromosomal alteration associated with poor prognosis in uveal melanoma is either a partial or complete loss of chromosome 3. This was confirmed with the discovery of somatic BAP1 mutations on the short arm of chromosome 3, which are present in the majority of higher-risk uveal melanomas.5 It has been theorized that BAP1 is essential for the preservation of melanocyte identity in uveal melanoma, and that depletion of BAP1 results in uveal melanomas assuming a stem-like cell phenotype. Unlike with cutaneous melanoma, the genetic aberrations in uveal melanoma are comparatively bland. Other mutations besides BAP1 mutations do exist and confer either a neutral or a relatively better prognosis. For instance, guanine nucleotide-binding protein, Q polypeptide (GNAQ) or alpha 11 (GNA11) encodes a G-protein alpha-subunit that mediates signals from G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) to the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway.6 Somatic mutations, most often mutually exclusive in either codon 183 or 209 of GNAQ or GNA11, have been revealed in a number of melanocytic neoplasms, including over 85 percent of uveal melanomas. Finally, about 15 percent of uveal melanomas are believed to have somatic mutations in SF3B1 and EIF1AX.7,8 An overwhelming majority of these mutations occur in disomy 3 tumors compared to monosomy 3 tumors and with a male patient predominance; these are associated with favorable prognostic features and better diagnosis. At the level of ribonucleic acids, a gene expression profile generated from only a few tumor cells can differentiate uveal melanoma into three classes: class Ia with a low risk of metastasis, class Ib with a risk of late metastasis and class II with a higher risk of metastasis.9 mRNA expression of PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen in melanoma) may be a prognostic biomarker for seemingly lower-risk tumors (class 1 or disomy 3). Regardless of the prognostication method, the dichotomous theory of risk we have outlined here has its limitations and does not fully consider clonal heterogeneity nor clonal evolution of an individual tumor. Treatment of Primary Uveal Melanoma The Collaborative Ocular Melanoma Study (COMS) was a multicenter randomized clinical trial with patient accrual spanning over a decade (1987 to 1998), and it has guided our present management of primary uveal melanoma.10 It revealed that small melanomas (<2.5/3.0 mm height, <16 mm diameter) could be managed with observation and were associated with a 5-year melanoma-specific mortality of 1 percent. Medium melanomas (2.5/3.0-10 mm height, <16 mm diameter) had equivalent melanoma-specific mortality if treated with either plaque brachytherapy or enucleation (complete removal of the eye), thus making either treatment option reasonable.11 Large melanomas (>10 mm height, >16 mm diameter) had equivalent melanoma-specific mortality if treated with enucleation either with or without preoperative external beam radiation (EBR); thus, preoperative EBR has since fallen out of favor.12 Our group at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center was the largest center in the COMS, and we led the trial of selumetinib (a targeted oral MEK inhibitor), the first study ever to demonstrate a benefit (in progression-free survival) for the treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma.17 Our center and others offer integrated programs utilizing the following treatments: Radiation Therapy Radiation therapy (RT) has been used to treat uveal melanoma since 1930.13 Today, approximately 75 to 85 percent of uveal melanomas are treated with radiotherapy, primarily in two forms: plaque brachytherapy and proton beam radiotherapy (teletherapy). Brachytherapy is more common, and refers to the application of a radioactive source near the tumor: The advantage is that the radiation is physically brought directly to the melanoma, and does not traverse healthy tissues and organs, thus enabling delivery of high-dose radiation to the tumor while limiting side effects. We attach the radioactive source to a shielding device (“plaque”) and secure it to the sclera during a surgical procedure; this stays in place for several days (3 to 7) while we deliver the desired dose of radiation (70-100 Gy). Teletherapy refers to the projection of radiation through space as a beam. Multiple photon beams produced by a linear accelerator or fixed radioactive sources can be directed to converge at the tumor in a procedure called “stereotactic radiosurgery.” Alternatively, a charged particle beam (particle teletherapy) can be directed at the tumor. The advantage of teletherapy is that tumors of any size or location are accessible. The total dose of radiation delivered during teletherapy may be divided into several “fractions” (usually 4 to 10) to maximize the therapeutic index of treatment. Several important randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the effect of RT for uveal melanoma. A study of 1,317 patients comparing enucleation of the eye to plaque brachytherapy in patients with medium-sized uveal melanoma found no difference in metastasis-free or overall survival.11 Local tumor recurrence occurred in 10 percent of the RT patients. Another study compared particle teletherapy to plaque brachytherapy, and reported higher rates of local control with the former, but found no difference in cause-specific or overall survival.14 In another study, based on the hypothesis that surgical manipulation of “large” uveal melanomas at the time of enucleation fostered metastatic spread, researchers undertook a controlled trial of 1,003 patients randomized to either neoadjuvant pre-enucleation teletherapy or no preoperative treatment. This study found no difference in metastasis-free or overall survival in patients receiving RT before surgery.12 In many instances, and using a variety of techniques, RT allows for effective destruction of the primary tumor, while preserving the eye and vision. Nevertheless, eye damage after RT is common, and important efforts are under way or planned to mitigate these effects through technique refinement and biologic modulation. A randomized study of two different radiation doses of teletherapy suggested that lower doses may produce fewer side effects and comparable cancer control rates.15 We need similar prospective studies of brachytherapy. As most long-term side effects of radiation are related to vascular and immunologic effects, we need to study the use of agents that modulate these processes. Early and ongoing studies suggest that agents such as bevacizumab and corticosteroids may be beneficial, but further study is necessary. Enucleation Enucleation had been the standard of care for uveal melanoma since the latter part of the 19th century. Following the results of COMS, this treatment method is now predominantly performed on large melanomas, while patients with medium tumors have a choice of two treatments that are identical for patient survival. An enucleation involves removing the globe (or eye) and optic nerve and retaining the surrounding orbital adnexal tissue (extraocular muscles, orbital fat, periosteum, cranial nerves, etc.). During the surgery, the six extraocular muscles are detached from the globe and the optic nerve is severed near its exit at the optic foramen. Once the eye is removed, a spherical orbital implant replaces it (various materials are available), and the conjunctiva and Tenon’s capsule are closed over this. Based on the surgical technique used, we may attach the extraocular muscles to the implant. A conformer, similar to a thick contact lens, is placed in the intrapalpebral fissure (the space between the eyelids) during the immediate postoperative period. Approximately four weeks after the surgery, we replace the conformer with a custom-made prosthesis, which is designed to cosmetically emulate the fellow normal eye. The prosthesis has optimal cosmesis in primary gaze, but may not move to the same degree as the fellow eye, particularly in extreme gazes. Other Treatments Less commonly used treatments for primary intraocular melanoma include local resection of the tumor, often combined with neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiation therapy. Lasers can also be used, possibly with dye or agent-enhancement, but this treatment is restricted by tumor size and location. Current Treatment of Metastatic Uveal Melanoma Historically, median overall survival (OS) for metastatic uveal melanoma has been estimated to be 6 to 12 months. More recent analyses have reported longer median OS of 17 to 20 months.16 In contrast to the recent OS benefits achieved with therapies for metastatic cutaneous melanoma, no prospective randomized trial of therapy for metastatic uveal melanoma has ever demonstrated an improvement in OS. The increases in reported median OS may be due to lead-time bias from active surveillance programs utilizing modern radiographic techniques. The recommended frontline approach for treatment of metastatic uveal melanoma remains clinical trial participation. The only systemic therapy to date that has shown efficacy in a randomized trial was the MEK inhibitor selumetinib, which improved PFS compared to investigator’s choice chemotherapy (HR: 0.46; 95% CI, 0.30-0.71; p < .001).17 The phase 3 registration trial randomized patients to dacarbazine with or without selumetinib. Unfortunately, the trial failed to meet its primary endpoint of improved PFS by blinded central radiology review.18 Given that there was no pure selumetinib arm, this trial could not confirm that MEK inhibition alone improves outcomes in metastatic UM, and it did not appear to improve PFS in conjunction with chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the trial serves as a model for future collaboration and proves that the timely completion of randomized, multinational trials is possible with this rare disease.

Facebook as a service has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we connect, communicate, and share information, but its significant user base does not automatically equate to a successful, sustainable business model. The challenges faced by Facebook in recent years, coupled with the scrutiny it has attracted, reveal some much-needed lessons for the tech industry. Primarily, the focus must shift from simply acquiring users to transforming these users into a reliable revenue stream. With over 2.7 billion active users, Facebook is undoubtedly a force to be reckoned with. However, its numerous controversies surrounding privacy issues, data breaches, and political manipulation have contributed to a growing sense of distrust among users, questioning the very foundation on which the platform relies. While advertising has been Facebook's primary source of income, recent global policy changes and user backlash against intrusive advertising methods have shaken the company's ability to rely solely on this revenue model. In light of these challenges, Facebook, as well as other tech companies, needs to reassess its strategy and consider innovative alternatives for generating income. For instance, the increasing popularity of e-commerce and digital transactions could provide opportunities for social media platforms to further monetize their services. Furthermore, the contrasting trajectories of Apple and Facebook are indicative of the need for businesses to continually invest in research and development. Apple has managed to stay ahead of the curve, with a suite of innovative products and a clear vision of customer needs. Facebook's struggle to redefine itself reflects the harsh reality that companies rooted in social interactions have a harder time adapting to a rapidly changing landscape. The fluctuating fortunes of tech giants like Facebook clearly demonstrate that a company cannot rely on its past achievements or popularity to guarantee future success. To maintain investor confidence and market relevance, a strong, adaptable, and well-defined business strategy is essential. Moreover, the stark consequences of failing to provide a substantive revenue model serve as a warning to young tech firms aspiring to go public: do not underestimate the importance of solid financial foundations and a proven track record. In an era of extreme market volatility and skepticism, Facebook's woes serve as a reminder that the tech industry is no longer a playground for reckless, unprofitable ventures. To succeed in this age of Dickensian realism, companies must reevaluate their strategies, prioritize innovation, and embrace adaptability. Only then can they hope to navigate the precarious balance between public sentiment and shareholder expectations and emerge victorious in the ever-evolving technological landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jsem si jistá, že jste už slyšeli o dietní abecedě. Translate to English English:","completion":"I am sure you have already heard about the dietary alphabet. The dietary alphabet is a way of referring to the various diets, eating habits, and nutritional approaches that are popular and prevalent in today's society, particularly among health-conscious individuals. These diets are often categorized by the first letter of their name or the primary food categories they focus on. Some examples of these diets are: A - Atkins Diet: A low-carbohydrate diet that emphasizes high protein and fat intake while limiting carbohydrates, especially from sugar, bread, and pasta. The main goal of the Atkins diet is to allow the body to burn stored fat for energy instead of relying on carbohydrates. B - Blood Type Diet: This diet suggests that individuals should eat foods and engage in exercise that are compatible with their blood type to achieve better health and weight management. For example, Type O individuals are encouraged to consume lean meats, fish, and vegetables and avoid grains, legumes, and dairy products. C - Clean Eating: Clean eating is not a specific diet plan but a general approach to choosing minimally processed, whole foods, and focusing on consuming fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. The goal is to improve overall health, energy levels, and maintain a healthy weight. D - DASH Diet: The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet is a balanced eating plan that aims to help lower high blood pressure and promote heart health. It emphasizes the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products while minimizing processed foods, saturated fat, and sodium intake. E - Elimination Diet: An elimination diet involves removing specific foods from your diet for a certain period to identify food sensitivities, allergies, or intolerances. This process helps you understand how your body reacts to certain ingredients and can lead you to make informed dietary choices to support better health and overall well-being. F - FODMAP Diet: The FODMAP (Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet is designed for individuals with Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) or other digestive disorders. It involves limiting foods that contain fermentable carbohydrates known to cause gastrointestinal discomfort, bloating, and other IBS symptoms. G - Gluten-Free Diet: A gluten-free diet is essential for people diagnosed with celiac disease or those with non-celiac gluten sensitivity. This diet eliminates gluten-containing foods, including wheat, barley, and rye, and usually replaces them with gluten-free alternatives made from rice, potato, or other gluten-free grains. H - High-Protein Diet: A high-protein diet focuses on consuming more protein to increase metabolism, build strength, and support muscle growth. Such diets include lean meats, fish, dairy products, legumes, and protein powders as staple components. I - Intermittent Fasting: Intermittent fasting is an eating pattern that involves alternating periods of fasting and eating. This can be done in various ways, such as the 16/8 method (fasting for 16 hours and eating in an 8-hour window) or alternate-day fasting. The goal of intermittent fasting is generally improved metabolic health, weight loss, and cellular regeneration. These are just some examples of the dietary alphabet, which includes a wide range of diets and eating patterns to cater to different people's preferences and health needs. Each diet has its own set of guidelines, advantages, and disadvantages, making it crucial to understand them fully and consult with a healthcare professional, especially if you have pre-existing medical conditions or specific nutritional requirements. Whichever diet you choose, a healthy, balanced approach to nutrition, combined with regular physical activity, is the key to achieving and maintaining optimal health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: CINCINNATI (AP) — The family of a drunken man picked up by Ohio police officers and dropped off at a Taco Bell before he was fatally struck by a car has sued over his death, accusing authorities of racial discrimination and putting their loved one in danger as part of a \\"perverse joke\\" about his Mexican heritage. The family of 22-year-old Uriel Juarez-Popoca filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Delaware County Sheriff's Office, several of the agency's deputies and an officer with the Ohio State Highway Patrol on Jan. 8. It seeks unspecified damages. An attorney for the patrolman said the discrimination allegations are ludicrous and that the officers gave Juarez-Popoca \\"a major break\\" by letting him go, especially considering that his legal status in the country was in question. The Cincinnati lawyer representing Juarez-Popoca's family, prominent civil-rights attorney Al Gerhardstein, said that proceeds from any settlement in the lawsuit or a jury trial would go to the wife, two children and parents of Juarez-Popoca, who live just south of Mexico City and had become financially dependent on remittance checks they received from Juarez-Popoca, who worked various jobs. Gerhardstein declined to comment on whether Juarez-Popoca was living legally in the U.S. It's undisputed that on the night of July 28, 2012, Juarez-Popoca was driving drunk on Interstate 71 in Sunbury, about 25 miles north of Columbus, when he pulled over in a grass median. Deputies responding to calls about a possible drunk driver found Juarez-Popoca, who spoke very little English, sitting inside his truck, clearly intoxicated. At that point, the lawsuit says that the deputies should have followed standard protocol and given Juarez-Popoca a blood-alcohol test, and then either detained him or turned him over to a family member or friend pending charges. Instead, they dropped him off at a Taco Bell restaurant about 5 miles away. Soon after, Juarez-Popoca was killed by a car while walking along a nearby four-lane highway. \\"This stands out as a truly outrageous failure by local law enforcement to do their basic duty of holding people safely,\\" Gerhardstein told The Associated Press. \\"It's just a really sick joke. A tragic joke.\\" Police said at the time that they dropped Juarez-Popoca off at the Taco Bell expecting him to call for a ride. The lawsuit says that deputies placed Juarez-Popoca in obvious danger by leaving him at the fast-food restaurant along a highway and failed to take proper action after receiving numerous calls about him from the store manager and drivers along the highway during a 50-minute period. Sam Shamansky, the attorney representing the Ohio state patrolman named in the lawsuit, said that Juarez-Popoca's death was a tragedy but that authorities were not discriminating against him. \\"There's no discrimination here,\\" he said. \\"If you ask me, it could just as easily be said that deputies were giving him a major break by not taking him to jail, maybe in order to not have discriminatory actions taken against him, vis-a-vis deportation. As an observer trying to be independent, I would suggest that's way more plausible than that they were discriminating against him because he's Hispanic.\\" Two deputies, Christopher Hughes and Derek Beggs, were fired over the matter. Patrolman Sean Carpenter also was fired but won an appeal of that decision and was reinstated. All three were charged criminally in the matter, with various outcomes. A jury found Beggs guilty of dereliction of duty and he was fined 500. A jury also found Carpenter guilty of dereliction of duty but that was overturned by an appeals court, which found that \\"no rational trier of fact could have found that (he) acted negligently.\\" Hughes pleaded no contest to a reduced charge of failure to assist a law enforcement officer and was ordered to pay 20. An attorney for Hughes and Beggs did not return a call for comment. In letters firing the two deputies, Delaware County Sheriff Russ Martin wrote that they had showed \\"a lack of maturity and professionalism.\\" \\"A fundamental duty as a law enforcement officer should be the preservation of life and inherent in that is the obligation to put a citizen in a better place than where he or she was found — even if that place is in custody for their own safety or the safety of others,\\" Martin wrote. ___ Follow Amanda Lee Myers on Twitter at https://twitter.com/AmandaLeeAP ||||| DELAWARE, Ohio — A State Highway Patrol trooper who was fired after failing to arrest a drunken driver during a stop on I-71 will get his job back, an arbitrator has ruled. The trooper, Sean Carpenter, also will be paid for part of the time he was out of work. Carpenter, 39, was fired in April for conduct unbecoming an officer and for failing to perform his duty after a July 2012 incident involving a drunken driver in Delaware County. Carpenter and two Delaware County deputy sheriffs found the driver, Uriel Juarez Popoca, on July 28 on an I-71 median near the Rts. 36/37 interchange. Popoca, 22, spoke Spanish and understood little English. The officers can be heard making fun of his speech in footage from their dashboard cameras. The officers took Popoca to a Taco Bell on Rts. 36/37, joking that someone there would understand him. Popoca left the restaurant shortly after being dropped there and was struck and killed by a passing driver. Carpenter was convicted of being derelict in his duty because he did not arrest the man; an appellate court threw out his conviction in August, ruling that Carpenter was not responsible for Popoca because the two deputies were in charge of the scene. Staff Lt. Anne Ralston said the patrol has not determined when Carpenter will return to work. According to the arbitration award, Carpenter will lose six months’ pay but will be paid for at least two of the months that he was out of work. Carpenter, who had been assigned to the Delaware post, earned 56,403 a year before he was fired. The two deputies involved in Popoca’s case — Derek Beggs and Christopher Hughes — were fired from the Delaware County sheriff’s office in February. Beggs also was convicted of dereliction of duty; Hughes was convicted of failing to aid a law-enforcement officer. The same appellate court upheld Beggs’ conviction. Tracy Whited, a spokeswoman for the sheriff’s office, said the office is finishing negotiations with the two former deputies but that neither will get his job back. Whited said the office is working on a settlement agreement with the former deputies, but the amount has not been set. larenschield@dispatch.com @larenschield ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The family of Uriel Juarez-Popoca, a 22-year-old man who was picked up by Ohio police officers while intoxicated and dropped off at a Taco Bell before being fatally struck by a car, has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Delaware County Sheriff's Office, several deputies, and an officer with the Ohio State Highway Patrol.

After serving in several government positions, including Minister of Labour and Vice President, he was thrice elected President of Argentina, serving from June 1946 to September 1955, when he was overthrown in a \\"coup d'état\\", and then from October 1973 until his death in July 1974. Can we infer the following? Perón would have been elected a third time if not for the coup.","completion":"It is difficult to definitively infer that Juan Domingo Perón would have been elected a third time if not for the coup that overthrew him in September 1955. While it is true that Perón had significant popular support and had previously been elected twice to the presidency, there are numerous factors that could have influenced the outcome of a hypothetical third election. To make an informed inference, let's explore Perón's political career, the context of his second term, and the circumstances surrounding the 1955 coup. Juan Domingo Perón was a charismatic and influential figure in Argentine politics. As a leader, he focused on social justice, labor rights, and nationalization of industries, which gained him the support of the working class. His policies and political ideology became known as \\"Peronism,\\" which remains an important political force in Argentina to this day. During his first two terms as president (1946-1955), Perón implemented numerous social and economic reforms, which further consolidated his power and popularity. Some of these policies included the nationalization of railways, the central bank, and public utilities, as well as the expansion of social welfare programs and workers' rights. These measures garnered significant support from the working class, who saw Perón as a champion of their interests. However, Perón's second term was met with increasing opposition and economic challenges. His administration faced accusations of authoritarianism, censorship, and persecution of political opponents. Additionally, the economy began to falter due to high inflation, a growing fiscal deficit, and a deteriorating balance of payments. These factors contributed to a loss of confidence in Perón's government among various sectors of society. The coup that ousted Perón in September 1955 was led by a coalition of military and civil factions, which included both conservative and liberal elements who opposed Perón's policies and his perceived authoritarianism. This opposition was strong enough to overthrow his government, suggesting that the political climate in Argentina was quite different from the environment that had previously facilitated his electoral victories. Given this context, it would be speculative to assume that Perón would have been elected for a third term had the coup not occurred. While his previous electoral successes and popularity among the working class indicate that he could have potentially mounted a successful campaign, the significant opposition he faced during his second term and the factors contributing to his ousting suggest that a third victory would not have been guaranteed. Ultimately, the hypothetical outcome of a third election involving Perón can only be speculated upon, as the complex interplay of political, social, and economic factors at the time makes it impossible to confidently infer that Perón would have won in the absence of the coup."},{"prompt":"Question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Brad and Kate for the following movie plot: The movie opens in a bar near Christmas, where a geeky Brad (Vince Vaughn) tries to hit on a confident and bitchy Kate (Reese Witherspoon), who blows him off...until she's called a bitch.

Leading members of the group have been arrested recently as more Basque political parties have called for a ceasefire. This is ETA's third ceasefire; the previous two were eventually abandoned. The BBC has excerpts from the video here. Article:","completion":"Title: Basque Separatist Group ETA Announces Historic Ceasefire Introduction The Basque separatist group ETA has announced a ceasefire, according to a report by the BBC. The group, which has been trying to achieve Basque independence for four decades, has been linked with more than 820 deaths and is widely considered a terrorist organization. Following prior statements by the Spanish government that it would not negotiate with ETA unless it renounced violence, the group has now issued a video in which it declares its intent \\"to put in motion a democratic process.\\" ETA's new commitment entails that it will no longer \\"carry out armed actions\\" while it campaigns for independence. This announcement follows a wave of recent arrests of leading ETA members and increased calls for a ceasefire by other Basque political parties. Although this is ETA's third ceasefire, the previous two were abandoned over time. Background of ETA The Basque separatist group ETA, which stands for Euskadi Ta Askatasuna or Basque Country and Freedom, was founded in 1959 and has been linked to numerous bombings and assassinations, including assassinations of politicians and members of the Spanish police force. The group's primary goal is to create an independent Basque state in the northern regions of Spain and France, which have distinct cultural and linguistic identities. Over the years, ETA's attacks have been met with widespread condemnation and retaliatory action by Spanish and French security forces. Previous Ceasefires This is not the first time the ETA has announced a ceasefire. In 1998, the group declared a ceasefire that lasted for 14 months but broke down after negotiations with the Spanish government failed to reach any conclusive agreements. The second ceasefire came in 2006, when ETA announced it would stop carrying out \\"armed actions\\" but resumed attacks just months later, following the collapse of peace talks with the Spanish government. The Current Ceasefire The latest ETA ceasefire announcement comes in a video featuring three unnamed representatives of the group, at least one of whom is wearing a traditional Basque beret. In the video, the group states that it intends \\"to put in motion a democratic process\\" and will no longer \\"carry out armed actions\\" as it campaigns for independence. The timing of the announcement is significant, as it follows increased domestic and international pressure on ETA, as well as a series of successful law enforcement operations that have resulted in the arrest of many of its leading members. In addition, more Basque political parties have called for a ceasefire, effectively isolating ETA's reliance on violence as a means to achieve its goals. Reactions and Implications The Spanish government has not yet officially reacted to the latest ETA ceasefire announcement, but previous statements have reaffirmed the government's position that it will not negotiate with the group unless it renounces violence. If the Spanish government perceives the current ceasefire as a genuine commitment to peace, it could potentially lead to new negotiations between ETA and the Spanish authorities, although the prospects of any such talks remain uncertain. Conclusion The current ceasefire announcement by ETA represents a potentially significant development in the long and bloody history of the Basque independence struggle. However, given the abandonment of the two previous ceasefires and the fact that the most recent announcement does not include any details regarding disarmament or a definitive end to the group's activities, many observers are likely to remain cautious in their assessment of the situation. Regardless, the current development may serve as a small step towards a more peaceful and democratic approach to achieving Basque independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
