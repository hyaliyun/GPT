I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot. But I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] What is an answer for this question: Which lake had more dissolved nutrients?","completion":"Based on the given information, Low lake had more dissolved nutrients than High lake. Let's break it down step-by-step to justify this answer: 1. High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, resulting in layers of stratified water. This stratification causes a separation between water masses with different properties like salinity, oxygenation, density, and temperature. 2. In High lake, water stratification leads to poor nutrient mixing between layers. This means the nutrients cannot easily travel up from deeper levels to the photic zone, where photosynthesis occurs, leading to limited primary production. 3. On the other hand, Low lake did not have any stratification issues. Without layers of stratified water, there are no barriers to prevent nutrient mixing within the lake. 4. Low lake is described as an abundant and prolific fishing spot. This suggests that there is a higher net productivity in Low lake, which can be attributed to a more efficient nutrient mixing process. Based on these justifications, we can conclude that Low lake had more dissolved nutrients compared to High lake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Fishing is a common occupation for those living close to the shore, as the sea provides a rich source of food in the form of fish and other seafood. Consuming fish as part of their diet is a natural and logical choice for those with such easy access to this resource. Additionally, fish is a nutritious and healthy option for their diet, being high in protein and omega-3 fatty acids. While some people might choose to write stories, talk to each other, or engage in other activities near the sea, these options are not exclusive to living near the ocean and can be done in any other place. Furthermore, dying of starvation is not a logical choice, as the sea provides food sources such as fish.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court. If a court determines the firing was not for \\"good cause,\\" the special counsel would be reinstated. The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said last week that Trump will not fire Mueller and that there was no need to bring the measure to the Senate floor for a vote. House Speaker Paul Ryan has also opposed the idea. The legislation was introduced by four Senators earlier this month after Trump's sharp criticism of an FBI raid on his personal lawyer's home and office rekindled fears that Trump may fire Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who supervises Mueller. Mueller is heading the federal investigation into Russia's electoral interference and possible collusion with the Trump presidential campaign. Trump has said there was no collusion and repeatedly denounced the probe as a \\"witch hunt.\\" Despite his harsh criticism of the Special Counsel and the Justice Department, Trump has dismissed reports that he's privately talked about firing Mueller.

Digital Mandela archive spreads message of social justice London (CNN) -- Documents chronicling the life of South Africa's first black president Nelson Mandela are now freely available to his fans around the world, thanks to a new online digital archive. The Nelson Mandela Digital Archive Project contains nearly 2000 mementos from of the life of the 93-year-old, casting an intimate light on the life of the anti-apartheid leader. Documents include the earliest-known photograph of Mandela, taken in 1938 when he was 19 or 20 years old, hand-written letters and diaries written during his 27 years of imprisonment, and previously unseen drafts of the sequel to his autobiography. The archive extends from the earliest known record of Mandela -- a Methodist church membership card issued in 1929 -- to handwritten notes taken during the talks to end apartheid, and beyond. The project is a collaboration between internet giant Google, and the Nelson Mandela Centre of Memory in South Africa, where the originals are held. Google gave a 1.25m grant to help preserve and digitize thousands of archival documents held in the Johannesburg-based center -- including never-before-seen items donated by the former president himself -- so that they could reach a broader audience online. Once again our beloved Mummy has been arrested and now she and Daddy are away in jailLetter from Mandela to his children The concept behind the project is that spreading Mandela's life story will help promote a message of social justice through the world. \\"It is invigorating to see our combined efforts become a reality,\\" said Verne Harris, head of the Nelson Mandela Center of Memory. \\"This digital initiative will make it possible for us to reach the full spectrum of our stakeholders, from the global elite to systemically disadvantaged South Africans.\\" The archive includes handwritten letters from his cell to his children, Zeni and Zindzi, after their mother, Winnie, had been arrested by the apartheid regime's police. \\"My Darlings,\\" begins the letter, dated June 23, 1969. \\"Once again our beloved Mummy has been arrested and now she and Daddy are away in jail. My heart bleeds as I think of her sitting in some police cell far away from home, perhaps alone and without anybody to talk to, and with nothing to read. Twenty four hours of the day longing for her little ones.\\" The project was the work of the Google Cultural Institute, which seeks to unlock the world's cultural and historical heritage by promoting and preserving culture online. Steve Crossan, the institute's director, said the archive showed \\"how the internet can help preserve historical heritage and make it available to the world. We've worked closely with the (center) to create an interactive online experience with powerful search and browsing tools, so that users can explore Mr Mandela's inspiring life story.\\" A similar grant of the same size has also been made to the Desmond Tutu Peace Center in Cape Town, for the documentation and digitisation of the South African Archbishop and anti-apartheid activist's archive. Other Google Cultural Institute projects have included showcasing the Dead Sea Scrolls, presenting thousands of works of art online through the Art Project, and the digitization of the Yad Vashem Holocaust materials. Speaking at the launch, South Africa's Minister of Science and Technology Naledi Pandor described Mandela as \\"the most famous ex-political prisoner of all time\\" and praised him for making \\"his own intellectual property available to all.\\" \\"He is an inspiration to us all.

Many people call this plant a tree, but it is a kind of grass. Like other kinds of grass, a bamboo plant may be cut very low to the ground, but it will grow back very quickly. A Japanese scientist recorded one bamboo plant that grew almost 1.5 meters in 24 hours! Bamboo grows almost everywhere in the world except Europe . There are more than 1,000 kinds of bamboo that grow around the world on both mountains and plains. Not all bamboo looks the same. Some bamboo plants are very thin. They may only grow to be a few centimeters wide while others may grow to more than 30 centimeters across. This plant also comes in different colors, from yellow to black to green. Many Asian countries have been using bamboo for hundreds of years. They often use bamboo for building new buildings. As a matter of fact, the cables hold up the hanging bridge across the Min River in Sichuan are made of bamboo. The bridge has been in use for more than 1,000 years, and is still holding strong. In Africa, engineers are teaching poor farmers how to find water using bamboo.

The Black Sabbath-influenced guitars are downtuned, creating slow and moody ambiance. \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" was based on Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and conveys the thoughts of a patient unjustly caged in a mental institution. The song opens with a section of clean single strings and harmonics. The clean, arpeggiated main riff is played in alternating 44 and 64 time signatures. The song is structured with alternating somber clean guitars in the verses, and distorted heavy riffing in the choruses, unfolding into an aggressive finale. This structure follows a pattern of power ballads Metallica set with \\"Fade to Black\\" on Ride the Lightning and would revisit with \\"One\\" on ...And Justice for All.\\"Disposable Heroes\\" is an anti-war song about a young soldier whose fate is controlled by his superiors. With sections performed at 220 beats per minute, it is one of the most intense tracks on the record.

The syncopated riffing of \\"Leper Messiah\\" challenges the hypocrisy of the televangelism that emerged in the 1980s. The song describes how people are willingly turned into blind religious followers who mindlessly do whatever they are told. The 136 beats per minute mid-tempo riffing of the verses culminates in a descending chromatic riff in the chorus; it increases to a galloping 184 beats per minute for the middle section that climaxes in a distorted scream of \\"Lie!\\".

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What movie does the accountant watch? ? A timid accountant in a Scottish Tweed weaving company cleverly bests the brash modern American efficiency expert whose ideas threaten his way of life. The film opens with Martin in Edinburgh buying whisky and cigarettes on the Royal Mile. We then see him at work as a head accountant in a very old-fashioned firm in the New Town. The Justerini & Brooks premises in George Street serves as their shop in the film. Martin is called to the death-bed of the owner, old MacPherson, at Moray Place. He is offered a whisky and declines. Old MacPherson drinks both and promptly dies. The new owner of the Tweed company, played by Robert Morley, is enamoured of a zealous American woman who is an efficiency expert and who wants to turn her hand to revolutionise the very traditional company. She insists on visiting \\"the factory\\" on the island, only to discover the task is done by old couples, on crofts where they spin the wool. She plans to replace the 700 weavers, dotted across the islands, with a single large factory. Whilst being driven through the city she even says the company should change to synthetic fibres, causing the chauffeur to drive into the back of a brewer's dray in the Grassmarket. Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes film at the cinema and is inspired to kill Mrs Barrows. As he is a non-smoker and a non-drinker, he decides he should mislead any future investigation by smoking and drinking at the scene of the planned crime. He buys a half-bottle of whisky and packet of Capstan cigarettes. In her flat though, after a series of botched attempts his conscience gets the better of him and he cannot kill her. He tries to remove all evidence when Mr MacPherson appears suddenly, and manages to avoid detection. Back in the office MacPherson interrogates Martin and finds his denial more plausible than Mrs Barrows's claims. She cannot take any more, accusing them all of being mad, and she leaves for good. Thus Mr Martin wins his battle of the sexes.","completion":"In the article, it states that Martin watches a Sherlock Holmes movie at the cinema."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Can you tell me the answer to who constitutes the finance commission after every five years??","completion":"The Finance Commission is an important constitutional body in India, primarily tasked with ensuring fair distribution of financial resources between the central and state governments. Article 280 of the Indian Constitution mandates that the President of India constitutes the Finance Commission at least once every five years, or earlier if required. The composition of the Finance Commission, as per the Constitution, consists of a chairman and four other members who are appointed by the President. These individuals come from diverse backgrounds such as economics, public affairs, finance, and administration in order to bring their unique perspectives and expertise to the commission's decision-making process. Here's a detailed overview of the process of constituting the Finance Commission: 1. Appointment of Chairman: The President appoints a chairman for the Finance Commission from among individuals who have had an illustrious career in either public affairs or administration. The chairman generally comes with extensive experience in managing financial budgets, allocations, and policy-making, enabling them to lead the commission effectively. 2. Selection of members: Apart from the chairman, the President appoints four other members to the Finance Commission. These members are chosen based on their knowledge and experience in the following four areas: a. Finance and Economics: At least one member must have substantial experience in the fields of finance, economics, or financial planning. This may include professionals from academia, research institutions, or government bodies who have a strong understanding of public finance issues. b. Public Affairs: A member with a background in public affairs will have expertise in governance, public policy, and administration. They will bring insights into the practical aspects of implementing financial policies and ensuring their success at the grassroots level. c. Accountancy: A member specialized in accountancy will possess technical expertise in auditing, financial management, and the maintenance of government accounts. Their experience will be critical in ensuring transparency and accountability in the allocation and distribution of resources. d. Legal expertise: A member with a background in law, ideally constitutional law, will assist the Finance Commission in interpreting the Constitution, particularly in matters related to the distribution of revenues between the central and state governments. 3. Tenure and Recommendations: Once constituted, the Finance Commission must submit its recommendations to the President within a stipulated period (usually two years). These recommendations serve as the basis for the distribution of financial resources between the central and state governments for the next five years. The members of the Finance Commission are selected based on their competence, expertise, and experience in their respective domains. The President's decision is influenced by various factors such as their integrity, objectivity, and commitment to the principles of federalism and fiscal prudence. The Finance Commission's recommendations, in turn, have significant implications for the overall financial health of the country, making the process of constituting the Finance Commission an essential aspect of India's governance. In summary, the Finance Commission is constituted by the President of India every five years, composed of a chairman and four members with expertise in fields such as finance, economics, public affairs, accountancy, and law. This team works together to formulate recommendations on distributing financial resources between the central and state governments, helping to maintain balanced fiscal relations and equitable growth across the nation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tree in the yard of Megan was a lot bigger than the tree in Rachel's yard, because Available choices: (A). Megan had an older tree.. (B). Rachel had an older tree..","completion":"(A). Megan had an older tree. The tree in the yard of Megan was a lot bigger than the tree in Rachel's yard, because Megan had an older tree. This age difference between the two trees played a significant role in their growth and overall size. Over the years, Megan's tree had the opportunity to extend its roots deeper into the soil, allowing it to access essential nutrients and water that contributed to its impressive stature. Furthermore, the older tree had more time to develop a robust and sturdy trunk, providing the necessary support to withstand strong winds and storms. On the other hand, Rachel's tree, being younger, had not yet had the same amount of time to grow to its full potential. Younger trees usually have less developed root systems and fewer branches, leading to a smaller overall size compared to their more mature counterparts. However, with proper care and ideal growing conditions, Rachel's tree can eventually catch up to, and possibly even surpass, the size of Megan's tree. Apart from the age factor, other variables could also influence the size difference between the two trees. For instance, each tree's particular species could have varying growth rates and maximum sizes. Additionally, the specific environmental conditions in Megan and Rachel's yards, such as sunlight exposure, soil quality, and regular access to water, can greatly impact the trees' development. In conclusion, the significant size disparity between Megan's and Rachel's trees is primarily due to the older age of Megan's tree, which has allowed it more time to grow and develop its structure. With proper care and nurturing, Rachel's younger tree may one day reach a comparable size. However, uncontrollable factors such as tree species and environmental conditions might further affect the ultimate potential of each tree in their respective yards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Obama’s gay inclusion at Morehouse President Obama speaking at Morehouse College commencement (Curtis Compton/European Pressphoto Agency/pool) President Obama’s commencement address at Morehouse College in Atlanta certainly has gotten a lot of attention. Quite a few Africans Americans don’t like how he talks to predominantly black audiences. As The Post’s Vanessa Williams reported yesterday, “The personal-responsibility finger-wagging … is getting old” for many. My disagreement with that is well documented. But lost in all the talk about what the president said to the all-male historically black college is how Obama ensured that his finger-wagging message also applied to gay black men. Now, there was some initial confusion about the reaction to what he said. But if you fast forward to 22:18 on the video of the president’s speech and listen attentively to the audio, you’ll hear something wonderful happen. Obama was extolling the hard work and dedication of one of the graduates who personified his urging to the men to “[k]eep setting an example for what it means to be a man.” “Be the best husband to your wife,” Obama said. “Yeah!” came the response. Then, the president added this: “Or your boyfriend, or your partner.” One of the graduates yelled out, “That’s right, too!” The reaction to that response was one of laughter and applause. Given Obama’s “wait a minute now” gesticulation during the laughter, perhaps he worried that folks were reacting negatively to his inclusiveness. He needn’t have. But it was another example of Obama’s fearlessness in talking about gay and lesbian issues in any audience, particularly African American audiences. Much like his mention of Stonewall and marriage equality in his inaugural address, Obama’s inclusion of “partner, or your boyfriend” was a startling moment. You couldn’t believe he said it, but you were glad and proud that he did. For, with just a few words, a black man who happens to be the leader of the free world told his fellow black men that gay relationships are on par with straight ones.

Penguins are popularly loved around the world, primarily for their unusually upright, waddling gait, impressive swimming ability and (compared to other birds) lack of fear of humans. Their striking black-and-white plumage is often likened to a white tie suit. Mistakenly, some artists and writers have penguins based at the North Pole. This is incorrect, as there are no wild penguins in the Northern Hemisphere.

Article: Find the size of your or another woman’s chest by wrapping your measuring material around the back over your shoulder blades, under the armpits, and across the fullest part of the bust. Ensure that you do not pull whatever material you’re using to measure too tightly around the chest. To measure for a bra, bathing suit, or other garment that calls for it, you will use this bust measurement along with the circumference just below the bust to find the cup and band size. Use your measuring material to find the length around your or another woman’s torso at its smallest point, which is your natural waist. Find this point by observing where the torso creases when bending side to side, and note that it will fall above the bellybutton and below the ribcage. Note that there is a difference between the natural waist and where the waistband may be worn on pants, skirts, or shorts. When clothing measurements call for a waist size, it refers to the narrowest part of the torso, the natural waist. You may want to take another measurement below the natural waist where you know you will wear a garment. Be sure to exhale and relax, or have the woman you’re measuring do so, before you take a waist measurement. The abdomen shouldn’t be enlarged with air, sucked in smaller, or otherwise in an unnatural or unrelaxed state. Wrap your measuring material around your own or another woman’s hips at their fullest point to determine hip size. The fullest point of the hips is generally about 8 inches below the natural waist, but of course the distance varies from person to person. Take a few different measurements if you need to ensure that you find the widest point. If you’re taking the measurement on yourself, make sure your measuring material is level across your hips and rear end by observing yourself in a mirror. Take the measurement of the inseam for a pair of pants by measuring along one leg from groin to ankle with the leg remaining straight. This is best done on another person or with help from someone else to take a measurement on you. If you don’t have someone to help, you can also measure the inseam on a pair of pants that fits you well. The proper inseam for a pair of pants may vary depending on the style of pants and the height of the heel on the shoe worn with them. Use your measuring material to take any other measurements that a sizing chart or clothing pattern calls for. Make sure that you always take a measurement from the fullest part or longest extension of a body part. Measure around the widest part of your arm or thigh, for example, and measure for the length of a sleeve with your arm bent to accommodate movement. It may be helpful to keep a piece of string or elastic tied around the natural waist, as it will be used as an endpoint for other measurements like front waist length, back waist length, and rise.

Born into a large family from Charlemagne, Quebec, Dion emerged as a teen star in the French-speaking world after her manager and future husband Rene Angelil mortgaged his home to finance her first record. Dion first gained international recognition in the 1980s by winning both the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival and the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest where she represented Switzerland. Dion was born in Charlemagne, Quebec, the youngest of 14 children of Therese (nee Tanguay), a homemaker, and Adhemar Dion, a butcher, both of French-Canadian descent. Dion was raised a Roman Catholic in a poor, but, by her own account, happy home in Charlemagne. Music had always been a major part of the Dion family; indeed, Dion herself was named after the song \\"Celine,\\" which French singer Hugues Aufray had recorded two years before her own birth. On 13 August 1973, at the age of five, the young Celine made her first public appearance at her brother Michel's wedding, where she performed Christine Charbonneau's song \\"Du fil des aiguilles et du coton\\". She continued to perform with her siblings in her parents' small piano bar called Le Vieux Baril, \\"The Old Barrel.\\" From an early age, Dion had dreamed of being a performer. In a 1994 interview with People magazine, she recalled, \\"I missed my family and my home, but I don't regret having lost my adolescence. I had one dream: I wanted to be a singer.\\" At age 12, Dion collaborated with her mother and her brother Jacques to write and compose her first song, \\"Ce n'etait qu'un reve,\\" whose title translates as \\"It Was Only a Dream\\" or \\"Nothing But A Dream.\\" Her brother Michel sent the recording to music manager Rene Angelil, whose name he discovered on the back of a Ginette Reno album. Angelil was moved to tears by Dion's voice and decided to make her a star. In 1981, he mortgaged his home to fund her first record, La voix du bon Dieu, which later became a local No. 1 hit and made Dion an instant star in Quebec. Her popularity spread to other parts of the world when she competed in the 1982 Yamaha World Popular Song Festival in Tokyo, Japan, and won the musician's award for \\"Top Performer\\" as well as the gold medal for \\"Best Song\\" with \\"Tellement j'ai d'amour pour toi\\". By 1983, in addition to becoming the first Canadian artist to receive a gold record in France for the single \\"D'amour ou d'amitie\\" (\\"Of Love or of Friendship\\"), Dion had also won several Felix Awards, including \\"Best Female performer\\" and \\"Discovery of the Year\\". Further success came when Dion represented Switzerland in the 1988 Eurovision Song Contest with the song \\"Ne partez pas sans moi\\" and won the contest by a close margin in Dublin, Ireland. At age eighteen, after seeing a Michael Jackson performance, Dion told Angelil that she wanted to be a star like Jackson. Though confident in her talent, Angelil realized that her image needed to be changed in order for her to be marketed worldwide. Dion receded from the spotlight for a number of months, during which she underwent dental surgery to improve her appearance, and was sent to the Ecole Berlitz in 1989 to polish her English. In 1989, during a concert on the Incognito Tour, Dion injured her voice. She consulted the otorhinolaryngologist William Gould, who gave her an ultimatum: have immediate surgery on her vocal cords or do not utilize them at all for three weeks. Dion chose the latter and underwent vocal training with William Riley.

Commuters are individuals who travel regularly from one place to another, usually for work or school. By specifying \\"commuters,\\" the sentence emphasizes its focus on these habitual travelers, setting the scene for their movement amidst the given conditions. 2. \\"Thick fog\\" - This phrase indicates the critical environmental condition in which the commuters are traveling. \\"Thick fog\\" describes a particularly dense and low-lying cloud-like formation that can obscure visibility and make navigation challenging. It presents an obstacle for the commuters, making their journey more difficult. Thus, this phrase adds essential context to the situation and can also evoke feelings of uncertainty or peril. 3. \\"Road\\" - The term \\"road\\" is significant because it establishes the setting where the action is taking place. It highlights the mode of transportation being used (walking, biking, or driving, for example) and reveals the type of environment where the commuters are navigating. Mentioning \\"road\\" provides crucial spatial understanding while also indicating that the commuters are likely using some form of land-based transportation throughout their journey. Together, these three essential words – \\"commuters,\\" \\"thick fog,\\" and \\"road\\" – provide the foundation upon which the sentence's meaning is built.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Metta means non-romantic love, kindness,and friendliness. It is a feeling that comes from your heart, and it has to be cultivated and practiced. It is usually practiced in five stages. If you are a beginner, try to stay in each stage for five minutes. Stage 1- Feel metta for yourself. Focus on feelings of peace, tranquility, strength, and confidence. You can repeat the phrase \\"May I be well and happy.\\" to yourself. Stage 2- Think of a friend and all of the things that you like about them. Repeat the phrase, \\"May they be well; may they be happy.\\" Stage 3- Think of someone that you are neutral about. You do not like them or dislike them. Consider the person's humanity and extend your feelings of metta to that person. Stage 4- Think of someone that you do not like at all. Instead of thinking about why you do not like them and having hateful thoughts, send your feelings of metta to them. Stage 5- In this last stage, think of every single person including yourself. Send metta to those people, your city, your neighborhood, your country, and the entire world. This type of mediation will teach you to concentrate and focus your thoughts. Through this mediation you can learn to practice mindfulness, relax, and rid yourself of anxiety. Find a sitting position that is comfortable for you. Your spine needs to be upright and relaxed. Your shoulders should be relaxed and slightly rolled back and down. Support your hands on a cushion or in your lap. Once you have your posture, begin going through the different stages. Each stage should last for at least 5 minutes. Stage 1- Count internally (breathe in, breathe out, 1 breathe in, breathe out 2, etc.) after each breath until you reach 10. Start over once you have reached 10. Focus on the sensations of breathing in and out. Your mind will wander. Just bring your thoughts back to your breathing. Stage 2- Continue to breathe in cycles of 10, but count before you inhale this time (e.g.,1, breathe in, breathe out, 2, breathe in, breathe out, 3, etc.). Focus on the sensations you have when you are inhaling. Stage 3- Breathe in and out without counting. Try to see your breathing as a continuous process instead of just breathing in and breathing out. Stage 4- Your focus should now be in the sensations of your breath as it enters and leaves your body. This may be your breath passing over your nostrils or your upper lip. The ultimate goal of Buddhism is to achieve inner peace and then share your experience with other people. Attaining nirvana is not only for your benefit, but for the world as well. It is important for you to be a source of encouragement and support for others. This is as simple as giving someone a hug if he or she is feeling down. If someone is important to you or does something nice for you, let the person know how you feel. Let people know that you are grateful for them and appreciate them. If someone is having a bad day, provide a listening ear. Your happiness is directly related to the happiness of other people. Showing compassion promotes happiness for all. You can practice compassion in many ways: Turn off your cell phone when you are spending time with friends and family. Make eye contact when someone is talking to you and listen without interrupting. Volunteer in your community. Open doors for other people. Be empathetic towards people. For example, if someone is upset, acknowledge and try to understand why they are upset. Ask them what you can do to help. Listen and show concern for their feelings. When you practice mindfulness, you pay attention to how you think and feel in the present moment. Mindfulness is not only for meditation but for your every day life as well. For example, you can be mindful as you eat, shower, or get dressed in the morning. Start by choosing one activity and then focus on the sensations in your body and your breathing as you do it. If you want to mindful while you are eating, concentrate on the taste, texture, and smell of the food as you eat it. As you wash the dishes, pay attention to the temperature of the water, how your hands feel as you clean the dishes, and how the water feels as you rinse the dishes. Instead of listening to the music or the television as you get dressed in the morning, get ready in silence. Notice how you feel. Were you tired or well rested when you woke up? How does your body feel as you put on clothes or shower? Summary:","completion":"\\"Metta\\" is a form of meditation focused on cultivating feelings of love, kindness, and friendliness, and is practiced by focusing thoughts on oneself, loved ones, neutral acquaintances, disliked individuals, and then all beings, thereby promoting mindfulness, relaxation, and anxiety-relief; Buddhist principles suggest sharing these peaceful experiences and showing compassion to benefit individuals and the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938? ? Jean Sibelius's Symphony No. 8 was his final major compositional project, occupying him intermittently from the mid-1920s until around 1938, though he never published it. During this time Sibelius was at the peak of his fame, a national figure in his native Finland and a composer of international stature. A fair copy of at least the first movement was made, but how much of the Eighth Symphony was completed is unknown. Sibelius repeatedly refused to release it for performance, though he continued to assert that he was working on it even after he had, according to later reports from his family, burned the score and associated material, probably in 1945. Much of Sibelius's reputation, during his lifetime and subsequently, derived from his work as a symphonist. His Seventh Symphony of 1924 has been widely recognised as a landmark in the development of symphonic form, and at the time there was no reason to suppose that the flow of innovative orchestral works would not continue. However, after the symphonic poem Tapiola, completed in 1926, his output was confined to relatively minor pieces and revisions to earlier works. During the 1930s the Eighth Symphony's premiere was promised to Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra on several occasions, but as each scheduled date approached Sibelius demurred, claiming that the work was not ready for performance. Similar promises made to the British conductor Basil Cameron and to the Finnish Georg Schnéevoigt likewise proved illusory. It is thought that Sibelius's perfectionism and exalted reputation prevented him ever completing the symphony to his satisfaction; he wanted it to be even better than his Seventh. After Sibelius's death in 1957, news of the Eighth Symphony's destruction was made public, and it was assumed that the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since... The answer to this question is:","completion":"Sibelius. The last name of the person who was occupied intermittently from the mid 1920s until around 1938 is Jean Sibelius, a Finnish composer who was working on his Symphony No. 8 during this time period."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She closed the door and started to go back to her room across the hall. She was halfway through a romance novel. But Hadley's delicious oatmeal raisin cookies were calling to her. She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room. She tiptoed to the open doorway and peeked in. There she was--that conniving slut--sitting where Macy should have been. How could Elmo have replaced her like that? She thought he had been falling in love with her. How could she have been so wrong? But it could still happen--if that woman would just go away. Elmo said, \\"Yeah. So, beginning Monday there will be two doctors in the office. That should take a little pressure off. If I need to be out for a day or two, Dr. Edwards can fill in for me.\\" \\"Yeah, or if you need to take off a week for a trip to Hawaii with your beautiful new wife.\\" Carsie gave him a sexy smile. \\"That's right.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body. It is impossible to sustain any level of good health on such a diet. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

(ii) Monica was wearing sandals..","completion":"Tanya avoided getting bitten by the snake that bit Monica, because she was equipped with better preventive measures. Unlike Monica, who was wearing sandals, which exposed her feet to potential threats, Tanya took a more cautious approach in her choice of footwear. First, Tanya assessed the environment and determined the likelihood of encountering snakes in the area. Considering that snakes can often be found in grassy or rocky habitats, Tanya decided to prioritize her safety by wearing shoes that offered her more protection. Second, Tanya chose to wear closed-toe shoes, as they would provide a barrier between her feet and any potential danger, including snake bites. This was a wise decision because, although Tanya was wearing sandals, her feet were still exposed and vulnerable to a snake bite. Next, Tanya learned more about the types of snakes that inhabited the area and their preferred environments. By being more informed, she was able to anticipate potential encounters and take necessary precautions. Finally, Tanya remained vigilant and alert in her surroundings, which allowed her to spot the snake and avoid it. In contrast, Monica was less cautious and did not notice the snake before it bit her. In conclusion, Tanya avoided getting bitten by the snake that bit Monica, because she recognized the potential risks and took appropriate preventative measures. By wearing closed-toe shoes, staying informed about the local snake population, and being vigilant, Tanya was able to keep herself safe from harm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We are introduced to Adam, a key witness in an ongoing high-profile criminal investigation against an international crime syndicate. Due to the risk of assassination, Adam is placed in Witness Protection under the supervision of Canada's elite RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted Police) Emergency Response Team (ERT) operators. Step 2: Introducing the Antagonist The antagonist is an international crime syndicate leader called Damon, who feels threatened by Adam's testimony in the investigation. Damon hires a group of skilled assassins to eliminate Adam at any cost. Step 3: Assassins' Plan and Disguise The assassins devise a plan to infiltrate the RCMP ERT unit assigned to protect Adam by disguising themselves as ERT operators. They forge credentials, plant backstories, and study the authentic operation tactics to seamlessly blend in. The assassins infiltrate the security team using their disguises. Step 4: Tension Escalates As the trial date approaches, more accidents and unexplained incidents take place, raising suspicion among the real ERT members. Adam, though initially safe, starts to feel uneasy, suspecting that there is a mole within the protection team. Step 5: Protagonist's Action Adam decides to take matters into his own hands. He contacts a former childhood friend, Sarah, who is now a freelance investigative journalist. Together, they start gathering information that might expose the assassins within the team. Step 6: Culminating Confrontation and Reveal As Adam and Sarah discover crucial evidence indicating the presence of the disguised assassins, they confront the moles, leading to an intense action sequence and showdown inside the safehouse. In a dramatic reveal, the assassins' true identities are exposed. The remaining trustworthy ERT members, Adam, and Sarah work together to stop the assassins. Step 7: Resolution and Conclusion With the skilled teamwork and efforts of the real ERT members, Adam, and Sarah, the assassins are neutralized. Adam's testimony is successfully submitted in the trial, helping to take down the international crime syndicate. Realizing the importance of her work, Sarah vows to continue her investigative journalism, focusing on stories involving corrupt officials and hidden enemies. Adam, grateful for the protection he received from the RCMP ERT, decides to find ways to repay the debt and fight against crime in his own way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

This is because the stronger the intermolecular forces are, the harder it is for liquid molecules to escape into the gas phase. Vapor pressure a measure of how much of a substance is in the gas phase when that substance is at equilibrium; that is, the number of molecules in the gas and liquid phases are not changing.

A 14-year-old boy got hurt when a car hit him and then quickly left without helping. This kind of thing is called a hit-and-run collision. It's really not nice, and it can cause a lot of pain for the person who got hit. Because of this, people are trying to make the roads safer by asking drivers to go slower. They think if cars drive slower, nobody will get hurt like that boy. They started a petition so that others can join them in asking for slower speed limits. The hope is that if enough people sign the petition, the leaders in the area will make a new rule for slower driving so that everyone can be safe. The people who started the petition think that it's much better if we all take care of each other. They believe that if cars go slower, it will give drivers more time to see what's happening around them and not hit anyone by mistake. So far, lots of people have agreed and put their names on the list - the petition. They hope that their actions will help the boy who was hurt and make the roads safer for everyone walking and riding bikes. They don't want anyone to get hurt again, especially kids like you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What were the names of the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius? Answer the above question based on the context below: Charles-Camille Saint-Saëns (French: [ʃaʁlkamij sɛ̃sɑ̃s]; 9 October 1835 – 16 December 1921) was a French composer, organist, conductor and pianist of the Romantic era. His best-known works include Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso (1863), the Second Piano Concerto (1868), the First Cello Concerto (1872), Danse macabre (1874), the opera Samson and Delilah (1877), the Third Violin Concerto (1880), the Third (\\"Organ\\") Symphony (1886) and The Carnival of the Animals (1886). Saint-Saëns was a musical prodigy; he made his concert debut at the age of ten. After studying at the Paris Conservatoire he followed a conventional career as a church organist, first at Saint-Merri, Paris and, from 1858, La Madeleine, the official church of the French Empire. After leaving the post twenty years later, he was a successful freelance pianist and composer, in demand in Europe and the Americas. As a young man, Saint-Saëns was enthusiastic for the most modern music of the day, particularly that of Schumann, Liszt and Wagner, although his own compositions were generally within a conventional classical tradition. He was a scholar of musical history, and remained committed to the structures worked out by earlier French composers. This brought him into conflict in his later years with composers of the impressionist and dodecaphonic schools of music; although there were neoclassical elements in his music, foreshadowing works by Stravinsky and Les Six, he was often regarded as a reactionary in the decades around the time of his death. Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post, at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris, and remained there for less than five years. It was nevertheless important in the development of French music: his students included Gabriel Fauré, among whose own later pupils was Maurice Ravel. Both of them were strongly influenced by Saint-Saëns, whom they revered as a genius. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel were the pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the given context. The passage mentions that Saint-Saëns held only one teaching post at the École de Musique Classique et Religieuse in Paris. Step 2: Locate the names of the students who studied under Saint-Saëns. In the text, it is stated that Gabriel Fauré was one of his students. Step 3: Identify any indirect students who were influenced by Saint-Saëns through their own teachers. The text states that Maurice Ravel was a pupil of Gabriel Fauré, who was himself a student of Saint-Saëns. Therefore, Ravel is an indirect pupil of Saint-Saëns. Step 4: Determine if these students revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. The passage explicitly states that both Fauré and Ravel revered Saint-Saëns as a genius. Conclusion: The pupils who revered Saint-Saëns as a genius were Gabriel Fauré and Maurice Ravel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The plot, riddled with inconsistencies and disjointed story arcs, failed to engage the audience and connect us to its central characters. While the premise was intriguing, featuring a protagonist grappling with the blurred lines between reality and the products of his own mind, the execution was severely lacking. The narrative struggled to find its footing and ultimately left the viewer confused and disoriented. As for the performances, the cast seemed to struggle with their roles. Not only was there a general absence of chemistry between the main characters, but the emotional range of the actors felt limited and underdeveloped. The dialogue appeared forced, as if hampered by an overly-expository script that left little room for authentic human interaction. The cinematography was far from any saving grace. Haphazard camera angles and choppy editing created a disorienting experience that distracted from any semblance of a cohesive storyline. Moreover, the visuals frequently strayed into over-the-top territory, pursuing shock value instead of supporting the film's thematic aims. Perhaps most disappointing was the film's score, which hovered between grating and forgettable. The soundtrack fell into the all-too-common trap of telegraphing plot twists through its heavy-handed melodies, thereby detracting from the intended suspense. In turn, the audience was left with a sense of déjà vu, robbed of any genuine surprise. In conclusion, \\"Disastrous Delusions\\" had the potential to be a captivating psychological thriller, but it ultimately collapsed under the weight of its own ambition. It was simply a cacophony of poor decision-making and careless craftsmanship that left viewers disengaged and yearning for the lights to come up.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a sentence, and you should determine whether it is overruling or non-overruling. In law, an overruling sentence is a statement that nullifies a previous case decision as a precedent by a constitutionally valid statute or a decision by the same or higher ranking court which establishes a different rule on the point of law involved.

A:","completion":"This task is asking you to assess whether a given sentence is overruling or non-overruling, in the context of legal precedent. An overruling sentence is one that effectively invalidates a previous decision made by a court, by introducing a new rule or interpretation of the law by either the same court or one that ranks higher. Here are the guidelines: 1. Read the given sentence carefully. 2. Analyse whether the sentence is creating a new legal rule/interpretation or referencing an existing one. 3. If a new legal rule is being established that would negate a previous court's ruling, then the sentence is overruling. 4. If no new legal rule is proposed and the sentence merely applies or refers to an existing legal principle, then it is non-overruling. In the context of the provided question: Q: \\"See Bagnara, 189 So. 3d at 172 (counsel's failure to properly move for JOA when state did not prove value element of grand theft constituted ineffective assistance of counsel on the face of the record); Gordon v.

It discusses two cases (Bagnara and Gordon v. State), making similar observations about the inefficacies of counsel in each, specifically in relation to a failure to move for JOA when the state did not adequately demonstrate necessary elements of the crimes in question. There is no suggestion here of a new legal rule that contradicts an older one. Thus, this would be classified as non-overruling, as it seems to be applying a prevailing legal principle—that of ineffective assistance of counsel in certain circumstances—rather than proposing a new one that would override a previous judicial decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis.

After nine months of work, the band had an album's worth of material ready for release, but they were not satisfied with the results; Mullen said that the songs \\"had no magic\\". The group subsequently enlisted Steve Lillywhite to take over as producer in Dublin in January 2004. Lillywhite, along with his assistant Jacknife Lee, spent six months with the band reworking songs and encouraging better performances. Several other producers received credits on the album, including Lanois, Eno, Flood, Carl Glanville, and Nellee Hooper; Bono acknowledged that the involvement of multiple producers affected the record's \\"sonic cohesion\\". Released in November 2004, How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb received favourable reviews from critics. The album featured lyrics touching on life, death, love, war, faith, and family. It reached number one in 30 countries, including the US, where first-week sales of 840,000 copies nearly doubled those of All That You Can't Leave Behind, setting a personal best for the band.

B. box is heavy..","completion":"B. box is heavy. The sentence ends with option B: \\"John broke the tablet when he placed the box on it not knowing the box is heavy.\\" This option accurately showcases the source of the issue, which was the weight of the box causing the tablet to break. In this situation, John was seemingly unaware of the significant weight of the box. Had he realized how heavy it was, he might have taken more caution when placing the box on top of the tablet, thus potentially avoiding damaging the tablet. The heavy box exerted too much force on the tablet, surpassing its structural integrity and ultimately causing it to break. Option A, \\"tablet is heavy,\\" does not provide a fitting conclusion to the sentence. The heaviness of the tablet itself would not be the cause for it to break in the given scenario. Instead, the weight or force exerted upon it by the box would be the primary contributor to the tablet's breakage. Understanding the importance of adequately supporting and securing delicate items like electronic devices can keep such incidents from occurring.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. Theodore Roosevelt Jr. was born on October 27, 1858, at East 20th Street in New York City. He was the second of four children born to socialite Martha Stewart \\"Mittie\\" Bulloch and businessman and philanthropist Theodore Roosevelt Sr. He had an older sister, Anna (nicknamed \\"Bamie\\"), a younger brother, Elliott, and a younger sister, Corinne. Elliott was later the father of First Lady Anna Eleanor Roosevelt, the wife of Theodore's distant cousin, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. His paternal grandfather was of Dutch descent; his other ancestry included primarily Scottish and Scots-Irish, English and smaller amounts of German, Welsh, and French. Theodore Sr. was the fifth son of businessman Cornelius Van Schaack \\"C.V.S.\\" Roosevelt and Margaret Barnhill. Theodore's fourth cousin, James Roosevelt I, who was also a businessman, was the father of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Mittie was the younger daughter of Major James Stephens Bulloch and Martha P. \\"Patsy\\" Stewart. Through the Van Schaacks, Roosevelt was a descendant of the Schuyler family. Roosevelt's youth was largely shaped by his poor health and debilitating asthma. He repeatedly experienced sudden nighttime asthma attacks that caused the experience of being smothered to death, which terrified both Theodore and his parents. Doctors had no cure. Nevertheless, he was energetic and mischievously inquisitive. His lifelong interest in zoology began at age seven when he saw a dead seal at a local market; after obtaining the seal's head, Roosevelt and two cousins formed what they called the \\"Roosevelt Museum of Natural History\\". Having learned the rudiments of taxidermy, he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught; he then studied the animals and prepared them for display. At age nine, he recorded his observation of insects in a paper entitled \\"The Natural History of Insects\\". Roosevelt's father significantly influenced him. His father was a prominent leader in New York's cultural affairs; he helped to found the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and had been especially active in mobilizing support for the Union during the Civil War, even though his in-laws included Confederate leaders. Roosevelt said, \\"My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.\\" Family trips abroad, including tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and Egypt in 1872, shaped his cosmopolitan perspective. Hiking with his family in the Alps in 1869, Roosevelt found that he could keep pace with his father. He had discovered the significant benefits of physical exertion to minimize his asthma and bolster his spirits. Roosevelt began a heavy regime of exercise. After being manhandled by two older boys on a camping trip, he found a boxing coach to teach him to fight and strengthen his body.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was his father?","completion":"Theodore Roosevelt Jr.'s father was Theodore Roosevelt Sr., a businessman and philanthropist.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Read this: Mining was important in Thuringia since the later Middle Ages, especially within the mining towns of the Thuringian Forest such as Schmalkalden, Suhl and Ilmenau. Following the industrial revolution, the old iron, copper and silver mines declined because the competition from imported metal was too strong. On the other hand, the late 19th century brought new types of mines to Thuringia: the lignite surface mining around Meuselwitz near Altenburg in the east of the Land started in the 1870s, and two potash mining districts were established around 1900. These are the Südharzrevier in the north of the state, between Bischofferode in the west and Roßleben in the east with Sondershausen at its centre, and the Werrarevier on the Hessian border around Vacha and Bad Salzungen in the west. Together, they accounted for a significant part of the world's potash production in the mid-20th century. After the reunification, the Südharzrevier was abandoned, whereas K+S took over the mines in the Werrarevier. Between 1950 and 1990, uranium mining was also important to cover the Soviet Union's need for this metal. The centre was Ronneburg near Gera in eastern Thuringia and the operating company Wismut was under direct Soviet control.

Q: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012.

What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who announced, with Shuttlesworth, that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15? from the following article ? Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15. Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned. Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens. Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes. However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\". King became Time's Man of the Year for 1963 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. Four months after the Birmingham campaign settlement, someone bombed the house of NAACP attorney Arthur Shores, injuring his wife in the attack. On September 15, 1963, Birmingham again earned international attention when Ku Klux Klan members bombed the 16th Street Baptist Church on a Sunday morning and killed four young girls. FBI informant Gary Thomas Rowe was hired to infiltrate the KKK and monitor their activities and plans.

But ask him now he feels about that decision, and you get a tepid response. \\"I'm not sure,\\" Poskin said. Like many farmers in the Midwest, Poskin is concerned about getting caught in the middle of a trade war, as Trump ramps up economic pressure on China. Those fears were heightened after Trump announced plans Thursday to impose tariffs on as much as 60 billion worth of Chinese imports. \\"I'm fearful they will retaliate on those tariffs,\\" Poskin said. \\"Soybean exports, wheat, poultry, chicken, beef — [there are] any number of products that we export to their country that they could retaliate with.\\" The announcement has unnerved many in Trump's base of supporters in U.S. agriculture. The trade tensions have also rattled global markets, which until recently had performed strongly. Trump's tariff decision was meant to punish Chinese companies that benefit from unfair access to U.S. technology. U.S. businesses have long bristled at Beijing's requirement that they transfer technology to Chinese companies as a condition of entering the Chinese market. U.S. businesses have also had their technology stolen through cyberattacks. \\"We have a tremendous intellectual property theft situation going on,\\" Trump said during the signing ceremony Thursday.

Jake McGing (born 22 May 1994) is a professional Australian footballer who plays as a central defender for Central Coast Mariners FC in the A-League. On 11 August 2015, he made his professional senior debut for Central Coast Mariners FC in the 2015 FFA Cup against Wellington Phoenix FC. Can we draw the following conclusion? Jake McGing made his professional senior debut after he was 20 years old","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Jake McGing made his professional senior debut after he was 20 years old. Here is a detailed explanation for this conclusion: Jake McGing was born on 22nd May 1994. To determine his age at the time of his professional senior debut, we need to analyze the time frame between his birthdate and the date of his debut match. His debut took place on 11th August 2015 when he played for Central Coast Mariners FC in the 2015 FFA Cup against Wellington Phoenix FC. To calculate the time difference between these two dates, we can follow these steps: 1. Calculate the years between his birth year (1994) and the year of the debut (2015): 2015 - 1994 = 21 years. 2. Calculate the months between his birth month (May) and the month of the debut (August): August falls in the eighth month of the year, whereas May falls in the fifth. So, 8 - 5 = 3 months. 3. Calculate the days between his birth date (22nd) and the date of the debut (11th): Since we are looking at the day of the debut, the days calculation would be 11 - 22 = -11 days. Putting these calculations together, we can determine that Jake McGing was 21 years, 3 months, and -11 days old. To account for the negative days value, we can borrow one month, making the age 21 years, 2 months, and 20 days. In conclusion, Jake McGing made his professional senior debut at the age of 21 years, 2 months, and 20 days, which is indeed after he was 20 years old."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: where was the first factory built in the world?","completion":"The first factory in the world, as we understand the term today, was built in 1717 in Derby, a town in Derbyshire, England. This factory, called Lombe's Mill or more specifically, the Derby Silk Mill, was a silk-spinning factory designed and built by John Lombe and George Sorocold. John Lombe, an Englishman, was an apprentice in the Italian silk industry and had gained valuable insights into the intricate processes of Italian silk spinning. His aim was to bring this knowledge back to England and establish a competitive silk industry in his home country. The silk-spinning mill was strategically constructed on an island in the River Derwent because water from the river was used to power the mill's machinery. In fact, the clever positioning and utilization of the water power made the Derby Silk Mill one of the first successful applications of hydro-power in a large-scale industrial operation. The factory featured a remarkable architectural structure that housed the silk-spinning processes and the mill's production workspaces. With five stories and a distinctively consistent layout, Derby Silk Mill was purpose-built to accommodate the large machinery and the hundreds of workers required for the silk production process. At this factory, silk was spun into threads which were then woven into fabrics, representing the entire range of production processes under one roof. This marked a revolutionary change in the textile industry, as previous smaller-scale workshops and cottage industries had separate locations for each production step. The concept of a centralized and organized production site that housed all the required tools, machinery, and workforce greatly influenced the transition towards the Industrial Revolution and paved the way for future large-scale factories across various industries. As the first factory in the world, Lombe's Mill, or the Derby Silk Mill, holds historical significance not only for its successful implementation of innovative manufacturing practices and the industrial application of hydraulic power but also for serving as the blueprint for future industrial innovations and advancements. Its founding acted as a catalyst for the burgeoning industrial revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, driving economic growth and changing the course of human history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: The judge had ruled the murder case could be reopened, excavation soon began where? Options: - dead - construction site - under ground - egypt - cemetary A:","completion":"The option in line with common sense to answer the question is \\"construction site.\\" When the judge ruled that the murder case could be reopened, it is natural to assume that new evidence or leads have come to light, prompting the need for further investigation. In cases like these, investigators typically examine locations connected to the case, or areas where the new evidence suggests that relevant discoveries might be made. In this particular situation, the excavation would likely occur at a construction site. Construction sites are often home to digging and land development, which makes them prime locations for uncovering hidden or previously buried evidence. If the new leads in the case suggest that the victim's body, a murder weapon, or some other piece of critical evidence could be buried at a construction site, it would make the most sense to begin the excavation there. On the other hand, the other options provided do not fit as logically within the context of a murder case investigation. For example, \\"dead\\" is not a location, and as such, would not be an appropriate place to begin an excavation. Likewise, although \\"underground\\" could imply a literal excavation site, the term is too general to have any practical meaning or direction for investigators in the context of a reopened murder case. The option \\"Egypt\\" would be highly unlikely as well, unless the case is specifically related to Egypt or involves Egyptian nationals. However, even if there were a connection to Egypt, the term itself is too broad to pinpoint an accurate location for excavation. Lastly, a \\"cemetery\\" might be associated with burials, but it is not a place where excavation typically occurs - especially in the context of a murder investigation. Exhuming a buried body in a cemetery would generally require a specific and compelling reason. In conclusion, selecting the \\"construction site\\" option makes the most sense in the context of a reopened murder case. This is primarily due to its relevance to the investigative process and greater likelihood of yielding evidence compared to the other options provided."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - flat - bend - and shout - straighten - unravel The answer is \\"and shout\\" because Answer:","completion":"The option \\"and shout\\" is the correct response, referencing a popular old song that became a cultural phenomenon, renowned for getting people on the dance floor for decades. This song, \\"Twist and Shout,\\" was first recorded by the Top Notes in 1961 and later covered by several other musicians, including the Beatles in 1963, which led to its fame and worldwide recognition. The \\"Twist\\" in the song's title isn't merely a part of the lyrics; it corresponds to a dance style that became popular in the 60s - known as the Twist dance. This dance involves standing with feet approximately shoulder width apart and twisting the hips in one direction and then the other. It was one of the foundational dances of the era and was simplistic enough that everyone could participate. \\"And Shout\\" refers to the song's expressive and rhythmic vocal line which encourages enthusiastic participation from the audience, with shouts and hollers often punctuating the lyrics at concerts and social gatherings. This aspect of engagement and interaction made it favored among the party scene, and it continues to be a crowd favorite at weddings, parties, and other social gatherings up till this day. In the context of the question, the actions \\"flat,\\" \\"bend,\\" \\"straighten,\\" or \\"unravel,\\" are not related to or associated with the song in any way. None of these actions express or signify any key elements or actions associated with the iconic song \\"Twist and Shout.\\" Therefore, the best and most accurate option to choose is \\"and shout.\\" Moreover, the impact and influence of the song \\"Twist and Shout\\" have transcended generations. It is not only remembered as one of the greatest dance songs but also as an embodiment of the energy and carefree spirit of the 60s. Its endurance as a pop culture phenomenon proves its timeless appeal and universal popularity, which can be attributed to its lively rhythm, memorable chorus, and the fun of dancing the Twist. So when people are asked what they do with the old song about twisting, they \\"and shout,\\" meaning they engage with it, often by singing loudly (shouting) and dancing (twisting) enthusiastically, replicating the joy, energy, and enthusiasm that the song initially and still continues to inspire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen. - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling). - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine. - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland. - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match. - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature. - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\" \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\" \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives. - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living. - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs. Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Help as much as you can. Given a passage and a query based on the passage, generate an unambiguous, concise and simple answer to the query from information in the passage. Note that the answer may not be present in exact form. At least, that’s the conclusion I draw from looking at the history of corrections of the S&P 500 Index based on daily data going back to December 30, 1949. Now that major indexes have officially entered correction territory, investors are wondering how long corrections tend to last. Let’s start with the worst-case scenario of a bear market. If a bear market is a move of 20% or more from peak-to-trough and a correction is a move of 10% to just under 20%, then the average bear market is a drop of 31.6% (median of 30.3%). I don’t think this is the start of a bear, though. As long as the future trend remains optimistic, the buying will resume. That leads to an even stronger bull market rally. In other words, a stock market correction can help the stock market catch its breath and hit even higher peaks. Most recessions occur with stock market declines of 30 percent or more. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. The current pattern looks more like 2011 than 1998, with some significant economic differences. All stock market corrections are different, but some follow patterns. How long do corrections last? Corrections generally last two months or less. They usually end when the price of a stock or a bond 'bottoms out'—for example, some will point to a stock reaching a 52-week low—and investors start buying again. How is a correction different from a bear market or capitulation? The stock market typically has a correction several times a year. For example, between 1983 and 2011, more than half of all quarters had a correction. That averages out to 2.27 per year. A stock market crash is when the 10 percent price drop occurs in just one day. Crashes can lead to a bear market. That's when the market falls another 10 percent, for a total decline of 20 percent or more. A stock market crash can cause a recession. The stock market usually makes up the losses in three months or so. If you sell during the correction, you will probably not buy in time to make up your losses. Corrections are inevitable. Is a correction good for the market? Many investors and analysts look at corrections as a necessary 'evil' to cool off an overheated stock or bond market. This is to prevent a huge sell-off or 'bubble burst,' as what happened with Internet stocks in 2000-2001. Definition: A stock market correction is when the market falls 10 percent from its 52-week high. Wise investors welcome it. A pullback allows the market to consolidate before going toward higher highs. Each of the bull markets in the last 40 years has had a correction. It's a natural part of the market cycle. Corrections can occur in any asset class. A correction is a decline or downward movement of a stock, or a bond, or a commodity or market index. The amount of the decline is at least 10 percent and a true correction exceeds that amount. In short, corrections are price declines that stop an upward trend.

It provides a place for religious activities, work and housing of Christian monks and nuns. The concept of the abbey has developed over many centuries from the early monastic ways of religious men and women where they would live isolated from the lay community about them. Religious life in an abbey may be monastic. An abbey may be the home of an enclosed religious order or may be open to visitors. The layout of the church and associated buildings of an abbey often follows a set plan determined by the founding religious order. Abbeys are often self-sufficient while using any abundance of produce or skill to provide care to the poor and needy, refuge to the persecuted or education to the young. Some abbeys offer accommodation to people who are seeking spiritual retreat. There are many famous abbeys across Europe. - Tides are the rise and fall of sea levels caused by the combined effects of the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun and the rotation of the Earth. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands.

A second tier was added later and opened in 1980 to accommodate road traffic. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

Plans were probably first made to construct the castle in 1284, but this was delayed due to lack of funds and work only began in 1295 following the Madog ap Llywelyn uprising. A substantial workforce was employed in the initial years under the direction of James of St George. Edward's invasion of Scotland soon diverted funding from the project, however, and work stopped, only recommencing after an invasion scare in 1306. When work finally ceased around 1330 a total of £15,000 had been spent, a huge sum for the period, but the castle remained incomplete. - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan.

It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Anglesey or Ynys Môn is an island off the north-west coast of Wales. With an area of , Anglesey is by far the largest island of Wales and the fifth-largest island in the British Isles. Anglesey is also the largest island in the Irish Sea by area, and the second most populous island in the Irish Sea (after the Isle of Man). The population at the 2011 census was 69,751. Two bridges span the Menai Strait, connecting the island to the mainland: the Menai Suspension Bridge, designed by Thomas Telford in 1826, and the Britannia Bridge. - The Angles were one of the main Germanic peoples who settled in Britain in the post-Roman period.

Better late than never for Ian Poulter, who on Thursday produced what he considers his best round of a dreadful year at the penultimate tournament of the season. A dusted-off putter from better times made the difference, leaving him second in the Turkish Airlines Open after an eight-under-par round. By his own four-letter description, Poulter’s 2014 campaign has been woeful, with injuries, a missed cut at The Open, Twitter rows and an underwhelming Ryder Cup by his standards. In that time his world ranking tumbled from 12th to 44, leaving him in danger of slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since September 2006. But Thursday afternoon there were signs that the 38-year-old was somewhere close to his best, following a sixth-placed finish in China last week with a sublime round of seven birdies, an eagle and only one dropped shot. Ian Poulter insists he is 'feeling right now' after a year in which he has 'played s***' as he moves second. Miguel Angel Jimenez leads the Turkish Airlines Open on nine under par, a shot ahead of Poulter. He cited the new Titleist clubs he switched to after the Ryder Cup as well a putter he unearthed from the 2013 Open, in which he finished third. ‘I’d played s*** all year,’ Poulter said. ‘There’s no other word for it. It was disappointing. There was nothing good coming out of 2014. ‘It’s been tough to take, it really has. I thought I was doing the right things at the start of the year and took a massive step backwards with injuries and trying to play through them is not good. ‘That’s a horrible spiral to be in when you’ve got two tour cards to make sure you maintain. Thankfully I’m feeling right now.’ Poulter (left, taking an approach shot on the 11 and right, his reaction to the shot) is second on eight under par. Poulter added: ‘I am having a boost at the right time. Sometimes you get a new car and it makes you feel good. I got new sticks in the bag. It felt great to be able to do that and that they worked really quickly. ‘When you get something new you are excited to use it. I have been excited for the last couple of weeks. I am happy with everything.’ Miguel Angel Jimenez led by a stroke on a day that all but eliminated Jamie Donaldson’s chances of snatching the Race to Dubai from Rory McIlroy. The Welshman needs to win here and in Dubai next week while hoping McIlroy finishes outside the top five when he returns in the desert. But a level-par round of 72 left the Ryder Cup player nine shots behind Jimenez, while the other two Race contenders in Sergio Garcia and Victor Dubuisson were horribly off the pace, shooting rounds of 75 and 77 respectively. Meanwhile, Turkey insists it is still bidding to host the 2022 Ryder Cup, a day after announcing their withdrawal over environmental concerns. Wales' Jamie Donaldson is now highly unlikely to catch Rory McIlroy in the Race to Dubai. The Welshman had a poor day and will hope to recover at in Antalya over the next few rounds.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000. During these trips the NSC, Treasury, and intelligence representatives spoke with Saudi officials, and later interviewed members of the Bin Laden family, about Usama's inheritance.

Write a summary based on this article: It is difficult to convey the excitement I first felt when it was revealed that His Holiness Pope Francis was invited to Washington D.C. to address the world from the floor of the House of Representatives. Many believed, like I did, that this was an opportunity for the Pope to be one of the world’s great religious advocates and address the current intolerance of religious freedom. An opportunity to urgently challenge governments to properly address the persecution and execution of Christians and religious minorities; to address the heinous and senseless murders committed by ISIS and other terrorist organizations. An opportunity to address the enslavement, belittlement, rape and desecration of Christian women and children; to address the condoned, subsidized, intentionally planned genocide of unborn children by Planned Parenthood and society; and finally, an opportunity for His Holiness to refocus our priorities on right from wrong. Media reports indicate His Holiness instead intends to focus the brunt of his speech on climate change--a climate that has been changing since first created in Genesis. More troubling is the fact that this climate change talk has adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into “climate justice” and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies. If the Pope stuck to standard Christian theology, I would be the first in line. If the Pope spoke out with moral authority against violent Islam, I would be there cheering him on. If the Pope urged the Western nations to rescue persecuted Christians in the Middle East, I would back him wholeheartedly. But when the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one. Artist and columnist Maureen Mullarkey effectively communicated this fallacy stating, “When papal preferences, masked in a Christian idiom, align themselves with ideological agendas (e.g. radical environmentalism) [they] impinge on democratic freedoms and the sanctity of the individual.” The earth’s climate has been changing since God created it, with or without man. On that, we should all agree. In Pope Francis’ encyclical on the environment (written with the consultation of that great seminary the EPA and its embattled head Gina McCarthy), he condemned anyone skeptical of the link between human activity and climate change and adopted the false science being propagated by the Left. If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous. Furthermore, I am a proud Catholic. I chose to attend a Jesuit college in the Midwest, not just for my undergraduate but also my graduate studies (D.D.S.). I received an excellent education where I was taught to think critically, to welcome debate and discussion and to be held accountable for my actions; a trademark of a Jesuit education. And finally, I am a Conservative, a member of Congress, a constitutionalist and adamant defender of our Republic; an American that believes in strict adherence to the rule of law and a firm believer in our First Amendment protections, in this particular discussion, the freedom of religion. So at this pivotal moment in world history, His Holiness, Pope Francis, is intending to spend the majority of his time on one of the world’s greatest stages focusing on climate change. I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life. If the Pope plans to spend the majority of his time advocating for flawed climate change policies, then I will not attend. It is my hope that Pope Francis realizes his time is better spent focusing on matters like religious tolerance and the sanctity of all life. As the leader of the Catholic Church, and as a powerful voice for peace throughout the world, His Holiness has a real opportunity to change the climate of slaughter in the Middle East… not the fool’s errand of climate change. ||||| Rep. Paul Gosar, an Arizona Republican and a Catholic, said Friday he will boycott next week’s address to Congress by Pope Francis because he believes the pope will focus on climate change instead of “religious tolerance and the sanctity of life.” Gosar published an op-ed on the conservative news site Townhall: “I have both a moral obligation and leadership responsibility to call out leaders, regardless of their titles, who ignore Christian persecution and fail to embrace opportunities to advocate for religious freedom and the sanctity of human life.” The he dismissed the pope’s recent encyclical calling for swift action on climate change, saying the climate has been changing “since God created it, with or without man … If the Pope wants to devote his life to fighting climate change then he can do so in his personal time. But to promote questionable science as Catholic dogma is ridiculous.” Gosar added, “When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one.” The congressman reiterated those concerns to reporters Friday afternoon, saying he will not attend “without assurances” the pope would not focus his comments on climate change. He said “there are others that have gone to Rome to ask him to talk about the genocide that is occurring,” but it is clear that “he’s going to talk about climate change.” While Gosar was the only congressman saying he would boycott the speech, he was not the only one raising concerns about the pope’s choice of topics. Rep. John Fleming, R-La., told USA TODAY on Friday, “What I’m a little concerned about is that the pope seems to distract at times from some of the most important issues of faith — which is life — and he talks about issues like climate change.” The pope has “made some statements that would suggest that there may be certain level of acceptance of abortion,” Fleming said, and he would like to see the pope use his remarks to “re-emphasize the importance of protecting life and preventing abortion.” ||||| The seed for Wide00014 was: - Slash pages from every domain on the web: -- a ranking of all URLs that have more than one incoming inter-domain link (rank was determined by number of incoming links using Wide00012 inter domain links) -- up to a maximum of 100 most highly ranked URLs per domain - Top ranked pages (up to a max of 100) from every linked-to domain using the Wide00012 inter-domain navigational link graph |||||","completion":"The author expresses excitement about Pope Francis being invited to address the world from the floor of the House of Representatives but is disappointed with the apparently chosen topic for the speech - climate change.

In this entry the dominant role goes to Boris Karloff. Through specially designed astronomical equipment, Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) demonstrates to colleagues Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi), Sir Frances Stevens (Walter Kingsford), his wife Lady Stevens (Beulah Bondi) and their nephew Ronald Drake (Frank Lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the African continent many millions of years in the past. Rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to Africa to find the mysterious element. Rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names \\"Radium X\\". Due to Rukh's long absences, his comely young wife Diana (Frances Drake) becomes attracted to Drake and the two fall in love. Meanwhile Rukh becomes contaminated by Radium X to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. The contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark. Rukh goes to Benet for help. Benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. Unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects Rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer. While Rukh is continuing his work, Sir Frances takes news of the discovery back to France. Diana and Ronald accompany him. When Benet informs him of this action, Rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge.

Question: The seventh ruler of the dynasty in China that started in 206 BC and ended in 220 AD was? Context: The Xiongnu, a nomadic steppe confederation, defeated the Han in 200 BC and forced the Han to submit as a de facto inferior partner, but continued their raids on the Han borders. Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BC) launched several military campaigns against them. The ultimate Han victory in these wars eventually forced the Xiongnu to accept vassal status as Han tributaries. These campaigns expanded Han sovereignty into the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, divided the Xiongnu into two separate confederations, and helped establish the vast trade network known as the Silk Road, which reached as far as the Mediterranean world. The territories north of Han's borders were quickly overrun by the nomadic Xianbei confederation. Emperor Wu also launched successful military expeditions in the south, annexing Nanyue in 111 BC and Dian in 109 BC, and in the Korean Peninsula where the Xuantu and Lelang Commanderies were established in 108 BC.

Samantha Adeokun, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her partner Peter Davegun, 42, in a brutal attack on December 23 last year. Stafford Crown Court heard she flew into a rage and beat her boyfriend by kicking and punching him as he curled up in a ball to protect himself. Samantha Adeokun, 41, from Silverdale, Lancashire, is accused of killing her on/off partner of six years Peter Davegun, 42, (above) by punching, kicking and beating him with a metal guitar stand until he fell unconcious. He suffered multiple injuries to his head and body after also being bludgeoned with a metal guitar stand leaving behind 'a bloodbath', jurors were told. Emergency services arrived at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after Adeokun waited one hour to dial 999. She claimed her partner had fallen and hit his head on a TV stand after tripping on a mat. Paramedics arrived just before 2.45pm and found Mr Davegun's body lying in the foetal position on his bedroom floor. The court heard he had extensive bruising and bite marks on his body and had suffered severe internal injuries and seven fractured ribs. He was pronounced dead at the property at around 3.20pm. Adeokun went on trial yesterday accused of murdering her on-off partner of six years following the drunken row. Prosecutor Deborah Gould, opening the case, said: 'The prosecution case says the defendant literally beat him to death using her fists, feet and part of a guitar stand. Stafford Crown Court heard how 41-year-old Adeokun allegedly attacked her partner at his flat in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire (above) on December 23 last year during a drunken row. Mr Davegun died from his injuries. The court heard how Adeokun waited nearly one hour before calling emergency services after the alleged attack. When police arrived, Mr Davegun was found unconscious in a pool of blood and was pronounced dead. 'At least part of the time she was doing this, she was bleeding and standing above him. 'She struck him repeatedly, causing significant internal bruising and bleeding. She struck him from behind and from the front. 'You will hear from the pathologist that there's evidence he was struck while on the ground in the foetal position. 'After the attack, the defendant telephoned her daughter and said she was sorry. She said she and the deceased had a fight. 'She said she had been defending herself and Mr Davegun was, at that stage, unconscious. 'When her daughter asked if she had called 999, the defendant said she hadn't because she needed to get dressed because she had blood on her. 'She changed out of her clothing. Then, nearly an hour afterwards, she called paramedics, claiming Mr Davegun had fallen, hit his head and been unconscious for 40 minutes.' Adeokun denies murdering Mr Davegun and claims he fell and hit his head after tripping on a mat at the flat. The jury also heard a recording of the 999 call Adeokun made during which she described the scene as a 'bloodbath'. She told the operator: 'We had a big argument earlier on and he's just fell. 'I cut my finger and it looks bad. I cut my finger and it looks like I've killed him.' Adeokun denies murder. The trial continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: No doubt you already have a good idea of what temperature is. You might say that it’s how warm or cool something feels. In physics, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles of matter move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy, so their temperature is higher. With a higher temperature, matter feels warmer. When particles move more slowly, they have less kinetic energy on average, so their temperature is lower. With a lower temperature, matter feels cooler. Now, I have a new situation: David is a physicist. He teaches school children how matters and energy work. One day he was teaching them about two particles of matter, particle A and particle B. Particle A moves faster, but particle B moves slower. He was showing the children about different characteristics of moving particles. Answer this question please: Which particle would have higher temperature, particle A or particle B? Answer:","completion":"In this situation, particle A moves faster while particle B moves slower. As stated in the background information, temperature is defined as the average kinetic energy of the particles of matter. When particles move more quickly, they have more kinetic energy and, consequently, a higher temperature. In contrast, particles with less kinetic energy have a lower temperature, which is the case for slower-moving particles. Therefore, based on this information, particle A would have a higher temperature compared to particle B, since particle A moves faster and has more kinetic energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As of 2015, the population was 48,210. It is the county seat of Albemarle County, which surrounds the city, though the two are separate legal entities. Charlottesville has eighteen distinctive neighborhoods. It is named after the British Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz. The Bureau of Economic Analysis combines the City of Charlottesville with the County of Albemarle for statistical purposes, bringing its steadily growing population to approximately 150,000. Charlottesville is the heart of the Charlottesville metropolitan area, which includes Albemarle, Fluvanna, Greene and Nelson counties. - Bella Morte is a gothic band that was formed in 1996 in Charlottesville, Virginia, USA. They incorporate elements of metal, dark wave, deathrock, alternative and synthpop. The band's name means \\"beautiful death\\" in Italian. According to Andy Deane, the name was chosen to \\"suggest that beauty can be found in tragedy\\", which is a theme occurring in every Bella Morte album. - Founded in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1993, Metropolis Records has developed a strong reputation over the years as a leader in various genres of underground music. Though widely known for electro-industrial, synthpop, future pop, darkwave, and gothic music, the label has always operated with a bent towards all genres of dark alternative music, be it electronics-based or post-punk. - Bleed the Grey Sky Black is Bella Morte 's fourth release on Metropolis Records . It reached # 1 on Metropolis ' pre-order sales in September 2006 . - Dark wave or darkwave is a musical term used for dark, usually gothic rock-influenced music that incorporates synthesizers, or elements of new wave and synthpop, although the term is also applied to post-punk bands that produce a dark atmosphere. The label began to appear in the late 1970s in German music media, coinciding with the popularity of new wave and post-punk. Building on those basic principles, dark wave is used to describe dark, introspective lyrics and an undertone of sorrow for some bands. In the 1980s, a subculture developed primarily in Europe alongside dark wave music, whose members were called \\"wavers\\" or \\"dark wavers\\". - Synthpop (also known as \\"technopop\\"), a subgenre of new wave music first became prominent in the late 1970s and features the synthesizer as the dominant musical instrument. It was prefigured in the 1960s and early 1970s by the use of synthesizers in progressive rock, electronic, art rock, disco, and particularly the \\"Krautrock\\" of bands like Kraftwerk. It arose as a distinct genre in Japan and the United Kingdom in the post-punk era as part of the new wave movement of the late-1970s to the mid-1980s. - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture. - Post-punk (originally \\"new musick\\") is a broad type of rock music that emerged from the punk movement of the 1970s, in which artists departed from punk rock's raw, accessible style to pursue a variety of avant-garde sensibilities. Attempting to break from rock tradition, post-punk artists experimented with sources such as electronic music, black dance music and the avant-garde, as well as novel recording technology and production techniques. The movement also saw the frequent intersection of music with art and politics, as artists incorporated ideas from sources such as modernist literature, critical theory, cinema, and performance art. Accompanying these musical developments were communities that produced independent record labels, visual art, multimedia performances and fanzines in conjunction with the music. - Deathrock is a subgenre of punk rock incorporating horror elements and spooky atmospherics, that emerged on the West Coast of the United States in the early 1980s. Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'bleed the grey sky black'.

Nursing studies emotions as part of its approach to the provision of holistic health care to humans. Psychology examines emotions from a scientific perspective by treating them as mental processes and behavior and they explore the underlying physiological and neurological processes. In neuroscience sub-fields such as social neuroscience and affective neuroscience, scientists study the neural mechanisms of emotion by combining neuroscience with the psychological study of personality, emotion, and mood. In linguistics, the expression of emotion may change to the meaning of sounds. In education, the role of emotions in relation to learning is examined.

First question: Real life applications of limits in calculus. Imagine you're eating your favorite candy little by little. You can say that the candy's size is \\"going towards\\" zero as you keep taking small bites. In math, we use limits to talk about how things like candy move closer and closer to a certain point. Now, an example from real life: when engineers design bridges or cars, they use limits to understand how strong they should be to handle heavy loads! Second question: Real life applications of the RPM formula. You know when you ride your bicycle, and the wheels spin really fast? We can talk about how many times the wheel spins in a minute using \\"RPM,\\" which stands for \\"Revolutions Per Minute.\\" It's a way to measure how fast something is spinning. There are many real life applications of the RPM formula, like in cars. People who make engines and machines need to figure out how fast the parts inside them should spin to work well. Now, let's see if these two questions are asking the same thing. The first question talks about \\"limits\\" in math and how we use them in real life. The second question is about the \\"RPM formula\\" and its real life applications. They are different because one is about limits in calculus and the other is about a formula for how fast something spins. So, they are not asking the same thing.

Please answer the following question: What do apples, pears and oranges all have in common? If you answered that they are all fruits you are absolutely correct. If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%. As Tim wrote in a previous blog post, this is reason why you should be eating your fruit, not drinking it According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classified the Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the Métis.

Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%.

I wonder if Colby made it... Colby [whispering to a friend]: I heard Malia might show up. Have you seen her? Friend: I haven't, but there are so many people here - it's hard to tell. Speaker: The professor made a great impact on all our lives... Malia [remembers a moment with the professor]: He truly did. We wouldn't have become friends without his guidance. Colby [whispering to the friend]: Remember that project Malia and I did together? It was one of the best times we've had. Friend: Yeah, you guys were so passionate about it. Malia [checking her phone]: Oh, I've just received a message from an unknown number. Unknown number: Hey, Malia! It's been ages. This is Colby. Trying to spot you in the crowd, but it's massive. Hope you're doing well. Malia [grinning]: It's so good to hear from him! I should let him know where I am. Malia [texting back]: Hi Colby! I'm near the entrance. Can't believe how many people came to pay their respects. As the ceremony wraps up and people start leaving, Malia and Colby continue to exchange messages, reminiscing about their time with the professor and their experiences in college. Aided by these digital breadcrumbs, they slowly but steadily make their way towards each other through the dissipating crowd. Colby [approaching Malia]: Hey! Malia [smiling]: Colby! It's been so long! Colby [embracing Malia]: I know, but I'm glad we finally found each other. Malia: It feels like life always had a way of keeping us apart... Colby: But that's never stopped us before, has it? Malia: No, it hasn't. Despite the odds, we always find our way back to each other... just like today. Colby [looking around at the crowd]: It's bittersweet, reuniting like this. Malia: I agree, but I know the professor would be happy to see us together again. Colby: That's true. Let's catch up and remember him, hand-in-hand. Malia: That sounds perfect. As Malia and Colby exit the hall hand-in-hand, their reunion marks the beginning of a new chapter in their friendship. The love and respect they shared for their professor not only brought them back together, but also inspired them to rekindle their bond in his memory."},{"prompt":"Question: When was Croft electrocuted?

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Sports shoes that work out whether their owner has done enough exercise to promise time in front of the television have been devised in the UK. The shoes- named Square Eyes- contain an electronic pressure sensor and a tiny computer chip to record how many steps the wearer has taken in a day. A wireless transmitter passes the information to a receiver connected to a television, and this decides how much evening viewing time the wearer deserves , based on the day's efforts. The design was inspired by a desire to fight against the rapidly ballooning waistlines among British teenagers, says Gillian Swan, who developed Square Eyes as a final year design project at Brunel University in London, UK. \\"We looked at current issues and childhood overweight really stood out,\\" she says. \\"And I wanted to tackle that with my design.\\" Once a child has used up their daily allowance gained through exercise, the television automatically switches off. And further time in front of the TV can only be earned through more steps. Swan calculated how exercise should translate to television time using the recommended daily amounts of both. Health experts suggest that a child take 12,000 steps each day and watch no more than two hours of television. So, every 100 steps recorded by the Square Eyes shoes equals exactly one minute of TV time. Existing pedometers normally clip onto a belt or slip into a pocket and keep count of steps by measuring sudden movement. Swan says these can be easily tricked into recording steps through shaking. But her shoe has been built to be harder for lazy teenagers to cheat. \\"It is possible, but it would be a lot of effort,\\" she says. \\"That was one of my main design considerations.\\" Answer:","completion":"Multi-choice question: What is the main feature of the Square Eyes sports shoes, and what inspired their creation?

Vi Ripken was able to scare off the man, who was later apprehended by Aberdeen police, by activating the panic alarm on her key fob. She was uninjured, and the man ran away without taking anything, said Lt. Fred Budnick, an Aberdeen police spokesman. She was approached outside the NBRS branch in the 200 block of W. Bel Air Ave. about 3 p.m., Budnick said. \\"Detectives are looking at what exactly transpired,\\" he said. Jesse A. Bowen, 33, of the 800 block of Lafayette St. in Havre de Grace was charged with attempted armed robbery, attempted armed car jacking, possessing a dangerous weapon, first-degree assault and controlled substance related charges in connection with the incident, police said Wednesday morning. Bowen is being held without bail at the Harford County Detention Center. There was no physical assault and no theft, Budnick said, and employees at the bank called police. The incident was the second in just over a year involving Vi Ripken in Aberdeen, a community known for its low crime rate. \\"It's a little unusual,\\" for her to be the victim of two crimes in a relatively short period, Budnick said, adding that Tuesday's incident \\"appears to be a crime of opportunity.\\" In July 2012, Ripken was taken at gunpoint from her longtime home in Aberdeen, bound and driven around in her car, then released unharmed after about 24 hours. Police have not identified a suspect in that case. In August, the former Orioles great announced a 100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the kidnapper. Earlier this year, Ripken told The Baltimore Sun that her abduction left her worried but that she was determined not to let it ruin her life. Police said Tuesday's incident does not appear to be related to her kidnapping. \\"There is no indication he had any involvement in last year's case. And there's no indication he knew who she was,\\" Budnick said. \\"Right now, it appears to be a crime of opportunity rather than a targeted issue.\\" Detectives investigating the incident thought they were familiar with the suspect from descriptions and were able to put a name with the face and track him down, Budnick said.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Snow removal is underway at Ronald Reagan National Airport. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) It’s not that 17.8 inches of snow wasn’t enough. But the number that will go down in the history books as Washington’s official total — recorded at Reagan National Airport — is downright paltry compared with some other spots in the region, raising the question: Why the disparity? The reason, it turns out, may be partly due to the improvised technique used by a small team of weather observers at the airport who lost their snow-measuring device to the elements midway through the blizzard. It was buried by the very snow it was supposed to measure. The mix-up, some say, may have kept the blizzard of 2016 from breaking into the region’s top three snowstorms on record, based on accumulations. It has also brought into focus the mechanics of how snow depth is counted and has prompted the National Weather Service to announce it will look into the procedures used at the airport. Mark Richards, senior weather observer at National, stood by the accuracy of the reading Sunday, saying his team did the best it could under tough conditions. But he acknowledged that the team had to abandon the standard measuring process when they lost the tool typically used to tally totals, called a snow board. “We would like it to be as accurate as possible,” Richards said. “… But it’s an inexact science. Everyone has to understand that measuring snow in a blizzard is a tough thing to do.” Susan Buchanan, a National Weather Service spokeswoman, said Sunday that the agency would assemble a team Monday to conduct a “comprehensive assessment of how snow measurements are taken” at National and other locations. She said the agency would make suggestions after its review. [In detail: How much snow fell in the Washington, D.C., region] The National Weather Service has clear guidelines on how to measure snowfall for one simple reason: Snowstorms have a huge effect on the economy, life and property. They cost millions of dollars. How much snow falls may determine whether additional relief is sent into a location after a major storm. The timeline of snowfall on Saturday suggests something was askew at National. At 8 p.m. Saturday, 17.8 inches of snow had been recorded there. Although snow continued to fall until midnight, that was the final measurement that the airport submitted to the National Weather Service. The measurement reflects a 0.3-inch increase in the three hours between 5 and 8 p.m., during which time light to moderate snowfall was being reported at the airport. It also reflects no additional snow accumulation in the four hours after 8 p.m. Significantly higher preliminary snowfall totals were reported at the region’s two other airports. Dulles International recorded 29.3 inches, while Thurgood Marshall-BWI Airport recorded 29.2 inches. Teams at both of those airports used snow boards. Still, Richards, who has been monitoring weather at National for 30 years, said the totals were not that far off from areas in nearby Arlington and Alexandria. Near National, a weather observer trained by the National Weather Service reported 19.4 inches one mile northwest of the airport in the Crystal City neighborhood. At the White House, approximately 3.5 miles north, 22 inches were recorded. Many residents question why Washington’s official weather records are measured at an airport on the river in Virginia, which may not be representative of the weather in the city. “People use National Airport as the weather centerpiece of the entire region, but it’s the warmest location in the entire region,” said Bob Leffler, a retired National Weather Service climatologist . “It’s just not a good site.” The blizzard was the snowiest storm on record at BWI, surpassing the 26.8 inches measured on Feb. 16-18, 2003. It was the second-snowiest storm on record at Dulles, coming in just behind Feb. 5-6, 2010, when “Snowmageddon” overtook the region. [Mr. President, move Washington’s weather observations to the White House] The National Weather Service requires that snow be measured with a snow board, which can be little more than a piece of plywood painted white. The board should be placed on the ground before the storm starts in a location that will be undisturbed by drifting. When the storm starts, snow should be measured every six hours, and then the board should be swiped clear. But once the storm got going Friday night, the board was buried and the observer could no longer locate the board. Instead, he took multiple snow depth measurements and averaged them. This is what was reported to the National Weather Service; it wasn’t snowfall, but rather snow depth. “Snow boards are the standard to use — when you can use them.” Richards said. “Snow boards are just not effective in a storm that has very strong winds its just going to blow off.” But without the use of a snow board, the measurement is questionable. Jim Lee, the meteorologist in charge at the National Weather Service in Sterling, Va., said he agrees that if the snow hasn’t been measured by the guidelines, the totals are “perishable.” [Should National remain D.C.’s official weather station?] Leffler, also the author of the Weather Service snow measurement guidelines, said that depending on the density of the snow, the loss of the snow board may have kept the total 10 or even 20 percent too low. That adjustment would push National’s total past 20 inches. It also cannot be compared with the region’s other airports. “I can tell you with 100 percent certainty” that the measurements were performed by the guidelines at Dulles, Lee said. He said he knows this because his office is responsible for those measurements, and they used a snow board and swiped it every six hours.

The Washington region on Sunday lurched fitfully from under one of the heaviest snowfalls in memory, with federal and local governments set to be closed on Monday, the Metro system prepared to offer severely limited service Monday, and authorities warning that it could take days for the plows to reach some residential streets. Metro, which records more than 730,000 rail trips on an average weekday, said it would resume service on a fraction of its operations — partial service on three underground rail lines and 22 bus routes — after being shut down for the weekend by the storm. Virtually all school systems and colleges in the region said they would be closed Monday. The federal government and state and county governments also said they would be closed Monday. [Live updates on Monday as Washington digs out] Authorities urged drivers to stay off the roads and pedestrians to stay out of the streets. They said that digging out from a storm that lasted almost 36 hours and delivered more than two feet of snow in some areas will hobble movement well into the workweek. In addition to paralyzing the region, the storm brought airplane traffic in and out of the region’s three major airports to a virtual halt. Reagan National and Dulles International airports said late Sunday that their runways had been cleared of snow to allow limited operations to resume Monday, but flights weren’t expected to return to normal for days, causing the U.S. House of Representatives to cancel an abbreviated session that was planned from Monday to Wednesday. [The full list of what is closed today] The last of the snow fell in the region around 11:45 p.m. Saturday. Totals ranged from 10 inches to 35 inches and more, with the heaviest accumulation to the north and west of the city, outside the Capital Beltway. The National Zoo in Northwest Washington got 22.4 inches; Hyattsville, in Prince George’s County, got 25 inches; 30 inches fell in Manassas; and Round Hill, in Loudoun County, got three feet. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) asked people to be patient, saying that “getting back to business as usual will take time.” Gregory Johnson of the Maryland State Highway Administration said the state’s primary roadways will be cleared by Monday morning. The secondary roads will still be snow-covered, “with a lot of work to be done.” “I’m pleased with the progress that we’ve made,” said Hogan, reiterating his appeal for drivers to stay off the roads. “We’ve been lucky with no fatalities. We want to keep it that way.” Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) and the state’s transportation secretary, Aubrey Layne, toured the hardest-hit areas by helicopter Sunday. McAuliffe said Saturday that snow removal cost the commonwealth 2 million to 3 million per hour. What's the proper technique for shoveling snow? A physical therapist offers specific tips for protecting your back while you dig out this winter. (Jhaan Elker/The Washington Post) “It’s going to be one of the largest snow-removal efforts that we’ve had in Northern Virginia — one of the most expensive — because some of it’s so high,” Layne said. “It’s a lot of snow. It’s just a heck of a lot of snow.” [The final snow totoals, in detail] In the District, police said they would ticket and tow the cars of drivers who venture out and get stuck. “If you come out, you get yourself stuck on one of our streets, I have to tell you: We will aggressively ticket you, and tow your vehicle,” D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said Sunday. “We want to have tomorrow to keep cars off the road so we can continue to clear those major arterials.” Police Chief Cathy L. Lanier said the tickets could cost as much as 750, and she warned that people also could be fined for walking in the street. “We’re going to have to start stepping up and being a little more aggressive about asking our public not to be out, walking in the streets,” Lanier said. Metro will open at 7 a.m. with limited service on the Red, Orange and Green lines as follows: The Orange Line will run between the Ballston and Eastern Market stations, the Red Line will run between Medical Center and Union Station, and the Green Line will run between Fort Totten and Anacostia. Trains will run every 20 to 25 minutes, the agency said. Fares will not be charged. Buses will run on what Metro is calling “lifeline service” on 22 lines only, from noon to 5 p.m., every half-hour. D.C. officials said there was no telling precisely how long it will take to clear the snow. “Two feet of snow is a lot to move,” Chris T. Geldart, director of the District’s Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency, said Sunday. “We’re going to be in our response phase for at least 24 to 36 hours, and the recovery phase for much longer than that.” Authorities in Prince George’s County said nearly 80 percent of the county’s main and secondary roads have been plowed. “For the next 48 to 72 hours we need you to be patient with us,” said County Executive Rushern L. Baker (D). “We need at least 24 hours for us to clear the primary streets and secondary roads before we can get into the neighborhoods.” The county government will be closed Monday. “I know people want to get out of your houses and move around, but we need you to stay at home as much as possible,” Baker said. Alexandria closed its streets to all but emergency vehicles Sunday. “With about two feet of snow, we have had 50 percent more snow in the past 36 hours than we typically have all winter,” said Mayor Allison Silberberg (D). “The roads are still treacherous, and the roads will melt a bit each day and then refreeze each night.” Silberberg said Alexandria had cleared virtually all its primary roads by late Sunday and that crews had shifted to secondary roads. She said residential streets would be tackled Monday or later. Montgomery County officials said crews are focusing on plowing primary roads. After that, they will move into the 4,000 lane-miles of neighborhood roads, county spokesman Patrick Lacefield said. [The power surprisingly stayed on across most of the region] “Crews are working around the clock, but we are not just having to plow, we are also having to carry away” loads of snow, Lacefield said. Where to put the more than two feet of snow that accumulated in many areas was a problem for officials, businesses and homeowners alike. In a lighter snow, plowing it or shoveling it aside is relatively easy, but this was too much snow to be shoved to one side. “Where are we going to put it all?” Hampton Inn manager Dorene Sapp said as she looked out from her hotel pavilion just off Leesburg Pike. “We are hoping for some melting but at this rate, I don’t know where it’s all going to go.” Just finding a shovel to dig out cars was a problem at the Sheraton and Hyatt parking lots near Dulles International Airport. Scott Morris, a Dulles Airport police officer who stayed in a hotel rather than driving home to the Shenandoah Valley, was close to digging his car out after a grueling hour. He brought his own shovel, which another guest offered 250 to buy. “I said, ‘At this point, pal, there’s not enough money in your pocket to get this from me,’ ” Morris said. When Ray Atkins’s neighbor, a tax judge, said he was due in court in North Carolina on Monday, the neighbors in the 1500 block of Garfield Street in Arlington went to work. Shovels deployed, six people cleared the three-foot-deep snow from the driveway and sidewalks so that the judge could get out. But while the judge may be able to leave his driveway now, he’s going nowhere else because the block, just off Wilson Boulevard, is packed deep with snow. Even before the snowfall began, Ngozi Johnson knew she’d need a strategy to deal with her daughter’s boredom from being stuck indoors. Thinking back to her own childhood — when she and her siblings would fan out across their neighborhood and help people dig out — Johnson went to Lowe’s and bought two shovels. On Sunday afternoon, with the District buried under two feet of snow, she; her daughter, 13-year-old Nandi Johnson; and her daughter’s best friend, 12-year-old Wendell Wray, hit the streets. “I thought this would probably be the best time to learn the true value of a dollar,” Ngozi Johnson said. [Where Snowzilla fits among D.C.’s top 10 snowstorms] Also recognizing a fresh entrepreneurial opportunity, Noel Lemus, Marcio Cruz and Osmin Fuentes were out at 9 a.m. Sunday with snow shovels ready. “We’ve been doing this for five years,” said Lemus, who said the men worked as electricians but shoveled snow on weekends as a side job. Lemus said he grew up in El Salvador and then spent 18 years in Southern California before seeing snow for the first time in Washington about six years ago. Asked whether he ever thought he’d be shoveling snow, he shrugged. “It’s just like the work in my home country,” he said. But it doesn’t snow in El Salvador, he was reminded. “No, but shoveling the dirt is the same.” It was shoveling with a deadline for many people, including Brian Boxman of North Potomac. He also wanted to be done digging out by 2:59 p.m. so he could get settled in front of his big-screen TV for the AFC Championship match between the New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos. His vision of the game, a beer and maybe nachos, kept the snow flying. “I’m under pressure,” he said as game time neared. Meanwhile, the number of people who died as a result of the storm increased. A Leesburg man had a heart attack and died early Sunday morning while trudging through waist-deep snow in an attempt to go home after working at a convenience store that had stayed open through the storm, police said. The man, whose identity has not been released, was in his 50s and collapsed around 2 a.m., police said. A resident saw him fall into the snow, called 911 and pulled the man inside a nearby home. Emergency responders were unable to revive him. “If the gentleman had been walking home on a sunny day, he probably would be alive,” said Leesburg police Lt. Brian Rourke. The man had tried to drive home after his shift at the convenience store, in the 700 block of Fieldstone Drive NE, but he abandoned his car after it got stuck and tried to walk the rest of the way home, Rourke said. Virginia authorities have attributed at least four other deaths to storm-related causes, and the storm had claimed at least 19 other fatalities nationwide as of Sunday morning. Other deaths included traffic fatalities, those from heart attacks while shoveling snow and two hypothermia deaths. One shoveling death was that of a 49-year old man from Abingdon, Md., northeast of Baltimore. ||||| A massive snowstorm descended on Washington, D.C., this weekend. | AP Photo Capitol police officer dies shoveling snow United States Capitol Police Officer Vernon Alston died of a heart attack on Saturday while he was shoveling snow at his home, according to an email sent to congressional officials by U.S. Capitol Police Chief Kim Dine. Alston, 44, began working for the Capitol Police in 1996, according to Dine's email. Alston collapsed in his garage and was taken to Kent County Hospital in Dover, Delaware, the email said. Story Continued Below Alston was pronounced dead on Saturday, the U.S. Capitol Police confirmed. “The death of Officer Alston is truly a tragic loss for the Alston family and the United States Capitol Police, which in fact is one in the same,” Dine said in the statement. “Officer Alston was someone who loved his job, and his loss leaves a huge void in the hearts of all of the men and women at the USCP.” Alston worked on the House Division of the Capitol Police and last worked on Friday, when a massive winter storm began descending on the Washington area. Congressional leaders expressed grief on Sunday morning upon hearing of Alston's death. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urged the congressional community to \\"all hold his family in our thoughts. He will be missed, but his service and dedication will no doubt be remembered by all who knew him.\\" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said in a statement: \\"I'm saddened to learn that the U.S. Capitol Police has lost one of our own over the weekend as a result of the storm. For 20 years, Officer Vernon Alston was a fixture on the Capitol grounds while keeping the community safe. I am always grateful for the dedication and sacrifice of the Capitol Police force and Officer Alston was an exemplar of that. My thoughts are with Officer Alston's family during this difficult time.\\" Rachael Bade contributed to this report. ||||| The House will be out of session this week due to “the severity of the winter storm in the D.C. area,” according to an email sent to lawmakers on Sunday. ADVERTISEMENT The House was already scheduled for a short week, with Democratic lawmakers attending their annual legislative retreat in Baltimore from Wednesday to Friday. More than 10,000 flights were canceled to and from the East Coast due to the blizzard this weekend, making air travel back to the nation’s capital a perilous prospect.

Weather observers at the airport reported a snow total of 17.8 inches, which some have argued is significantly lower than measurements taken at nearby locations during the same period. It has emerged that the weather observers had to abandon their usual measuring process when the snow-measuring device they were using was buried in the snow they were attempting to measure.

The cashier will slide the card through a special machine, and it will ask you to enter a secret number called a PIN. Your grown-up will help you with that. 6. Once you've entered the PIN, the machine will check if you have enough money on your EBT card. If you do, it will take the money off of the card and pay for your groceries. 7.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"As of 2001 , how many attorneys where on full role and how much money would the hike generate?\\" is \\"57,392 on the full roll- 2.6 million raise\\"?","completion":"Imagine there is a big group of helper people called lawyers in a place called Illinois. They sometimes need to pay extra money so they can help others who don't have much money, especially when there is not enough money coming from usual sources. So, the top judge and his friends decided to ask the lawyers to pay a little more. In the year 2001, there were 57,392 lawyers who could give this extra money, and if all of them did, they would raise about 2.4 million - that's a lot of money to help others in need!

All NBA teams have an interesting story or a history behind their names. Some of the names reflect the city's culture or history, others came from previous owners and many were selected through \\"Name the Team\\" contests. For teams like Los Angeles and Utah, the names were not always a reflection of the city. Even though Los Angeles has no lakes, the Laker name has been a city treasure for almost 40 years. Before going to Los Angeles, the team originated in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In 1948, team officials chose the name for its direct relationship to the state's motto, \\"The Land of 10,000 Lakes.\\" The team name went unchanged after moving to Los Angeles in 1960. Because Utah's team originated in New Orleans, Louisiana, it was called the Jazz. In 1974, New Orleans club officials chose the name to represent the city for its reputation as the \\"jazz capital of the world.\\" The name stayed with the team even after finding a new home in Salt Lake City, Utah in 1979. The Chicago Bull's original owner, Richard Klein, named the team the Bulls. He picked the name because a fighting bull is relentless, and never quits. Klein, who founded the club in1966, believed these qualities were necessary for a championship team and hoped his Chicago athletes would live up to the team name. A belief that Bulls----winner of the six NBA championships have definitely followed. In 1967, the Indian Pacers selected their team name in a different way from most other teams.

Seattle is a charter city, with a mayor–council form of government. From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party. All precincts in Seattle voted for Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama in the 2012 presidential election. In partisan elections for the Washington State Legislature and United States Congress, nearly all elections are won by Democrats. Although local elections are nonpartisan, most of the city's elected officials are known to be Democrats. In 1926, Seattle became the first major American city to elect a female mayor, Bertha Knight Landes. It has also elected an openly gay mayor, Ed Murray, and a third-party socialist councillor, Kshama Sawant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. I am facing a new situation today: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who has less abnormal cells in their body? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation, Charlotte has less abnormal cells in her body than Jason. This is because Jason has been diagnosed with cancer, a disease that causes cells to divide out of control due to mutations in genes controlling the cell cycle. These abnormal cells often lead to the development of tumors and damage to healthy tissues. On the other hand, Charlotte has been tested and found to have no cancer, only high blood pressure. While high blood pressure is a health concern, it does not involve the presence of abnormal cells like cancer does.

But it’s disturbing in a way that’s thought-provoking, while at the same time giving us an honest tour of one of the world’s most interesting pieces of land. “Breaking Borders” aims to visit places where there is ongoing tension, and see if the universal language of food can at least open a conversation. So host Mariana van Zeller is accompanied by chef Michael Voltaggio, and their first stop is Palestine, where Israelis and Palestinian Arabs coexist with, at best, unease. Much of the show is devoted to a quick tour of the city, noting areas of particular contention. It’s a great summation for viewers who usually find references like “West Bank” simply confusing. We also see Voltaggio hunting through shops and markets to find food that will be acceptable under the dietary laws of both Orthodox Jews and Palestinians. This in itself provides a fascinating sub-tour of the city. It all builds to the dinner, where guests include both Israeli settlers and Palestinians who want Israeli settlers to just get out. Not surprisingly, the conversation has sharp edges, and no one pretends it will end with a group hug and peace in our time. Still, the dialogue is civil enough to be illuminating, not just angry.

Answer the question...where does all the human waste go on a cruise ship??","completion":"On a cruise ship, managing human waste is a crucial aspect of ensuring the health and comfort of passengers and crew members, as well as protecting the environment. Human waste, also known as black water, includes sewage and wastewater generated from toilets and urinals. The disposal and treatment of such waste on a cruise ship involve a multi-step process that typically includes the following stages: 1. Collection: Human waste from toilets, urinals, and other sanitary facilities is collected through plumbing systems that lead to dedicated tanks or holding areas. These tanks are specifically designed to store black water temporarily onboard and can be constructed from materials such as stainless steel or advanced composites to prevent corrosion and leaks. 2. Treatment: Cruise ships utilize onboard sewage treatment systems to process black water. These systems can vary, but many ships use advanced wastewater purification technologies that cleanse and purify the waste before it is discharged overboard. Some of the primary methods of treatment may include: a. Biological Treatment: This process involves the use of aerobic bacteria that break down organic matter in the waste through anoxic and aerobic digestion. Biological treatment may happen in sequential batch reactors, moving bed biofilm reactors, or membrane bioreactors. b. Chemical Treatment: In some cases, chemicals like chlorine and ozone may be added to the waste to kill harmful pathogens and aid in disinfection. This helps eliminate viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other harmful organisms present in the sewage. c. Physical Treatment: Physical separation methods, such as sedimentation, coagulation, and filtration processes, are used to remove debris, oils, and solids from the waste. Ultrafiltration, microfiltration, and reverse osmosis are common physical processes employed in treating the wastewater. In some cases, the wastewater goes through multiple processes to ensure it's safe to be discharged into the ocean or reused for non-potable purposes onboard. 3. Discharge: Once treated, the purified wastewater can be safely discharged overboard, adhering to international maritime regulations and environmental guidelines. Cruise ships must primarily discharge black water in accordance with the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships (MARPOL) and follow local laws and regulations of the countries they visit. 4. Offloading: In cases where treatment systems are unavailable or not functioning properly, the cruise ship might store the waste in onboard tanks until it arrives at a port. Once at the port, the waste is offloaded and transported to a land-based waste management facility for disposal or further treatment. In conclusion, managing human waste on cruise ships is a complex process that includes storage, treatment, and safe handling while ensuring adherence to environmental regulations and minimizing the impact on marine ecosystems. Modern sewage treatment systems on cruise ships allow for efficient processing and disposal of human waste, significantly reducing the potential for environmental contamination."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Information: - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - 3D Monster Maze is a computer game developed from an idea by J.K.Greye and programmed by Malcolm Evans in 1981 for the Sinclair ZX81 platform with the 16 KB memory expansion. The game was initially released by J. K. Greye Software in early 1982 and re-released later the same year by Evans' own startup, New Generation Software. Rendered using low-resolution character block \\"graphics\\", it was one of the first 3D games for a home computer, and the first game incorporating typical elements of the genre that would later be termed survival horror. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Escape is an early ZX Spectrum video game developed and released by New Generation Software in 1982 . \`\` Can you ESCAPE from the monsters ? You must search through the maze to find the axe which will enable you to break down the door and ESCAPE . But it is not that easy - the Triceratops hides behind the hedges and the Pteranodon soars over the maze to swoop down upon you '' - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - New Generation Software was a firm best known for the computer games with innovative graphics it produced for the Sinclair ZX81 and ZX Spectrum computers. It was conceived in the spring of 1982 shortly after the lead developer, Malcolm Evans created \\"3D Monster Maze\\" (initially released by J. K.

Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: Caracas, Venezuela – Venezuela's close presidential election has the nation's military caught in the crosshairs, as experts question whether a Hugo Chávez led military would support opposition presidential candidate Henrique Capriles if he were to win on October 7. The military has entered the political discourse days before Venezuela's election, prompted by the defense minister's claim that Capriles plans to \\"dismantle\\" the country's armed forces. Gen. Henry Rangel Silva made the argument Tuesday in a TV interview, after Capriles announced that an active general had agreed to be his defense minister. Capriles didn't name the general, but Rangel said he didn't believe any Venezuelan general would betray President Hugo Chávez's socialist government by accepting the appointment. “He (Capriles) says he is going to appoint an active general as his Defense Minister (…) How can he say he is going to appoint an active general when his government plans to dismantle the Armed Forces?\\" Rangel said in Spanish, as quoted by Venezuelan newspaper El Nacional. \\"I don’t think there is one single active general willing to dismantle the Bolivarian Armed Forces.” Venezuela's military is constitutionally neutral but Chávez has packed its leadership with loyalists. That has raised questions about whether the armed forces would stay put if the results of Sunday's elections end up jeopardizing Chavez's rule. Retired general and former defense minister Fernando Ochoa Antich, a strong Chávez opponent, said General Rangel's claims are 'extremely serious\\" and 'threaten the country's institutionalism.' \\"Does this mean that if Capriles wins, the Venezuelan Armed Force will not acknowledge his victory?\\" Ochoa Antich said in Spanish. \\"I don’t think the military institution would go along with such an adventure.” Experts remain unsure themselves over how much of Venezuela's 115,000 military and national guard personnel are made up of so-called Chávez loyalists. \\"The military remains pretty professional especially at the low level and mid level ranks, and should back whoever wins,\\" said Adam Isaccson, senior associate for Regional Security at the Washington Office of Latin America, to Fox News Latino. But concern over violence and unrest after an election in Venezuela has never been higher. Right-leaning Capriles is Chávez's toughest challenger in the 14 years he's been in power. Polls indicate a dead-heat race, as the Chávez campaign has had to deal with national doubts over his health, a fledgling economy and an increase in crime. Barring a commanding win, both candidates are sure to challenge the results of the election and that has experts like Isaccson concerned about a Venezuelan military that may have to confront a heavily armed civilian population in the streets -the citizen militias that so far have been mostly supportive of Chávez. \\"Ultimately, the electoral tribunal is going to have to decide on a winner,\\" he said. \\"And the military is going to have to back that decision, but they maybe confronting a huge portion of the population.\\" Leading the more heavily armed citizen population, Isaccson said, are Venezuela's citizen militias who could clash with the professional military if presidential election results are disputed. \\"The biggest concern is 150,000 citizen militia members that Chávez has setup all around the country that are pretty overtly politicized,\\" Isaccson told Fox News Latino. \\"They are armed and they have some training.\\" Defense spending has actually gone down under Chávez. Defense spending accounted for about 1.1% of its GDP, on average, from 2007 to 2011, compared to about 1.5% from 1994-1998, the five years preceding Chávez's rise to the presidency, according to figures from the World Bank. Venezuela maintains about 115,000 military personnel on active duty, including the National Guard, according to Military Periscope. Since 2006, the U.S. has labeled Venezuela as not fully cooperative on anti-terrorism, an action that bans the sale or license of U.S. defense articles or services to Venezuela. Venezuela has about 20 U.S. built F-16 fighters and, according to a Reuters report, have fallen into disrepair. The president has used this as an argument in turning to Russia and China for new equipment. Russia has been by far Venezuela's largest arms supplier over the past five years (2007-2011), delivering more than 2 billion during that time, followed by Spain at 259 million and China at 218 million, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Weapons delivery totals differ from purchase agreements, which can be spread across several years. From 2005-2009, Venezuela agreed to purchase more than 6 billion of arms from Russia, including at least 24 Sukhoi Su-30 fighter jets, 50 military helicopters, 100,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles, a license to build a factory to produce Kalashnikov rifles in Venezuela, and several submarines, according to the Congressional Research Service.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Paragraph: In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background paragraph, Tanzania, with its large forest cover, would have a thinner A horizon in its soil compared to Kenya. This is because forests typically store most of their organic matter in the O horizon (forest floor) and a thin A horizon, while grasslands tend to develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: How do I setup a minecraft server? Question 2: How do I make a multiplayer Minecraft server? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. Both questions refer to setting up a Minecraft server, with the primary difference being that the second question specifically mentions \\"multiplayer.\\" However, the default purpose of setting up a Minecraft server is to host a multiplayer environment, so the answers to both questions will be quite similar. Setting up a Minecraft server is an exciting project that enables you to host your own multiplayer world for friends, family, or just other players on the internet. By following these steps, you will be well-equipped to create your own Minecraft server: 1. Check system requirements: Before starting, ensure that your computer meets Minecraft's system requirements. Running a server demands more resources than the game itself. The recommended minimum system requirements are: - A recent version of Java (preferably the latest version) - 2 GB of RAM (4 GB or more is recommended for a smoother experience) - A stable internet connection 2. Download the Minecraft server software: Visit the official Minecraft website (www.minecraft.net) and download the server software. Choose the version that matches the game edition you and your friends will be playing. For example, if you want to set up a server on the Java edition, click on \\"Download Minecraft: Java Edition Server Software.\\" 3. Create a folder: Create a new folder on your computer and name it something like \\"Minecraft Server.\\" It can be placed anywhere convenient, but keeping it on your desktop is often the easiest. Move the downloaded server software (minecraft_server.jar) into this folder. 4. Configure the server: Inside the Minecraft Server folder, create a new text document. Open it and paste the following text: - For Windows: java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui - For macOS/Linux: #!/bin/bash cd \\"(dirname \\"0\\")\\" exec java -Xmx1024M -Xms1024M -jar minecraft_server.jar nogui Save the file with an appropriate name and the extension \\".bat\\" for Windows or \\".sh\\" for macOS/Linux. For instance, \\"start_server.bat\\" or \\"start_server.sh\\". This will create a script that will be used to start the server. 5. Run the server for the first time: Double-click the script file (start_server.bat or start_server.sh) you created in step 4. This will start the server for the first time and generate additional necessary files and folders within your Minecraft Server folder, such as \\"server.properties,\\" \\"eula.txt,\\" and the \\"world\\" folder. 6. Accept the EULA: Open the \\"eula.txt\\" file, change \\"eula=false\\" to \\"eula=true\\" to agree to the Minecraft server's End User License Agreement (EULA) and save the file. This is mandatory for running a Minecraft server. 7. Customize server settings: Open the \\"server.properties\\" file with a text editor (like Notepad or TextEdit) and modify configurations as desired, such as the game mode and difficulty. For example, to change the game mode to Creative mode, change \\"gamemode=survival\\" to \\"gamemode=creative.\\" 8. Restart the server: Run the script file (start_server.bat or start_server.sh) again to start your Minecraft server with your custom settings. The server console window will open, displaying any commands and server messages. 9. Port forwarding: For other players to connect to your server over the internet, configure port forwarding on your router. The default port for Minecraft is 25565. Consult your router's user manual for specific instructions on how to enable port forwarding. 10. Share the server address: Once the server is up and running, you can share your public IP address with friends and family. They can use this IP address to connect to your Minecraft server. To find your public IP address, you can use a service like www.whatismyip.com. That's it! You've successfully set up a Minecraft server. Join your server by starting the Minecraft game, clicking \\"Multiplayer,\\" and then \\"Add Server.\\" Enter your public IP address, and you're ready to explore your new Minecraft world with others. Remember to periodically save your server worlds and run updates to keep everything running smoothly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer based on context: After defeating the Bills, the Steelers stayed home to take on the visiting Lions. They started off scoring in the 1st quarter as Ben Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on 2 consecutive TD passes from 34 and 47 yards out for leads of 7-0 and then 14-0. The Lions were able to get on the board as David Akers nailed a 35-yard field goal to make the score 14-3. The Steelers managed to pull away by 2 touchdowns as Shaun Suisham nailed a 25-yard field goal for a 17-3 lead. The Lions drew closer as Matthew Stafford found Calvin Johnson on a 79-yard TD pass shortening the lead to 17-10 not long before Suisham nailed a 34-yard field goal to make the score 20-10. Just then, the Lions managed to take the lead scoring 17 straight points when Stafford found Calvin Johnson again on a 19-yard pass making the score 20-17 and with the Lions taking the lead as Joique Bell ran for a 4-yard TD moving them ahead 24-20 and then finally wrapped things up in the first half as Akers nailed a 19-yard field goal to take a 27-20 lead at halftime.After the break, the Steelers got back to work as Suisham nailed a 21-yard field goal to shorten the Lions' lead to 27-23. They took the lead in the 4th quarter as Roethlisberger found Will Johnson on a 1-yard pass making the score 30-27. After a failed fake field goal attempt by the Lions, the Steelers set the ball up at their own 3-yard line. Due to a huge penalty against the team, the Steelers were able to move further down the field and seal the win for themselves as Roethlisberger found Jerricho Cotchery on a 20-yard pass for a final score of 37-27. How many more yards of field goals kicked in the first half by Shaun Suisham were there compared to field goals kicked by David Akers in the first half?","completion":"First, we need to find the total yards of field goals Shaun Suisham kicked in the first half. He made two field goals: one from 25 yards and another from 34 yards. 25 yards + 34 yards = 59 yards Next, we need to find the total yards of field goals David Akers kicked in the first half. He made two field goals: one from 35 yards and another from 19 yards. 35 yards + 19 yards = 54 yards Now, subtract the total yards of field goals kicked by David Akers from the total yards of field goals kicked by Shaun Suisham to find the difference. 59 yards (Suisham) - 54 yards (Akers) = 5 yards So, Shaun Suisham kicked 5 more yards of field goals in the first half compared to field goals kicked by David Akers in the first half."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. My fraternal twins were born 2 months early. The staff had already stopped premature labor at six months gestation but it proceeded too quickly this time. Total labor 2.5 hours. Needless to say, they were tiny - female 2 lbs. 3 oz, male 3 lbs. 10 oz. Female was born dark blue - luckily, I was at the finest maternity hospital in this half of the State (McGee Women’s). They brought the female around to breathing, while I cried, thinking that she was dead. The twins were rushed to the NICU, too tiny to breast feed except with pumped milk through a feeding tube. Both were watched closely by doctors and nurses as they were not passing waste properly. The day it was decided that the male needed surgery, the female was discharged to home. The male was transferred to another very good hospital for surgery for a temporary colostomy. He was discharged to home after a week. What broke my heart was that I was allowed to visit him in the hospital but his older brother and twin sister were not allowed. Prior to his discharge, the staff instructed me in changing and maintaining his colostomy bag on a daily basis. He kept the colostomy bag until he was about 5 months old; back into the hospital for the colostomy reversal. The sign that I hung above their shared playpen said “Whatever doesn’t kill me, makes me stronger”. How did I cope with it? Mostly alone. The hospital offered group sessions for parents of severely premature infants. During the very first session, I had a zen realization that, once I realized that the circumstances were out of my control, I GAINED control of myself and my life. A bit like the Serenity Prayer. I shared that epiphany with the group and they looked at me like I had two heads. I had never heard of the Serenity Prayer and I’d been an atheist since age 13, so religion was not my go-to then, nor is it now. That realization helped. The twins are 37 now.

Krishnan Nair (25 July 1939 - 16 November 1980), better known by his stage name Jayan, was an Indian film actor, naval officer, stunt performer and cultural icon of the 1970s. He starred in over 120 Malayalam films. During his film career, he was primarily an action star and was particularly famous for his macho image and unique style. He was reputed for his chauvinistic appeal and well known for performing stunts of a dangerous nature on his own. On 16 November 1980, Jayan was killed in an accident on the set of the movie Kolilakkam (English: Shockwave). The climactic scene of the movie was being filmed in Sholavaram, near Madras, Tamil Nadu. Jayan always performed his own stunts, and for this movie he was performing a particularly dangerous stunt that involved him boarding an airborne helicopter from a moving motorbike. The shot was accepted by the director in the first take; altogether three shots were filmed. According to the film's production executive, Jayan insisted on yet another re-take as he was not satisfied with its perfection. During the re-take, the helicopter lost its balance and crashed along with Jayan who was hanging onto the landing skids, and he later succumbed to his injuries. After his death was confirmed, a slide was added during the theatre show of his movie Deepam, which was running in packed houses, informing his death to the viewers who witnessed it with absolute shock and disbelief. A large number of his fans burst into tears and ran out of the buildings, while many continued to watch the movie, refusing to believe it and taking it for an ingenious promotion for some upcoming project. Jayan's body was taken to Trivandrum via aeroplane and later it was taken to his home in Quilon, where he was cremated. Thousands paid homage to the late actor, and the police had to take huge measures to deal with the crowds. His mother Bharathiyamma became bedridden after this incident, and she too died two years later. Some conspiracy theories emerged regarding the circumstances of his death, primarily because the pilot and his co-star Balan K. Nair, who was in the helicopter, survived with minor or no injuries. Nevertheless, it has been confirmed as a genuine accident. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Are there any details on the accident?","completion":"Yes, there are details on the accident.

Remember to thank them for helping you. Say something like, “You’ve been the best sounding board, Kathy. I hope we stay in touch.” You should next tell colleagues you were close to. Chances are you’ll maintain some sort of relationship outside of work, so you don’t want them to be insulted that you haven’t told them personally. Stop into their office and break the news. You aren’t obligated to tell others why you are leaving, but they will want to know nonetheless. Accordingly, you should settle on a story and stick with it. Your colleagues will talk to each other and compare notes. Don’t tell one person you’re leaving because you can’t take the stress but tell another person you’re leaving because the commute is shorter. Ideally, you should settle on a story that is non-controversial. For example, you can simply say, “They promised promotion opportunities which I want to pursue.” Everyone can understand why you would want to leave for that reason. Whatever you do, don’t badmouth anyone, not even over drinks after work. If you need to vent, then call up your parents or therapist. If other people need to know that you’re leaving, you can let them know by email. Keep it brief and friendly. Tell them your last day and ask them to contact you if they have questions. For example, other team members you work with occasionally should probably get an individual email. They might need to check about the status of a project.

Given these facts, what causes landslides among the following options: - earthquakes - deforestation - scattered light - rainfall - Water expanding - erosion - mouth of rivers - flooding","completion":"Landslides can be caused by several factors, often involving a combination of these factors. Among the options you provided, the causes of landslides include: 1. Earthquakes: The ground shaking during an earthquake can destabilize slopes and trigger landslides. The intensity of the shaking, the slope's stability, and the underlying soil and rock composition all play a role in determining if a landslide occurs. 2. Deforestation: Trees and vegetation help to stabilize slopes by increasing the cohesion of the soil and absorbing water from the ground. Deforestation can weaken the soil structure and decrease water absorption capacity, leading to an increased risk of landslides. 3. Rainfall: Heavy or prolonged rainfall can saturate the ground, adding weight and reducing the soil's strength. Rainwater infiltration can also increase water pressure within the soil, reducing the friction between soil particles and contributing to slope instability. In some cases, rapid snowmelt can have a similar effect. 4. Erosion: Natural erosion processes like river or coastal erosion can gradually remove material from the base of a slope, making it steeper and more susceptible to landslides. Human activities, such as construction and mining, can exacerbate erosion concerns. 5. Flooding: When rivers overflow their banks, they can saturate and destabilize nearby slopes, leading to landslides. Floodwaters can also erode the base of slopes, thus increasing the risk of slope failure. In summary, among the options you provided, earthquakes, deforestation, rainfall, erosion, and flooding are the primary factors that can contribute to landslides. Other factors, such as the slope's steepness, soil and rock composition, and human activities, can also contribute to the risk of landslides."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent. Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Company — a charter similar to that of the EIC.

A UN standing army would be ideally suited to respond to contemporary crises. Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"To support the claim that a UN standing army would be ideally suited to respond to contemporary crises, I will gather evidence from areas such as efficiency, neutrality, consistency, and capability. 1. Efficiency: A UN standing army would be a permanent and easily mobilizable force, which means it would be able to respond quickly to crises as they emerge. Since the troops and resources would already be coordinated under one organization, the need for lengthy negotiations to form a coalition would be eliminated, resulting in quicker intervention during emergencies. 2. Neutrality: A UN standing army would be composed of diverse countries, helping it maintain political neutrality. This would enable the force to enter conflict and disaster zones without the stigma of a specific, potentially controversial national agenda, making it more likely to be accepted by the local populations and opposing factions. 3. Consistency: With a UN standing army, there would be a consistent approach to training, logistics, and operations, which could lead to increased effectiveness in missions. Rather than each participating nation operating under its own standard practices, a UN force would follow a single set of guidelines, contributing to better coordination and communication when addressing crises. 4. Humanitarian aid and disaster relief: Besides handling militaristic tasks, a UN standing army could be effectively trained to provide humanitarian aid and disaster relief. Having a well-prepared and equipped force on standby to quickly respond to natural disasters would be invaluable when it comes to saving lives and limiting suffering. 5. Deterrent effect: The existence of a UN standing army could act as a deterrent to potential conflicts and violence. The knowledge that a UN force could quickly respond to acts of aggression might encourage countries and factions to reconsider their actions and resort to diplomatic solutions instead. 6. Reduction of burden on member nations: The creation of a UN standing army would spread the responsibility of crisis response, reducing the burden placed on individual member nations. This could allow for more effective and balanced distribution of resources, ultimately benefiting all parties involved. 7. Legitimacy: Since a UN standing army would be operating under the banner of an international organization, it would have the moral authority and legitimacy to intervene in crises. This could lead to more successful conflict resolution, as stakeholders involved in the situation would be more likely to accept the intervention of a neutral, legitimate force. In conclusion, evidence from efficiency, neutrality, consistency, capability, humanitarian aid, deterrent effect, and legitimacy, support the notion that a UN standing army would be ideally suited to respond to contemporary crises."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Add spaces: BordeauxwinesGreatBordeauxwines","completion":"Bordeaux wines Great Bordeaux wines When examining the phrase \\"Bordeaux wines Great Bordeaux wines,\\" it's clear that this is about the popular and famous wines hailing from the Bordeaux region in France. Bordeaux has a long and esteemed history in the world of wine, and its incredible offerings have placed it at the forefront of wine production and appreciation. In this discussion, we'll look into the noteworthy aspects and qualities of Bordeaux wines. First, let us look at the Bordeaux wine region. Situated in the southwest of France, Bordeaux is one of the most significant wine-producing areas in the world. The region has a unique climate characterized by the maritime influences of the Atlantic Ocean, which combines with multiple soil types to create a diverse range of wines. The area covers over 100,000 hectares of vineyards and produces approximately 960 million bottles per year. The Bordeaux region is renowned for producing outstanding red wine blends, which often consist of Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Cabernet Franc, Petit Verdot, and Malbec. It's important to note, however, that Bordeaux also produces high-quality white and sweet wines, most notably using Sauvignon Blanc, Semillon, and Muscadelle grape varieties. Now, let's delve deeper into what makes Bordeaux wines great and stand out. A significant factor is the extreme diversity of the wines produced in this region. Bordeaux is divided into several key sub-regions, each with its own distinct terroir, which refers to the unique combination of soil, climate, and topography that shapes a wine's character. These sub-regions include Médoc, Graves, Saint-Émilion, Pomerol, and Sauternes. 1. Médoc: Located on the Left Bank of the Gironde estuary, Médoc is known for its exceptional Cabernet Sauvignon-based red wines. Its well-draining gravelly soils contribute to the growth of robust, full-bodied, and age-worthy wines, with notable appellations such as Pauillac, Margaux, and Saint-Estèphe producing some of the world's most sought-after bottles. 2. Graves: Also situated on the Left Bank, Graves is recognized for both its red and white wines. Blending Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot, the red wines are elegant and complex, while the white wines combine Sauvignon Blanc and Semillon to create a vibrant and refreshing taste. The famous sweet wine appellation, Sauternes, is also part of the Graves sub-region. 3. Saint-Émilion: A prominent appellation located on the Right Bank of the Bordeaux region, Saint-Émilion wines are primarily Merlot-based, yielding a smoother and more approachable profile. The sub-region is also recognized for producing red wines with a diversity of styles, from fresh and fruity to complex and opulent, thanks to its diverse soil types and excellent winemaking techniques. 4. Pomerol: A small appellation on the Right Bank, Pomerol is famous for its rich, velvety, and intensely flavored Merlot-based wines. With a clay-heavy terroir and relatively limited production, Pomerol wines boast a unique character, making them highly sought-after by wine enthusiasts. All these factors - the diverse terroir, the blend of grape varieties, and the exceptional winemaking traditions - contribute significantly to the greatness of Bordeaux wines. The region's producers are committed to upholding the highest standards of quality, leading to a prestigious reputation. As a result, wine connoisseurs worldwide continue to cherish Bordeaux wines as some of the best in the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The best way to polish furniture depends on the type of material it is made of, such as wood, metal, or glass. However, in this guide, we will focus primarily on polishing wooden furniture, as it is the most common type. Below are the steps you should take to effectively polish wooden furniture: 1. Evaluate the furniture: Before you begin polishing, it's important to determine the type and finish of your wooden furniture. Look for any manufacturer's labels or tags that may indicate the type of wood, finish, or care instructions. 2. Choose the right polish: Select a furniture polish that works well with the type of wood and finish of your furniture. Different wood polishes may contain natural oils like lemon, tung, or linseed oil, or synthetic ingredients like silicone or petroleum distillates. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations or consult with a furniture specialist if you're unsure. 3. Gather your supplies: Some items you will need for polishing furniture include: - Furniture polish - Soft, lint-free cloth, microfiber cloth, or cheesecloth - Clean, dry cloth for buffing - Cotton swabs or a soft toothbrush for detailing - Gloves for protecting your hands 4. Clean the furniture: Before you apply the polish, it's essential to remove dirt, grime, and dust from the surface. Use a soft, lint-free cloth dampened with water or a gentle furniture cleaner to wipe down the surface thoroughly. Make sure to cover all areas, including corners and crevices. Allow the furniture to dry completely before proceeding to the next step. 5. Apply the polish: Pour a small amount of the furniture polish onto a soft, lint-free cloth or directly onto the surface, depending on the manufacturer's instructions. Use a circular motion to apply the polish to a small section of the furniture at a time. This ensures even coverage and prevents streaks. 6. Work in details: For the intricate parts of the furniture, such as carvings or edges, use cotton swabs or a soft toothbrush to apply the polish. This allows you to reach tight spots and prevents excess polish from building up in crevices. 7. Allow the polish to dry: Allow the furniture polish to dry according to the manufacturer's recommended drying time, which typically ranges from a few minutes to half an hour. Do not skip this step, as drying allows the polish to soak into the wood and provide protection. 8. Buff the furniture: Once the polish is dry, use a clean, dry cloth to buff the furniture. Use long, circular strokes to gently rub the surface until it shines. Work one section at a time to ensure an even and consistent shine across the entire piece of furniture. 9. Regular maintenance: To keep your furniture looking its best, establish a regular polishing schedule. Every few months, go through the process of cleaning, applying polish, and buffing to maintain the appearance and protective qualities of the polish. 10. Additional tips: - Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasives on your wooden furniture to prevent damage. - Do not over-polish your furniture, as excessive polish can cause a build-up that can dull the finish. - Keep your furniture out of direct sunlight and maintain a consistent indoor environment (temperature and humidity) to preserve the wood. By following these steps and regularly maintaining your furniture, you can preserve its appearance, protect it from damage, and extend its life. Remember to always use the appropriate polish for your specific type of wood and finish to achieve the best results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Aubrey's family got their water from the local well. Aubrey had to fill their jug with water. Given the context: What does Aubrey need to do before this? Possible answers: walk to the well, receive water to their well, help their family","completion":"Before Aubrey can fill their jug with water from the local well, there are several steps that they must undertake to ensure that the process is carried out efficiently and safely. Some of these steps include the following: 1. Preparing the water jug: Aubrey must first find a clean, empty jug that is suitable for carrying water. They may need to clean the jug if it has been used previously or if it has been stored for a period of time. Ensuring that the jug is clean will help to prevent contamination of the water. 2. Checking the water quality: Aubrey should find out if the local well is providing clean and safe water. They can do this by talking to their neighbors, community members, or local health department to ensure there have been no recent reports of water pollution or contamination. 3. Plan the walk to the well: Aubrey should consider the distance to the well, the size of the water jug they will be carrying, and the terrain of the path to the well. Planning the route and timing can help Aubrey arrive at the well when it is not too crowded, which makes the process more efficient. 4. Preparing for physical activity: Walking to the well with an empty jug is relatively easy, but carrying a full jug of water can be physically demanding. Aubrey should wear comfortable shoes, and dress in weather-appropriate clothing to ensure they are protected from the elements. If the jug is large and heavy, Aubrey may also consider using a wheeled cart or another form of assistance for transporting the water. 5. Checking the weather: Aubrey should check the weather forecast before heading out to the well. If there are any possible rainstorms or extreme temperatures predicted, it may be better to postpone the trip to the well and find an alternative means of obtaining water. 6. Discussing with family: Aubrey may need to inform their family of their plans to collect water from the well. This is particularly important if there are specific family responsibilities or tasks that Aubrey is also responsible for completing. By communicating with their family, Aubrey can ensure that there are no conflicts with other family members' schedules or needs. In conclusion, before filling their jug with water from the local well, Aubrey needs to ensure that the water is safe for consumption, plan and prepare for their walk to the well, check the weather forecast, discuss their plans with their family, and prepare the water jug itself. Taking these steps will help to make the process of obtaining water from the well a smooth and successful endeavor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Generate a 3-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package net.wigle.wigleandroid. A:","completion":"Title: Decent App with Room for Improvement Rating: 3 out of 5 stars Review: I've been using the net.wigle.wigleandroid app for a while now, and I must say, it's an interesting tool that helps in wardriving and exploring wireless networks in your vicinity. The app runs smoothly on my Android device and offers some valuable data about different Wi-Fi networks around me and their signal strength. However, there are a few areas where I think the app could use some improvement. First and foremost, the user interface feels a bit outdated and clunky at times. It seems like it could use a little polishing to make it more intuitive and user-friendly. The different menus and options are not easy to navigate, and it took me some time to figure out how to customize the settings. In addition, although the app provides raw data about surrounding networks, it would be great if it could analyze and present that data in a more actionable manner. Adding customizable dashboard widgets or charts to quickly visualize network trends, for example, would go a long way in making the app more useful for network enthusiasts. Lastly, the location tracking feature doesn't seem to be very accurate, and the auto-upload feature of discovered networks could be enhanced: it doesn't always work as expected. It would be helpful if the developer addressed these issues in future app updates. In summary, net.wigle.wigleandroid is a fascinating app that caters to a niche user base who seek advanced wireless network information. While it does provide some valuable insights, there is room for improvement in terms of user interface, data visualization and a few other features. Overall, I would give it a solid 3 stars, hoping that the team would address the areas that need fine-tuning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different cooking methods and environments. The premise presents a scenario where meat is sizzling, which typically occurs when cooking on a high-heat surface, such as a grill or stovetop. The use of the word \\"spilled\\" further suggests that the meat is being cooked on some elevated surface, whereas a crockpot would have contained the meat. Moreover, the mention of \\"charcoal\\" indicates that the cooking method likely involves direct heat from burning coals – such as grilling or barbecuing – which is generally incompatible with crockpot cooking. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests the meat was cooked in a crockpot, which is a slow cooker that uses low, consistent heat to cook food over an extended period. The cooking process in a crockpot is fundamentally different from the high-heat method described in the premise, as it does not involve sizzling, direct exposure to coals, or the risk of spilling onto the street. To summarize, the hypothesis and the premise are not congruent, as they describe distinct cooking environments and techniques.

It involves a handsome man standing outside a young woman's window, singing a love song to her to win her over. However, trying to woo a female with songs is not just something that humans do. A few animals sing love songs as well. Birds and elephants are romantic but the latest animal to _ a female might surprise you--it is the humble mouse. You may find it odd to find out that mice sing. We do not hear them because the frequency of their voice is so high. In fact, scientists have known for some time that male mice make special sounds to females, but it has always been assumed that the sounds are produced instinctively and randomly, with little thought going into the process. But new research suggests otherwise. When male mice with different voices were put in a cage together, scientists found that they would gradually change their pitches to sound like one another. But when a female mouse was put in the cage with two males, one male would change his pitch to match the other. \\"It was usually the smaller animal changing the pitch to match the larger animal,\\" professor Erich Jarvis, leader of the study, from Duke University, US, told BBC News. This ability, known as vocal learning, is rare in the natural world. It had been thought to be limited to some birds, such as parrots--as well as whales and dolphins. The latest findings challenge the long-held opinion that mice cannot learn to adapt their voices. Scientists also found the part of the brain that controls the mice's singing ability. In the experiment, they damaged the cells in this part of the mice's brain and found that the animals couldn't keep their songs in pitch or repeat them any more. This also happened when the mice became deaf. Jarvis said that this finding had changed his understanding of the way mice make sound. \\"In mice we find that the pathways that are at least modulating these vocalizations are in the forebrain, in places where you actually find them in humans,\\"...

As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.

It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\".

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What part of the church did Nikolova consider unsuitable for the baptism? , can you please find it? The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda. Answer:","completion":"Nikolova considered the south part of the atrium, which was probably a baptistery featuring a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font, unsuitable for baptism.

I read this background article the other day: The water level is seasonal, being lowered by about 10 feet (3.0 m) over the winter. The reservoir fills in the spring from snow melt and underground springs. The lake is usually at full level by late spring, but in the occasional years of low snow melt and low rainfall, it may remain up to several feet below its typical level. Water is let out of the lake in the fall so that ice will not damage docks and other structures around the lake. This also leads to excellent water quality, as a significant portion of the water is replaced every year. I am facing a new situation today: The water level in Large Lake was high in March, 3 feet higher in April, and 7 feet higher still in May. It dropped to a much lower level in September, October and November, when they released a significant portion of the water as a yearly chore.

It lies east of Stranraer and south of Newton Stewart. It is well known today as \\"Scotland's National Book Town\\" with a high concentration of second-hand book shops. It has a population of about 1,000. - Wigtownshire , was a constituency of the House of Commons of the Parliament of Great Britain from 1708 to 1801 and of the Parliament of the United Kingdom from 1801 to 1918 . It was represented by one Member of Parliament . The first British general election in Wigtownshire was in 1708 . In 1707 -- 08 , members of the 1702 -- 1707 Parliament of Scotland were co-opted to serve in the 1st Parliament of Great Britain . See Scottish representatives to the 1st Parliament of Great Britain , for further details . In 1918 the Wigtownshire area was combined with Kirkcudbrightshire to form the Galloway constituency . - Dumfries and Galloway is one of 32 unitary council areas of Scotland and is located in the western Southern Uplands. It comprises the historic counties of Dumfriesshire, Stewartry of Kirkcudbright and Wigtownshire, the latter two of which are collectively known as Galloway. The administrative centre is the town of Dumfries. - The Parliament of Great Britain was formed in 1707 following the ratification of the Acts of Union by both the Parliament of England and the Parliament of Scotland. The Acts created a new unified Kingdom of Great Britain and dissolved the separate English and Scottish parliaments in favour of a single parliament, located in the former home of the English parliament in the Palace of Westminster, near the City of London. This lasted nearly a century, until the Acts of Union 1800 merged the separate British and Irish Parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom with effect from 1 January 1801. - Wigtownshire or the County of Wigtown is a registration county and lieutenancy area in south-west Scotland. Until 1975, Wigtownshire was one of the administrative counties used for local government purposes, and is now administered as part of the council area of Dumfries and Galloway. As a lieutenancy area, Wigtownshire has its own Lord Lieutenant, currently John Alexander Ross. - A registration county was, in Great Britain and Ireland, a statistical unit used for the registration of births, deaths and marriages and for the output of census information. In Scotland registration counties are used for land registration purposes. - Galloway (Gaelic: \\"Gall-Ghàidhealaibh\\"; Latin: \\"Gallovidia\\") is a region in southwestern Scotland comprising the counties of Wigtown and Kirkcudbright. - The Kingdom of Great Britain, officially Great Britain , was a sovereign state in western Europe from 1 May 1707 to 31 December 1800. The state came into being following the Treaty of Union in 1706, ratified by the Acts of Union 1707, which united the kingdoms of England and Scotland to form a single kingdom encompassing the whole island of Great Britain and its outlying islands. It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\". Also after the accession of George I to the throne of Great Britain in 1714, the kingdom was in a personal union with the Electorate of Hanover. - A Member of Parliament (MP) is the representative of the voters to a parliament. In many countries with bicameral parliaments, this category includes specifically members of the lower house, as upper houses often have a different title. - The Parliament of England was the legislature of the Kingdom of England. In 1066, William of Normandy introduced what, in later centuries, became referred to as a feudal system, by which he sought the advice of a council of tenants-in-chief (a person who held land) and ecclesiastics before making laws. In 1215, the tenants-in-chief secured Magna Carta from King John, which established that the king may not levy or collect any taxes (except the feudal taxes to which they were hitherto accustomed), save with the consent of his royal council, which gradually developed into a parliament. - The City of Westminster is an Inner London borough which also holds city status. It occupies much of the central area of Greater London including most of the West End. It is to the west of and adjoining the ancient City of London, directly to the east of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, and its southern boundary is the River Thames. It was created with the 1965 establishment of Greater London. Upon creation, Westminster was awarded city status, which had been previously held by the smaller Metropolitan Borough of Westminster. - The 14 British Overseas Territories (BOT) are territories under the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United Kingdom. They are those parts of the former British Empire that have not chosen independence or have voted to remain British territories. Most of the inhabited territories are internally self-governing, with the UK retaining responsibility for defence and foreign relations. The rest are either uninhabited or have a transitory population of military or scientific personnel. They share the British monarch (Elizabeth II) as head of state. - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - The Parliament of the United Kingdom, commonly known as the UK Parliament or British Parliament, is the supreme legislative body in the United Kingdom, British Crown dependencies and British overseas territories. It alone possesses legislative supremacy and thereby ultimate power over all other political bodies in the UK and its territories. Its head is the Sovereign of the United Kingdom (currently Queen Elizabeth II) and its seat is the Palace of Westminster in the City of Westminster, London. - The Acts of Union 1800 (sometimes erroneously referred to as a single Act of Union 1801) united the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland (previously in personal union) to create the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with effect from 1 January 1801. Both Acts, though since amended, still remain in force in the United Kingdom, but have been repealed in the Republic of Ireland. - The City of London is a city and county within London. It constituted most of London from its settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the agglomeration has since grown far beyond the City's borders. The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local authority districts of Greater London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, the City of Westminster). - The Palace of Westminster is the meeting place of the House of Commons and the House of Lords, the two houses of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Commonly known as the Houses of Parliament after its occupants, it is also known as the 'heart of British politics'. The Palace lies on the north bank of the River Thames in the City of Westminster, in central London.

My question: What does the bartender talk to Betty about?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: As discussed earlier, sit in team formation and designate a dealer. Grab your Euchre deck and have the dealer give each player 5 cards and assemble the kitty. Starting to the person left of the dealer, rotating clockwise, ask each player whether or not he wishes to declare the suit that is showing as trump until someone does (or a new cycle begins). If he does wish to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pick it up.\\" If he does not want to declare this suit trump, he says \\"pass,\\" or declares a pass by knocking on the table. He/She then discards one of their other cards (usually a low card of the non-trump suit). If a rotation of the circle is completed without anyone telling the dealer to \\"pick it up,\\" the card is turned face down and another rotation ensues. During this rotation, a player can call trump of any suit other than the one that was originally turned up. If the rotation completes without anyone calling trump, the deal is forfeited and passed clockwise to the next person in the circle. It's generally wise to only call a trump suit if you have a good hand. Otherwise, stay mum. Each player must follow suit -- meaning if a player has a card of the same suit as was led, he must play it on that trick. If a player does not have a card of that suit, he can trump the trick, or simply throw a card off suit. The highest card of the suit that was led takes the trick, unless a trump card is played. The highest card of trump will win any hand. If you lay a card that does not follow suit but you do have a card that does, this is called a \\"renege.\\" If another player calls you out on what you've done, they receive 2 points. If you are going alone, however, the penalty is 4 points (for whichever side is guilty). Because each game of Euchre is so short, it's a little easier to memorize the cards. Think about what cards you believe your opponents are holding to determine how to lead off and what to throw away. For example, if the dealer adds the original trump card to his hand, don't forget it. If you are leading and have two or more trump cards, go with those. Always lead a high trump if your partner called it; it'll help them locate the missing cards. Otherwise, work in a sequence. Say diamonds are trump -- lead with the Ace of Spades or Clubs to try to win it. Don't hold onto your good cards. Euchre goes fast -- if you act slowly, you'll miss your opportunity to use them. When opportunity knocks, answer the door. \\" Once one team gets to 9 points, this means they are \\"in the barn.\\" You must announce this with great enthusiasm, since it typically indicates that you are about to win the game. If you really want to have fun with it, have one partner interlock their fingers together, and flip upside down with the thumbs making \\"udders\\" and let the other partner \\"milk\\" them. The five tricks of Euchre can go by pretty fast, so it's best to keep score as you go. Use the 6 and 4 cards to keep tabs. Once a team reaches ten, you'll probably want to play again. Switch teams if skill sets are better suited in different combinations.","completion":"In Euchre, players sit in a circle and one person gives out five cards to everyone. They take turns to decide which suit is the \\"trump\\" suit, which is the most powerful. When it's their turn to play a card, they must play one of the same suit, if they have it. The player who plays the highest card from the trump suit or the one played first usually wins that round. Euchre is a fast game, so you need to think about what cards the other players have and use your best ones quickly. When one team gets close to winning, they can celebrate in a silly way. It's good to keep track of your score, and you can play again with different teams if you want."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S.-led coalition in Afghanistan dropped more bombs during the first quarter of 2018 than it has in the same period in any of the last 15 years, according to Pentagon data. The increased bombing is the latest evidence the 17-year-old war in Afghanistan is significantly intensifying since U.S. President Donald Trump announced his new military strategy for the country in August. Coalition planes dropped 1,186 weapons on Afghanistan during the first three months of 2018, according to figures released by U.S. Air Forces Central Command. The previous record (1,083) was set during the height of the war in 2011. The U.S. has not released 2001 to 2003 airstrike data. Those figures do not include activity by the Afghan Air Force (AAF), which has stepped up its aerial bombardment since gaining the ability to conduct airstrikes two years ago. The AAF carries out between 4 to 12 airstrikes every day, according to the Afghan Ministry of Defense. If recent trends are any indication, 2018 is likely to get even more violent. Fighting traditionally picks up during the warmer months, and the coalition has expanded its bombing campaign against the Islamic State group, as well as narcotic labs and other Taliban revenue sources. But there is little indication the expanded airstrikes are helping end the conflict, says Thomas Johnson, an Afghanistan specialist who teaches national security affairs at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey, California. \\"It's basically a tactic of desperation,\\" said Johnson, author of Taliban Narratives: The Use of Power and Stories in the Afghanistan Conflict. \\"There's never been an insurgency in history that's been defeated purely through air power.\\" Even high-level U.S. military officials concede the conflict remains a stalemate.

I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat.

Given the context: How would Casey feel afterwards? Possible answers: proud of others, very frustrated, happy with everyone A:","completion":"Given the context, it is most likely that Casey would feel very frustrated after not receiving the results from the project. Although it is not explicitly mentioned why Casey stopped asking, it can be inferred that they did so because they did not receive any answers or information despite their efforts. This can lead to a sense of frustration based on the following factors: 1. Lack of progress: Not receiving the results from the project suggests that the project has not made progress or completed its objectives. When someone is invested in an assignment or is responsible for it, they want to see it succeed. If the results are not provided, it may indicate that there are roadblocks, delays, or even negligence from other team members, which can be frustrating. 2. Ineffective communication: Communication is key in any work environment, particularly when collaborating on a project. If the team members have not been transparent with Casey regarding the project's status, it can create a communication gap that leads to frustration and mistrust. 3. Limited involvement or influence: When an individual is not provided with the expected information, they may feel as if their involvement in the project is not valued or that they lack the influence to make things happen. This feeling of disconnect may further contribute to their frustration. 4. Uncertainty: Not having clarity about the project's status can be unsettling and nerve-wracking. It is challenging to make accurate decisions and plan for the future if crucial information is missing. This uncertainty adds to the frustration that Casey may feel in this situation. 5. Impact on personal performance: In many work environments, performance is assessed based on accomplishments and completion of assigned tasks. If the project's results are not available, Casey might be concerned about the possible negative impact on their personal performance evaluation or reputation. While it is not possible for us to determine Casey's feelings with absolute certainty, it is reasonable to deduce that given the scenario, they would likely be very frustrated. The other mentioned emotions, such as being proud of others or happy with everyone, do not align with the context provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French.

The answer is:","completion":"To determine which case has a lower risk of attack from lions, we will look at each case individually and analyze how the group size may affect the likelihood of attack. Case A: Large group of wildebeests 1. Due to the large number of wildebeests, there are more eyes and ears to detect potential danger. 2. Large groups can intimidate predators, making them less likely to attack. 3. Individual wildebeests are more likely to get lost in the crowd, making it difficult for lions to single out potential targets. Case B: Smaller groups of wildebeests 1. Smaller groups may not be as vigilant or as effective in detecting potential threats from lions. 2. A lion may be more likely to attempt an attack on a smaller group, as it is less intimidating. 3. Predators may have an easier time singling out individual wildebeests in smaller groups. Based on this analysis, it can be concluded that the wildebeests have a lower risk of attack from the lions in Case A, when they are in a larger group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Photo Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, has throat cancer and will begin treatment shortly at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, he said in a note to the bank’s employees and shareholders late Tuesday. Doctors discovered the cancer at an early stage, Mr. Dimon, 58, said, noting that his condition was “curable.” After a series of tests, he said the doctors confirmed that the cancer had not spread beyond the “original site” and the adjacent lymph nodes on the right side of his neck. Mr. Dimon assured employees at JPMorgan, the nation’s largest bank, that the prognosis from the doctors was “excellent.” Mr. Dimon, who has held the dual roles of chief executive and chairman at the bank since 2006, has been atop JPMorgan longer than any other bank chief. The announcement of his diagnosis came on Mr. Dimon’s 10-year anniversary at JPMorgan. That tenure, which began when JPMorgan acquired Bank One, has been marked by triumph — the bank emerged from the financial crisis in better shape than its rivals — and by tumult. The bank has worked to mend its frayed relationships with regulators — a painful reconciliation that cost it roughly 20 billion. In November, JPMorgan reached a record 13 billion settlement with a range of government authorities over its sale of questionable mortgage-backed securities in the lead-up to the financial crisis. The bank also reached a 2 billion settlement over accusations that it failed to sound alarms about Bernard L. Madoff’s Ponzi scheme. JPMorgan has also been buffeted by the departure of several top executives. In the last two years alone, at least 10 senior executives have left JPMorgan. Most recently, Michael J. Cavanagh, once considered an heir to Mr. Dimon, left the bank to join the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm. And like its rivals, JPMorgan, which will report second-quarter earnings on July 15, is grappling with a slowdown in its trading business. It has been a particularly grueling stretch for trading units across Wall Street. The sluggish trading revenue traces, in part, to a spate of rules passed in the aftermath of the financial crisis. In the past, banks made some of their riskiest wagers — bets that sometimes translated into rich profits — through trading complex derivatives, bonds and commodities. In the new banking landscape, where interest rates remain persistently low, the role of those businesses has been diminished. In his annual letter to shareholders in April, Mr. Dimon stressed that despite the “constant and intense pressure,” he was proud of the bank’s resiliency and its resolve. Last year, JPMorgan earned 17.9 billion in profit despite the legal costs. Mr. Dimon reiterated his faith in the leadership of the bank on Tuesday. He did not outline any plans to cede the reins of the bank while he has treatment — a process that he said should last about eight weeks. In his note, Mr. Dimon emphasized that the company would “continue to deliver first-class results for our customers.” The illness of any chief executive naturally prompts questions about who is prepared to take over, at least for a little while. But Mr. Dimon emphasized in his note that he would remain immersed in the day-to-day operations of the bank. JPMorgan’s board has remained firmly behind Mr. Dimon, redoubling support for him. The board awarded Mr. Dimon 20 million in annual compensation for his work in 2013. The raise came one year after the board had cut his compensation to 11.5 million. Even before Mr. Dimon’s diagnosis the board agreed on various succession plans. “The board had already established a short-term, medium-term and longer-term succession plan,” said a JPMorgan spokesman, Joseph Evangelisti. Among the potential successors, people briefed on the matter said, are Gordon Smith, the head of JPMorgan’s consumer bank, and Mary Erdoes, who runs the asset management business. The inclusion of Mr. Smith and Ms. Erdoes reflected the changing fortunes of banking. JPMorgan’s consumer business, for example, has taken on more prominence as the bank shifts its focus to credit cards and auto loans and away from intricate deal-making and trades that once were the hallmark of Wall Street. ||||| James Dimon, chairman and chief executive of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co., on Tuesday told employees and shareholders he has been diagnosed with throat cancer, that the prognosis is excellent and that he will continue to be actively involved in the company during his treatment.

Options: - over age - early death - valuable - joy - happiness The answer is \\"early death\\" because A:","completion":"Living life too hard can lead to early death because it often involves engaging in risky behaviors, putting excessive stress on the body and mind, and neglecting one's overall well-being. When individuals push themselves beyond their limits for extended periods, they may experience negative consequences such as chronic stress, physical exhaustion, and mental burnout. Risky behaviors, such as drug and alcohol abuse or engaging in extreme sports without proper training and precautions, can increase the likelihood of accidents and life-threatening situations. Additionally, excessive work or extreme fitness routines can weaken the immune system, making individuals more susceptible to illness and injury. Chronic stress caused by living life too hard can also have severe health consequences. Long-term stress has been linked to numerous health issues, including heart disease, hypertension, depression, and a weakened immune system. Furthermore, not prioritizing self-care and well-being can lead to sleep deprivation, poor eating habits, and a lack of social support, all of which contribute to an increased risk of early death. It is essential to find a balance between striving for success and maintaining one's health and well-being. By prioritizing self-care, moderating risk-taking, and building a supportive social network, individuals can live a more fulfilling and longer life."},{"prompt":"austin was tired of his abusive dad so he beat him with a baseball bat.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the state that was formed when its last merger was completed on May 15 1948? The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad.

How to keep a cat from running away when it is moved Make sure your cat is micro-chipped. Before you move it's important to take some steps which will prepare your cat. If the worst happens and your cat does run away, ensuring that she has been micro-chipped will mean she is fully registered and can be returned to you if she is picked up or found. Answer:","completion":"(c). Most cats now are micro-chipped. Your vet can do this quickly and easily and it doesn't hurt or distress your cat. The correct answer is option (c) because microchipping is a common and efficient way to identify your cat if it runs away, making it easier for your cat to be returned to you if found. Option (a) is incorrect because it only describes what to do if your cat is already lost and doesn't provide a solution to keeping a cat from running away in the first place. Option (b) is incorrect because it doesn't make sense. The information about a \\"semi-chip chip\\" is unclear and keeping your cat indoors at all times may not be practical or suitable for some cats. Option (d) is incorrect because it contains inaccurate information. A microchip is not a hollow piece placed in a cat's ear, but a small implant placed under the skin, usually between the shoulder blades. The description of removing the chip to identify the cat is also incorrect, as microchips are meant to stay implanted and can be scanned to reveal the owner's information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I’ve been to Key West several times, but for some inexplicable reason 1, I never visited the Hemingway House (or the Truman Little White House 2 for that matter but that’s a topic for a different post). As expected, it was about 1,000 degrees there (Celsius or Fahrenheit, you pick – either way, that’s way too hot). Welcome to Florida in July. 😀 We would have melted completely but fortunately, the house was air conditioned and they had some fans outside. I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue. It’s a gorgeous piece of property but I’m not sure that getting married at the home of a serial philanderer who had 4 marriages and 3 divorces is exactly a good omen. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why was the author excited to visit the Ernest Hemingway house? Options: A.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose body was flown to Adelaide? is inside the article: By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days.

Pfizer Inc., the world #39;s largest drugmaker, agreed to pay 430 million to resolve personal-injury claims against a subsidiary that sold products containing asbestos in the 1970s. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about a legal settlement reached by Pfizer Inc., the world's largest pharmaceutical company, to resolve personal-injury claims related to asbestos-containing products sold by a subsidiary company in the 1970s. To provide more context, asbestos is a naturally occurring mineral that was widely used in several industries due to its insulating, fire-resistant, and tensile-strength properties. However, it became well-known that prolonged exposure to asbestos fibers could lead to severe health problems, most notably mesothelioma, a rare form of cancer that affects the lining of the lungs, chest, and abdomen. Throughout the 1970s, a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc. had manufactured and sold products that contained asbestos. People who were exposed to these products filed personal-injury claims against the company. These claims alleged that the company was negligent and responsible for the harm caused by these asbestos-containing products, likely due to a lack of proper warnings and safety measures to protect those who were at risk of exposure. In light of these claims, Pfizer Inc. opted to resolve the situation by agreeing to pay a significant amount of money, 430 million, to settle these personal-injury cases. This decision was likely made to avoid further legal complications, address the damage caused to those affected, and maintain its corporate reputation. By agreeing to pay the settlement, Pfizer acknowledged that it was accountable for the health issues suffered by the claimants who were exposed to the asbestos-containing products sold by its subsidiary. The settlement highlights the importance of corporate accountability, especially in cases where public health and safety are at stake. Companies must ensure that their products are safe for use and should take responsibility for any harm caused by their products, whether directly or through their subsidiaries. Furthermore, this case serves as a reminder that the effects of harmful substances, such as asbestos, can persist for decades after initial exposure, emphasizing the need for ongoing regulation and vigilance in protecting public health."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Which has a more importance with constraints?\\" Context: \\"In a course at the LSA summer institute in 1991, Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky developed optimality theory—an overall architecture for phonology according to which languages choose a pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints ordered by importance; a lower-ranked constraint can be violated when the violation is necessary in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology. The appeal to phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements (e.g. features) in various approaches has been criticized by proponents of 'substance-free phonology', especially Mark Hale and Charles Reiss.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"In the context of the development of Optimality Theory at the LSA summer institute in 1991 by Alan Prince and Paul Smolensky, the concept of constraints and their importance in phonology and morphology is crucial for understanding the overall architecture of languages. The main idea of Optimality Theory is that languages choose the pronunciation of a word that best satisfies a list of constraints that are ordered by importance, allowing for a lower-ranked constraint to be violated in order to obey a higher-ranked constraint. Regarding the question of which aspect – phonology or morphology – has more importance with constraints, it is essential to first understand the distinction between the two. Phonology is the study of the distribution and patterning of speech sounds, or phonemes, in a language while morphology is concerned with the structure and formation of words through the combination of morphemes, which are the smallest units of meaning in a language. In Optimality Theory, both phonological and morphological constraints play significant roles in determining the pronunciation and structure of words in a language. However, their importance may vary depending on the specific linguistic context and the properties of the language in question. In the original development of Optimality Theory, the primary focus was on phonological constraints. These constraints govern aspects such as syllable structure, assimilation, and stress placement in a language. The theory suggests that languages have an inventory of possible phonological constraints, and each language has its own specific ranking of these constraints, which determines the possible pronunciations of a word. Soon after the introduction of Optimality Theory, its scope was extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince. Morphological constraints deal with issues such as the arrangement of morphemes in a word, the selection of specific allomorphs (variant forms of a morpheme), and the realization of inflectional and derivational morphology in a language. Like phonological constraints, morphological constraints are ranked according to their importance in a language, with lower-ranked constraints being violated when necessary to satisfy higher-ranked constraints. Overall, both phonological and morphological constraints hold importance in the structure and pronunciation of words in a language under the framework of Optimality Theory. Their relative importance may depend on the linguistic context and specific properties of the language under analysis. It is essential to note, however, that Optimality Theory and its grounding on phonetic substance have been criticized by proponents of \\"substance-free phonology,\\" such as Mark Hale and Charles Reiss. These critics argue against the reliance on phonetic grounding of constraints and representational elements like features, suggesting alternative ways to approach the study of phonology and morphology without assuming predetermined linguistic elements based on phonetic substance. Despite these criticisms, Optimality Theory remains a dominant trend in the study of phonology and morphology and sheds light on the importance of constraints and their relative ranking in the organization of linguistic systems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Just 25 years ago, the top three career hopes for young people in Britain were teacher, banker and doctor.Now, they want to be sports star, pop star and actor, according to survey by the Guardian newspaper. Rachel, a character in the popular TV show Glee, may be said to speak for British teenagers.\\"Nowadays being nobody is worse than being poor.\\" He said. Emma Brockes, a reporter with the Guardian, believes it is \\"the bad influence of celebrity culture\\" that is to blame.\\"When children wanted to be doctor, it wasn't because they were really more interested in the functions of human organs than they are now; you go where the respect is.\\" She wrote. It could explain why there has been such an increase in levels of anxiety and depression.Dr Carlo Stranger, of Tel Aviv University, studied the sense of self for his new book The Fear of Insignificance: Searching for Meaning in the 21st Century.He told the Daily Mail that young people now are \\"affected by the close connection to the global entertainment network, which has turned ranking and rating people according to wealth and celebrity into an obsession .\\" \\"As humans, we naturally measure ourselves to those around us, but now we live in a global village.We are comparing ourselves with the most 'important' people in the world and finding ourselves wanting,\\" he said.Today, even high achievers constantly fear that they are insignificant when they compare themselves to success stories in the media. The way out? Simply stop measuring your achievement through a fantasy of wealth and celebrity.Dr Strenger said that it is a process called \\"active self-acceptance through a constant search for self-knowledge through life.\\" \\"The fear of insignificance can only be overcome through strong individual and cultural identity over and above measurable achievement,\\" he said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does a Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator works? How does it feel like to always be an option to others? In terms of love life, friendship, work. Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Available choices: +no. +yes.","completion":"These two questions are inquiring about different information. +no. Now, I will respond to each question separately. 1. How does a Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator works? A Facebook app like Love or Friendship calculator typically uses a combination of algorithms, user inputs, and data mining techniques to generate compatibility scores or results. Here's a general overview of how the process works: a. User authorization and data collection: The user usually needs to authorize the app to access their Facebook data. The app then collects personal information from the user's profile, such as age, gender, location, relationship status, mutual friends, likes, and posts. b. User input: Depending on the app, the user may be asked to input information about themselves, the person they are interested in, and their preferences in a partner or friend. This may include personality traits, physical appearance, hobbies, interests, and other factors that could affect compatibility. c. Algorithm and calculation: The app applies its algorithm, which is a set of predefined rules or formulae designed to analyze the collected data and user inputs. The algorithm processes the data to determine which factors are most important in defining compatibility and assigns different weights to each factor. It may involve deriving meaningful relationships between data points, analyzing patterns, calculating similarity or distance metrics, and applying machine learning techniques. d. Result presentation: After processing the data, the app calculates a compatibility score or result that quantifies the level of compatibility between the users or their compatibility with the ideal match. The app may present the score as a percentage, a graphical representation, or a simple statement like \\"You are a great match\\" or \\"You are just friends.\\" Please note that these apps are largely for entertainment purposes, and their results should not be taken too seriously. The algorithms behind these apps are not scientifically accurate and cannot truly predict the success of personal relationships. 2. How does it feel like to always be an option to others? In terms of love life, friendship, work. Feeling like an option rather than a priority can lead to various emotional responses. I will outline some of the possible emotions and thoughts one might experience in different aspects of life. a. Love life: In a romantic relationship, feeling like an option might cause a person to feel undervalued, insecure, and unloved. They may question their partner's commitment and their own worthiness of love. It can lead to emotional stress, self-doubt, and a decline in self-esteem. b. Friendship: In friendship, repeatedly feeling like an option can result in feelings of loneliness, hurt, and resentment. One might feel taken for granted, unappreciated, and used by their friends. This may lead to questions of whether the friendship truly serves its purpose and if it has any real value. c. Work: In a professional setting, feeling like an option may result in a lack of motivation, decreased job satisfaction, and low self-confidence. One might feel that their efforts are not recognized, their opinions are not valued, and their work is not genuinely appreciated. Over time, this could harm not only one's career but also their mental well-being. To overcome these negative emotions and situations, it is essential for individuals to assert their boundaries and communicate effectively with their partners, friends, and colleagues about their feelings and needs. Developing self-confidence and knowing one's worth is also crucial for maintaining healthy relationships in all aspects of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Matt Franklin is a recent MIT graduate who works at a Los Angeles Suncoast Video store in 1988 while trying to figure out what he wants to do with his life, something that his police officer father has grown impatient with. While working one day, Matt's high school crush, Tori Frederking walks into the store. After pretending that he doesn't work there and saying that he works at Goldman Sachs in an effort to impress her, Tori invites Matt to a Labor Day party, hosted by Matt's twin sister Wendy's boyfriend, Kyle Masterson, at his hillside home. Later that night, Matt, Wendy, and Matt's best friend, Barry Nathan, head to the party. On the drive over, Barry steals a brand new Mercedes-Benz convertible from the car dealership he got fired from earlier that day, justifying his actions by saying that Matt needs the convertible if he really wants to impress Tori. The trio arrive at the party. While there, Matt catches up with an old classmate (who actually works at Goldman Sachs) and then awkwardly tries to woo Tori. Barry snorts some cocaine he found in the glove box of the stolen convertible and gets involved in a dance-off, and Wendy's boyfriend proposes to her in front of everyone at the party. She says yes, upsetting Matt, who doesn't think that Kyle will support her in her dream to attend graduate school at the University of Cambridge. Tori eventually invites Matt and Barry to another party her boss is hosting in Beverly Hills. Matt takes Tori there in the Mercedes, while Barry rides with her two friends in another car, using the cocaine as an enticement to let him go along. Barry has a wild sexual encounter with an older woman while Matt and Tori continue to mingle with each other, after Matt's successful 'put down' of Tori's boss, a habitual sexual harasser. They leave the party to go into a neighbor's backyard where they jump on a trampoline, play truth or dare, and end up having sex.

Johnny Hooker, a grifter in Joliet, Illinois, cons 11,000 in cash (187,600 today) in a pigeon drop from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in Chicago to teach him \\"the big con\\". Unfortunately, their victim was a numbers racket courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hookerâs cut.

Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then out-cheats him to win 15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation.

In test A, whose substance would have higher temperature, John or Keith? John an Keith are coworkers in a chemistry lab. Yesterday, they conducted there tests, test A, test B, and test C. In test A, John kept a substance in solid state, but Keith changed the same substance from solid to liquid state. In test B, John conducted a chemical reaction in low temperature, but Keith conducted the same chemical reaction in high temperature. Finally, in test C, John kept an unstable material in room temperature, but Keith kept the same unstable material in a cool container. Hint: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Answer:","completion":"In test A, Keith's substance would have a higher temperature than John's substance. This is inferred from the information provided in the paragraph, which states that both John and Keith were working with the same substance. In test A, John kept the substance in a solid state, while Keith transformed the substance from a solid to a liquid state. Since temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter, and it is mentioned that when a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is due to an increase in the temperature of the material, we can conclude that the change in state for Keith's substance indicates a higher temperature than John's substance.

The top 50 m (160 ft) of a glacier are rigid because they are under low pressure. This upper section is known as the fracture zone and moves mostly as a single unit over the plastically flowing lower section. When a glacier moves through irregular terrain, cracks called crevasses develop in the fracture zone. Crevasses form due to differences in glacier velocity. If two rigid sections of a glacier move at different speeds and directions, shear forces cause them to break apart, opening a crevasse. Crevasses are seldom more than 46 m (150 ft) deep but in some cases can be 300 m (1,000 ft) or even deeper. Beneath this point, the plasticity of the ice is too great for cracks to form.

The Blackfoot Confederacy, Niitsitapi or Siksikaitsitapi (nitmowmeko, meaning \\"the people\\" or \\"Blackfoot-speaking real people\\") is a historic collective name for the four bands that make up the Blackfoot or Blackfeet people: three First Nation band governments in the provinces of Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia, and one federally recognized Native American tribe in Montana, United States. The Siksika (\\"Blackfoot\\"), the Kainai or Kainah (\\"Blood\\"), and the Northern Piegan or Peigan or Piikani (\\"Apa'tosee\\" or \\"Poor Robes\\") reside in Canada; the Southern Piegan/Piegan Blackfeet (\\"Amskapi Piikani\\" or Pikuni) are located in the United States, where they are also known as the Blackfeet Nation. In modern use, the term is sometimes used only for the three First Nations in Canada. Historically, the member peoples of the Confederacy were nomadic bison hunters and trout fishermen, who ranged across large areas of the northern Great Plains of western North America, specifically the semi-arid shortgrass prairie ecological region. The Niitsitapi main source of food on the plains was the American bison (buffalo), the largest mammal in North America, standing about 6 1/2 feet (2.0 m) tall and weighing up to 2,000 pounds (910 kg). Before the introduction of horses, the Niitsitapi needed other ways to get in range. The buffalo jump was one of the most common ways. The hunters would round up the buffalo into V-shaped pens, and drive them over a cliff (they hunted pronghorn antelopes in the same way). Afterwords the hunters would go to the bottom and take as much meat as they could carry back to camp. They also used camouflage for hunting. The hunters would take buffalo skins from previous hunting trips and drape them over their bodies to blend in and mask their scent. By subtle moves, the hunters could get close to the herd. When close enough, the hunters would attack with arrows or spears to kill wounded animals. The people used virtually all parts of the body and skin. The women prepared the meat for food: by boiling, roasting or drying for jerky. This processed it to last a long time without spoiling, and they depended on bison meat to get through the winters. The winters were long, harsh, and cold due to the lack of trees in the Plains, so people stockpiled meat in summer. As a ritual, hunters often ate the bison heart minutes after the kill. The women tanned and prepared the skins to cover the tepees. These were made of log poles, with the skins draped over it. The tepee remained warm in the winter and cool in the summer, and was a great shield against the wind. The women also made clothing from the skins, such as robes and moccasins, and made soap from the fat. Both men and women made utensils, sewing needles and tools from the bones, using tendon for fastening and binding. The stomach and bladder were cleaned and prepared for use for storing liquids. Dried bison dung was fuel for the fires. The Niitsitapi considered the animal sacred and integral to their lives. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: what was the importance and uses of bison?","completion":"The importance and uses of bison for the Niitsitapi can be summarized from the quote: \\"The people used virtually all parts of the body and skin.

Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, who had recently lost both her husband and the hope of ever having children of her own, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew and protests. Because she drew the infant out of the water, Bithiah decides to name the baby Moses.

Moses loves Nefretiri, who is the throne princess and must be betrothed to the next Pharaoh. She reciprocates his love. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God.

Process: - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose animal being wakened during hibernation happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Yes, perturbation or disturbance during hibernation can have direct and indirect effects on an animal's ability to hibernate properly. **Direct effects:** 1. Energy expenditure: When an animal is woken up during hibernation, its body must work harder to increase its heart rate, blood flow, and metabolic rate again. This sudden break in hibernation consumes additional energy, which otherwise would be conserved during uninterrupted hibernation. 2. Increased stress: Disturbing an animal during hibernation causes stress, which may lead to an elevation of stress hormones such as cortisol. High cortisol levels in the bloodstream can negatively impact an animal's health and ability to return to a proper hibernation state. 3. Reduced body fat reserves: Constant disturbance during hibernation may lead the animal to use up its stored fat reserves faster than anticipated. Body fat reserves are crucial for an animal's survival during the hibernation period, as they provide energy and help maintain body temperature. **Indirect effects:** 1. Health risks: If the animal has to leave its den due to disturbances, it may be exposed to harsh weather conditions or predators. This exposure increases the risk of injury, infections, or predation, which can weaken the animal and hinder successful hibernation. 2. Inadequate rest: Hibernation serves as a time for rest and rejuvenation, and disturbance can diminish the quality of this critical resting period. Inadequate rest can cause long-lasting negative effects on the animal's health, including weakened immune system and reduced ability to reproduce. 3. Reduced reproductive success: Frequent disruptions may not only reduce an animal's body fat reserves but also affect its ability to find a mate or reproduce successfully. It might result in a decreased population if a large portion of animals within a species fails to reproduce. In conclusion, perturbations during hibernation can have significant consequences on an animal's hibernation process and overall health. It is essential to be cautious and respectful of their natural behavior to ensure their survival during this critical period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The bill stalled on a 56-43 vote, four short of the 60 votes needed to overcome the Republican opposition. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, changed his vote to \\"no\\" as a tactical move, allowing him to bring the measure up later. Reid and other Democrats accused Republicans of stalling the National Defense Authorization Act, which traditionally passes with bipartisan support, to undermine the \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" repeal and an immigration provision offering a path to citizenship for students and soldiers who are children of illegal immigrants.

In total, Lord Salisbury served as prime minister for approximately 13 years and 252 days. Under Lord Salisbury's leadership, Britain underwent a period of political stability, imperial expansion, and prosperous economic growth. During this time, the UK played an influential role in global affairs, and Lord Salisbury was recognized for his diplomatic skills. The shipbuilding and naval works program led by Sir Frederick William Richards aimed at modernizing and expanding the British navy to maintain its dominance over the seas, especially as other world powers were investing heavily in their own navies. This program was shaped by the global competition of the late 19th century, known as the naval arms race. Under Richards' direction, the Royal Navy saw significant technological advancement and growth. Ships were constructed incorporating new innovations in steel armor plate technology, steam turbine engine propulsion, and modern artillery equipment. Furthermore, Sir Frederick focused on implementing new ship designs, such as the development of the pre-dreadnought battleship, which would serve as the precursor to the revolutionary HMS Dreadnought. These efforts increased the strategic power of the British Empire and ensured its prominence in European and global politics during Lord Salisbury's administration. The relationship between Lord Salisbury and Sir Frederick William Richards exemplifies the strong collaboration between political and military leadership necessary to navigate the complexities of the rapidly changing world in the late 19th century."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Keith is a doctor at the city hospital.

Input: Question: What is the population of the place where the extension would connect to West Kirby? Passage 1:In 1873, the Hoylake and Birkenhead Railway was authorised to construct two extensions to its lines. One was a short connecting section near to Birkenhead docks, and the other was the extension from Hoylake to West Kirby. The station and the extension were opened on 1 April 1878 as the terminus of the Wirral Railway's route from Birkenhead Park station. The station's original signal box was built in 1886, to a London and North Western Railway (LNWR) design. This signal box was removed and replaced in 1932. After the opening of the Mersey Railway Tunnel in 1886, carriages were operated through Birkenhead Park, every half-hour, all the way to James Street station in Liverpool. As traffic increased, the line into West Kirby was doubled, from a single track, in 1896. After a board meeting on 28 October 1895, it was decided to extend the line from Hooton, into West Kirby. The station was relocated on the western side of the original station, with an enlarged island platform and rebuilt, in 1898-9, in red brick, with a turreted clock tower and mock Tudor frontage. A further platform was constructed for the Hooton line, on the eastern side of the original station. The site of the original station was used for goods sidings. In the present day, this is the site of The Concourse, a community building operated by Wirral Metropolitan Borough Council. Passage 2:Meléndez began his wrestling career in 1951 at age 18. During a lengthy tenure in his native Puerto Rico, he went under various monikers and learned the ropes with the likes of Pedro Morales and Carlos Colón Sr.. Meléndez made his United States debut at Sunnyside Garden in Long Island, New York in 1963. Primarily using the name Gypsy Joe by this point, he mainly worked for Nick Gulas and later Jerry Jarrett in the Southeastern region, particularly Mid-Southern Wrestling. During his Gulas run, he was often teamed with heels like Tojo Yamamoto, with whom he formed the No Pain Train, and The Cuban Assassin. He also joined forces with Frank Martinez to be collectively known as the Blue Infernos. The masked duo would attain tag team championships on numerous occasions. By the 1970s, Gypsy Joe was a local star of Chattanooga, Tennessee, regularly performing at Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Auditorium on Saturdays and appearing on local WDEF-TV. His career wasn't limited to the South, however, winning championships around the country as well as in Canada’s Stampede Wrestling. Passage 3:Coming off their win over the Steelers the Jets played an interconference duel with the Bears. In the first quarter the Jets trailed early as kicker Robbie Gould got a 37-yard field goal, followed by Matt Forte getting a 22-yard TD run. The Jets pulled ahead with RB Shonn Greene getting a 3-yard TD run, followed by CB Dwight Lowery returning an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, followed by RB LaDainian Tomlinson getting a 3-yard TD run letting the Jets lead 21–10. The lead was narrowed as QB Jay Cutler scrambled 2 yards for a touchdown, but was soon extended as kicker Nick Folk made a 26-yard field goal. They trailed again with Cutler completing a 40 and a 25-yard TD pass to wide receivers Devin Hester and Johnny Knox respectively, but soon were able to tie the game with QB Mark Sanchez throwing a 23-yard TD pass to WR Santonio Holmes. The Bears escaped the tie with Cutler finding Knox again on a 26-yard TD pass. The Jets tried to come back, but only came away with a 34-yard field goal from Folk. When the Jets got the ball back, Sanchez threw a pass intended for Holmes, only to be intercepted by safety Chris Harris with 0:58 to go.

Write an article with the title: \\"Congress warned that drones present 'a nightmare scenario for civil liberties'\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Congress Warned That Drones Present 'A Nightmare Scenario for Civil Liberties' Introduction Advanced technology has a significant impact on the way society functions and carries out essential tasks, with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones, featuring prominently in various fields. However, the rapid increase in drone usage has raised significant concerns about the potential encroach of privacy and civil liberties. Lawmakers in Congress have been warned about the nightmare scenario these UAVs could present, fueling an urgent debate in the legislative chambers. The Emergence of Drones In the twenty-first century, drones have emerged as disruptive technology that has found numerous applications. Originally developed for military purposes, drones have been employed in non-combat roles such as aerial surveillance, search and rescue, firefighting, and even delivering packages. The demand for drone technology has grown exponentially, with private citizens, corporations, and government agencies seeking to take advantage of their convenience and versatility. The Threat to Civil Liberties Despite their usefulness and novel applications, drones also present significant risks to civil liberties and privacy. ACLU legislative counsel Neema Singh Guliani cautioned Congress about the potential risk of an Orwellian society where the government uses drones to spy on law-abiding citizens, making it nearly impossible for them to enjoy their right to privacy. Drones are equipped with cameras and other surveillance devices that can capture detailed images and videos of individuals, which could be used maliciously by law enforcement or third parties to invade citizens' privacy or track their activities. The lack of transparency and public knowledge regarding data collection and storage policies further exacerbates these concerns and erodes public trust. Congressional Concerns and Actions Members of Congress have taken heed of the warnings and are working on legislation to address the potential threats that drones pose to civil liberties and privacy. Some lawmakers have suggested imposing strict regulations on the use of drones, particularly by law enforcement, to prevent abuse of power and unwarranted surveillance. Furthermore, Congress may consider requiring specific warrants or establishing particular criteria for drone use in domestic investigations or specialized missions. They may also push for legislation that enforces transparency and accountability when it comes to data collection, storage, and sharing policies. Balancing Innovation and Privacy In the quest to balance innovation and privacy rights, stakeholders need to tread carefully to ensure that regulations do not impede the growth of the drone industry while also adequately protecting citizen's rights. As drones continue to advance in technology and application, it is essential for public and private sectors to work collaboratively, establishing a dialogue on ethical and legal norms surrounding UAV usage. The Role of the Public The public also has a crucial role in determining the future trajectory of drone technology and its impact on civil liberties. By engaging with lawmakers and demanding transparency, citizens can influence the nature of regulations and ensure their concerns are addressed. In working together with legislators, civil society, and drone industry representatives, the public can create an environment where drones serve the public interest without compromising personal freedom and privacy. Conclusion The rapid increase in drone applications brings with it both immense potential and significant challenges. While drones promise to revolutionize industries and daily life, they also present a potential nightmare scenario for civil liberties and privacy. By acknowledging the potential risks and implementing appropriate legislative measures alongside public engagement, Congress can protect citizens' rights while supporting the growth of a valuable and innovative industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Peace talks aimed at ending a 22-month-old crisis in Sudan #39;s troubled Darfur region, scheduled for Friday in Nigerian capital Abuja, has been postponed for a day, a spokesman for the African Union said.","completion":"The information given is about the peace talks that were aimed to resolve the ongoing crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. The talks were scheduled to take place in Abuja, Nigeria, under the auspices of the African Union. However, they have been postponed for a day by the African Union spokesperson. The crisis in Darfur began back in 2003 and has continued for more than two decades. It is a complex conflict characterized by violence between different ethnic groups, government forces, and rebel movements in the region. The situation has resulted in a massive humanitarian crisis, with millions of people being displaced from their homes, widespread human rights abuses, and significant loss of life. The crisis in Darfur is rooted in a number of long-standing issues, including political, social, and economic marginalization of the non-Arab ethnic groups in the region by the central Sudanese government. This has resulted in a lack of access to basic resources, services, and development opportunities for the people of Darfur. Additionally, the region has been affected by environmental challenges, such as desertification and competition over scarce resources like water and fertile land, which further exacerbate tensions and conflicts between the different groups. In response to the ongoing crisis in Darfur, peace negotiations have been conducted by the African Union, an organization designed to promote unity, cooperation, and peace among African countries. These talks have aimed to address the root causes of the conflict, secure a ceasefire, and establish a comprehensive peace agreement among the warring factions. The goal of these negotiations is to bring an end to the violence and suffering, promote reconciliation, and establish a lasting and stable peace in the region. The peace talks scheduled for Friday in Abuja, Nigeria, represent an attempt to further advance these discussions and come to a resolution. By bringing together representatives from the Sudanese government, rebel movements, and other relevant stakeholders, it is hoped that the talks will allow for meaningful dialogue and progress towards ending the crisis in Darfur. The one-day postponement of the talks indicates that there may be some remaining challenges or obstacles that need to be addressed before negotiations can effectively proceed. This could include logistical issues, disputes over representation, or other concerns that prevent participants from engaging in constructive dialogue. However, the postponement also signifies that the African Union and other involved parties remain committed to finding a solution to the Darfur crisis and are willing to continue their efforts to achieve peace and stability in the region. In conclusion, the information provided is about the peace talks aimed at ending the 22-month-old crisis in Sudan's Darfur region. The talks, originally scheduled for Friday, have been postponed for a day by the African Union spokesperson. The crisis in Darfur has been ongoing for more than two decades and is characterized by violence, displacement, and suffering. These peace negotiations, led by the African Union, are essential in working towards a resolution to this devastating conflict and bringing about lasting peace and stability in the region. The fact that the talks have only been postponed for a day demonstrates the commitment and determination of the involved parties seeking a peaceful and lasting solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When radio greetings sent to Venus go unanswered, Harringway announces that a journey to Venus is the only alternative. The recently completed Soviet spaceship Cosmostrator intended to voyage to Mars, is redirected to Venus, a 30- to 31-day journey. During the voyage, Sikarna works furiously to translate the alien message using the spaceship's computer. When their spaceship nears Venus, radio interference from the planet cuts the crew off from Earth. By then, Sikarna's efforts lead to a stunning discovery: The spool describes a Venusian plan to irradiate the Earth's surface, with the extermination of mankind being the prelude to an invasion. Rather than containing a \\"cosmic document\\", as had been expected, the spool bears a cold-blooded message of destruction. Harringway convinces the crew to press on towards Venus rather than return to Earth with news that would panic mankind. With the ship's robot, Omega, American astronaut Brinkman pilots a one-man landing craft. On the ground, he encounters an industrial complex and finds small recording devices that look like insects. The rest of the crew follows when Cosmostrator lands, but they find no Venusian life forms. Journeying across the planet, they find the remains of a deserted and blasted city centered around a huge crater, signs of a catastrophic explosion so intense that shadowy forms of humanoid Venusians are permanently burned on to...

Do you know why so many people wanted to reach the top of the world? It was breathtaking. It was wonderful and a bit of frightening. It was Qomolangma, the highest mountain in the world. For many years, it has attracted tens of thousands of people who tried to climb its dangerous slopes. During May's 60th anniversary of the first successful climb, nearly 600 people from around the world, including a 5-year-old Italian boy, tried to reach the \\"roof of the world\\". China Central Television(CCTV) also sent a team to join the adventure. It broadcasted a special program, called \\"Standing at the world's third pole in 2013\\", from May 18 to 24 to cover the Chinese climbing Qomolangma. Over the last century, the 8848-metre-high peak has proven a great challenge for mountaineers. Those who try to stand on top of the world do so at great risk from extremely cold, avalanches , and falling ice. At 8,500 meters, the air contains just one-third of the oxygen at sea level, requiring most climbers to use oxygen tanks. Some of those who climbed the mountain paid the highest price---175 people have lost their lives on the slopes. On May29, 1953, Sir Edmund Hillary from New Zealand and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal became the first men ever to reach the top of the mountain. Nearly half a century later, the sons of the two pioneers, Peter Hillary and Jaming Tenzing Norgay, followed in their fathers' footsteps. In 2002, they also successfully reached the roof of the world. Over the last 60 years, more than 10,000 men and women have tried to climb the mountain and more than 1,200 have succeeded. The first Chinese climbers reached the top of the mountain in 1960. Despite the dangers, many different people are drawn towards the challenge.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Pick your answer from: - no - yes","completion":"When answering these questions, it is important to address them separately as they do not ask the same thing. So, the answer is: no. Now, let's address each question in detail: First question: When I sing, am I supposed to feel vibrations in my face? When singing, it is entirely normal to feel vibrations in your face, as well as other parts of your body. These vibrations occur because sound waves travel through physical objects in the form of mechanical vibrations. When you sing, your vocal cords vibrate, creating sound waves that radiate from your mouth and throat. As these waves travel through the air and interact with the surrounding environment, they also pass through the tissues and bones in your face, causing vibrations to be felt. There are specific sensations that singers often feel, such as resonance. Resonance refers to the amplification and enrichment of sound produced by the interaction of sound waves with the structures of the vocal tract, including the sinuses, nasal passages, and oral and throat cavities. A singer who is singing with proper technique will often feel resonance in their facial bones, particularly the mask area (around the nose, cheeks, and forehead). This is considered a positive sensation and indicates efficient use of the vocal instrument. Second question: Why is my voice changing and I am not able to sing? There are many possible reasons for changes in your voice and difficulties in singing. Some common factors include: 1. Age: As individuals mature, especially during adolescence, hormonal changes can affect the structure and function of the vocal cords. This may lead to a change in the range, pitch, or timbre of your voice. 2. Vocal fatigue: Excessive use or misuse of your voice, such as constant talking or singing without proper technique, can strain your vocal cords, causing them to swell or become irritated. This may result in temporary changes to your voice and reduced singing ability. 3. Illness: Infections such as colds, flu, or laryngitis can lead to inflammation or swelling of the vocal cords, which in turn may cause a temporary change in your voice and make it difficult to sing. 4. Technique issues: Singing with improper technique can place strain on your vocal cords and create tension in your throat, leading to a reduction in your singing ability and possible changes in your voice. These issues can typically be addressed with vocal training and guidance from a skilled voice teacher. 5. Psychological factors: Sometimes, the issue is not physical, but rather psychological. Performance anxiety, stress, or mood changes can affect the way you perceive your own singing abilities and the resulting sound that you produce. In order to determine why your voice is changing and you are not able to sing, it may be helpful to consult with a speech-language pathologist or experienced voice teacher to address your concerns, identify any underlying issues, and develop a personalized treatment or training plan to help you improve your singing abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose death could not be determined to be accident or suicide? is inside the article: In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in..., can you guess it ?

Movie title: The Grey Zone Movie plot: The film opens in October 1944, in the Auschwitz-Birkenau extermination camp. A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers. A new trainload of Hungarian Jewish prisoners arrives, and all are immediately sent to the gas chambers. As the group is given instructions about \\"delousing\\", a fearful, angry man in the group begins shouting questions at one of the Sonderkommandos, Hoffman (Arquette), who has been issuing the instructions. Hoffman beats him to death in an outburst of frustration, in an attempt to make the man stop talking. After the gassing of this same group, a badly shaken Hoffman finds a young girl alive beneath a pile of bodies. He removes her from the chamber, and, after informing the leader of the insurgency, Schlermer (Daniel Benzali), takes her to a storage room and summons Nyiszli, who revives her. The group decides to hide her in the childrenâs camp. While the prisoners hide her in a dressing room, SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer Eric Muhsfeldt (Keitel) suddenly walks in. Noticing that one of the prisoners present, Abramowics (Buscemi), is there illegally, he shoots him, prompting the girl... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Grey Zone,\\" the prisoners, specifically the Sonderkommandos, are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village. These citizens are likely part of the Polish resistance, who were against the Nazi regime and sought to support any effort that might weaken or disrupt their operations. The firearms provided by the Polish citizens would be crucial in assisting the Sonderkommandos in their plot to destroy one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. Additionally, the prisoners also receive gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory, where female prisoners work. These women take great risks in smuggling the gunpowder into the men's camp by hiding it amid the bodies of deceased workers. This highlights the collaboration and solidarity among the prisoners in their shared goal of rebelling against the Nazis. However, as we evaluate this film proposal, it is essential to consider a few factors to determine whether it is worth investing in. First and foremost, we must consider the historical accuracy of the events portrayed in the film. While there were instances of resistance, uprisings, and sabotage within concentration camps during World War II, it is crucial to ensure that the movie does not significantly deviate from actual events or present misleading information. Consulting with historians and experts could help in making sure that the film is as accurate as possible. Additionally, it would be vital to assess the film's potential appeal to a broader audience. While the story seems to contain elements of drama, action, and struggle, the subject matter's sensitive nature and the graphic depiction of the events in the extermination camp could potentially limit the movie's target audience. Thus, some potential viewers might find the film to be too intense or challenging to watch. The film's production quality would also be a crucial factor in determining whether to invest in the project. A high-quality production team, alongside an experienced and talented cast, would be necessary to accurately portray the complex and nuanced story of the prisoners and their efforts to rebel against their oppressors. This could include considering the film's budget, director, screenwriter, and available resources to ensure the best possible outcome. Lastly, it is important to keep in mind the ethical considerations of producing a film based on such a sensitive and historically significant subject. Ensuring that the story is told with respect and empathy for the people who suffered through these horrifying events is essential. In conclusion, the decision to invest in this film proposal should involve careful consideration of its historical accuracy, audience appeal, production quality, and ethical implications. Balancing these factors will enable you to make an informed decision about whether or not to support the project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In order to stay up to date and make informed decisions, the parliament should receive regular reports and updates on various aspects of the water situation. It may include data on water availability and consumption, water quality, the status of water infrastructure, and emerging risks and challenges concerning water resources. Additionally, it should also consider best practices and recommendations from experts in the field to develop sound policies and adapt to the changing water scenario. It is essential for the government to involve all relevant stakeholders, including local communities, industries, and environmental organizations, in the planning and management of water resources. This will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the water situation and ensure that all perspectives are considered in the decision-making process.

Sad stories do exist in large numbers for the past lottery winners and that's why some financial experts say \\"70 percent of lottery winners will squander away winning within a few years.\\" Some end up losing all within two years, family relationships destroyed or even worse. Wayne Schenk was an old soldier diagnosed with lung cancer. When he won a million dollars in a lottery he thought his troubles were over and he would get the advanced medical treatment that might save his life. But Lottery officials refused to pay him the total sum in a single payment and they said they could not make an exception to the regulations. When Schenk died in 2007, he'd only received one payment of 34,000. Another lottery winner, Billy Bob Harrell, Jr. killed himself two years after winning 31 million dollars in the Texas lottery in 1997.He'd spent large amounts of money and given large amounts away, but he didn't end me expected peace that should have come with the freedom of money. Other lottery winners have ended up in prison for crimes.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. While the original First Blood had its far-fetched moments, it was at least exciting in parts. In Rambo: First Blood, Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic-book action. Plausibility is totally rejected; logic nose-dives; Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission. Just like any other wish-fulfilment actioner of that time (e.g. Invasion USA, Commando, Red Scorpion), Rambo: First Blood, Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for. If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers, what is left to get excited about? Imprisoned after the events of the first movie, John J Rambo (Sylvester Stallone) is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East. The year is 1985, and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam. Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman (Richard Crenna), but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock (Charles Napier). Rambo's job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs  if it doesn't, he is to rendezvous with a chopper; if it does, he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date. Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge, the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao (Julia Nickson). Sure enough, Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp, but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point, the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who, it seems, doesn't really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications. Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured, but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock. The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff's polished photography, Jerry Goldsmith's exhilarating score, and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics. Beyond these scant pickings, the film is a failure. The actors are reduced to macho posturing, the plot rings false, the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless, the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable. At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan, a man with simplistic and near-hysterical anti-communist sentiments. For this reason, contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie-bashing shooting-fest as if it was the greatest movie of all-time, transforming it into an undeserved box office success. Thankfully times have changed  nowadays we can look upon it as a simple-minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count, ludicrously dumb politics, and a ludicrous hero. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer points out various aspects of the movie as weak or lacking, such as the implausible plot, lack of excitement due to the invulnerable hero, soulless action sequences, and absurd dialogue.

For example, if you want to go from 60 ppm to 80 ppm in a 10,000 US gal (38,000 L) pool, you would add 2.5 pounds (1,100 g) of baking soda.

For example, how to go to school is a problem I often worry about. Every afternoon, my father picks me up at the gate of the school. Many parents pick up their children, too. Most of them drive private cars. Of all the cars, Anna's father's car is the best. Anna seems to have a very rich father. She always has beautiful dresses, shoes and bags. Besides these, she is also very beautiful. But she has no friends in school. When other students are playing, she never joins them. I don't like her because she is too perfect. It makes me uncomfortable to make friends with her. She seems to have everything. One afternoon, when I went to my father's car, I saw a small thing fall out of Anna's bag. So I called her quickly. However, she didn't look back and kept going. I felt very angry with her.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men. In fact, it did quite the opposite. The widespread, relatively equitable property ownership which distinguished America and determined its mores and values also explained why the American masses held elites in such contempt.

Title: Clash of the Titans Movie plot: King Acrisius of Argos (Donald Houston) imprisons his daughter DanaÃ« (Vida Taylor), jealous of her beauty. When the god Zeus (Laurence Olivier) impregnates her, Acrisius sends his daughter and his newborn grandson Perseus to sea in a wooden chest. In retribution, Zeus kills Acrisius and orders Poseidon (Jack Gwillim) to release the last of the Titans, a gigantic sea creature called the Kraken, to destroy Argos. Meanwhile, DanaÃ« and Perseus safely float to the island of Seriphos, where Perseus grows to adulthood. Calibos (Neil McCarthy), son of the sea goddess Thetis (Maggie Smith), is a young man engaged to marry Princess Andromeda (Judi Bowker), the daughter of Queen Cassiopeia (SiÃ¢n Phillips) and heir to the rich city of Joppa; but for committing several atrocities against Zeus, including hunting and destroying Zeus's sacred flying horses (excepting only Pegasus), Zeus transforms Calibos into a monstrous satyr and he is exiled by his people. In revenge, Thetis transports an adult Perseus (Harry Hamlin) from Seriphos to an abandoned amphitheatre in Joppa, where he is befriended by an elderly poet named Ammon (Burgess Meredith) and learns that Andromeda is under a curse and cannot marry unless her suitor successfully answers a riddle, whose failures are burned at the stake. In order to aid his son, Zeus sends Perseus a god-crafted helmet from Athena (Susan Fleetwood) which makes its wearer invisible, a magical sword from Aphrodite (Ursula Andress), and a shield from Hera (Claire Bloom). Perseus, wearing the helmet, captures Pegasus and follows Andromeda to learn the next riddle. Perseus is nearly killed by Calibos but manages to sever one of Calibos' hands, losing his helmet in the process. Perseus befriends Thallo (Tim Pigott-Smith) and presents himself as suitor and correctly answers the riddle, presenting the severed hand of Calibos. Perseus wins Andromeda's hand in marriage.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their divisional win over the Browns, the Steelers stayed at home for a Week 7 interconference duel with the 6-0 Minnesota Vikings. Pittsburgh got the game's opening score late in the first quarter with kicker Jeff Reed nailing a 39-yard field goal. The Vikings would answer in the second quarter with a 2-yard touchdown run from running back Adrian Peterson, yet the Steelers struck back with Ben Roethlisberger completing a 40-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver Mike Wallace. Both teams would swap field goals in the third quarter, with Reed booting a 27-yard field goal and Vikings kicker Ryan Longwell making an 18-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Pittsburgh defense came up with a huge play as defensive end Brett Keisel forced a fumble off of Vikings quarterback Brett Favre, allowing linebacker LaMarr Woodley to return the fumble 77&#160;yards for a touchdown. However, Minnesota immediately struck back as wide receiver Percy Harvin returned a kickoff 88&#160;yards for a touchdown. The Steelers' defense came up big again as linebacker Keyaron Fox returned a Favre interception 82&#160;yards for a touchdown. With the win, Pittsburgh went into their bye week at 5-2 while Minnesota dropped to 6-1.

Hint: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Answer:","completion":"Tony will experience more tooth decay. This is because he is eating candy, which is high in sugar. The bacteria in the mouth use these sugars for energy and produce lactic acid as a waste product, leading to tooth decay. On the other hand, Greg is eating celery, which is not high in sugar and would not contribute to a significant production of lactic acid in the mouth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who offers McQueen a sponsorship? Movie title: Cars Movie plot: In a world populated by anthropomorphic vehicles, the last race of the Piston Cup championship ends in a three-way tie between retiring veteran Strip \\"The King\\" Weathers, infamous runner-up Chick Hicks, and rookie Lightning McQueen. The tiebreaker race is scheduled for one week later at the (fictional) Los Angeles International Speedway in California. Lightning is desperate to win the race, since it would not only make him the first rookie to win a championship, but also allow him to leave the unglamorous sponsorship of Rust-Eze and allow him to take The King's place as the sponsored car of the lucrative Dinoco team. Eager to start practice in California as soon as possible, he pushes his big rig, Mack, to travel all night long. While McQueen is sleeping, the exhausted Mack drifts off and is startled by a gang of four reckless street racers, causing McQueen to fall out the back of the trailer and onto the road. McQueen wakes in the middle of traffic and speeds off the highway to find Mack, only to end up in the run-down desert town of Radiator Springs, while inadvertently ruining the pavement of its main road. After being arrested and impounded overnight (while guarded by a rusty, but friendly, tow truck named Mater), McQueen is ordered by the town judge, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately. The local lawyer Sally Carrera requests that McQueen should instead be given community service to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. McQueen tries to repave it in a single day, but it turns out to be shoddy and he is ordered to repave the road again, which takes several days to complete. During this time, he becomes friends with several of the cars, and learns that Radiator Springs used to be a popular stopover along the old U.S. Route 66, but with the construction of Interstate 40 bypassing it, the town literally vanished from the map.

The main aspect discussed here involves placing a certain chocolate-coated item in a particular place, likely a refrigerator or freezer, until the chocolate has completely solidified or hardened. The given statement offers two options. The first option is to leave the items in the said place overnight to allow the chocolate to harden. The overnight method would probably facilitate a slow and thorough stiffening of the chocolate. Alternatively, the second option proposed is to keep them there just long enough for the chocolate to solidify. This method most likely suggests a shorter duration, making it a quicker option, beneficial when one is pressed for time. Once the chocolate on the items becomes solid to the touch, the preparation process concludes and they are ready to be served. This phrase correlates with many dessert recipes that require a final chilling and hardening step before the treats are fit to be enjoyed.

The core of the band consisted of Stephen Carroll and Paul Furgale. Now, let's look at the roles that these two core members played in the band: 1. Stephen Carroll: Vocalist and Guitarist. 2.

While both of them contributed to the band in other ways (with Carroll serving as a guitarist and Furgale as a bassist), the fact that they were both involved in providing vocals for the band leads us to conclude that the sentence is accurate.

Firstly, they state that despite being shaped like an egg, it still \\"gets the job done and serves it's purpose.\\" This means they found the product ultimately functional and capable of meeting their needs.

Catching Fire, out in Chinese theaters on Nov 21, is set in a futuristic society called Panem. Every year its government holds a televised fight to the death. Two teenagers from each of the 12 districts of Panem are chosen to compete. In the new film, last year's victors Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her partner Peeta are back home after winning the 74thHunger Games. Katniss just wants to live a normal life.

The teenager finds herself back in the competition along with Peeta. Since Katniss brings hope to Panem through her courage, President Snow plans to use this year's Games to kill off Katniss and Peeta and in turn _ the fires of rebellion. \\"This is the next step of Katniss' heroism and the next part of her journey to finding out who she is really going to be,\\" Lawrence told Reuters.

Haven't any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave?) My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid, and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on. Duh! What the crap were you expecting from a Jet Li movie? Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story, then just loaded it up with action? Of course not! Black Mask is awesome, wall-to-wall action throughout nearly it's entire running time.

Most of Li's other martial arts films are nursery-school when compared to Black Mask; there is no holding back on the gratuitous violence, bloodshed, or action sequences whatsoever!

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James Harold Doolittle (December 14, 1896 - September 27, 1993) was an American aviation pioneer. A Reserve officer in the United States Army Air Corps, Doolittle was recalled to active duty during World War II. He was awarded the Medal of Honor for personal valor and leadership as commander of the Doolittle Raid, a bold long-range retaliatory air raid on the Japanese main islands, on 18 April 1942, four months after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack was a major morale booster for the United States, and Doolittle was celebrated as a hero. Doolittle became acquainted with the field of space science in its infancy. He wrote in his autobiography, \\"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation [in the US].... While with Shell [Oil] I worked with him on the development of a type of [rocket] fuel....\\" Harry Guggenheim, whose foundation sponsored Goddard's work, and Charles Lindbergh, who encouraged Goddard's efforts, arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle piloted himself to Roswell, New Mexico in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's workshop and a \\"short course\\" in rocketry and space travel. He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \\"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away--who knows!\\" In July 1941 he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in rocket propulsion research. The Army, however, was interested only in JATO at this point. Doolittle was concerned about the state of rocketry in the US and remained in touch with Goddard. Shortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke to an American Rocket Society conference at which a large number interested in rocketry attended. The topic was Robert Goddard's work. He later stated that at that time \\"...we [the aeronautics field in the US] had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry. In 1956, he was appointed chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) because the previous chairman, Jerome C. Hunsaker, thought Doolittle to be more sympathetic to the rocket, which was increasing in importance as a scientific tool as well as a weapon. The NACA Special Committee on Space Technology was organized in January 1958 and chaired by Guy Stever to determine the requirements of a national space program and what additions were needed to NACA technology. Doolittle, Dr. Hugh Dryden and Stever selected committee members, such as Dr. Wernher von Braun from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency, Sam Hoffman of Rocketdyne, Abe Hyatt of the Office of Naval Research and Colonel Norman Appold from the USAF missile program, considering their potential contributions to US space programs and ability to educate NACA people in space science. Did he ever work with anyone famous during this time?","completion":"Yes, during this time, James Doolittle worked with many famous people. One example is when he worked with Robert H. Goddard, who was an important person in rocket development. He also met Charles Lindbergh and Harry Guggenheim, who supported Goddard's work. Later, Doolittle worked with people like Dr. Wernher von Braun from the Army Ballistic Missile Agency and Sam Hoffman of Rocketdyne, among others, when he was helping with the space program and rocket technology. So, he indeed worked with famous and important people during this time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Write some highlights for the following article: The United States has no plans to restrict travel from African countries hard-hit by the Ebola virus epidemic, the Obama administration said Monday. At the same time, the president's chief spokesman said the U.S. won't absolutely rule it out. 'A travel ban is not something that we're currently considering,' White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters. 'We feel good about the measures that are already in place,' he insisted. White House on tilt? Obama's aides are facing tough questions from reporters who demand to know why planes from Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea are still allowed to land at US airports amid an Ebolaepidemic. Now arriving in the US: 77 sick patients believed to be infected with Ebola have been stopped from boarding planes bound for America, and the White House says that's enough to suggest the planes can still come. Global village: West African nationals can connect to the US via Nigeria or Europe and the White House says the planes have to continue flying if supplies and aid workers are to reach those in need. 'Our experts continue to be confident that the medical infrastructure that we have in this country is sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak from occurring,' Earnest said. He continued Monday to project confidence, which some have interpreted as reassuring while others see it as complacency. Still, he adopted a never-say-never attitude when pressed on the subject. 'This is something that we regularly assess and re-assess, and – so I wouldn't rule out any changes in the future,' he said. Earnest explained that a back-and-forth flow of aviation traffic is needed in order to fight the Ebola outbreak from an ocean away. 'We're relying on the commercial transportation system to move supplies and personnel into the region,' he said. 'So we don't want to obstruct one of the core components of our strategy.' The administration is relying heavily on what Earnest called 'a multi-layered screening protocol' to spare Americans from the kind of public health devastation that has brought three countries to their knees and killed thousands. 'There are extensive screening measures on the ground in west Africa where this outbreak has occurred,' he said, adding that 'there's guidelines and guidance and training that has been given to flight crews.' 'There also is a protocol in place for Customs and Border Patrol officers who are manning our ports of entry,' Earnest added, 'to be on the lookout for individuals, again, that may be exhibiting symptoms of Ebola – in other words, that are contagious with Ebola.' But health officials said Sunday that they are considering the approval of new measures designed to provide the U.S. with one extra firewall, such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the U.S. from an affected nation. Death toll keeps tolling: Red Cross workers loaded the body of this Ebola victim onto a truck for disposal on Sunday. Setting boundaries: US Air Force personnel mark out the location of a future field hospital in Liberia with razor wire, which could be needed to keep hordes of patients out of the few clinics available. Other pandemics have seen similar strategies. In 2009, at the height of the avian influenza scare, China and other Asian nations required temperature checks of every passenger deplaning in Beijing and other major points of entry. But those modest steps, like the more drastic travel ban proposals, are just drawing-board ideas. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci said Sunday that a 'discussion is underway right now' and 'all options are being looked at' for new U.S.-based screening plans. But the question, he told CNN, is whether 'the extra level of screening is going to be worth the resources you need to put into it. At a press conference Sunday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief Dr. Thomas Frieden declared: 'There's no doubt that we can stop Ebola in this country.' He also said current screening protocols in Africa have stopped 77 potentially Ebola-infected people from boarding planes to America. The Ebola virus is transmitted via contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person. The current strain of the virus is believed to have killed about half of the people it has infected in Africa. U.S. officials stressed Friday during a White House press conference that America's public health system is more robust and will adequately protect the public. Highlights:","completion":"- The United States has no plans to restrict travel from African countries affected by the Ebola virus epidemic, according to the Obama administration. - However, the U.S. won't absolutely rule it out and will continue to assess the situation. - White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest says the current measures in place are sufficient to prevent an Ebola outbreak in the US. - Health officials are considering new measures, such as checking the body temperature of everyone who enters the U.S. from an affected nation, as an extra layer of protection. - Commercial aviation traffic remains essential for moving supplies and personnel into the affected region, so the administration does not want to obstruct this core component of their strategy."},{"prompt":"I read this background article the other day: Most ants are generalist predators, scavengers, and indirect herbivores, but a few have evolved specialised ways of obtaining nutrition. It is believed that many ant species that engage in indirect herbivory rely on specialized symbiosis with their gut microbes to upgrade the nutritional value of the food they collect and allow them to survive in nitrogen poor regions, such as rainforest canopies. Leafcutter ants (Atta and Acromyrmex) feed exclusively on a fungus that grows only within their colonies. They continually collect leaves which are taken to the colony, cut into tiny pieces and placed in fungal gardens. Ergates specialise in related tasks according to their sizes. The largest ants cut stalks, smaller workers chew the leaves and the smallest tend the fungus. Leafcutter ants are sensitive enough to recognise the reaction of the fungus to different plant material, apparently detecting chemical signals from the fungus. If a particular type of leaf is found to be toxic to the fungus, the colony will no longer collect it. The ants feed on structures produced by the fungi called gongylidia. Symbiotic bacteria on the exterior surface of the ants produce antibiotics that kill bacteria introduced into the nest that may harm the fungi. I am facing a new situation today: Bill and Chris are passionate entomologists. Bill knows everything there is to know about most ants except the Leafcutter ants. Chris studied Leafcutter ants extensively and exclusively for years now. They are good friends and exchange ideas often over a pint of beer.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks...

So, we need to identify the options that involve consuming a source of energy. Step 2: Evaluate the options From the given options, \\"+I can consume an apple\\" is the only one that involves consuming a source of energy. Eating an apple will provide your body with calories and nutrients that will help you replenish the energy you lost after exerting yourself. The other options do not directly provide energy: - \\"+I can go for a run\\": This will actually burn more energy and make you feel more tired. - \\"+I can brush my hair\\": This is a neutral activity and does not contribute to increased energy levels. - \\"+I can wash my face\\": While it may help to refresh and clean your face, this activity is not associated with directly providing energy to your body.

There are several reasons mentioned in the review that lead to this conclusion. Firstly, the title \\"Disappointing\\" clearly indicates that the customer did not enjoy the album and did not meet their expectations. This negative sentiment is a strong indicator of dissatisfaction. Secondly, the customer mentions that they were \\"disappointed\\" after looking forward to it, further emphasizing their dissatisfaction with the product.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK? ? In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

As late as 1986, the Justice Department found that the Mafia controlled the International Longshoremen's Association, the Hotel and Restaurant Employees union, the Teamsters union, and the Laborers' International Union. Does it follow that \\"The unions were never taken care of by the government.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not follow that \\"The unions were never taken care of by the government.\\" The statement given states that the government cleaned up the unions, which implies that the government had indeed taken measures to address the issue of Mafia control within those unions. However, it is important to look at the historical context and understand the various actions taken by the government to tackle the Mafia's influence on these unions. In the early and mid-20th century, organized crime groups, such as the Mafia, penetrated various sectors of the American economy, including labor unions. The Mafia exploited these unions to further their criminal activities, such as money laundering, racketeering, and extortion. In some cases, the criminal organizations formed alliances with corrupt union officials to gain control over entire unions. Recognizing the need to address the Mafia's influence on unions, the United States government initiated various investigations and measures to curb the Mafia's infiltration. The establishment of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act in 1970 was a significant milestone in the government's efforts to dismantle organized crime in the US, not only in unions but in other sectors as well. The RICO Act provided the legal framework to prosecute those involved in racketeering and infiltration of legitimate organizations, including labor unions. Starting from the 1980s, several high-profile cases were brought against organized crime figures and corrupt union officials under the RICO Act. For instance, in the 1980s, the government successfully prosecuted the leaders of the five major Mafia families in New York City, leading to a severe blow to organized crime's hold over many labor unions. Moreover, in 1989, the Teamsters union, which was once under the control of the Mafia, was placed under a consent decree with the government. This decree resulted in the implementation of democratic reforms within the union, the appointment of independent monitors, and the removal of organized crime influence from the union's leadership. The transformation of the Teamsters union is an example of the government's efforts to address the issue of Mafia control over labor unions in the US. Furthermore, other measures, such as the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act (LMRDA) of 1959, also known as the Landrum-Griffin Act, aimed to combat corruption and promote transparency within labor unions. The Landrum-Griffin Act established guidelines for the reporting of financial transactions within labor organizations and increased oversight over union activities. Taking into account the various efforts made by the government to address the Mafia's influence on labor unions from the 1950s up to the 1980s, it is evident that the government did indeed take action to clean up the unions. While it is true that the problem of Mafia control persisted through the mid-1980s, the government's efforts eventually led to significant progress in dismantling the Mafia's grip on labor unions. As a result, it does not follow that \\"The unions were never taken care of by the government.\\" Instead, it is more accurate to state that the government took steps to address the problem and achieved significant success over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Martin Luther King Jr. has declined the post her father once held as president of the Atlanta-based Southern Christian Leadership Conference, saying she was interested in being more than a \\"figurehead.\\" The Rev. Bernice A. King was elected to the office in October 2009, but never served as president as a string of legal battles divided the 53-year-old organization. Bernice King told CNN political contributor Roland Martin she made suggestions to the organization in October about how the presidency might operate. She said she felt \\"disrespected\\" because there was no formal communication until earlier this month. \\"What they sent back was merely a job description that primarily spoke to a board-driven organization,\\" King said. \\"I was elected to lead the organization. I was frankly not interested in merely being a figurehead of the organization.\\" \\"I envisioned SCLC emerging as the vanguard for next-generation nonviolent activism in the tradition of my father,\\" King said in a statement earlier Friday. \\"Amidst the turmoil, chaos and confusion surrounding SCLC over the last 15 months, my team and I dedicated an exhaustive amount of time, energy and resources to assess the organization and prepare for my transition.\\" The group's national board of directors said King was shifting \\"her attention to furthering her mother's legacy and embark upon other ministry initiatives. \\"We wish the best for Elder Bernice King, and pray for her great success as she moves forward,\\" it said in a statement. A judge in Fulton County (Georgia) Superior Court ruled in September 2010 the current national board should be in charge, instead of another faction, although that decision is under appeal. Dr. Howard Creecy, acting president of the SCLC, told CNN that the board supported King's right to make a \\"quality decision.\\" \\"We never asked for the storms we had to pass through,\\" he said, indicating the gap between King's election and her taking the presidency was a \\"lengthy period.\\" The SCLC \\"gave a voice\\" to people affected by the Gulf oil spill disaster and remains concerned about the plight of the poor, Creecy said, adding that the group is \\"restoring our credibility.\\" Bernice King said she now plans to shift her attention to furthering the legacy of her mother, Coretta Scott King, and pursuing ministry initiatives. \\"We wouldn't know Martin Luther King as we know him if it were not for all of her work.\\" Coretta Scott King died in January 2006, 38 years after her Nobel Peace Prize-winning husband was assassinated. The SCLC has seen a power struggle dating back about a decade, said Ralph Luker, a retired professor who specialized in the civil rights movement and has been an observer of the organization. Bernice King's brother, Martin Luther King III, was president of the SCLC from 1997 to 2004. They and sibling Dexter King had been locked in a bitter legal battle over their parents' estates and rightful succession. The group, which has chapters and affiliates throughout the country, was a leading organization during the civil rights movement in the 1960s. Bernice King told Martin she wants to work with the National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference on education, health care, immigration and other issues. \\"Regardless of what institution, the work of my father will continue,\\" she said. It's now up to the SCLC to determine the proper leadership model, the minister told CNN. \\"I will continue to pray for them to move forward in a positive direction,\\" Bernice King said. Dr. Bernard LaFayette Jr., vice chairman of the SCLC, said the organization will move forward. \\"She deserves the right to make her own assessment,\\" he said of Bernice King.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Fact 1: The looseness of soil has a positive impact on a plant 's roots' growth in that soil. Fact 2: Fertile soil is loose, absorbent and pleasant smelling. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"The growth of plant roots is positively impacted by what kind of soil?\\" with the following options: - fertile - claggy - heavy - alluvial - sun's heat - salinity - warm - dense A:","completion":"The growth of plant roots is positively impacted by fertile soil. Given Fact 1, we know the looseness of the soil has a positive impact on a plant's roots' growth in that soil. According to Fact 2, fertile soil is described as being loose, absorbent, and pleasant smelling. Therefore, fertile soil meets the requirements for facilitating better root growth. Let's analyze the other options to better understand why fertile soil is the correct answer: - Claggy soil: Claggy soil is sticky and clay-like, which impedes root growth due to its difficulty in permeability and oxygen exchange. Roots may struggle to penetrate and expand in this type of soil. - Heavy soil: This type of soil is typically dense and has a high clay content, making it difficult for plant roots to penetrate, find nutrients, and receive oxygen. Heavy soil restricts root growth, leading to stunted plants and poor yields. - Alluvial soil: Alluvial soil is usually found in river valleys and floodplains, and it's often rich in nutrients. However, alluvial soil may contain varying levels of sand, silt, and clay, making its structure inconsistent. While alluvial soil can be fertile, it is not the direct factor contributing to root growth. - Sun's heat: The sun's heat is related to the temperature of the soil. While soil temperature affects plant growth, it is not a characteristic of soil itself. Warmer temperatures may aid in root growth, but they do not define the type of soil in question. - Salinity: Salinity refers to the salt content of soil. High salinity can have negative effects on plant growth as it may cause osmotic stress and nutrient imbalances. Lower salt concentrations may be tolerated by specific plant species, but salinity itself does not positively impact root growth. - Warm: Warm describes the temperature, not the type of soil. While warmer temperatures can promote root growth, this term doesn't directly apply to soil composition. - Dense: Dense soil is compact and difficult for plant roots to penetrate. This type of soil can lead to poor root growth and overall plant health due to restrictions on water, oxygen, and nutrient availability. Given the explanation of the options presented, it is evident that the growth of plant roots is positively impacted by fertile soil, as it provides the necessary loose and absorbent structure that promotes healthy root development."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: kai was a good teacher so he taught how to tie a tie to students.

Review title: Don't waste your money Product review: I bought a Melitta burr coffee mill at a kitchen outlet for apparently the regular retail price of about 25. It lasted about a month. The grinding was just ok but it did tend to clog up. I think it put too much stress on the motor to do espresso grinds. Anyway, not an issue now since the motor didn't hold up at all. I am now going to go ahead and buy something that costs more but that I can depend on to last. Answer:","completion":"The given product review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reasons for this are as follows: 1. Negative Review Title: The title \\"Don't waste your money\\" is a strong deterrent, implying that the reviewer would not recommend purchasing the product because it does not meet their expectations and might not be worth the investment. 2. Short Lifespan: The reviewer mentions that the Melitta burr coffee mill only lasted about a month, which is a very short lifespan for a product in this category. This shows that the product may have low durability and potentially poor build quality. 3. Grinding Issues: The grinding capability seems to be mediocre at best, with the reviewer saying it was \\"just ok\\" and that the mill tended to clog up. For a coffee grinder, it is crucial that the grinding is efficient and consistent, and this issue suggests that the product does not perform effectively for its primary function. 4. Unsuitable for Espresso Grinds: The reviewer also notes that the mill struggled to grind beans fine enough for espresso, which might have caused undue stress on the motor. The inability to handle finer grinds is a considerable limitation for some coffee enthusiasts, making the product less attractive. 5. Motor Failure: The motor of the coffee mill failed after a short period of use, which indicates a significant quality issue. A reliable motor is essential for a product like this to function correctly and without any operational issues. 6. Preference for a Higher-Priced, Dependable Product: The reviewer's intention to purchase a more expensive but reliable alternative suggests that the Melitta burr coffee mill did not meet their expectations. A higher-priced product may offer better quality, performance, and durability, making it more appealing in comparison. Taking all these factors into account, it is clear that the review paints a rather negative picture of the Melitta burr coffee mill. Therefore, the chances of me buying the product would be significantly decreased after reading this review, and I would likely consider exploring other options in search of a higher-quality and more reliable coffee grinder."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The disease is defined by the presence of abundant neurofibrillary lesions and neuritic plaques in the cerebral cortex. Neurofibrillary lesions comprise paired helical and straight tau filaments, whereas tau filaments with different morphologies characterize other neurodegenerative diseases. No high-resolution structures of tau filaments are available. Here we present cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) maps at 3.4-3.5 Å resolution and corresponding atomic models of paired helical and straight filaments from the brain of an individual with Alzheimer's disease. Filament cores are made of two identical protofilaments comprising residues 306-378 of tau protein, which adopt a combined cross-β/β-helix structure and define the seed for tau aggregation. Paired helical and straight filaments differ in their inter-protofilament packing, showing that they are ultrastructural polymorphs. These findings demonstrate that cryo-EM allows atomic characterization of amyloid filaments from patient-derived material, and pave the way for investigation of a range of neurodegenerative diseases.","completion":"Title: Cryo-EM Reveals Alzheimer's Tau Filament Structures: Identifying the Seed for Aggregation and Polymorphs"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Wrap a cotton strip around your hairline, tucking it under the rods.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Mastering the Art of Hair Curling: A Step-By-Step Guide to Achieving Perfect Curls Introduction: From beachy waves to soft, defined curls, the world of hair styling is constantly evolving, and one technique that remains relevant is the art of hair curling. Curling rods are among the most popular tools for at-home hair enthusiasts, as well as professional stylists. These versatile tools offer an array of possibilities, transforming your locks from lifeless to fabulous in minutes. In this detailed article, we'll explore the step-by-step process of curling your hair to achieve salon-like results, right in the comforts of your home. Step 1: Preparing Your Hair and Tools Before diving into the hair-curling process, gather the necessary tools and ensure your hair is in the right condition. Start with clean, dry hair. Make sure you have combed your hair and removed any tangles. To protect your hair from heat damage, you may also want to apply a heat protectant spray. For this demonstration, you'll need: - Curling rods (in the size of your choice) - End papers - Rat-tail comb - Hair clips (for sectioning) - A cotton strip Step 2: Sectioning Your Hair Begin by creating three sections of your hair – a middle section and two side sections. Use the rat-tail comb to part your hair down the middle and clip the side sections away for now. This will make it easier to work through each section one at a time, ensuring even curls throughout your hair. Step 3: Starting with the Middle Section Take a thin strand of hair from the middle section (roughly 1-inch wide) and comb through it to ensure it's smooth. Holding the strand taught, fold an end paper around the tip of the hair strand. This helps to properly secure the hair onto the rod and ensures an even curl from the roots to the ends. Step 4: Wrapping the Hair Strand Around the Curling Rod Place the wrapped tip of the hair strand onto the curling rod and begin wrapping the strand around the rod, moving away from your face. Remember to keep tension on the hair strand as you wrap it, and maintain an even distance between each wrap to control the curl size. Once the hair strand is completely wrapped, secure the rod in place by snapping the rod's closure or using a hairpin. Step 5: Repeating the Process for the Entire Middle Section Following the same technique, continue to take thin strands of hair from the middle section, fold end papers onto the tips, and wrap each strand around curling rods one at a time. Clip the rods as you finish each strand. Continue the process until the entire middle section is wrapped in rods. Step 6: The Side Sections Move on to the side sections of your hair and apply the same process. However, instead of just one row of rods, create two columns of rods for each side section. This will ensure even distribution of curls and provide better support for the curling process. Begin from the front of your head and work towards the back for both columns as you proceed. Step 7: Wrapping a Cotton Strip Around the Hairline To protect your hairline and keep the rods securely in place during the curling process, wrap a cotton strip around the hairline. Make sure to tuck the strip under the secured rods, ensuring a snug fit. This will also help to absorb any moisture from your hair, allowing for a more efficient curling process. Step 8: Letting the Curls Set For optimal results, let the curling rods remain in your hair for at least 45 minutes, or until your hair is completely dry (if you applied a heat protectant spray). You can also opt for a hooded dryer or a soft bonnet dryer if you prefer a faster, more controlled setting process. Step 9: Unraveling Your Curls Once your hair is completely set and dry, gently remove the cotton strip. Starting from the bottom and working your way up, carefully unclip and unwind the curling rods from each hair strand. Be sure to handle your curls with care to maintain their shape while removing the rods. Step 10: Finishing Touches At this point, you will have a head full of beautifully defined curls. To style your curls, gently run your fingers through your hair, or use a wide-tooth comb to break up the curls and create a more natural, voluminous look. Finish off your look with a light hairspray or serum to hold your curls in place and add shine. Conclusion: Curling your hair with curling rods may seem like a daunting task, but with practice, this step-by-step guide will help you achieve perfect curls in no time. Don't get discouraged if you don't achieve flawless curls on the first try; the more you practice, the better your results will be. Experiment with different rod sizes and styling techniques to find the perfect curling method that works best for your hair type and desired look.

Now, the boss of Apple is named Tim Cook, and when he heard about this decision, he was not very happy. He felt like it was like being asked to share his toys, even though he didn't think he had to. Tim Cook said that what the European Commission decided was \\"maddening\\" and \\"political.\\" \\"Maddening\\" is when something makes you really, really frustrated, like when your brother or sister borrows your toys without asking first.

Tim Cook doesn't think it's fair that Apple has to give away lots of money like that. He believes that the decision was not made for the right reasons. It's like when someone tells you to do something, just because they can, even if it doesn't seem fair. But, just like when your parents tell you to share your room or your toys, sometimes big people and even big companies like Apple have to do things they don't like. Even if Tim Cook doesn't agree with the decision, they might still have to give the money to the Republic of Ireland in the end. That's the story about how Apple's boss Tim Cook felt when he was told his company needs to pay lots of money back to a faraway place.

Article: Ibn Sina subsequently settled at Rey, in the vicinity of modern Tehran, the home town of Rhazes; where Majd Addaula, a son of the last Buwayhid emir, was nominal ruler under the regency of his mother (Seyyedeh Khatun). About thirty of Ibn Sina's shorter works are said to have been composed in Rey. Constant feuds which raged between the regent and her second son, Shams al-Daula, however, compelled the scholar to quit the place. After a brief sojourn at Qazvin he passed southwards to Hamadãn where Shams al-Daula, another Buwayhid emir, had established himself. At first, Ibn Sina entered into the service of a high-born lady; but the emir, hearing of his arrival, called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his dwelling. Ibn Sina was even raised to the office of vizier. The emir decreed that he should be banished from the country. Ibn Sina, however, remained hidden for forty days in sheikh Ahmed Fadhel's house, until a fresh attack of illness induced the emir to restore him to his post. Even during this perturbed time, Ibn Sina persevered with his studies and teaching. Every evening, extracts from his great works, the Canon and the Sanatio, were dictated and explained to his pupils.

Write an article with the title: \\"Editorial: President Obama kept promise to soldiers with release of prisoner\\"","completion":"Title: Editorial: President Obama kept promise to soldiers with release of prisoner Introduction: In 2014, President Barack Obama authorized a prisoner exchange that led to the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier held captive by the Taliban in Afghanistan for nearly five years. The move was controversial, with critics denouncing it as a negotiation with terrorists, while others praised it as a fulfillment of the U.S. government's commitment to never leave a soldier behind. In this editorial, we will look into the circumstances surrounding Bergdahl's release and examine how President Obama kept his promise to the U.S. soldiers. Step 1: Background Information on Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl Bowe Bergdahl was a U.S. Army soldier who was deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. In June of that year, he was captured by the Taliban after walking away from his platoon's remote outpost. Following his capture, Bergdahl was held hostage in various locations in Pakistan and Afghanistan, enduring torture and poor conditions. His captivity became a long-standing concern for the U.S. government as it sought to secure his release. Step 2: The Negotiations For years, the U.S. government negotiated with the Taliban to gain Bergdahl's release. The talks were complex, as the U.S. had a policy of not directly negotiating with terrorists. However, the negotiations were mediated by the government of Qatar, which served as an intermediary between the two parties. During President Obama's tenure, he was closely involved in the process of seeking Bergdahl's release. He understood the importance of bringing home every American soldier, as part of a long-standing commitment to \\"leave no one behind.\\" Step 3: The Prisoner Exchange Agreement Eventually, an agreement was reached to exchange five Taliban prisoners held at Guantanamo Bay for Sgt. Bergdahl's release. Although the exchange of prisoners was controversial, President Obama regarded it as a necessary step to fulfill his commitment to U.S. soldiers. The five released Taliban prisoners were sent to Qatar, where they would be monitored and under restricted movement as part of the deal. Step 4: The Release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl On May 31, 2014, Sgt. Bergdahl was released in a remote area of eastern Afghanistan, where U.S. special operations forces recovered him. Following his release, Sgt. Bergdahl was treated by medical personnel and underwent a lengthy process of recovery and reintegration. Conclusion: By authorizing the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, President Obama demonstrated that he upheld the U.S. government's commitment to never leave a soldier behind. Despite the controversy surrounding the prisoner exchange, the decision to bring Bergdahl home served as a reassurance to American soldiers and their families that their country would always prioritize their safe return. This gesture, which showed a willingness to put the concerns of the troops first, is an essential aspect of military ethos and President Obama's legacy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the voices become increasingly violent, and strange, unexplainable occurrences begin to plague her and her family, they decide to seek the help of a priest to perform an exorcism. Skeptical of traditional religion, Emily adamantly rejects the idea, and the family is left struggling to protect themselves from the malevolent force surrounding them. Detailed Plot: Act 1: Emily, an independent and spirited 24-year-old artist, has recently been diagnosed with schizophrenia. Her family is devastated, urging her to take her prescribed medication to ensure her safety and well-being. Emily, however, refuses to comply, believing that the voices she hears are not figments of her imagination but rather spirits communicating with her. Act 2: Emily's symptoms grow increasingly severe, and her bizarre behavior begins to strain her relationships with her family and friends. The voices she hears become more aggressive, demanding violent actions. Emily's mother, Sarah, and her younger sister, Lily, begin to experience unsettling and inexplicable events around their home - mysterious shadows, objects moving on their own, and nightmarish visions. Growing desperate, Emily's family consults with a local priest, Father Andrews, who believes that she might indeed be experiencing something supernatural. He suggests they perform an exorcism to free her from any malevolent spirits that may have attached themselves to her. Emily, raised by her atheist mother after the death of her religious father, adamantly refuses to submit to an exorcism, claiming that it will do more harm than good. Act 3: As the supernatural activity escalates, Emily starts losing control and becomes a danger to herself and others. Father Andrews, while respecting Emily's wishes, suggests that the family gather to perform a cleansing ritual instead, in hopes of driving away the malicious force. Despite their skepticism, Emily's family reluctantly agrees in a desperate attempt to protect her and find peace. During the cleansing ritual, the violent spirit unleashes its full fury, possessing Emily and wreaking havoc within the household. Emily's family and Father Andrews are in a race against time to save her before the spirit consumes her entirely. Act 4: As the ritual nears its completion, the spirit manipulates Emily's deepest fears and guilt surrounding the death of her father, leaving her vulnerable and hopeless. Just when all seems lost, a connection to her long-deceased father empowers Emily and gives her the strength to continue fighting against the demonic force. With the help of her family and Father Andrews, Emily finally expels the malevolent spirit, setting her free from its grasp. Exhausted and battered, Emily and her family, now united in faith, rebuild their lives together, forever changed by their harrowing experience. As Emily begins taking her prescribed medication under her family's watchful care, the line between supernatural intervention and mental illness remains blurred, leaving an unsettling question in their minds - is Emily truly liberated from the darkness, or will it return?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The reason questions are a successful sales tactic is that they allow the customer to do most of the talking. This gives you a better idea of what their needs are and how you can sell your product to them. But this only works if you actually give your customer time to talk. In other words, don't drown them in product description and technical information. Instead, save this information for later, when you've identified the problem and already sold them on the fact that you can provide a solution. After all, if they just wanted information, odds are they could get it on your website. You need to figure out exactly what you could bring to your prospect and how what you bring can further their overall goals. You already have the first part from your discussions of the customer's problem. However, for the second part you will need an idea of what the customer wants to achieve overall. Try coming at this directly with something like, \\"What are you looking to accomplish in the next few years?\\" or \\"What is the primary long-term goal of your business?\\". From here, you can tailor the language and content of your product or service offering to how you can help them along the path to achieving their goals. You can also draw out customer desires by asking them to imagine the future of their business or life. You can either ask about how their life or business will be in the future or how they hope your business relationship will develop. For example, try asking, \\"Where do you see yourself/your company in five years? Ten years?\\" or, \\"How do you see your business developing if we go through with this deal?\\". You can gather even more information by asking other hypothetical questions like, \\"If you had no monetary constraints, what changes would you make?\\". Listen to these responses and think about the solutions you could provide. At regular intervals, especially if you are explaining something complex, stop to ask your customer if they have any questions. This not only keeps them engaged, but can keep you from having to go back and explain something you've already moved past. In any case, try to maintain an air of helpfulness and take the time to explain anything the customer doesn't understand, as well as to understand their concerns as deeply as possible. And when your customer is thinking about their answers or questions, wait patiently and quietly.

Add spaces: ClimateChange,energy,Kerry-Liebermanbill,Senate","completion":"Climate Change, energy, Kerry-Lieberman bill, Senate Climate Change is a significant and lasting alteration in the Earth's overall climate patterns due to human activities, such as the emission of greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. These changes have been causing the Earth's average surface temperature to increase, leading to severe weather events, rising sea levels, and the decline of biodiversity. Energy refers to the ability of a system to perform work or produce heat. It can be found in many forms, such as kinetic, potential, chemical, and thermal energy. Energy production, consumption, and conservation are critical topics, as the world grapples with the consequences of Climate Change and the realization that finite resources, such as fossil fuels, are being depleted. Sustainable and renewable energy sources, like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, are becoming increasingly important in providing clean and reliable energy without exacerbating Climate Change. The Kerry-Lieberman bill, formally known as the \\"American Power Act,\\" was proposed legislation in the United States Senate in 2010 by Senators John Kerry and Joe Lieberman. The bill aimed to address Climate Change and promote energy security through a comprehensive set of measures, including the establishment of a cap-and-trade system and the promotion of clean energy technologies. The cap-and-trade system would have put a declining cap on greenhouse gas emissions, set long-term and interim emissions reduction targets, and provided businesses with an economic incentive to reduce their emissions. However, the bill never received a vote in the Senate due to insufficient bipartisan support, and the prospect of comprehensive climate legislation in the United States remains uncertain. The Senate is one of the two chambers of the United States Congress, the other being the House of Representatives. It consists of 100 Senators, two from each of the 50 states, who serve six-year terms. The Senate plays a crucial role in the legislative process by considering and voting on bills, as well as providing advice and consent on presidential nominations, including Supreme Court Justices and Cabinet members. The Senate also has the power to ratify treaties and try impeachment cases brought forth by the House of Representatives. Given its significant responsibilities and broad influence, the Senate's position on Climate Change and energy issues can have substantial implications for both domestic and global efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of a changing climate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: You can perform certain operations on a matrix to transform it while keeping it equivalent to the original. These are called elementary operations. To solve a 2x3 matrix, for example, you use elementary row operations to transform the matrix into a triangular one. Elementary operations include: swapping two rows. multiplying a row by a number different from zero. multiplying one row and then adding to another row. You want to produce zero in your second row, so multiply in a way that lets you do that. For example, say you have a matrix that looks like this:You can keep the first row and use it to produce zero in the second row. To do that, first multiply the second row by two, as follows: In order to get to zero for the first row, you may need to multiply again, using the same principle. In the example above, multiply the second row by -1, as follows:When you complete the multiplication, your new matrix looks like this: Next, add the first and second rows to produce zero in the first column of the second row. In the example above, add the two rows together as follows: At this point, you have a triangular matrix. You can use that matrix to get a new linear system. The first column corresponds to the unknown x, and the second column corresponds to the unknown y. The third column corresponds to the free member of an equation. For the example above, your new system would therefore look like this: Using your new system, determine which variable can be determined easily, and solve for it. In the example above, you’ll want to “backsolve” – moving from the last equation to the first when solving for your unknowns. The second equation gives you an easy solution for y; since the x has been removed, you can see that y = 2. Once you’ve determined one of the variables, you can substitute its value into the other equation to solve for the other variable. In the example above, replace the y with a 2 in the first equation to solve for x as follows: Summary:","completion":"Elementary operations are used to transform matrices while keeping them equivalent to the original.

Write a title for this article: Senator Mark Kirk’s campaign has launched an unusual public attack on a Chicago Tribune reporter, accusing him of “bullying” former and current staff members with questions about allegations that the Illinois Republican has been physically and verbally abusive toward employees. Kevin Artl, Kirk’s re-election campaign manager, released a memo this week in which he said Tribune reporter Todd Lighty had contacted more than 15 people connected with Kirk, including current and former staffers and the senator’s sister and mother. According to Artl, Lighty has identified four former staffers who the reporter says were subjected to abusive treatment. Artl says those staffers have denied any abuse took place. More broadly, the campaign denies that Kirk has been abusive toward any staff members. The criticism is especially unusual because it preceded the publication of any story. The Tribune declined to say Saturday whether it even planned to go forward with a story, saying it does not comment on unpublished reporting. But it did issue a statement defending the conduct of Lighty, saying: “Good reporters ask tough questions.” “The Kirk campaign has wholly mischaracterized Lighty’s diligence and thoroughness,” Tribune editor Gerould Kern said in the statement. “Lighty has been direct, open and honest at all times with the Kirk staff in his reporting. He is a meticulous and professional journalist.” In a letter addressed to Kern and Tribune managing editor Peter Kendall, Artl threatened legal action if the reporter continued to “harass Senator Kirk’s family and associates – or should he print any falsehoods without a reasonable basis to believe them accurate”. Artl said Lighty has persisted despite denials from the four former staffers, including one who signed a sworn affidavit saying he enjoyed working for Kirk and that the senator had never subjected him to verbal or physical abuse. “We respect the role of your newspaper in aggressively reporting stories that you deem newsworthy,” Artl wrote in the letter, which the campaign released to reporters. “But in pursuing those stories, one of your reporters, Todd Lighty, has crossed the line from acceptable aggressive reporting to harassment of people who aren’t telling him what he wants to hear.” The letter goes into substantial detail, even tallying the number of calls, text messages, emails and visits that each person received from the reporter. The first-term Illinois Republican went through a grueling recovery after a 2012 stroke. He has drawn attention in recent months with a number of public gaffes, including one in which Kirk was caught on an open microphone calling presidential hopeful and South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham a “bro with no ho” because he is unmarried. The Kirk campaign’s attack on the reporter was first reported in the Illinois Capitol Fax blog on Friday. The campaign also released what it said were email exchanges with Lighty in which the reporter describes several alleged instances of abusive behavior by the senator. In one of those instances, Kirk is said to have berated an aide after he was late picking the senator up at O’Hare International Airport, according to the Kirk campaign’s account of the email exchange. The aide, Seth Jansen, who no longer works for Kirk, issued a statement through the campaign staff saying: “The inference or accusation that Senator Kirk acted inappropriately towards me is simply false.”","completion":"\\"Senator Kirk's Campaign Accuses Chicago Tribune Reporter of Harassment Amid Allegations of Staff Abuse\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks? Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as 850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \\"heads\\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \\"upside down lettering error\\" coins. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.\\", answer the following question.

Expand this summary.","completion":"On Saturday, 18-year-old Devin Washington attended a job interview at a Popeyes restaurant in New Orleans. The interview was progressing well when, around 1pm, a man attempted to steal cash from a register while the clerk was giving him change. The manager swiftly blocked the exit, but the thief attempted to push her aside in his bid to escape. Witnessing this unfold, Washington leaped into action: he \\"bent his arm back\\" and, with assistance from a cook, managed to pin the thief to the floor, effectively stopping the robbery. The suspect, later identified as 50-year-old Pablo Ciscart, was arrested by police and charged with robbery and fugitive attachment. Upon further investigation, Ciscart admitted to the crime, likely due to the irrefutable evidence and the presence of multiple witnesses. As a result of their bravery and quick thinking during this harrowing incident, both Washington and the cook received accolades from their colleagues and local community. The manager was particularly impressed by Washington's clear sense of loyalty, duty, and protectiveness for others; qualities that the manager saw as essential for an employee in a fast-paced and challenging environment like a restaurant. Evidently, Washington's selfless and courageous actions spoke much louder than any resume or interviews could. As a result, he was offered a job at the Popeyes restaurant on the spot—an offer he enthusiastically accepted. This remarkable story serves as a shining example that, even during the most unexpected and demanding situations, one's true character can prove invaluable in not only securing employment but also helping to create a safer community. In summary, Devin Washington may have entered a Popeyes in New Orleans simply seeking a job interview, but he left as a local hero who saved the day and landed his dream job in the process. His remarkable actions, swift reflexes, and ability to handle a high-pressure situation highlight not only his suitability for the role but also the power of stepping up in times of crisis, making his story one that will be remembered and shared for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What systems are pollutants bad for?\\" in the context of air pollution and its harmful effects on various systems would be: \\"respiratory and circulatory.\\" Air pollution is caused by various pollutants such as particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and carbon monoxide. These pollutants adversely impact different systems, primarily the respiratory and circulatory systems. The respiratory system is responsible for allowing us to breathe and exchange oxygen and carbon dioxide. Pollutants present in the air can damage the respiratory system by causing inflammation and irritation, leading to asthma, bronchitis, or other breathing difficulties. Prolonged exposure to pollutants can decrease lung function, making people more vulnerable to respiratory infections and diseases. The circulatory system, which consists of the heart, blood vessels, and blood, is responsible for circulating oxygen, nutrients, and other essential substances throughout the body. When pollutants are inhaled, they can also enter the bloodstream and impair the circulatory system. Air pollution is linked to an increased risk of heart diseases, such as atherosclerosis, where plaque builds up in arteries and restricts blood flow. This can ultimately lead to heart attacks and strokes. Moreover, air pollution affects other aspects of life as well. It can contribute to the destruction of animal habitats and mar the environment by causing eutrophication, acid rain, and the depletion of the ozone layer, for example. That being said, the respiratory and circulatory systems are directly and most significantly affected by air pollutants, which is why they are considered the best answer in this context."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

It is situated on the banks of the sacred river Godavari, which is the second longest river in India after the Ganges, spanning a length of approximately 1,465 kilometers. The Godavari River originates from the Trimbakeshwar, a significant pilgrimage site approximately 30 kilometers away from Nashik. Trimbakeshwar is renowned for its ancient Shiva temple called Trimbakeshwar Jyotirlinga, which is one of the twelve Jyotirlinga shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva. The location of the city on the banks of the Godavari River has played a substantial role in its development. The river serves as a vital source of water for irrigating the agricultural lands, catering to the domestic needs of the population, and supporting the industrial activities of Nashik. Being home to the Kumbh Mela, a sacred Hindu pilgrimage and the world's largest religious gathering, Nashik witnesses millions of devotees who come to seek blessings and take a holy dip in the Godavari River. This festival holds immense importance among Hindus, as it is believed that bathing in the holy waters during Kumbh Mela leads to salvation and liberation from the eternal cycle of life and death. In terms of history and mythology, the Godavari River holds great significance, especially in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata. According to the Ramayana, Lord Rama, along with his wife Sita and brother Lakshmana, stayed near the Godavari River during their exile. Over time, Nashik has also evolved into an industrial and educational hub, with the Godavari River providing an essential water resource for these purposes.

The food… ||||| By Chelsea Griswold A man’s dying wish for an act of unexpected kindness has blossomed into a year’s worth of donations and giving on his behalf. A year ago, Seth Collins and his parents began a mission to fulfill the dying wish of Aaron Collins – Seth’s younger brother – to leave a stranger a 500 tip. After the video for the first tip went viral, money from donors started pouring in for Seth Collins to do it again. And the one-time act of kindness developed into something much more. One unsuspecting server at Thre3e Wise Men Brewing Company in Indianapolis received a 500 tip Monday afternoon, the 54th tip given in Aaron’s memory. “It couldn’t have come at a better time in my life,” server Beth Foster told ABC News’ Indianapolis, affiliate WRTV. “I’m a teacher just looking for a job and it’s kind of hard right now.” Seth Collins has collected 60,000, and plans to travel to all 50 states and give out a 500 tip each week until the money is gone. Indiana was the 17th state Seth has traveled to as part of his mission. Seth chronicles each tip on a blog dedicated to Aaron’s memory. “It never gets old. I knew about the third one that it was never going to get old,” Seth Collins said. ||||| Random Acts Of Tipping Since his brother's death a year ago, Seth Collins has been touring the country giving 500 tips to restaurant servers, the last request in his brother's will. He aims to hit all 50 states by the end of the year. Collins speaks to Weekend Edition Sunday host Rachel Martin. RACHEL MARTIN, HOST: Making a living serving food in a restaurant can be a tough business. With most of your income coming from tips, customer service is of paramount importance. If you treat the customers particularly well, you might get a generous tip. But at most restaurants that is not likely to get anywhere near the 500 mark. But for one frequent diner, a 500 tip is now the norm. Seth Collins is travelling around the country giving 500 to restaurant servers in every state - and he's carrying out these seemingly random acts of generosity as a tribute to his brother who died a year ago today. Seth Collins joins us from his home in Kentucky. Seth, thanks for being here. SETH COLLINS: Thank you for having me. MARTIN: So, why is this the way that you've chosen to honor your brother? COLLINS: Well, when we found his will, the last thing in it was that we go out to dinner and leave an awesome tip. And he said I'm not talking about 25 percent. I mean, 500 for pizza. So, we did that. And raised the money from friends and family just to make it happen. And then I thought I would just share the video with friends and family. The first video went viral and people ended up donating up to now over 60,000. It only seemed fair once I started thinking about that to try to give back to as many places as I could. MARTIN: I wonder was your brother in the food service industry? I mean, what was his connection to this idea? COLLINS: He had always been a generous tipper. It's actually funny. My mom had just told me a story that even when he was young, when he just had an allowance and no job, is he saw that they didn't leave what he considered a generous tip. He would take a couple dollars of his own money and toss that on the table to help bolster the amount of the tip. MARTIN: And what is the reaction from the waiter or the waitress in the moment? COLLINS: Different people, I think, react to it in their own way. Some people, when they shocked, sort of shut down. It's just they're trying to bottle in that emotion so that they don't start crying or something. And they let that out later. MARTIN: And what do you do when it's all over? COLLINS: I'm really not sure what I'll do. I'm sure I'll keep giving whatever money we have. A lot of people have asked will I take it international? And I really want all the money to be given to the waiters and waitresses rather than spending it on traveling to Ireland so that I can leave a 500 euro tip there. MARTIN: Seth Collins. He is traveling around the country giving out 500 tips in honor of his brother, Aaron. He joined us from his home in Kentucky, with his cat in the background. Thanks so much, Seth.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What month and year were the surviving crew members of the brigantine formerly used as a whaler rescued?, using the article: The last voyage of the Karluk, flagship of the Canadian Arctic Expedition of 1913–16, ended with the loss of the ship in the Arctic seas, and the subsequent deaths of nearly half her complement of 25. In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent. Before their eventual rescue in September 1914, three more of the party had died, two of illness and one in violent circumstances; 14 were rescued. Historians have divided views on Stefansson's decision to leave the ship. Some of the..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The surviving crew members of the brigantine, formerly used as a whaler and known as the Karluk, were rescued in September 1914. The ship became trapped in ice in August 1913 while en route to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. The ship was carried off course and westwards by the ice, stranding the crew members. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, the ship was crushed and sunk in January 1914. The crew and expedition staff then struggled to survive on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. The brutal and testing survival period was marked by hunger, illness and internal dissent among the stranded party who managed to maintain their sustenance by hunting game on Wrangel Island. However, their existence was perilous and troubled by internal divisions, and in total eleven men lost their lives either on the ice or on the island which became their temporary refuge. The captain of the ship, Robert Bartlett, along with an Inuk companion, undertook a difficult expedition across the frozen sea in order to reach the Siberian coast and search for assistance. After a challenging journey, during which they received assistance from local populations, they were able to eventually reach Alaska. However, the sea ice conditions impeded an immediate rescue mission. It was not until September 1914 that the rest of the stranded party, comprising 14 individuals, was eventually rescued from their ordeal on Wrangel Island. These events represent the culmination of a tragic Arctic expedition that unfolded over more than a year and claimed the lives of almost half of the original crew and expedition staff."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects. Which lake had a lower net productivity? Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]","completion":"Based on the information provided, Long Lake had a lower net productivity due to the occurrence of water stratification, which led to unpleasant chain effects and a decrease in the fish population.

Q:Given the background: If all the other factors influencing humidity remain constant, at ground level the relative humidity rises as the temperature falls. This is because less vapor is needed to saturate the air, so vapor condenses as the temperature falls. In normal conditions, the dew point temperature will not be greater than the air temperature because relative humidity cannot exceed 100%.[4] and the situation: Sam lived in Chicago for many years and experienced those high humidity days during the summer, the Indian summers in October and harsh and humid winters, so he decided to move to San Diego, in a warmer and much dryer climate. Answer the following question: Which city has more humidity during winter? A:","completion":"Based on the given background information and situation, Chicago has more humidity during winter compared to San Diego. The reason for this is that Chicago experiences harsh and humid winters, while San Diego has a warmer and much drier climate. One major factor that contributes to the higher humidity levels in Chicago during winters is its geographical location – the city is located in the Midwest region of the United States, close to the Great Lakes, which can influence the humidity levels in the area. In contrast, San Diego is situated on the Southern California coast and enjoys a Mediterranean climate characterized by mild winters and warm, dry summers. This climatic difference is due to the city's proximity to the Pacific Ocean and the prevailing westerly winds that help maintain the dry and stable conditions for most of the year. Therefore, comparing both cities, it can be concluded that Chicago experiences higher humidity during the winter months in comparison to San Diego. This difference in humidity levels is one of the reasons that prompted Sam to move from Chicago to San Diego, so he could enjoy a warmer, drier climate throughout the year."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Thunderstorms form over the ocean - An area of low pressure causes rotation - Several thunderstorms come together around this area - The storm is fed by rising air from warm ocean water evaporating The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the process is the formation and strengthening of a tropical cyclone (also known as a hurricane or typhoon, depending on the region). Throughout the process, various meteorological and oceanic conditions contribute to the development of the storm. Here is a more detailed description of the final step: 1. Continuation of Storm System Development: As a result of the low pressure system, air continues to flow toward the center of the storm. The Coriolis Effect, which is the tendency for the path of moving particles to be deflected due to Earth's rotation, imparts a rotational movement to the storm system, causing the winds to spiral around the low pressure center. 2. Strengthening of the Storm: The warm ocean water provides the storm system with its primary source of energy through the evaporation of seawater. As the air above the warm ocean water rises, it carries with it moisture and heat. Upon reaching a certain height, the warm, moist air cools and condenses into clouds and precipitation, releasing latent heat in the process. This heat release further fuels the storm by warming the surrounding air and causing it to rise even more rapidly. This creates a positive feedback loop, known as Conditional Instability of the Second Kind (CISK), leading to the growth and intensification of the storm system. 3. Development of an Organized System: As the storm gains strength and continues to rotate, bands of thunderstorms begin to develop and wrap around the eye, which is the calm, clear center of the storm that settles as a result of descending air. The convergence of these bands of thunderstorms and their associated winds creates a well-defined and organized circulation within the storm system. This stage marks the transition from a tropical disturbance to a tropical depression. 4. Classification as a Tropical Cyclone: As the storm intensifies and its wind speeds increase, it goes through several classification stages: tropical depression, tropical storm, and finally, a tropical cyclone. The classification as a tropical cyclone occurs when the storm displays sustained wind speeds of 74 mph (119 km/h) or higher. At this stage, the storm system poses a significant threat to coastal areas due to its destructive winds, torrential rainfall, and storm surges that can lead to widespread flooding and damage. The final step in the process, therefore, is the formation and strengthening of a tropical cyclone fueled by the rising air from warm ocean water evaporation, leading to a dangerous and powerful storm capable of causing extensive destruction in its path."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At The Disco's 2006 hit, \\"Lying Is the Most Fun a Girl Can Have Without Taking Her Clothes Off.\\" However, the longest song titles can vary depending on the definition of \\"contemporary\\" and the eligibility criteria for considering a song within the pop genre. It is important to note that there might be other songs with longer titles, but this particular song is a well-known example in the realm of pop music. 2. Worst pop music song to ever reach the top 40 in America and why: Determining the \\"worst\\" pop music song is subjective and open to personal opinions and interpretations. However, some songs have been widely criticized and often mentioned in discussions about the worst songs. One example is \\"Friday\\" by Rebecca Black, which reached the Billboard Hot 100 in 2011. \\"Friday\\" received a significant amount of criticism for various reasons. Firstly, many people found the lyrics to be overly simplistic, repetitive, and lacking in depth. Secondly, the song's production was criticized for its reliance on auto-tune, giving the vocals an artificial and unnatural sound. Finally, the overall song was considered irritating by many listeners, featuring an excessively catchy chorus that some people found annoying. While both of these questions pertain to the realm of pop music, they are seeking information about entirely different aspects, namely the longest song title and the worst song to reach the top 40 in America."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Three experts have described how a teenage girl was struck by lightning while using her phone in a large London park.The girl,aged 15,recovered,but a year later was still wheelchair-bound and found to be suffering complex physical and emotional problems. The girl also had a perforate eardrum on the side where she had been holding the mobile phone.She was having general recovery in Northwick Park Hospital,Middlesex. Swinda Esprit,a senior house officer, said that while the brain and muscle damage was similar to that of many lightning victims--who can experience heart attacks on being struck--the ear problems were not. She said that the damages were particularly relevant for people who might be involved in less serious lightning incidents,who might otherwise recover, but would never get their full hearing back if struck while on the phone. \\"We were shocked by the damage,which is why we wanted to draw attention to it,\\"Dr Esprit said.\\"A year on and she still was suffering these difficult hearing.\\" They added that three other cases had been reported in newspapers in China,South Korea,and Malaysia.In the Malaysian case,a sales executive was killed by lightning while talking on his phone during a thunderstorm near Kuala Lumpur. \\"All these events resulted in death,\\"the doctors wrote.\\"This rare phenomenon is a public health issue,and education is necessary to stress the risk.\\" The Australian Lightning Protection Standard recommends that metallic objects,including cordless or mobile phones,should not be carried outdoors during thunderstorms.However, \\"the United States National Weather Service says on its website that both are safe to use \\"because there is no direct path between you and the lightening\\".

If the statement said, \\"A musician is reading music while playing his clarinet, and another musician is playing a trumpet.\\" In this instance, we could then conclude that a person is playing a trumpet. 2. If the statement provided a context in which multiple musicians were playing various instruments, and a trumpet was listed among them, such as, \\"A group of musicians is performing in a jazz band, with musicians playing the clarinet, saxophone, trumpet, drums and piano.\\" In this case, we can conclude that a person is playing a trumpet. 3. If there was a situation whereby the musician playing the clarinet switched instruments to play the trumpet, for instance, \\"A musician is reading music while playing his clarinet, and later, he takes a break and begins playing the trumpet.\\" Here, we could use the information provided to conclude that a person is playing a trumpet.

At WWDC 2005, Steve Jobs announced this transition, revealing that Mac OS X was always developed to run on both the Intel and PowerPC architectures. All new Macs now use x86 processors made by Intel, and some were renamed as a result. Intel-based Macs running OS X 10.6 and below (support has been discontinued since 10.7) can run pre-existing software developed for PowerPC using an emulator called Rosetta, although at noticeably slower speeds than native programs. However, the Classic environment is unavailable on the Intel architecture. Intel chips introduced the potential to run the Microsoft Windows operating system natively on Apple hardware, without emulation software such as Virtual PC. In March 2006, a group of hackers announced that they were able to run Windows XP on an Intel-based Mac. The group released their software as open source and has posted it for download on their website. On April 5, 2006, Apple announced the availability of the public beta of Boot Camp, software that allows owners of Intel-based Macs to install Windows XP on their machines; later versions added support for Windows Vista and Windows 7. Classic was discontinued in Mac OS X 10.5, and Boot Camp became a standard feature on Intel-based Macs.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Thanksgiving will be here before we know it! If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. Question: What did they write? Options: A. not enough information B.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Carbon monoxide poisoning causes death and injuries around the world. This gas is a problem in all parts of the world that experience cold weather. A few years ago, America's Centers for Disease Control (C. D. C.) studied deaths linked with carbon monoxide poisoning. It found that the number of carbon monoxide deaths in the United States was greatest in January. The C.D.C. also found that carbon monoxide kills more than four hundred Americans each year. And, it said more than twenty thousand people are taken to hospital for treatment of health problems linked with the gas. Carbon monoxide is called the silent killer because people do not know it is in the air. The gas has no color, no taste and no smell. It does not cause burning eyes. And it does not cause people to cough. Yet, carbon monoxide gas is very deadly . It steals the body's ability to use oxygen. Carbon monoxide makes it difficult for the blood to carry oxygen to body tissues . It does this by linking with the blood. When the gas links with the blood, the blood is no longer able to carry oxygen to the tissues that need it. Damage to the body can begin very quickly from large amounts of carbon monoxide. How quickly this can happen depend on how long a person is breathing the gas and how much gas he or she breathes in. Carbon monoxide poisoning has warning signs . But people have to be awake to realize them. Small amounts of the gas will cause a person's head to hurt. He or she may begin to feel tired. Their stomachs may feel sick. The room may appear to be turning around. The person may have trouble thinking clearly. People develop serious headache as the amount of the gas continues to enter their blood. They will begin to feel very tired and sleepy. They may have terrible stomachache. Doctors say carbon monoxide influences people differently. For example a small child will experience health problems or die much sooner than an adult. The general health of the person or his or her age can also be important. Question: What does the passage mainly talk about? Options: A: Warning signs that carbon monoxide poisoning has. B: Reasons why carbon monoxide can cause person's death.

Greg An entertainment industry maven is being sued by his ex-mistress, who says she traveled to the U.S. to be with him after he promised to divorce his wife and take care of her for the rest of her life - then split with her. Ted Cohen, a 65-year-old music industry icon who's worked in senior positions at EMI, Warner Bros. Records and Philips Media and is currently the managing partner of TAG Strategic met Deborah Sass in 2006. According to TMZ, Sass, an Australian, was living in London at the time, and the two embarked on an affair before Cohen told Sass that if she moved to Los Angeles, he'd divorce his wife and care for Sass for the rest of her life.

The correct answer is \\"Cohen allegedly told her she didn't need one, because he was taking care of her.\\" This is because Ted Cohen is the subject of the passage, and it is about his actions and the lawsuit against him. The other options are incorrect because they do not directly relate to the subject of the passage: - A. Greg, EMI, Philips Media, TAG Strategic, Warner Bros.

Question: Is Mark \\"Boogie\\" Heke allowed to stay with his family? Movie title: Once Were Warriors Movie plot: This film is about a Maori family living in Auckland, New Zealand. The parents, Beth and Jake Heke, moved to the city when their tribal elders disapproved of their relationship. Beth (Rena Owen) was descended from the tribal leadership, and seems to have been next in line for leadership when she ran away. Unfortunately Jake (Temuera Morrison) was descended from people who were considered slaves (captives of inter-tribal wars). Rather than be separated they ran away, moved to the city, and got married. They have five children.The film opens with Jake coming home with gifts for his wife and family. He then reveals that he has just been laid off and his wife, Beth, is less than pleased. The viewer almost feels sympathy for Jake at this point. He seems like a man who wants his family to be happy. The truth turns out to be different.Jake has a horrible temper, especially when he drinks. He gets angry easily, and after consuming alcohol he gets violent. Often after a night of drinking at the bar, Jake takes the party home where dozens of intoxicated people flood their home and drink into the early morning. They sing and carry on, even though the children are upstairs trying to sleep. Beth joins in with the drinking and it becomes quickly apparent that they both have a problem. Beth and Jake are very hospitable to their friends, feeding them and allowing them to spend the night. This proves to be problematic in several ways, especially since Jake is unemployed and has 5 children to feed. The children often do not have any food to eat the next day. Jake also savagely beats Beth when he is drunk, which seems to be often. While the physical violence seems to be mostly directed at Beth, it has obviously affected the children as well.The eldest son Nig (Julian Arahanga), is angry and rebellious.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve -35970 = 267*b + 1092*b + 1911*b for b.","completion":"To solve the equation -35970 = 267*b + 1092*b + 1911*b for b, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine like terms: You first add up the terms with 'b' as shown: 267*b + 1092*b + 1911*b = 3270*b So the equation can be rewritten as: -35970 = 3270*b Step 2: Isolate the variable: Next, you isolate the variable 'b' on one side of the equation. In this instance, you achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by 3270: b = -35970 / 3270 Step 3: Calculate: Use your calculator to perform the division: b = -11 What this solution means is that b has to equal -11 to satisfy the original equation. So, the answer to the equation -35970 = 267*b + 1092*b + 1911*b is b = -11. This indicates that when -11 is substituted into the equation for b, the equation balances, or becomes true. Step 4: Check: You can also check the solution by substituting -11 for b in the original equation as shown: -35970 = 267*(-11) + 1092*(-11) + 1911*(-11) -35970 = -2967 - 12012 - 21021 -35970 = -35970 As you can see, the value of b = -11 indeed makes the original equation true, which confirms it as the correct solution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Inflation Only Gets Out of Control if You Let It Amity Shlaes warns that, contrary to what you see in the Treasury bond markets, inflation is just around the corner: In 1945, all seemed well: Inflation was 2 percent, at least officially.Within two years that level hit 14 percent. All appeared calm in 1972, too, before inflation jumped to 11 percent by 1974, and stayed high for the rest of the decade, diminishing the quality of life for whole cohorts. They paid the higher interest rates needed to reduce the inflation, and got a house with one less bedroom. Or no pool. The thing about inflation is that it accelerates. The acceleration hit storybook levels in the most sudden case of all, that of Germany in 1922. Many financial analysts thought the Weimar authorities weren’t producing enough money… The reason that markets haven’t jumped yet is that the last great inflation and correction happened in the late 1970s and early 1980s, just long enough ago that most adults in the financial markets don’t remember it. We can debate whether today’s challenge resembles that faced in the early 1980s, or something worse. But one thing is clear: pretty soon, we’ll all be in deep water. The Cleveland Fed inflation estimates, based on financial market data including the interest rate spread between ordinary and inflation-protected Treasury bonds, show expected inflation of 1.4 percent per year over the next ten years. So, if Shlaes knows about an inflation bomb that the young guns on Wall Street can’t see, she has the opportunity to go make a ton of money in the bond markets. Inflation isn’t nearly as mysterious as Shlaes makes it out to be. Milton Friedman is on point here: “Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon in the sense that it is and can be produced only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output.” If inflation starts to get out of control, all the Fed has to do is contract the money supply. The Fed is sure to have to do this in the medium term. The housing crash, banking crisis and recession caused a sharp drop in the velocity of money. MV = PQ, so the Fed had to greatly expand the monetary base in order to prevent deflation. As the velocity of money picks up, the Fed will need to contract the monetary base to prevent rapid inflation. If it’s this simple, why do countries ever have undesirably high inflation? Sometimes, as with Zimbabwe, it’s because they’re printing money as a fiscal strategy. At other times, as in the U.S. in the 1970s, there is insufficient political will for the sometimes-painful step of monetary contraction. The former is not a serious fear in the United States. As for the latter, it is possible to imagine a central bank that lacks the discipline to tighten when appropriate. But not this Federal Reserve, which has a strong bias toward disinflation and many of whose members seem to have had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, into the insufficient amount of easing we have had to date. I would prefer to see the Federal Reserve adopt a rule, such as NGDP level targeting, that would lay out an orderly path for monetary easing in recessions and tightening upon recovery. But I don’t think we need to worry about the Federal Reserve losing its grip on any ad-hoc decisions to allow some moderate inflation. It’s just not in this Fed’s nature—and the markets know it. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the concept and potential threat of inflation, particularly what is deemed 'out of control' inflation, as well as the factors that can contribute to it such as a rapid increase in the quantity of money by the Federal Reserve. It makes reference to instances in history when inflation rose significantly, like Germany in 1922, the US in the 1970s, and Zimbabwe's hyperinflation crisis, which were largely attributed to increased money production and lack of political will for monetary contraction, respectively. An important point made is that inflation is usually a monetary phenomenon, triggered by a quicker increase in the quantity of money than in output. The article suggests that if inflation begins to spiral out of control, all the Federal Reserve needs to do is contract the money supply. This concept is based on Milton Friedman's theory of inflation. The article also elaborates on why despite knowing how to prevent it, countries sometimes end up with undesirably high inflation. The reasons include using money printing as a fiscal strategy or lack of political will to contract the money supply. The writer, however, argues that such scenarios are highly unlikely in the US, given that the Federal Reserve demonstrates a strong bias towards disinflation. The writer proposes a solution to prevent uncontrolled inflation, suggesting the Federal Reserve should adopt a rule, like Nominal Gross Domestic Product (NGDP) level targeting, which would facilitate a methodical approach for monetary easing during recessions and subsequent tightening, rather than ad-hoc decisions that could lead to moderate inflation. Overall, the article seeks to dispel the fear of inflation getting out of control and argues that with the Federal Reserve's tendency towards disinflation and its regulatory mechanisms, the markets shouldn't worry about inflation spiralling out of control."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This one is a bit easier. You see, when people become teenagers, their bodies start to change a lot and they sometimes get more moody.

Let's break them down for better clarity. 1. \\"In later life he was an atheist, but in the early stages became a believer.\\" This sentence expresses that the person in question started off as a believer in the early stages of life. However, as time went by and the person grew older, they changed their beliefs and became an atheist in their later life. Here, the timeline of the person's beliefs is as follows: - Early stages of life: Believer - Later life: Atheist 2. \\"He was an atheist in early life but converted into a believer in the later stages.\\" This sentence has the opposite meaning as the first one. It conveys that the person was initially an atheist during the early stages of their life. As they grew older and progressed in life, their beliefs changed, resulting in their conversion to a believer in the later stages.

Q:Title: Good Ideas, Terrible Food Product review: I purchased this book after reading the many excellent reviews it received. Alas and alak, it was disappointing. Not so much the actual diet he describes, but the menus were horrendous and the plan was way too rigid. Would not recommmend. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses their disappointment with the book, primarily in regards to the menus and the rigidness of the plan. By stating that they would not recommend the product, it further emphasizes their negative perception of the book. The reviewer begins by highlighting that they were initially drawn to the book due to the excellent reviews it had received and were hoping for a similar positive experience. However, their expectations were not met, which only adds to the unflattering nature of the review. They make it clear that their disappointment is not with the diet concept itself but with the way it is presented and executed in the book. The use of words like \\"horrendous\\" and \\"way too rigid\\" reflects their discontent and dissatisfaction with the product. Additionally, by saying that they \\"would not recommend\\" the book, the reviewer is discouraging potential purchasers from considering this product and implying that they feel there are likely better options available in the market. This further solidifies the unflattering nature of the review and, depending on its visibility and credibility, may have a negative impact on the product's overall reputation and sales. In conclusion, this review portrays the product in an unflattering light and showcases the reviewer's negative experience with the book, specifically its menus and the plan's rigidity. By sharing their disappointment, they may deter potential customers from choosing this product and encourage them to explore alternative options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There once was a guy named Kevin and girl named Erin. They really liked spending time together. One day, Kevin traveled from his home in the United States of America to Erin's house in England. They then thought to take a sudden trip around the world. They first traveled by plane around Europe, where they saw many different people and sights. They then took a boat to Africa and Asia, where they went on a trip through the mountains. Later in the month, they traveled to China by train and were allowed to see how different life was over there. Next they took another plane to Australia, where they had a lot of fun seeing kangaroos and a different type of English speaking people. After spending a week in Australia, Kevin and Erin took a really long plane ride to North America, where they drove across the land. They saw everything from the mountains to forests. They even got to visit the beach!

Keep the skillet over the heat until the oil starts to ripple. Non-stick pans will make your sear less crispy. Opt for a cast iron skillet. Make sure the meat isn’t dripping with marinade before you put it on the pan. Before the oil starts to smoke, lay the meat down in the center of the pan, or spread out smaller pieces of meat evenly so the meat isn’t crowded. Don’t move the meat around the pan once you’ve dropped it in. Use tongs or spatula to try and lift the meat off of the pan to check on the sear’s color. If the meat sticks to the pan, wait to flip it. Once you see a dark sear or the breading is golden brown, flip your meat over. The size and type of meat will affect the time it takes for it to cook. A 6 oz (170 g) chicken breast will take approximately 5 minutes for each side to cook through. A beef steak or pork tenderloin that’s 1 in (2.5 cm) thick will take 3-4 minutes on each side. If your meat isn’t at the right temperature and you’re afraid of the pan burning it, remove the meat from the skillet and place it on a baking pan. Put it into your oven on the broil setting for 2-3 minutes before checking the temperature again.","completion":"This article provides tips on achieving a perfect sear on meat using a cast iron skillet, emphasizing even oil distribution, appropriate pan sizes, and monitoring cooking times."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy. - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014). - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s. - A humor magazine is a magazine specifically designed to deliver humorous content to its readership. These publications often offer satire and parody, but some also put an emphasis on cartoons, caricature, absurdity, one-liners, witty aphorisms, surrealism, neuroticism, gelotology, emotion-regulating humor, and/or humorous essays. Humor magazines first became popular in the early 19th century with specimens like \\"Le Charivari\\" (18321937) in France, \\"Punch\\" (18412002) in the United Kingdom and \\"Vanity Fair\\" (18591863) in the United States. - The New Yorker is an American magazine of reportage, commentary, criticism, essays, fiction, satire, cartoons, and poetry.

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, shortened Hogwarts, is a fictional British school of magic for students aged eleven to eighteen, and is the primary setting for the first six books in J.K.

Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks?\\" ? Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently.

Summarize: Lemons are great for replacing salt since they give the same zip and depth of flavor to food. You can grate the zest and include it in baked foods or squeeze the lemon and add a squirt to your food. Lemon works well in: Salad dressings Pastas Poultry or seafood dishes Breadcrumbs Try to keep several types of fresh herbs on hand so you're more likely to cook with them. For even easier use, consider mincing (chopping them finely) and storing them in the fridge so you can quickly season or garnish your food. Try these fresh herbs that pair well with a variety of foods: Basil Dill: Parsley Rosemary Thyme Chives Cooking with red or white wine is a great way to concentrate flavor in your food. Add about 1/2 cup of red or white wine to your dish and let it cook down so the wine reduces. Avoid using cooking wine or sherry which usually have salt added and are high in sodium. For example, add red wine to a pasta sauce and let it simmer for an hour to amplify the flavor. Or you can add a splash of white wine to a seafood pasta sauce and let it cook down. If you're cooking something that calls for a lot of water, you can usually replace it with a chicken, vegetable or beef stock. Ensure that the stock is salt-free (which is easy to do if you're making it at home). The stock will be more flavorful than the water and you won't even need to add salt. For example, if you're making a vegetable soup, replace the water with a stock for additional flavor. Mix up a quick salt-free marinade for meat or vegetables and heat up your grill. Grilling your food will give it a great smoky flavor and you won't even need to use salt. Try adding hickory or mesquite chips to the grill or grilling your food on a cedar wood plank for extra flavor. Try using a citrus-based marinade for even more seasoning. For example, marinate chicken in a lime vinaigrette and grill it for a bit of a smoky taste. There are a variety of vinegars you can use to replace salt. Try a splash of red wine vinegar, white wine vinegar, balsamic vinegar, or apple cider vinegar to give additional flavor to your food. Studies have shown that vinegar can enhance the salty flavor of foods. You can use vinegar in: Stews Salads Marinades Braised vegetables","completion":"Lemons can replace salt by providing zesty flavor in dishes like salad dressings, pastas, and seafood, while freshly minced herbs like basil, dill, parsley, rosemary, thyme, and chives diversify flavors. Cooking with red or white wine adds depth to dishes, while replacing water with salt-free stock enhances a dish's taste. Grilling with smoky elements like hickory chips or cedar planks imparts smoky flavors, and citrus-based marinades elevate seasoning levels. Vinegar varieties also enhance salty tastes in stews, salads, marinades, and braised vegetables."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who did Jean Richard claim had an alliance around 1263? is inside the article: Most historians describe the contacts between the Mongol Empire and the Western Europeans as a series of attempts, missed opportunities, and failed negotiations. Christopher Atwood, in the 2004 Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, summed up the relations between Western Europe and the Mongols: \\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam.\\"A few other historians argue there was an actual alliance, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged. The Mameluks..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Jean Richard claimed that an alliance between the Mongol Empire and Western Europeans began around 1263. This alliance, according to Richard and a few other historians, was formed despite numerous failed attempts, missed opportunities, and unsuccessful negotiations. The alliance was aimed at forming a united front against their mutual enemies, particularly the Islamic forces. However, historians have differing opinions on the details and existence of this alliance, and some debate whether it would have been a wise idea or if the Crusaders were relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict at that time. Regardless of the variations in opinions, Jean Richard's assertion that an alliance was formed around 1263 stands as one of the proposed scenarios for this historical relationship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"When analyzing the premise and hypothesis given, it's essential to break down the components within each statement and examine the relationships between them. Let's first understand the premise and hypothesis individually. Premise: \\"But to be quite honest, I think most people in this room are never going to mention it and probably didn't take it very seriously.\\" The premise states that the speaker believes that \\"most people\\" in the room didn't take the subject matter seriously and are unlikely to mention it. The term \\"most people\\" indicates that it is not referring to everyone, but a majority or significant portion of the audience. The premise is a belief or opinion of the speaker and is not presented as absolute fact. Hypothesis: \\"Ten people in this room did not take it very seriously.\\" The hypothesis presents the idea that \\"ten people\\" within the room didn't treat the subject with seriousness. The number \\"ten\\" provides a specific, fixed quantity of people, unlike the premise, which uses the term \\"most people\\" to represent a relative portion of the room's population. Now, let's explore if it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis: It is important to note that the premise is a belief or opinion and is not an absolute fact, but for the sake of the argument, let's assume the premise is true. If the premise is true, it means most people in the room didn't take the subject seriously.

For example, if there are 20 people in the room and the premise holds true, then the hypothesis could be true - ten or more people didn't take it seriously. However, if there are only five people in the room and the premise holds true, then the hypothesis would be false - ten people cannot be the majority of a room with a smaller population. Given that the number of people in the room remains unknown, we cannot conclude with certainty that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true.

However, with the given information, it's unclear what the sentence context would be in English. My first stage of process would be to attempt to parse the meaning of each segment and consider if there are any apparent errors. 'Happening 2005' could be a reference to an event or occurrence in the year 2005, such as an art exhibition. 'Animals' would be plural for of any type of animal. 'Kobber bladguld 22 karat' seems to be in Danish and translates to 'copper leaf gold 22 carat' in English. 'Over 2m' could refer to a measurement, potentially referring to the size of an item. 'For sale' is straightforward, indicating that the mentioned item is available for purchase. With these interpretations in mind, I believe the correctly punctuated and more understandable sentence might look something like this: \\"Happening 2005: Animals in Kobber Bladguld (22 karat), over 2 m, for sale.\\" This interpretation assumes the given sentence was a listing in some sort of art exhibition, for an artwork labelled \\"Animals\\" from 2005, which uses 22 karat copper leaf gold, and the artwork itself is over 2 meters in some measurement.

Choices: - glycolysis - atherosclerosis - absorption - photosynthesis A: A:","completion":"Photosynthesis acts as a natural complement for cellular respiration. Photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two essential biological processes that play a critical role in the energy conversion and exchange in living organisms. While these two processes have different functions and occur in different locations within cells, they are interconnected and work together to maintain life. Photosynthesis is a process that takes place primarily in the chloroplasts of plant cells and some algae. It is responsible for converting sunlight into chemical energy, which is then stored in the form of glucose or sugar molecules. During photosynthesis, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll molecules, which in turn, drives the synthesis of glucose from carbon dioxide and water. Oxygen is produced as a waste product and is released into the atmosphere. The overall equation for photosynthesis can be summarized as: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2 On the other hand, cellular respiration is a process that occurs in the mitochondria of both plant and animal cells. Its primary function is to convert the stored chemical energy in glucose molecules into a more usable form, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the main energy currency of cells. Cellular respiration is composed of three stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle), and the electron transport chain. During these processes, glucose is broken down into carbon dioxide and water, while ATP and heat are produced. Oxygen is consumed as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain. The overall equation for cellular respiration can be summarized as: C6H12O6 + 6O2 → 6CO2 + 6H2O + ATP + heat Photosynthesis and cellular respiration serve as natural complements because they utilize the same chemical compounds in their reactions while producing opposing products. Photosynthesis captures light energy and converts it into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct. Cellular respiration, on the other hand, consumes oxygen and glucose to produce ATP, which is utilized for various cellular processes, and releases carbon dioxide and water as waste products. The products of one process become the reactants of the other, creating a balanced and continuous cycle of energy conversion and storage. In conclusion, photosynthesis and cellular respiration are two essential processes in living organisms that are intricately connected and complement each other in terms of reactants and products. This interdependence helps maintain the balance of gases in the atmosphere, ensuring the survival and growth of diverse life forms on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Previous research suggested that the sharks frequent only surface waters close to the East Coast. The new study found that they swim thousands of miles into the Atlantic and dive hundreds of meters for reasons still unknown, researchers said. “As these sharks get larger, they start to leave the continental shelf and they venture out into the open Atlantic Ocean. That’s the novel information coming from this research,” said Gregory B. Skomal, lead author of the study and a Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries senior biologist. Advertisement “When they’re out there, they’re kind of wandering, almost nomadic in behavior,” he said in a telephone interview. “The movement of these animals is much broader than we previously thought.” Get Fast Forward in your inbox: Forget yesterday's news.

It was written by researchers from the state and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology/Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution Joint Program in Oceanography. The researchers used satellite tracking technology to monitor the movements of 32 great white sharks over several years. The animals were all tagged off Cape Cod between July and October from 2009 to 2014, except for one female tagged in March 2013 off the coast of Jacksonville, Fla., the researchers said. The modern technology was able to debunk previously held notions that great whites’ movements through the western Atlantic were confined to a seasonal north-south path along the East Coast The new study found that while smaller sharks did tend to stick close to shore, larger, more mature animals tended to move farther offshore. Advertisement “As they get bigger, they probably have the capacity to go out and venture into deeper, colder, broader areas,” Skomal said. The coastal sharks were found to seasonally migrate from the Gulf of Maine in summer to the mid-Atlantic in fall, to the South Atlantic and even the Gulf of Mexico in winter and spring. The sharks that swam farther offshore (“pelagic” or open-water sharks), did not follow a clear, seasonal pattern. While they also stayed along the East Coast in summer, their movements were “much less defined” and “wide-ranging” the rest of the year, the researchers said. Coastal sharks did not tend to swim north of Maine or stray far from the continental shelf, but some of the pelagic sharks reached the Grand Banks in Newfoundland to the north, and swam as far east as the Azores, which are off the coast of Portugal. The coastal and pelagic sharks also moved through the ocean at varying depths, the researchers found. The coastal sharks spent most of their time near the surface, while the pelagic sharks split time more evenly between surface swimming and diving. Advertisement “This indicates that [pelagic] individuals occupied a wider range of temperatures more frequently as they spent more time, horizontally and vertically, in both warmer and colder water when away from the shelf,” the researchers said. The coastal sharks’ movements can be explained by temperature shifts and feeding opportunities. But pelagic sharks’ habits were “not spatially, nor temporally, well-defined, and there was no apparent synchrony in their movement” except in summer, when all the sharks gravitated to the East Coast to feed on wildlife like the myriad seals that frequent Cape Cod, the researchers said. The data compiled from the yearslong tagging effort filled gaps in knowledge, but questions remained about the reasons for the animals’ behavior. “The tags are really good at telling us where they’re going, but they don’t tell us what they’re doing in terms of actual behavior,” Skomal said. Skomal speculated that the pelagic sharks’ mysterious diving in the open ocean was “likely in pursuit of some sort of prey.” He said the new data on great white sharks’ movements could end up impacting protections for the species in the Atlantic, which do not currently extend to the international zones that the study revealed the animals swim through. “They may be subjected to harvest by nations that do not have similar conservation strategies in place, so what it does is essentially leave these species vulnerable to exploitation,” he said. He said he hopes international agreements can be amended in the future to include more of the Atlantic in a great white protection area. As for the great white shark population along the East Coast, he said, the researchers believe it may be more robust than commonly assumed after decades of decline. “The white shark population in the western North Atlantic is increasing, and it’s rebounding after heavy levels of exploitation that occurred in the ’70s and ’80s,” he said. “We don’t think it’s reached historical highs, or even reached preexploitation levels, but it is showing signs of improvement so that’s all positive news.” Ben Thompson can be reached at ben.thompson@globe.com .

(Associated Press) FILE — In this Sept. 13, 2012 file photo, Massachusetts shark expert Greg Skomal pulls the cap off a blood sample taken from an Atlantic great white shark before performing blood gas analysis moments after the nearly 15-foot, 2,292-pound shark was released from the research vessel Ocearch off the coast... (Associated Press) BOSTON (AP) — The movements of great white sharks in the Pacific and Indian oceans have long been the subject of academic study, but new research is just starting to shed light on the behavior of their Atlantic Ocean counterparts. Researchers in Massachusetts say white sharks appear to venture offshore farther, with more frequency and at greater depths than previously known in the Atlantic. Some of the 32 sharks tracked between 2009 and 2014 ended up as far east as the Azores, the Portuguese island chain located more than 2,300 miles (3,701 kilometers) from Cape Cod, where most of the animals were initially outfitted with satellite tags. They also were found to make frequent deep dives — as far down as 3,700 feet (1,127 meters) — and spend more time at those dark depths than previous studies in the Atlantic suggest. The team, which included scientists from the state Division of Marine Fisheries, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, had its findings published last week in Marine Ecology Progress Series, a prominent scientific journal. \\"Everything we knew previously indicated that the white shark in the Atlantic is more coastally-oriented, moving north-to-south and remaining on the continental shelf,\\" explained Gregory Skomal, the study's lead author. \\"So what we're now describing is this other component, this offshore movement into open ocean.\\" Skomal says the work has implications for shark conservation efforts since it extends the known habitat for these ancient predators. White sharks are not considered endangered or threatened, but it's illegal to hunt them in U.S. waters. \\"You've got U.S. protection within 200 miles of shore, but you have sharks clearly leaving that protection that are vulnerable to harvest,\\" Skomal said. \\"We need to engage other countries fishing in these waters to talk about putting similar protections in place.\\" The research is exciting because it represents the \\"first real insights into the movement patterns of white sharks\\" in the northern part of the Atlantic, says Tobey Curtis, a Massachusetts-based shark researcher for the National Marine Fisheries Service who was not involved with the study. \\"Prior to this, we were only able to piece together information about their distribution from widely scattered reports from fishermen, scientists and the public,\\" he said. \\"Having tracks of individual sharks really helps fill in the gaps, and provides a more complete picture of white shark movements and migrations.\\" The study seems to hew closely to what's been observed of white sharks in other oceans — that juveniles tend to stay in the relatively shallower waters of the continental shelf where food sources abound, while adults are more apt to venture into open ocean, observes Christopher Lowe, a shark researcher at California State University in Long Beach also not involved with the research. Indeed, most of the tagged sharks in the Atlantic study generally followed a north-south migration along the Eastern Seaboard. They headed to Newfoundland and New England waters in the summer, then down south to the Carolinas and even the Bahamas for the winter. Lowe says it remains to be seen what impact continued growth of white shark populations in the Atlantic has on these habits, or whether climate change is playing a role. Another key question is finding out what these sharks are actually doing so far offshore. Researchers in northern California suggest offshore movements are for mating, a ritual that has never been observed among white sharks. But Skomal and his team believe the animals are more likely foraging — it's just not immediately obvious what they're feeding on. \\"That's the great mystery right now,\\" he said. ___ Follow Philip Marcelo at twitter.com/philmarcelo.

Article: Stir the water and sugar together in a small saucepan with tall sides. Place the saucepan on a stove over medium-high heat. Start with cold water. The ratio in this recipe will create a thick syrup suitable for cold fruit drinks, cocktails, and candied fruits. To create a syrup with medium thickness for use in iced tea and warm beverages, increase the ratio to two parts water and one part sugar. For a thin syrup suitable for use as a dessert glaze, change the ratio to three parts water and one part sugar. Stir the mixture as it comes to a boil in order to dissolve the sugar. Use medium-high to high heat and stir with a wooden or plastic mixing spoon. It may take 3 to 5 minutes before the mixture reaches a rolling boil. Check to see if the sugar has dissolved by scooping up a small amount in your spoon. If you see sugar crystals, continue to boil the syrup longer. Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer steadily for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. If you want to create a flavored syrup, add the flavorings while the syrup simmers. Liquid ingredients, like fresh lime or lemon juice, can be added directly to the syrup and stirred in. Solid ingredients, like orange peels, mint springs, or cinnamon sticks, should be tied into a bundle with cheesecloth an twine and steeped in the syrup as it simmers. Remove the syrup from the heat and let it cool to room temperature. Do not place the syrup in the refrigerator during this cooling stage. Instead, let it come to temperature on the counter at room temperature. You can add the syrup to your recipe immediately or pour it into a container to cover and refrigerate for later. The syrup should last in the refrigerator anywhere from one to six months.

This article: Mays Gilliam is the alderman for the 9th Ward in Washington, D.C.. After learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, Kim, Gilliam is surprisingly chosen as the party candidate for the presidency after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. Assuming the election was already lost to sitting vice-president Brian Lewis, the party decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the next presidential election. At first, Gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as President because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to mess it up. However, Gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother persuades him to speak out for what he believes. He begins to talk about issues such as welfare, money, society, etc. After Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Gilliam supports cancer, Gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was \\"kissing\\" his opponent (taken from Bugs Bunny–Elmer Fudd cartoons). A part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of Osama bin Laden saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis. This strategy gains Gilliam even more points in the polls. As voting day draws closer, Gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (although they reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about the American life. Finally, Gilliam ends up winning the election and the presidency.

Answer based on context: In the Morean War, the Republic of Venice besieged Sinj in October 1684 and then again March and April 1685, but both times without success. In the 1685 attempt, the Venetian armies were aided by the local militia of the Republic of Poljica, who thereby rebelled against their nominal Ottoman suzerainty that had existed since 1513. In an effort to retaliate to Poljica, in June 1685, the Ottomans attacked Zadvarje, and in July 1686 Dolac and Srijane, but were pushed back, and suffered major casualties. With the help of the local population of Poljica as well as the Morlachs, the fortress of Sinj finally fell to the Venetian army on 30 September 1686. On 1 September 1687 the siege of Herceg Novi started, and ended with a Venetian victory on 30 September. Knin was taken after a twelve-day siege on 11 September 1688. The capture of the Knin Fortress marked the end of the successful Venetian campaign to expand their territory in inland Dalmatia, and it also determined much of the final border between Dalmatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina that stands today. The Ottomans would besiege Sinj again in the Second Morean War, but would be repelled. On 26 November 1690, Venice took Vrgorac, which opened the route towards Imotski and Mostar. In 1694 they managed to take areas north of the Republic of Ragusa, namely Čitluk, Gabela, Zažablje, Trebinje, Popovo, Klobuk and Metković.

The question inquires about the first person to climb the Mount of the Holy Cross, but without specifying any particular season or context. The Mount of the Holy Cross is a well-known peak in the Sawatch Range of the Colorado Rocky Mountains, which has gained its reputation due to a cross-shaped snowfield found on its northeastern face.

The suggested answer provided information about the first winter ascent of the peak, which indeed took place in 1943 by Russel Keene and Howard Freedman of the 10th Mountain Division. They were stationed at Camp Hale during that time.

The first recorded ascent of the Mount of the Holy Cross was achieved by Ferdinand Vandeveer Hayden and his survey team, which included photographer William Henry Jackson. This expedition took place in August 1873, long before the feat accomplished by Russel Keene and Howard Freedman.

Help as much as you can. Q:Information: - The ghazal (Arabic/Persian/Urdu: ) is a poetic form with rhyming couplets and a refrain, each line sharing the same meter. A ghazal may be understood as a poetic expression of both the pain of loss or separation and the beauty of love in spite of that pain. The form is ancient, originating in Arabic poetry in Arabia long before the birth of Islam. It is derived from the Arabian panegyric \\"qasida\\". The structural requirements of the ghazal are similar in stringency to those of the Petrarchan sonnet. In style and content, it is a genre that has proved capable of an extraordinary variety of expression around its central themes of love and separation. - The Patiala gharana is one of the \\"gharanas\\" of vocal Hindustani classical music. It was founded by Ustad Fateh Ali Khan and Ustad Ali Baksh Khan (known as Alia-fattu) and was initially sponsored by the Maharaja of Patiala, Punjab and was known for ghazal, thumri, and khyal styles of singing. - Patiala is a city in southeastern Punjab, in northern India. It is the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative capital of Patiala district. Patiala is located around the \\"Qila Mubarak\\" (the Fortunate Castle).

The style is sometimes called \\"North Indian classical music\\" or \\"Shstriya Sangt\\". It is a tradition that has been evolving since the 12th century CE, in North India. Today, it is one of the two subgenres of Indian classical music, the other being Carnatic music, the classical tradition of South India. - Khyal (or Khayal, Urdu: , Hindi: ) is the modern genre of classical singing in North India. Its name comes from an Arabic word meaning \\"imagination\\". It is thought to have developed out of Dhrupad introducing frequent taans and alankars in it. It appeared more recently than dhrupad, is a more free and flexible form, and it provides greater scope for improvisation. Like all Indian classical music, khyal is modal, with a single melodic line and no harmonic parts. The modes are called raga, and each raga is a complicated framework of melodic rules.

Answer the above question based on the context below: In late 1854 or early 1855 James Robertson married Beato's sister, Leonilda Maria Matilda Beato. They had three daughters, Catherine Grace (b. 1856), Edith Marcon Vergence (b. 1859), and Helen Beatruc (b. 1861).In 1855 Felice Beato and Robertson travelled to Balaklava, Crimea, where they took over reportage of the Crimean War following Roger Fenton's departure. Beato was ostensibly Robertson's assistant, however the unpredictable conditions of a war-zone forced Beato to assume a more active role. In contrast to Fenton's depiction of the dignified aspects of war, Beato and Robertson showed the destruction and death. They photographed the fall of Sevastopol in September 1855, producing about 60 images. Their Crimean images dramatically changed the way that war was reported and depicted.In February 1858 Beato arrived in Calcutta and began travelling throughout Northern India to document the aftermath of the Indian Rebellion of 1857. During this time he produced possibly the first-ever photographic images of corpses. It is believed that for at least one of his photographs taken at the palace of Sikandar Bagh in Lucknow he had the skeletal remains of Indian rebels disinterred or rearranged to heighten the photograph's dramatic impact (see events at Taku Forts). He was also in the cities of Delhi, Cawnpore, Meerut, Benares, Amritsar, Agra, Simla, and Lahore. Beato was joined in July 1858 by his brother Antonio, who later left India, probably for health reasons, in December 1859. Antonio ended up in Egypt in 1860, setting up a photographic studio in Thebes in 1862. Answer:","completion":"Roger Fenton"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He has done fewer than a handful of interviews, given one high-profile speech and has shied away from attacking other Democrats who are considering a run in 2016. But that doesn't mean Webb has been silent on issues. Far from it. Webb, a 68-year-old former senator and secretary of the Navy, has been quietly outlining a 2016 platform -- on Twitter. For the last two-months, Webb has been tweeting about criminal justice reform, mental health issues and efforts to increase middle class incomes. He has urged the United States to reshape its drug policies and outlined his views on leadership. What's more, Webb has commented on news-of-the-day issues, like President Barack Obama's decision to normalize relations with Cuba, former New York Mario Cuomo's death and the release of Congress' report on torture. Webb plans to continue this Twitter-first strategy when he live tweets President Barack Obama's State of the Union address on Tuesday, adding his observations and disagreements with the president in real time. While most of this has gone largely unscrutinized -- and Webb and his advisers are aware Twitter can't be the only way a presidential candidate outlines a message -- advisers said Webb's Twitter account is a fair representation of the platform Webb would run on if he chooses to jump into the race. \\"We can un-paralyze the environment and re-establish a transparent, functioning governmental system,\\" he said in December, linking to a number of policy positions on combating climate change. \\"Why are so many Americans currently in prison compared with other countries and our own history,\\" he asked this month. Webb's tweets are noticeably very different than most politician's tightly edited, concise messages. Some, frankly, don't make sense. But Webb's spokesman said the former senator writes all his own tweets and takes it \\"very seriously.\\" \\"It is not a bunch of propeller heads around him saying you should do that or this,\\" said Craig Crawford, Webb's new communication's director whose hiring was announced on Twitter. \\"He likes to get his own message out and doesn't do interviews just for the heck of it. He is his own guy.\\" Crawford said Webb enjoys Twitter more than giving speeches. \\"It is more a dialogue than a one way speech,\\" he said, adding that the former senator feeds off the responses he gets and reads all of them. \\"He approaches Twitter as a conversation,\\" Crawford said. \\"He did these prison reform tweets and it is an opportunity to build a conversation with followers that is a little different than a speech or an interview that is driven by whatever the questions are. I think he enjoys it.\\" So will Webb bypass the media and only try and reach voters through Twitter in the coming months? No, says Crawford, who notes that Webb has received a list of media requests that \\"most politicians would dream about.\\" \\"He recognizes that interviews are part of the gig,\\" Crawford said. \\"He is going to open up the doors before too long.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"Jim Webb is a 68-year-old man who used to be a senator and secretary of the Navy.

The answer is:","completion":"The text refers to the category \\"mean of transportation.\\" In this case, the USS Flint (AE-32/T-AE-32) is a Kilauea-class ammunition ship of the United States Navy, serving as a means of transportation for ammunition and supplies. The ship's primary purpose is to transport and deliver a variety of ammunition, including missiles, projectiles, and bombs, to other naval vessels within a fleet or battle group. Built by Ingalls Nuclear Shipbuilding Division Litton Industries Inc. in Pascagoula, Mississippi, the USS Flint (AE-32) was delivered to the United States Navy at Charleston, South Carolina, on August 30, 1971. The ship's name was derived from the sparking rock flint, rather than the city of Flint, Michigan, which some might mistakenly assume. Ammunition ships, such as the Kilauea-class vessels, are crucial components of modern naval forces, enabling warships to extend their time at sea and maximize their operational effectiveness without constantly returning to port for resupply. These specialized ships are designed to transport substantial amounts of ordnance while ensuring safety and efficiency in loading and unloading munitions for delivery to other ships. The USS Flint (AE-32) has therefore served as an essential support ship for the United States Navy, playing a vital role in the transportation of ammunition and supplies during various missions, deployments, and exercises throughout its years of active service. By fulfilling its transportation function, the USS Flint (AE-32) directly contributes to the overall capabilities of the naval fleet, emphasizing the importance of its role within the category of \\"mean of transportation.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let's break them down to understand their similarities and differences better. 1) \\"In 2009, the first signing of Silent Majority Group Framing Hanley received a gold certification for their single 'Lollipop.'\\" This sentence indicates that Framing Hanley, which was the first act signed by the record label Silent Majority Group, received a gold certification for their single \\"Lollipop\\" in the year 2009. Here, \\"the first signing of Silent Majority Group Framing Hanley\\" can be a little confusing because it might be interpreted that the Silent Majority Group and Framing Hanley signed something together for the first time. However, in reality, it aims to express that Framing Hanley was the first band to be contracted by Silent Majority Group. 2) \\"In 2009, Silent Majority Group's first signing Framing Hanley received a Gold certification for their single 'Lollipop'.\\" This sentence, on the other hand, explicitly labels Framing Hanley as the first signing of the Silent Majority Group by using the possessive ('s) with the label's name. This sentence more clearly conveys that Framing Hanley was the first band to be signed by the Silent Majority Group. It further clarifies that the band received a Gold certification for their single \\"Lollipop\\" in 2009. In conclusion, while both sentences refer to the same event and provide the same key information, the second sentence is less ambiguous.

Summarize: Hawkins won a draining final-frame thriller 13-12 over the pre-tournament favourite late on Monday night. But the Englishman was way below his best from the start against the world number 14 on Tuesday. He scored only 31 points as he lost the first five frames. Hawkins got on the board in frame six, but Fu easily won the last two frames to earn a six-frame advantage after the first session. The quarter-final tie is the best of 25 frames and the second session gets under way on Wednesday at 14:30 BST. Fu played with fluency and impressive cue ball control to take full advantage of some sloppy play by 2013 runner-up Hawkins - the only man to have made the semi-finals, when the Crucible switches to one table - in each of the last three years. But his chances of repeating that feat appear slim after being completely outplayed by London-based Fu, who recorded three half-centuries on his way to a 5-0 lead. World number 11 Hawkins took a scrappy sixth frame, but two half-centuries gave Fu frame seven and he rounded off the session with his sixth score of more than 50. The other afternoon match saw four-time champion John Higgins win four frames in a row to take a 5-3 lead in his all-Scottish meeting with Alan McManus. McManus, twice a World Championship quarter-finalist in the early 1990s, lost the opener but was then in imperious form as he secured a 3-1 mid-session interval lead with breaks of 114, 78 and 56. But the 45-year-old was out of sorts after the interval, appearing to be troubled by a neck problem. And Higgins, who has gone on to lift the title on the last three occasions he has reached the last eight at the Crucible, made the most of some decent chances to take control.

There could be a variety of factors and reasons contributing to the temple's current state, such as natural disasters, man-made destruction, or simply the passage of time taking its toll on the structure. The temple might hold historical, cultural, or religious significance, making its loss or damage particularly disheartening. When people visit temples, they often do so with the intention of experiencing the beauty, history, and spiritual connection these structures provide. When a temple is no longer in its original, preserved state, it may not evoke the same sense of awe and wonder that it once did. Additionally, the loss of such a significant monument could lead to a decrease in tourism and, subsequently, a negative impact on the local economy, further establishing the sadness surrounding the situation. Moreover, temples often serve as a testament to the architectural and artistic achievements of past civilizations. When a temple lies in ruins, it becomes more difficult to study and appreciate the craftsmanship and skill involved in its creation. This loss of knowledge and understanding of the past contributes to the overall feeling of sadness associated with the diminished state of the temple. In conclusion, the statement \\"It is sad but there is not much of the temple left\\" aligns with the given information that much of the temple lies in ruins. This perspective acknowledges the emotional and cultural impact of losing a significant historical monument, and it is a valid response to the current state of the temple."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It continues to operate for that purpose. As of 2016, Bellette is the only woman to have won the Sulman Prize on more than one occasion. A large number of her works are held by the Art Gallery of New South Wales; other galleries that hold examples include the Art Gallery of South Australia, Art Gallery of Western Australia, Bendigo Art Gallery, Geelong Art Gallery, the National Gallery of Australia, and the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery. In 2004–05, a major retrospective exhibition was held at Bathurst Regional Art Gallery, the S. H. Ervin Gallery in Sydney, the University of Queensland Art Museum, Mornington Peninsula Regional Gallery and the Drill Hall Gallery in Canberra.Described by Amanda Beresford as Australia's \\"only true modern classicist\\", Bellette is generally regarded as an influential figure in the modern art movement in Sydney in the mid-twentieth century. Art historian Janine Burke described Bellette as \\"a leader of the post-war art world\\", and the University of Queensland Art Museum's curator placed her as \\"a seminal figure in the visual arts from the 1930s until her death in Majorca in 1991\\". Of her paintings, opinions vary. Burke described her as \\"arguably the best painter\\" of the Sydney circle. Historian Geoffrey Dutton was unconvinced about her choice of subject but praised Bellette's \\"assured if muted\\" style, while dismissing the lesser efforts of her husband. Art historian and writer Sasha Grishin had a different view. Commenting on Bellette's paintings of Greek mythological subjects created in the 1940s, he wrote, \\"they were neither very convincing as paintings, nor works that had a particular resonance in Sydney or Australian art at the time\\". John Passmore and Bellette studied together both in Australia and England, travelled in Europe, and exhibited side by side in group shows.

Movie plot title: Pehla Pehla Pyaar Movie plot: Zimmy (Ali Tabish) and Tina (Resham) belong to middle-class families; live and study in Dubai, and fall in love after initial indecisiveness. Zimmy becomes a famous singer thanks to Tina who appears in his first music video as a friendly-cum-romantic gesture. Seth Tahir Dawood (Nadeem) in Bangkok catches a glimpse of Tina on TV and asks his personal secretary, played by Kanwal, to arrange his meeting with her. The secretary is helped by Sweetie (Sajid Hasan), Tina's brother - a drunkard and a gambler - who manages to convince her mother that the 40-something Seth is the perfect match for Tina. Zimmy returns from an outdoor shoot to learn of the marriage and heartbroken, vows never to get married. But unknown to him, he is admired by Haya (Zara Sheikh), the daughter of Seth Dawood and Tina's step daughter. The film moves at an amazingly rapid pace in the latter half, but sadly in no particular direction.

The former model who was allegedly shot by her boyfriend in a failed murder-suicide after he killed a Utah cop was arrested over the weekend, accused of giving police false stories. Traci Vaillancourt, 34, was arrested on two counts of suspicion of obstruction of justice late on Saturday and spoke to an attorney for the first time since the September 1 incident on Sunday. Vaillancourt - who was disfigured and was left hooked on painkillers after getting a rare blood disease - was allegedly shot in the back by her boyfriend Timothy 'Troy' Walker, 35, while sitting in their Volvo in Draper, Utah. This was just moments after Walker is accused of shooting dead Sgt Derek Johnson, 32. Walker then turned the weapon on himself and was hospitalized. He remains in serious condition. On Saturday Salt Lake County Jail released a probable cause statement saying that investigators spoke with Vaillancourt on Sept. 1, 4 and 7, but all three statements were found to be inconsistent with evidence from the scene. Wheelchair: Vaillancourt was wheeled into court and was breathing with the help of an oxygen tank. Accused: Timothy Walker (left) allegedly shot Sgt. Derek Johnson dead before turning the gun on his girlfriend Vaillancourt (right in an earlier mugshot) and himself. Killed: Father-of-one Sgt Derek Johnson was fatally shot when he stopped alongside Walker's Volvo. Officers suspect the pair were on drugs when Sgt Johnson spotted their car parked awkwardly. Police believe that Walker ambushed Johnson while he was sat in his patrol car. Sgt Johnson was married to his high school sweetheart Shante Sidwell with whom he had a 6-year-old son Bensen. His funeral was held on Friday where the community paid tribute to man described as a dedicated public servant. According to the Deseret News, his sister Desirae Johnson said: 'I love you and I am so proud of you for giving your life to what you loved and believe in. I promise I will never forget you and look for signs of you wherever I go.' On Sunday night Vaillancourt met attorney Matthew Kober at the Salt Lake County Metro Jail, also reported by the Deseret News. Kober said the woman being held in the medical unit, in a wheelchair and wearing a sling. According to the lawyer, Vaillancourt is in a lot of pain and on medication. 'I asked a lot of questions. She answered to the best of her recollection,' Kober said. 'This is the first time I've been able to meet with her to understand her side of the story and find out her version of events. We're finding out everything about as quickly as the media is,' he continued. The attorney said that he still needed to talk to police about which of his client's statements they thought were inconsistent. 'There are still some facts I want to follow up and understand better,' Kober said. 'She is aware multiple shots were fired. She expressed her concern for the fallen officer and is in a very emotional state. 'All along we thought she was a victim in this matter,' he added. Tributes: Family and friends paid their respects to Sgt Johnson at his funeral on Friday. Community: Johnson was described as a dedicated public servant in the town of Draper, Utah. Speaking in response to the crime, Vaillancourt's sister Victoria King has revealed her sister's tragic demise from aspiring model and TV star to drug-addled homeless woman reliant on her violent boyfriend. After having her first child, Vaillancourt was diagnosed with a rare blood disorder called Hereditary Angioedema which made her face, throat and limbs swell, her sister told KSL.com. She says her sister quickly became addicted to her pain medication after suffering four strokes before the age of 30. 'It just went downhill from there,' King told the broadcaster. 'I tried to get him away from her. She chose a different path. … He was bad news from the get-go, I knew it, and the two of them combined, and a loaded gun nonetheless, and strung out on drugs.' 'We tried and tried and tried to help her but you can't help someone who won't help themself,' she added. Proud dad: Derek Johnson is pictured with his son Bensen. Happily married: Derek Johnson grew up in Draper and married his high school sweetheart. He was described as a dedicated police officer. King last saw her sister and Walker, 35, the day before the shootings and was left startled by his behavior. 'He got out of the car and he was hyper, showing me a gun that has a laser and a machete and knives,' she said. The couple were trying to talk King into giving them cash - an event which wasn't unusual according to Vaillancourt's older sister. They have a daughter together who lives in full custody of her paternal grandmother. Ms King told Salt Lake Tribune that her sister was not without remorse at what had become of her life but couldn't work her way out of the cycle of addiction. 'She would cry, ‘I never pictured my life turning out like this,’' King told the newspaper. According to King, Walker gave Vaillancourt attention and Vaillancourt 'was attached to him at the hip'. Online: In this photograph posted by friends on Facebook they expressed dismay at what had become of the girl they loved, right. She says the pair have been living in and out of motels and were most recently living out of their car. She says the couple told her they needed protection and that's why they had purchased a cache of weapons. 'I know she was a victim, but I felt like I already lost her a long time ago. My heart is absolutely bleeding for Derek Johnson’s family,' King added in the interview. 'I just want them to know I’m sorry'. Walker has a history of petty crime but nothing that would indicate the murder he is accused of carrying out on Sunday. Vaillancourt too has a record of theft and shoplifting but nothing violent. Crashed: Sgt Johnson drove his car a short distance after being shot, crashing it into a field. Shot dead: A tribute site has been set up to Derek Johnson. 'The streets of Draper City were made safer by Sgt. Derek Johnson who loved his job as a police officer for the Draper City Police Department,' Johnson's family wrote in his obituary. 'Understanding the risk, but wanting to protect he gave his life while on duty Sept. 1, 2013, at the age of 32. 'He was the recipient of many awards, including Life Saving Award, Distinguished Service Award, and was the 2012 Community Policing Officer of the Year. With a good nature, a sense of humor that could light up any room, attention to detail and the ability to make anyone his friend. 'He made a difference. He loved his family, hunting, running, hiking and giving service. He was always up for a good challenge,' it reads. The police officer, promoted last year, tried to drive away after the shooting and crashed his patrol car into a field. The owner, Dan Smith, hung ribbons in his memory. 'There's no words that can explain it and make it ok,' Smith said. 'It obviously tugs at your heartstrings and you want to do something to show that it wasn't in vain.' The local sheriff Jim Winder says Walker had a desire to shoot a uniformed officer. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Carefully brush your cat.\\"","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Grooming Your Cat for a Healthy, Beautiful Coat Introduction Cats are undoubtedly popular pets, with their independent personalities and loving nature endearing them to millions of households worldwide. While cats are typically known to be clean animals that maintain themselves through regular grooming, there are still times when owners need to step in and provide additional care to keep their feline companions looking their best. This article delves into the importance of grooming your cat, how often you should brush their coat, the supplies required, and the tips and tricks to ensuring a smooth, enjoyable grooming experience for both you and your cat. The Importance of Grooming Your Cat Grooming your cat not only improves the look of their coat but also promotes overall health by preventing tangles, knots, and mats, which can lead to skin irritations and infections. Additionally, the act of brushing removes loose fur, reducing hairballs and minimizing shedding, thus creating a cleaner home environment. Grooming your cat also helps strengthen the bond between the two of you by providing a time of relaxation and quality interaction. Determining the Frequency of Brushing The coat length and type of your cat largely dictate how often you should groom them. Generally, short-haired cats require less frequent brushing, about once or twice a week, to keep their coats glossy and free from tangles. On the other hand, long-haired cats necessitate more regular grooming, around two to three times a week or even daily, to prevent mats and minimize hairballs. It is important to consider the breed-specific grooming needs and the unique characteristics of your cat to tailor a suitable grooming schedule. Gathering the Right Supplies Having the right supplies on hand can make the grooming experience more efficient and enjoyable for both you and your cat. Some essential grooming tools include: 1. A slicker brush or comb: Ideal for removing tangles, knots, and loose fur, a slicker brush or comb, depending on the coat length, is a must-have tool in any cat grooming kit. 2. A dematting comb or rake: This tool is particularly helpful for cats with long hair, as it easily removes mats without causing pain or discomfort to your cat. 3. Grooming scissors: These are handy when it comes to trimming and maintaining your cat's fur, especially around sensitive areas like the face, ears, and paws. 4. Nail clippers: Regularly trimming your cat's nails is essential for their health and wellbeing, and investing in a pair of cat-specific nail clippers makes this task much more manageable. 5. Grooming wipes or waterless shampoo: In case of any mess, grooming wipes or waterless shampoo can help keep your cat clean without the need for a full bath. Carefully Brushing Your Cat Preparation is the key to a successful grooming session. Begin by locating a quiet, calm space within your home where your cat feels comfortable and secure. You may also want to consider incorporating specific cues, such as treats or soothing background music, to help your cat associate grooming with a positive experience. Start the grooming process by gently stroking your cat, gradually introducing the brush or comb into your touch. Once your cat is relaxed, initiate brushing with gentle, long strokes that follow the natural direction of the coat. Speak to your cat softly and offer praise and reassurance throughout the session. When tackling tangles, knots, or mats, approach cautiously to minimize discomfort. If possible, hold the fur closest to the skin to reduce pulling tension and use a detangling spray or comb to gently work through the problematic area. Don't forget to give attention to the tail, ears, and underbelly, as these areas can also be prone to mats and tangles. Regularly check for any skin irritations, fleas, or ticks while grooming, and consult a veterinarian if you notice any irregularities or inconsistencies in your cat's coat or skin. Conclusion Regular grooming is crucial for maintaining your cat's healthy, beautiful coat and overall wellbeing. By committing to a consistent grooming schedule, investing in the right tools, and creating a positive grooming experience, your cat will not only look great but will feel all the more adored and cherished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both represent central California -- their districts share a border. Both are recently elected to Congress. Both have outspoken positions on immigration reform. And that's where the similarities end. Republican v. Republican Rep. Jeff Denham, who represents California's 10th Congressional District, is actively lobbying his Republican colleagues to get on board behind immigration legislation that includes a path to legalization. \\"The entire system is broken,\\" Denham said in a recent interview with CNN. \\"It's a big issue for our nation.

The increasing awareness of the need for immigration reform is creating a shift in the political landscape, especially within the Republican Party. Proponents of such a reform, like Denham, argue that the current system is unsustainable and detrimental to both the United States and the millions of immigrants who want to contribute to the country legally. The growing support for a more comprehensive immigration reform approach within the Republican base is not only a reflection of the changing demographics of the country but also a realization that the outdated and often conflicting policies only serve to make the issue worse. Thus, Denham's efforts to lobby his Republican colleagues for a policy overhaul can be seen as an attempt to bridge the existing divide within the party and find a more durable and realistic solution. Denham's ability to push through immigration legislation that offers a path to legalization might largely depend on both the political climate and his capacity to persuade his more conservative colleagues to see the long-term benefits of such a move. However, if the momentum behind his position continues to grow, it could signal a significant transformation within the Republican Party and even help to reshape the national conversation on immigration reform. Despite the resistance from some quarters within the party, the fact remains that an increasing number of Republicans are beginning to recognize that finding a viable solution to the complex issue of immigration is not only necessary but also in their best interest as a political force. By championing this cause, Denham is placing himself at the forefront of what could potentially be a turning point for both his party and the country as a whole. In conclusion, while Denham might currently be in the minority in his caucus when it comes to his views on immigration reform, the growing momentum behind his position cannot be ignored. As more and more Republicans begin to acknowledge the need for a practical and humane approach to this issue, it is possible that those like Denham who advocate for change will find increasing support within their ranks. Ultimately, the fate of immigration reform will depend on the willingness of lawmakers like Denham to challenge the status quo and work tirelessly to build consensus, both within and outside their party."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. What is an answer for this question: Which plant would change the regulation of their stomata, plant A or plant B?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, plant B is the one that would change the regulation of their stomata. This is because plant B has been repeatedly exposed to drought conditions, and as the study by Tombesi et al. showed, plants that have been exposed to drought develop a strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use, which includes changes in stomata regulation and hydraulic safety margin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aside from acquiring the lower Tenasserim coast, the Burmese did not achieve their larger objectives of taming Siam and securing their peripheral regions. The actual outcome was the opposite. The new energetic Siamese leadership was now better able to support rebellions in Lan Na and Lower Burma. On the other hand, the Burmese offensive military capability was greatly diminished after two long wars with Siam and China. In the following years, Hsinbyushin was totally preoccupied with yet another Chinese invasion. At any rate, the Burmese could not blame the Siamese for fomenting the rebellions of the 1770s. It was mainly the warlord behaviour of Burmese commanders who \\"were drunk with victory\\" that incited the rebellions. The Siamese were only helping the ready situation on the ground. In 1773, the southern Burmese army command provoked a mutiny by its ethnic Mon troops and put down the mutiny with \\"undue severity\\". Over 3,000 Mon troops and their families fled to Siam, and joined the Siamese army. The army command warlord's behaviour only grew in 1774 when Hsinbyushin suffered from a debilitating long illness that would ultimately claim his life two years later. Local governors began to disregard the king's royal orders, an unimaginable development only a few years previously. In January 1775, another Lan Na rebellion started with full Siamese support. Chiang Mai fell on 15 January 1775. Hsinbyushin on his deathbed ordered his last invasion of Siam in 1775. The Siamese defences held this time. The Burmese armies were bogged down in central Siam in June 1776 when they withdrew after the news of Hsinbyushin's death had reached the front. Lan Na was firmly on the Siamese camp.

The two wild-card teams in each league face each other in a one-game playoff. The winner of this game advances to meet the top seed in the Division Series. The revised playoff system began with the 2012 season. Is it true that is the mlb wildcard a one game series?","completion":"Yes, it is true that the Major League Baseball (MLB) wildcard is a one-game playoff series. The introduction of this current format occurred on November 17, 2011, instituted by the MLB as a way to expand the postseason and further increase the level of competition and excitement for fans. Under this system, two wild-card teams from each league (American League and National League) qualify for a one-game playoff matchup, also known as the 'Wild Card Game'. In order to qualify as a wild-card team, a team must have the best win-loss record among the non-division winners in their respective league. The wild-card game serves as a high-stakes, winner-takes-all, match where the victorious team secures their spot in the Division Series. The losing team, however, is immediately eliminated from the playoffs. The rationale behind implementing a one-game playoff for the wildcard teams revolves around several factors: 1. Increased competition: By allowing two wildcard teams from each league, the MLB postseason becomes more inclusive and offers additional teams opportunities to compete, leading to increased excitement and intensity during the regular season. 2. Rewarding division winners: With the wildcard teams facing off in the high-pressure, single game before advancing, division winners, who generally have better records, are provided with the benefit of bypassing this elimination game and secure their spot directly in the Division Series. 3. Fan engagement: The wildcard format provides fans of more teams with additional reasons to stay engaged throughout the entire season, as the chance to secure a wildcard spot remains possible for many clubs even as the season winds down. 4. Television revenue: A one-game playoff generates considerable interest and excitement among fans, which translates into increased viewership for television networks and additional revenue for the league. Since the implementation of the wildcard system, the excitement and unpredictability have been evident. Each season, the wildcard game produces memorable moments and has the potential of catapulting the winning team to further success in the playoffs. However, due to its one-game nature, the wildcard game has also generated some criticism, as a team's entire season can be reduced to the outcome of a single, high-stakes game. Despite these concerns, the wildcard format has been a significant part of the MLB postseason landscape since 2012 and continues to generate significant interest and excitement for fans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The latest figures showed an 83% increase in donor numbers since 2008. The government is set to launch a consultation on increasing donations - including the so-called opt-out system. It would mean any individual who had not registered a clear decision on whether they wished their organs to be donated would be presumed to hold no objection. But families would still have to be contacted and consulted before any transplant went ahead. Dr Sue Robertson, who is a member of the BMA's Scottish Council, said more than 800 people in Scotland were currently in need of a transplant. \\"We think that's too many and we think we should do as much as we can to try and help those people,\\" she told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. \\"It's great to hear donation rates have increased and organ transplantation has been an area where there's been amazing progress, but we strongly believe that as long as people in Scotland are still dying waiting for transplants then more needs to be done.\\" Dr Robertson said an opt-out system could be crucial to reducing the number waiting for organs. She added: \\"We have written to the minister Aileen Campbell to ask her to clarify the timetable for the consultation that she promised us some months ago, to look at the potential particularly for legislative change.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. If a US President were to declare martial law, would he have the power to dissolve Congress and stay in office for more than two terms? Can a US President declare martial law to avoid impeachment? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"In the United States, the President does have the power to declare martial law, but the Constitution does not provide the President with the authority to dissolve Congress or extend their term indefinitely. The concept of martial law allows for the replacement of civil rule with military authority during a crisis, disaster, or in a time of war. Under martial law, certain civil freedoms may be suspended, such as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures, freedom of association, and freedom of movement. It's a serious step that has only been taken in limited circumstances such as during the Civil War or following a direct foreign attack like Pearl Harbor. As far as a President using martial law to avoid impeachment, this seems unlikely. Impeachment is a constitutional procedure, and the President does not have the power under the Constitution to prevent or stop this. Impeachment is initiated by the House of Representatives and decided by the Senate. It is meant as a check and balance on the executive branch by the legislative branch. Additionally, the President cannot use martial law to extend their power beyond two terms. The 22nd Amendment of the Constitution is quite clear on this, limiting the President to two terms in office regardless of circumstances. This amendment was ratified following Franklin D. Roosevelt's four terms in office and has only been challenged once without success. It's also essential to note that the declaration of martial law is traditionally intended to last only as long as the emergency or crisis itself does. Once the disaster is resolved, civilian rule must be restored. The second question differs slightly from the first; though related, it is not a paraphrase. The first question asks about the President's power to dissolve Congress and extend terms under martial law, while the second inquires specifically about whether martial law could be invoked to avoid impeachment. The two questions overlap in that they both relate to a potential misuse of martial law by a President to extend their powers, but they are not just restatements of the same query. They touch on two different elements of presidential power under martial law: the ability to dissolve congress and the ability to avoid impeachment. Both possibilities, however, stand contrary to the U.S. Constitution's established checks and balances which limit the power of any one branch of government, including the Executive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again. Lohan is then seen smoking a cigarette, as in the opening scenes, his hand bloodied. Later, the prisoners are taken out of their cells and given second-hand civilian clothing.

Article: If you regularly shave, and are transitioning into professional waxing, don’t shave for three weeks so your hair can grow out. If you have never removed your vaginal hair, consider trimming it. The ideal length of hair for waxing is about .25 inches (0.64 cm). There are two types of waxes: the bikini (which removes hair from the top and sides of your vagina) and the Brazilian (which removes everything). Decide how much hair you want to remove, and choose the wax that’s right for you. If you’re a beginner, don’t start with the Brazilian, as it can be painful. Instead, ease your way in by getting a few bikini waxes done first. Look for nail and spa salons in your area. One easy way to find places that wax is to call all of the nail salons in your area and ask if any of them do waxing. Ask about their practice, how they ensure that everything is sterile and clean, and how much the wax will cost. Depending on where you live, a professional waxing session can range from 35-80. Waxing is not a pain-free process, though it is a manageable one. Take one regular dose of your preferred painkiller to prepare for your session. If you have a low pain tolerance, bring another painkiller for after the session. Do not take more than one standard dose before your wax. If it’s your first time getting professionally waxed, you might be uncomfortable or even nervous about being naked from the waist down in front of a stranger -- but you have nothing to worry about! Your waxing technician is a professional. If you still feel uncomfortable after a few sessions, try listening to music or an audiobook while you get waxed. This can help keep your mind off the situation. If your waxing technician ever makes you feel uncomfortable or does something inappropriate, leave the session as soon as you can and report them to a manager or the police. While nowhere near unmanageable, waxing will probably cause you some pain. Try not to clench your teeth or muscles against it, because that’ll only make the experience worse. Instead, focus on breathing deeply and exhale right as the strip is being pulled. Getting waxed right after your period is said to help with the pain! You’re going to be tender and your skin will be sensitive after your waxing session. Prepare for that tenderness by wearing comfortable cotton underwear and a skirt or other comfortable pants. Avoid wearing tight pants or underwear for at least a day after shaving. To keep your vaginal area smooth and prevent irritation or ingrown hair, exfoliate gently one week after your session with a loofah. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text. So, for this article, the summary would be: Waxing is a way to remove hair from your body, like from your private parts. If you want to try it, let your hair grow a little first. There are two types of waxing for your private parts: the bikini and Brazilian. Bikini takes off just some hair, and Brazilian takes off all of it. Waxing can hurt a bit, but you can take medicine to make it better. When you get waxed, remember to breathe and wear comfy clothes after. If you take care of your skin after, it will stay smooth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Porn videos and Playboy magazines. for the following movie plot: Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) is an anxious sales executive in the St. Louis area. When he finds out that his eldest son, Kevin (Jasen Fisher), has emotional problems and needs therapy, and that his other two children, Taylor (Alisan Porter) and Justin, may have issues as well, he begins to blame himself and questions his abilities as a father. When Gil's wife, Karen (Mary Steenburgen), announces she is pregnant with their fourth child on the same day he quit his sales job, he is unsure whether he can cope. Gil is also concerned and convinced that the financial burdens of another child and office politics at work are turning him into the distant workaholic he hated his own father, Frank (Jason Robards), for being. Stressed by family and work issues, he opens up to Frank about his doubts as a parent. Frank tells him that he worries too much, and they have a reconciliation of sorts with Frank telling Gil, that fear and apprehension for one's children never ends. When a hired cowboy character fails to show up at Kevin's birthday party, Gil dresses up as a cowboy himself and hilariously understudies the role. Gil's sister, Helen (Dianne Wiest), is a divorced bank manager whose dentist ex-husband wants nothing to do with their kids, Garry (Joaquin Phoenix) and Julie (Martha Plimpton). Garry, who has just entered puberty, is shy, friendless, and likes to be alone in his room with a mysterious paper bag. At first Helen worries that it contains drugs or alcohol, but it actually contains porn videos and Playboy magazines. Julie is still in high school. In spite of her high SAT scores, she is not interested in her education. She and her slacker boyfriend, Tod Higgins (Keanu Reeves), get married, ultimately resulting in her becoming pregnant and him moving into Helen's house. When Helen asks Tod to talk with Garry, he is able to reassure Garry that his obsession with girls and sex is normal for a boy his age, something that is a relief to Garry. This also increases Helen's respect for Tod. Eventually she supports his and...
