With no way to return to their home planet, the Newcomers were first quarantined and then finally released to live among humans in the LA area.An LA police detective, Matthew Sykes, and his partner, Detective Tuggle, are patrolling an LA Newcomer neighborhood when they spot two of the aliens dressed in long black coats entering a small convenience store. The aliens pull out shotguns and rob the store's owner. Sykes and Tuggle intervene when the robbers emerge from the store and a gunfight ensues. One of the newcomers changes the magazine on his shotgun and begins to fire several powerful rounds that pass through the entire width of the car Tuggle is hiding behind. Tuggle is hit in the chest by one of the shots and dies immediately. Sykes, enraged at his longtime partner's death, takes off after Tuggle's killers.Rushing into a dark tunnel near the store, the Newcomer Sykes chases pulls out a small vial of blue fluid and deposits a small amount on his tongue. The substance is clearly a drug and the newcomer, invigorated by it's effects, furiously charges Sykes. Sykes fires several shots into the alien's chest, who seems unaffected at first but eventually drops. When Sykes is found by the backup that arrives, one of the officers tries to help him to his feet. When Sykes sees that the officer is a Newcomer, he violently pushes him away and hits him.The next day at his headquarters, Sykes joins his company for the morning debriefing.

Write some highlights for the following article: A group of Texas clinics that provide abortions are asking the U.S. Supreme Court for emergency action to keep their facilities open, in the face of state restrictions that went into effect last week. A ruling by a federal appeals court earlier this month gave Texas the green light to move forward on the mandate requiring all abortion clinics in the state be \\"ambulatory surgical centers,\\" regulated under the same standards as hospitals. Another challenged provision would force doctors performing abortions to first obtain admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. Abortion rights groups said 13 reproductive health clinics were forced to immediately close Friday after the court ruling, leaving only a handful still operating. The time-sensitive appeal was filed with Justice Antonin Scalia, who gave Texas officials until Thursday to respond in writing. Scalia would then presumably ask his other eight colleagues to weigh in before issuing an order on behalf of the court. Any order would only have temporary effect, until more appeals can be filed on the larger questions of the Texas law's constitutionality. That process may take several months, at least, to resolve. The Supreme Court refused to intervene previously when other sections of the Texas law were challenged in court. Lawmakers in the state's Republican-majority Legislature have said the regulations would improve patient care and safety. Abortion rights groups counter, saying the law is designed to make it nearly impossible to operate an abortion clinic in Texas. The Center for Reproductive Rights had sued Texas this past spring, on behalf of a coalition of abortion clinics. In August, a federal judge ruled that the \\"ambulatory surgical centers\\" requirement was unconstitutional and imposed an injunction. Thursday's appeals court ruling lifted that injunction and allowed the measure to go into effect immediately. Lauren Bean, spokeswoman for the state attorney general's office, said in a statement after that ruling, \\"This decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women.\\" Abortion rights groups counter the mandate will leave women of reproductive age in the state with minimal health care options, and called the appeals court decision \\"demonstrably wrong.\\" \\"Over 900,000 Texas women of reproductive age, more than a sixth of all such women in Texas, now reside more than 150 miles from the nearest Texas abortion provider, up from 86,000 prior to the enactment of the challenged act,\\" said the clinics in their emergency application to the high court. \\"Women's ability to exercise their constitutional right to obtain an abortion will be lost, and their lives will be permanently and profoundly altered,\\" by having those clinics remaining closed. Supporters said before the bill was enacted, there were 41 facilities in Texas providing abortions. H.B. 2 also bans abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and tightens usage guidelines for \\"abortion-inducing drugs\\" such as RU-486. Critics contend the law, in addition to eliminating abortion across huge swaths of the state, will further deny access to many women in rural communities and will force women to seek dangerous \\"back-alley\\" abortions. Republican Gov. Rick Perry signed the bill into law last year. The high court case is Whole Woman's Health v. Lakey (14A365). CNN's Azadeh Ansari contributed to this report.

Premise: \\"Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show.\\" true? Select from the following. (a). yes; (b). it is not possible to tell; (c). no;","completion":"(c). No. The hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show\\" does not align with the premise \\"Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance.\\" In order to understand the relationship between the premise and the conflicting hypothesis, let's break down each statement and analyze them carefully. The premise \\"Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance\\" suggests that there is a strong demand for tickets to these shows, which might be due to factors such as their popularity, limited seating capacity, or limited number of shows. This demand creates a situation where potential attendees must reserve or purchase their tickets ahead of time to ensure that they have a seat at the event. On the other hand, the hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show\\" conflicts with the premise, as it implies that there is either enough availability for last-minute purchases or the demand for tickets is low enough that one can purchase tickets right before the show starts. This hypothesis disregards the importance of reserving tickets in advance stated in the premise. Taking into account the information provided in the premise, it is clear that the hypothesis is not true. To align with the premise that emphasizes the importance of advanced reservations, potential attendees should reserve their tickets well in advance to avoid missing out on the event. This is especially crucial if the shows are very popular, have limited seating, or have a restricted number of performances. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Tickets to shows should be brought right before the show\\" is not true based on the provided premise \\"Tickets for the shows must be reserved well in advance.\\" To ensure a successful reservation or purchase of tickets, attendees are advised to make their plans and secure their tickets as early as possible."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Es sind mehrere Faktoren, die zu dieser Situation geführt haben. Erstens herrscht eine gewisse Uneinigkeit unter den Mitgliedstaaten über die Notwendigkeit und das Tempo der Schengen-Erweiterung. Einige Mitgliedstaaten sind besorgt über mögliche Auswirkungen auf die Sicherheit und die öffentliche Ordnung, insbesondere im Hinblick auf grenzüberschreitende Kriminalität und illegale Einwanderung. Zweitens sind technische und organisatorische Probleme aufgetreten, die die Einführung des Schengen-Informationssystems der zweiten Generation (SIS II) verzögern. Dieses System ist für den Austausch von Sicherheits- und Migrationsinformationen zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten unerlässlich und sollte ursprünglich bis Ende 2007 ohne Verzögerung betriebsbereit sein. Es wurden jedoch erhebliche Verzögerungen und Schwierigkeiten bei der Entwicklung und Implementierung festgestellt. Drittens gibt es Bedenken hinsichtlich der Erfüllung der Schengen-Anforderungen durch die neuen Mitgliedstaaten, wie z.B. die Sicherung der Außengrenzen, die Zusammenarbeit der Strafverfolgungsbehörden und die Anpassung nationaler Gesetzgebungen und Verfahren. Einige Mitgliedstaaten haben Probleme bei der Umsetzung dieser Anforderungen gemeldet, was Unsicherheit und Misstrauen unter den bisherigen Schengen-Mitgliedern schürt.

One of the first CNN contributors to announce his prediction on Twitter was Alex Castellanos. In his latest column, he explains why he's betting fellow Republican Mitt Romney will win. Democratic strategist Paul Begala disagrees with Castellanos' prediction. Right after the first presidential debate in which some were underwhelmed by President Barack Obama's performance, Begala remarked, \\"There is no doubt Romney had a good night.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story follows the escape of two men from an Alaska prison, the efforts of a railroad dispatch office to safely stop the out-of-control train they are on, and the hunt by their warden to recapture them. Oscar \\"Manny\\" Manheim is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts, the doors to Manny's cell were welded shut for three years. A court order compels Manny's nemesis, the vindictive and sadistic Associate Warden Ranken, to release him back into the general prison population. Manny intends to break out a third time with his older brother Jonah, but he is forced to set his escape plan into action in the middle of winter after Ranken employs a serial killer to stab him. Jonah stabs his attacker to death in retaliation and in turn is severely beaten by a prison guard, leaving him in a high-security hospital wing. Manny has to leave his brother behind. He recruits Buck McGeehy, who was convicted of statutory rape and who works in the prison's laundry room, to smuggle him out in a trolley. Buck decides to join Manny in the escape, even though Manny wants to go it alone. After a freezing cross-country hike (involving a 300Â ft drop into a river and subsequent swim) the two hop on board a train consisting of four locomotives at a remote Alaskan rail yard. Both men enter the fourth unit and stow away in the toilet compartment. Just as the train starts to move, the elderly engineer suffers a heart attack. In attempting to stop the train and get off, he does not set the throttle to idle, instead engaging the brakes, before collapsing off the still-moving train. This overrides the engine's automatic train stop. Consequently, the locomotives overpower the brakes, burning their shoes off and making it impossible to stop the...

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What do muscles do?\\" and the following answer choices: - Immobilize - expand - Form bones - thrust - Shrink - grow - Bend - Move Now knowing that muscles can only contract and contraction is a type of movement, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Move. To understand why \\"Move\\" is the best answer choice, it's essential to know the basics of muscles and how they function in our bodies. Muscles are a type of body tissue that has the unique ability to contract, and in doing so, they produce force and movement. There are three types of muscles: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscles are the ones most commonly associated with movement. They are attached to the bones via tendons, and when they contract, they pull on those bones to create motion. This is called a voluntary muscle movement because we can consciously control its action. Smooth muscle is found in various internal structures, such as the walls of blood vessels, the digestive tract, and the respiratory system. The contractions of smooth muscles are involuntary and play a role in processes like digestion, constriction or dilation of blood vessels, and regulating airflow. Cardiac muscle, as the name suggests, is found in the heart. Its contractions are also involuntary, and it is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. So, let's review the other answer choices and why they don't fit: - Immobilize: Muscles don't immobilize; rather, they are responsible for allowing movement. - Expand: While muscles can stretch or elongate, they don't \\"expand\\" in the same sense as, for example, a balloon. - Form bones: Muscles are not involved in the formation of bones. Bones are formed primarily by ossification, which is a process where cartilage is replaced by bone tissue. - Thrust: Although certain muscle movements can be described as a \\"thrusting\\" action, the word \\"thrust\\" is not a comprehensive definition of what muscles do. - Shrink: Muscles can atrophy or \\"shrink\\" if they're not used enough, but this does not define their primary function. - Grow: Muscles can grow in size and strength with regular exercise, but again, this doesn't describe their main function. - Bend: While muscles aid in bending of joints, the word \\"bend\\" is not a comprehensive explanation of how muscles function in the body. Moving, therefore, best describes the primary function of muscles because it encompasses the varied roles that muscles play in generating force and motion throughout the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Who duetted with Robbie Williams on the 2001 number one 'Somethin' Stupid'?","completion":"Nicole Kidman duetted with Robbie Williams on the 2001 number one hit 'Somethin' Stupid.' This song is a cover version of the original track created by Frank Sinatra and his daughter Nancy Sinatra in 1967. The tune was written by C. Carson Parks and became one of the most popular father-daughter duets. In the 2001 iteration, Robbie Williams and Nicole Kidman came together to lend their voices to a fresh interpretation of this classic. At the time, Robbie Williams was already an established British pop star who initially rose to fame as a part of the boy band 'Take That.' In contrast, Nicole Kidman was an acclaimed Australian actress, famous for her roles in popular films, such as 'Moulin Rouge!,' 'Eyes Wide Shut,' and 'The Others.' Despite being known primarily for her acting work, Kidman demonstrated her stunning vocals in her collaboration with Williams. The cover by Williams and Kidman was released on December 10th, 2001, as the lead single from his fourth studio album, \\"Swing When You're Winning.\\" It featured a prominent big-band sound and was produced by Guy Chambers. The music video, directed by Vaughan Arnell, paid homage to the classic Hollywood era, showcasing Kidman and Williams in an intimate setting with an old-school glamour vibe. Upon its release, the duet was well-received and garnered commercial success, reaching the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart and holding the position for several weeks. It was also a notable hit in several other countries, such as Ireland, New Zealand, and parts of Europe. Furthermore, the song not only strengthened Robbie Williams' music career, but it also solidified Nicole Kidman's talents as a singer in the entertainment industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: How did cellular respiration evolve? The evolution of cellular respiration is deeply intertwined with the history of life on Earth. Cellular respiration is a process through which cells convert nutrients into energy (adenosine triphosphate or ATP) and metabolic waste (such as carbon dioxide and water). This energy is essential for cells to perform various functions and maintain their structure. The evolution of cellular respiration can be traced through several stages. 1. Early Earth and the first forms of life: Around 3.5 to 4 billion years ago, the first life forms emerged on Earth. These ancient organisms were anaerobic, meaning they did not require oxygen to survive and generate energy. Instead, they relied on fermentation, a primitive metabolic pathway that produces small amounts of ATP by breaking down organic molecules in the absence of oxygen. 2. The evolution of photosynthesis: About 2.5 billion years ago, a type of bacteria called cyanobacteria evolved the ability to perform photosynthesis. This process involves capturing sunlight and using its energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen. The oxygen produced as a byproduct of photosynthesis was gradually released into the atmosphere and increased the levels of atmospheric oxygen, paving the way for the evolution of aerobic organisms. 3. The evolution of aerobic respiration: As atmospheric oxygen levels increased, some organisms evolved the ability to use oxygen to generate energy through a more efficient process called aerobic respiration, which can produce up to 36 ATP molecules per glucose molecule, compared to just 2 ATP molecules produced through fermentation. Aerobic respiration consists of three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. 4. Endosymbiosis and the development of eukaryotes: Around 2 billion years ago, a crucial event in the evolution of cellular respiration took place. Primitive eukaryotic cells engulfed aerobic bacteria in a process known as endosymbiosis. Over time, these bacteria evolved into cellular organelles called mitochondria, which are responsible for aerobic respiration in eukaryotic cells. This event allowed eukaryotic cells to harness the energy-producing capabilities of their internalized mitochondria, leading to the development of complex multicellular organisms. Question 2: What does cellular respiration break down? Cellular respiration is a process that breaks down nutrients, primarily glucose, to generate energy for cells in the form of ATP. Glucose is a simple sugar molecule that serves as the primary energy source for most organisms. Cellular respiration can also involve the breakdown of other organic compounds, such as fatty acids and amino acids, depending on the organism and its metabolic needs. Cellular respiration consists of three primary stages: 1. Glycolysis: This is the first stage and takes place in the cytoplasm of the cell. During glycolysis, one glucose molecule is broken down into two molecules of pyruvate. This process generates a net gain of 2 ATP molecules and 2 molecules of NADH (an electron carrier). 2. Krebs cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): The second stage of cellular respiration occurs in the mitochondrial matrix. Pyruvate is converted into Acetyl-CoA, which enters the Krebs cycle. During this cycle, the breakdown of Acetyl-CoA produces ATP, NADH, FADH2 (another electron carrier), and carbon dioxide as a waste product. 3. Electron Transport Chain (ETC) and Oxidative Phosphorylation: The third stage takes place in the inner mitochondrial membrane. NADH and FADH2 transfer electrons to the electron transport chain, which results in the pumping of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This creates a concentration gradient, driving the protons back into the matrix through the enzyme ATP synthase. The flow of protons through ATP synthase generates the majority of ATP produced during cellular respiration, with oxygen acting as the final electron acceptor and forming water. To answer your last question, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is about the evolution of cellular respiration, while question 2 is focused on the substrates that cellular respiration breaks down to produce energy."},{"prompt":"Is this product review positive?

News article: 777-year-old tree is a babe in Muir Woods Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle Emily Burns, the Director of Science with, Save the Redwoods League... The tallest redwood tree in Muir Woods — a giant that was assumed to have sprouted up to 1,500 years ago in the Middle Ages — is a measly 777 years old, a puerile sprig in the hallowed halls of old growth, an analysis of tree-ring data has revealed. The study, by a Humboldt State University scientist, is the first definitive determination of the age of trees in Muir Woods. The findings by Allyson Carroll, a tree-ring specialist, mean that a 249-foot-tall coast redwood known by the lackluster name of Tree 76 sprouted seven centuries later than originally believed, at the beginning of the Medieval Inquisition in the early 13th century. The new birth date is curiously apropos since the tree is in a place called Cathedral Grove, presumably acceptable under the Inquisition, which was characterized by an effort by the Catholic Church to suppress heresy. The date nevertheless means the oldest and biggest tree that researchers could find in the Bay Area’s most famous redwood forest is a babe in the woods compared with the giant old-growth trees farther north. Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle A cross second taken from the \\"Vortex\\" tree which fell in June of... “It’s one of the largest redwoods in Muir Woods, so it probably represents one of the oldest,” said Emily Burns, science director for San Francisco’s Save the Redwoods League, which is documenting the age, size, health and tree-ring history of California's last remaining old-growth redwood groves as part a statewide project known as the Redwoods and Climate Change Initiative. Carroll, a biologist at Humboldt State and a consultant for the League, came up with 777 years by comparing the tree rings from Tree 76 to a database of core samples taken from redwoods across California, including from Samuel P. Taylor State Park. Specific dates can be fleshed out by comparing the size and thickness of the tree rings, which are larger during wet years and smaller during dry years. The samples were taken in Cathedral Grove in March 2014. Although that was one of dozens of redwood study plots in California, the research represented the first significant scientific study of the tree canopy at Muir Woods. The plan over time is to identify tree-ring patterns, or markers, that are consistent throughout the coast redwood range and figure out how the trees react to climate change. As of now, the collective redwood tree-ring record in California can reliably be traced back to the year 328, revealing drought years and other major weather events, Carroll said. Scientists must have data from multiple trees in different locations to compare traits, which is why the reliable record goes back only 1,687 years. However, individual trees have been found that are older. Photo: Michael Macor, The Chronicle A cluster of Redwoods at the Muir Woods National Monument, Calif.... Growth accelerating Dendrochronology, as tree-ring science is called, was used to document a coast redwood in Redwood National and State Parks, near Crescent City, that is 2,520 years old. The oldest giant sequoia, a redwood species that grows in the Sierra, is 3,240 years old, according to the record. Scientists have found that the growth trend of redwoods has accelerated over the past few decades, and they have pinpointed 1580 and 1739 as particularly parched years in California. The tree-ring record has also been used in cultural history projects. Carroll all but confirmed that a wood remnant at Trinidad Head, north of Arcata, was part of a cross erected by the Spanish in 1775. The redwood altar at Grace Cathedral in San Francisco came from the Humboldt area, but there wasn’t enough information to pinpoint the age of the tree it came from or the date it was cut, she reported. Dendrochronologists are now trying to determine the age of the old adobe found at the historic Presidio Officers' Club by dating its redwood support beams. The adobe, hidden for years under a covering of wood planks and plaster, is believed to be the last remnant of the original Spanish fort El Presidio de San Francisco, established in 1776. Until now, nobody had ever definitively calculated the age of the trees in Muir Woods, but scientists have suggested that the tallest trees were probably 1,200 to 1,500 years old. Besides Tree 76, Carroll calculated the ages of two fallen redwoods in Muir Woods, further bolstering the tree ring record in the grove. Catastrophe centuries ago The Vortex Tree, which fell in 2011, was 693 years old, according to her report published in April. The Solstice Tree, which fell in 2012, was 536 years old, she concluded. Burns said the relative youth of the three trees means the grove itself is probably younger than was believed. She suggested a fire, flood or some other catastrophe might have struck the area many centuries ago, forcing the entire forest to regenerate itself from scratch. “We know redwoods can get older than this, and some redwoods in the Bay Area were logged. But we don't see any evidence of logging,” she said. “That leads me to believe that there may have been some sort of disturbance.” Peter Fimrite is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Premise: An innkeeper who lost his hearing at Stalingrad and communicates by writing answers Siegelbaum's saying, Hitler deceived the world: Hypothesis: An innkeeper who definitely still has his hearing at Stalingrad and communicates by writing answers Siegelbaum's saying, Hitler deceived the world: Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise provided is as follows: An innkeeper who lost his hearing at Stalingrad and communicates by writing answers Siegelbaum's saying, \\"Hitler deceived the world.\\" The hypothesis provided is: An innkeeper who definitely still has his hearing at Stalingrad and communicates by writing answers Siegelbaum's saying, \\"Hitler deceived the world.\\" The question being asked is whether the premise entails the hypothesis. In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to first understand the concept of entailment. In philosophical terms, entailment is a relation between premises and conclusions within an argument. If the premises of an argument entail the conclusion, then it means that if the premises are true, the conclusion must also be true. In other words, it would be logically impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false simultaneously. With that understanding, let's examine the premise and hypothesis and compare their components. 1. Innkeeper: Both the premise and hypothesis refer to an innkeeper, so they share this element in common. 2. Hearing status: The premise suggests that the innkeeper lost his hearing at Stalingrad, while the hypothesis states that the innkeeper still has his hearing at Stalingrad. This is a clear contradiction between the two, as it is impossible for the innkeeper to have both lost and retained his hearing. An innkeeper cannot simultaneously lose and keep their hearing, so the hearing status in the two cases does not show entailment. 3. Communication method: In both the premise and hypothesis, it is mentioned that the innkeeper communicates by writing. This element is consistent in both statements. 4. Siegelbaum's saying: Both premise and hypothesis involve a connection with Siegelbaum's saying, \\"Hitler deceived the world.\\" This element is also consistent in both statements. To summarize, the elements of being an innkeeper, the communication method, and the context of Siegelbaum's saying are consistent between the premise and hypothesis. However, the contradiction in the hearing status of the innkeeper prevents the entailment between the premise and hypothesis. As previously mentioned, for entailment to exist, the truth of the premise must necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, the contradictory points in the hearing status of the innkeeper make it impossible for the premise and hypothesis to both be true simultaneously. Thus, it can be concluded that the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Sample B is from the Atacama Desert, where they get one of the lowest rainfall in the world. He needs to determine the properties of these samples. But I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. What is an answer for this question: Would sample B rocks have more or less chemical reactions? A:","completion":"Based on the background information provided, sample B, which is from the Atacama Desert with one of the lowest rainfalls in the world, would have less chemical reactions in comparison to sample A from the Amazon Rainforest. The reason for this is that rainfall plays a significant role in promoting chemical reactions in the soil. Higher rainfall leads to more rainwater interacting with and passing through the soil, reacting chemically with the particles. Because the Atacama Desert has much lower rainfall, there will be less rainwater available to react with the soil particles, resulting in fewer chemical reactions. Additionally, high rainfall can carry material away and expose new surfaces, which further increases the rate of weathering. In the case of sample B, with lower rainfall, there will be less material carried away and fewer new surfaces exposed, which also contributes to a reduced rate of chemical reactions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish Free State was created as a result of the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty, which officially put an end to the Irish War of Independence. The treaty established the Irish Free State as a self-governing dominion within the British Commonwealth, granting it the right to have its own parliament, government, and civil service. Importantly, Ireland was also allowed to have an independent army, though the British Crown retained naval bases in specific locations. The Irish Free State marked a significant milestone in Ireland's quest for independence. It granted a considerable degree of autonomy to the Irish people, making its existence far too important to be put to rest during the very year of its foundation. Instead, the Irish Free State continued to exist until 1937 when the state was succeeded by a new political entity, Ireland (Éire), under a new constitution. In conclusion, the premise that \\"In 1922, the new Irish Free State was born\\" does not entail or support the hypothesis \\"In 1922, the Irish Free State was put to rest for the final time.\\" Thus, the correct answer is [III] no, as the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922 contradicts the notion that it was put to rest in the same year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack. - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society. - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known. - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability. - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - The Focke - Wulf Project II was a design study for a single seat jet fighter carried out in Germany during World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\" - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: If a blue tit has an ultraviolet patch on it's head, then what is it? Context: Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.

During childhood and his teens, he spent at least one month each year with his grandparents in Vega Alta, Puerto Rico. He is of mostly Puerto Rican descent. In 2002, Miranda and John Buffalo Mailer worked with director Thomas Kail to revise In the Heights. Book writer Quiara Alegria Hudes joined the team in 2004. After success off-Broadway, the musical went to Broadway, opening in March 2008. It was nominated for 13 Tony Awards, winning four, including Best Musical and Best Original Score. It also won the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. Miranda's performance in the leading role of Usnavi earned him a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical. Miranda left the cast of the Broadway production on February 15, 2009. Miranda reprised the role when the national tour of In the Heights played in Los Angeles from June 23 to July 25, 2010. He again joined the tour in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

What exploded when?","completion":"The sentence \\"What exploded when?\\" appears to be linguistically acceptable, but it is quite minimalistic and may benefit from further elaboration for clearer communication. To assess its linguistic acceptability, we can examine its syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 1. Syntax: From a syntactic perspective, the sentence has a valid construction that consists of two main components: the interrogative pronoun \\"what\\" and the subject \\"exploded.\\" These two parts are necessary for forming a basic question structure in English. The word \\"when\\" adds a time-related aspect to the question, seeking information about the timing of the event. Overall, the sentence follows the typical word order for asking a question in English: interrogative pronoun + subject + verb + additional information (in this case, \\"When?\\"). 2. Semantics: Semantically, the sentence is clear and comprehensible. The question asks for specifics regarding an object or event that exploded and the time at which it occurred. There is no ambiguous vocabulary or sense of confusion in interpreting the question as long as the context is known. However, it might raise further questions, such as the nature of the explosion, location, or consequences. The brevity of the sentence could be seen as somewhat ambiguous because the context is not clearly established, making it harder to determine exactly what the speaker is asking for. 3. Pragmatics: In terms of pragmatics, the sentence can be appropriate in certain situations where the context is well understood. For example, in a conversation about recent incidents or experiments involving explosions, asking \\"What exploded when?\\" would be accepted as a relevant and understandable question. In these situations, the conversation partners may implicitly understand the objects or events being discussed, so the minimalistic nature of the question becomes less of an issue. Nonetheless, in most cases, a more elaborate sentence could provide additional context and clarity for the listener. For instance, \\"What was the cause of the explosion that occurred this morning?\\" or \\"Which object exploded during the experiment, and at what time?\\" would ensure that the question is more clearly defined and provide better context for the listener to respond adequately. Furthermore, if listeners are unfamiliar with the context or the events being discussed, the original sentence could be considered too vague, and they might struggle to provide a relevant answer. In conclusion, the sentence \\"What exploded when?\\" is linguistically acceptable in terms of syntax and semantics, but its minimalistic nature might limit its effectiveness in conveying a clear and complete question in certain situations. Providing more context or additional information may be helpful to ensure that the listener understands and responds accurately to the question being asked."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

More men are getting Botox than ever before, but unlike their female counterparts, the goal is not to eliminate all of their wrinkles. New York City-based plastic surgeon Dr Norman Rowe said male professionals are asking for subtle changes in their appearance. He's dubbed the look the 'Wall Street Wrinkle' because a large amount of the men requesting the tweaks are in finance. 'They really want to avoid looking overdone,' he told ABC News, explaining that many men view their wrinkles as a 'badge of honor'. Scroll down for video. Best shot: New York-based plastic surgeon Dr Norman Rowe can be seen giving his patient Joseph Mancuso Botox injections to subtly reduce the appearance of his crow's feet, while keeping the rest of his wrinkles. He noted: 'I don't necessarily see that as much in females. They want complete rejuvenation.' According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, nearly 400,000 US males got Botox injections in 2013, which is a 310 percent increase since 2003. Dr Rowe's patient Joseph Mancuso was filmed getting his first Botox injections to reduce the appearance of his crow's feet. 'I don't want it took like as if I have a very stiff face,' he told the outlet. 'I just want to look natural.' Tiny tweaks: This photo shows Mr Mancuso before Dr Rowe administered his Botox injections. New and improved: Mr Mancuso, who said he wanted to look natural, is thrilled by the results seen in this after photo. Since men aren't looking to get rid of all of their wrinkles, Dr Rowe said the procedure is relatively painless because of the reduction in injections. 'Sure you can grow old gracefully,' he said. 'But what's gracefully? A few grey hairs and wrinkles are good. The men, they just want to look refreshed.' Men are also getting Botox injections in their palms and under their arms so they can avoid sweaty handshakes and perspiring through their shirts. Botox injections can cost patients 300 or more and the effects last four to six months after treatment. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

Russia uses Iranian air base to conduct strikes in Syria The Russian Defense Ministry has said long-range Russian TU-22M3 bombers based in Iran have struck a number of targets inside Syria. (Reuters) ISTANBUL — Russian bombers flying from an Iranian air base struck rebel targets across Syria on Tuesday, Russian and Iranian officials said, dramatically underscoring the two countries’ growing military ties and highlighting Russia's ambitions for greater influence in a turbulent Middle East. The long-range Tu-22 bombers took off from a base near Hamadan in western Iran and launched raids in Syria's Aleppo, Deir al-Zour and Idlib provinces, the Russian Defense Ministry said in a statement Tuesday. Both countries are staunch allies of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, and the flights marked the first time Russia has launched strikes from Iranian territory. Iran has long banned foreign militaries from establishing bases on its soil. But the raids on Tuesday appeared to signal a budding alliance that would expand Russia's military footprint in the region. Iran and Russia “enjoy strategic cooperation in the fight against terrorism in Syria, and share their facilities and capacities to this end,” Iran’s National Security Council chief, Ali Samkhani, said Tuesday, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA). [Syrian extremist group splits from al-Qaeda and changes its name] Shiite-led Iran has sent thousands of troops and fighters, including members of its Revolutionary Guard Corps, to Syria to bolster Assad — who is from the minority Alawite sect — against largely Sunni rebels. For Tehran, losing a longtime ally to a majority-Sunni uprising would undermine its own influence in the region. Iranian proxies such as Lebanon's Hezbollah and an array of Shiite Iraqi militias have also fought for the Syrian regime. And last year, Russia intervened as well, committing tanks, artillery and combat aircraft to the fight. It also built a new air base in Latakia province in the Alawite heartland. But until now, Russia's long-range bombers, which require longer airstrips, had to be launched from Russian territory more than 1,200 miles away. Now, those same bombers need to fly only about 400 miles from Iran to Syria, Iran's Fars News Agency reported Tuesday. The shorter distance will allow Russia to intensify its air campaign against rebel-held areas. Both government troops and opposition fighters are now locked in a battle for the strategic Syrian city of Aleppo, where residents face a growing humanitarian crisis. Russia has carried out strikes in support of government troops there, activists say. [Battle for Aleppo may be the most crucial in Syria’s civil war] Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday that its long-range bombers struck targets linked to the Islamic State and Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, a group that formally split from al-Qaeda last month and changed its name from Jabhat al-Nusra. The strikes destroyed five major ammunition depots, training camps and three command posts, the ministry said. But rights groups have criticized both Russia and the Syrian regime for repeated strikes on civilian targets, including homes, schools and hospitals. Russian and Syrian officials have denied those reports. On Tuesday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch said Syrian and Russian troops have used banned incendiary weapons in civilian areas. \\"These weapons inflict horrible injuries and excruciating pain,\\" Steve Goose, arms director at HRW, said in a statement. “The disgraceful incendiary weapon attacks in Syria show an abject failure to adhere to international law.\\" Russia's clout, however, will probably continue to rise in the region, analysts said. Its military presence in Iran bolsters Russia's growing image as a central player in the Middle East, challenging American supremacy. [Obama’s overture to Russia on Syria] Iran itself is deeply involved in conflicts in Yemen and Iraq, where it holds particular influence. Iran was quick to provide military supplies to the Shiite-led government in Baghdad as Islamic State militants made their land grab in the summer of 2014, pushing toward the capital. In recent years, Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani, commander of the Revolutionary Guard Corps’ elite Quds Force, has made regular appearances on the battlefield in both Iraq and Syria, becoming the public face of Iran’s growing military power. Moscow’s alliance with Iran might also allow Russia to make further inroads into both countries. Last year, Russia and Iran signed a military cooperation deal focused on training and fighting terrorism. In May, Russia made the long-delayed delivery of the advanced S-300 air-defense missile system, which was ordered by Iran in 2007 amid controversy over its nuclear program. With the signing of a nuclear deal last year between Iran and six world powers, the sale went forward, and ties between Russia and Iran have improved markedly. On Sunday, Russian President Vladimir Putin’s top Middle East envoy arrived in Tehran to discuss bilateral relations. Russia has also requested the use of Iranian airspace to fire cruise missiles at rebel targets in Syria.

Dad wasn't around, so I never knew him well. He killed himself when I was three years old, leaving mom with the job of raising nine kids. She was a very hard worker, and in order to make ends meet, she hardly ever rested. With my mom as my example, I learned that hard work is the best way to get what you want. Even as a little boy, I knew I was going to be successful. Regardless of what I chose, I wanted to make my brothers, sisters and mom proud of me--not only by being successful in what I chose to do, but also as a person who could be looked up to for the right reasons. Surprising as it might seem, basketball wasn't in my plans. One day, my mom cut a rim off an old water barrel and then held it up for me to throw an old rubber ball through. By junior high, I started playing basketball on a team. I loved to compete. For me, it paid off. I always put the effort in, every day. I am grateful for the life I've enjoyed as a basketball star. Basketball is not life. It can be exciting. But the most important thing about basketball is that it gives me a way to do good things for others as I move through this journey called life.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region? In 1684, a council led by Enrique Enríquez de Guzmán, the governor of Guatemala, decided on the reduction of San Mateo Ixtatán and nearby Santa Eulalia, both within the colonial administrative district of the Corregimiento of Huehuetenango.On 29 January 1686, Captain Melchor Rodríguez Mazariegos, acting under orders from the governor, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán, where he recruited indigenous warriors from the nearby villages, 61 from San Mateo itself. It was believed by the Spanish colonial authorities that the inhabitants of San Mateo Ixtatán were friendly towards the still unconquered and fiercely hostile inhabitants of the Lacandon region, which included parts of what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas and the western part of the Petén Basin. To prevent news of the Spanish advance reaching the inhabitants of the Lacandon area, the governor ordered the capture of three of San Mateo's community leaders, named as Cristóbal Domingo, Alonso Delgado and Gaspar Jorge, and had them sent under guard to be imprisoned in Huehuetenango. The governor himself arrived in San Mateo Ixtatán on 3 February, where Captain Rodríguez Mazariegos was already awaiting him. The governor ordered the captain to remain in the village and use it as a base of operations for penetrating the Lacandon region. The Spanish missionaries Fray de Rivas and Fray Pedro de la Concepción also remained in the town. Governor Enriquez de Guzmán subsequently left San Mateo Ixtatán for Comitán in Chiapas, to enter the Lacandon region via Ocosingo.In 1695, a three-way invasion of the Lacandon was launched simultaneously from San Mateo Ixtatán, Cobán and Ocosingo. Captain Rodriguez Mazariegos, accompanied by Fray de Rivas and 6 other missionaries together with 50 Spanish soldiers, left Huehuetenango for San Mateo Ixtatán.

Objective: To evenly and cleanly cut fabric and ensure no ragged, frayed ends Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Choose from: A). use a pair of fabric shears to cut your material. Do not worry about using your fabric scissors to cut anything else, especially paper, as this won't blunt the sharp blades over time.; B). use a pair of fabric shears to cut your material. Do not use your fabric scissors to cut anything else, especially paper, as this will blunt the sharp blades over time.;","completion":"B). Use a pair of fabric shears to cut your material. Do not use your fabric scissors to cut anything else, especially paper, as this will blunt the sharp blades over time. To provide a detailed explanation, let's first understand the importance of fabric cutting and the reasoning for choosing option B. When working with fabric, it is crucial to have clean, precise cuts to ensure the quality of the finished product. Ragged or frayed edges can compromise the overall quality, as well as the appearance, of the final piece. In addition, uneven cuts can create problems when sewing and matching seams. Therefore, using the proper tools is essential for achieving the desired result. Fabric shears or fabric scissors are specialty tools designed specifically for cutting fabric. Fabric shears differ from regular scissors in several ways: 1. Sharpness: Fabric shears are generally made from higher quality materials, such as stainless steel, and are specifically designed to be extra sharp to cut through fabric easily and cleanly. This sharpness allows them to slice through fabric with minimal resistance and without causing frayed or ragged edges. 2. Blade angle: The blades of fabric shears are typically angled, which allows for a smoother, more accurate cut. This design also makes it possible to cut along the fabric's surface more easily, preventing bunching or pulling. 3. Handle design: The handles on fabric shears are often shaped to provide a more comfortable grip, which is crucial when cutting large pieces of fabric or making intricate cuts. The design typically includes a larger handle for your fingers and a smaller one for your thumb, allowing for greater control and precision. The reasoning behind option B, which advises against using fabric scissors to cut anything else, especially paper, is based on several factors: 1. Different materials: Paper and other materials have different compositions and densities compared to fabric, which can cause the shears' blades to become dull or damaged over time. 2. Conserving sharpness: Cutting paper can cause debris and dullness to build up on the blades, which can affect their performance when cutting fabric. Keeping fabric shears exclusively for cutting fabric ensures that the blades remain sharp and free from wear and tear. 3. Wear and tear: Cutting different materials puts stress on the shears and can reduce the life of the tool. Using designated scissors for each material will keep each tool in optimal condition and prolong their lifespan. In conclusion, option B is the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning, as it emphasizes the importance of using fabric shears only for cutting fabric. This practice helps maintain the sharpness, precision, and longevity of the shears, which in turn leads to clean, even cuts and a higher quality finished product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Almost every child in big cities has the chance to go to school. Nine years' studying helps children to prepare for their future lives. In fact, many students can study for more than nine years. Not all children are so lucky. There is a girl called Xiao Fang. She is eight years old and lives in a small village in Guangxi. When she was younger, she wanted to go to school, but she could not because her family was too poor. The schools were too expensive, so her parents kept her at home. Instead of studying, Xiao Fang worked in the fields with her parents. Then Project Hope heard about Xiao Fang. It agreed to help Xiao Fang to go to school. Her wish came true, and now she is studying in a school. Unluckily, there are many thousands of children who can not go to school. You can help these children. Project Hope also helps to repair school buildings. All this good work costs money. Project Hope needs your help. If you give Project Hope Y=300, we can pay for one child to go to school for a whole year. With more money, Project Hope can build new schools. The money buys good desks, chairs, blackboards and books. To help us is to help Xiao Fang and many other children to have a good start in life. Answer:","completion":"Question: Which of the following statements is true according to the article? A) Every child has an equal opportunity of education due to general affordability, regardless of where they live. B) Xiao Fang's initial inability to attend school was due to her family's financial constraints and the costly nature of education in her locality. C) Project Hope only provides financial support to children for their education and does not get involved in repairing school infrastructures. D) By donating Y=300 to Project Hope, one can sponsor the construction of a new school. Answer: B) Xiao Fang's initial inability to attend school was due to her family's financial constraints and the costly nature of education in her locality. Explanation: The article talks about the contrast in access to education between children living in big cities and those from poorer, rural areas, like Xiao Fang. Xiao Fang could not attend school due to financial constraints and expensive schooling in her area. This information disproves option A that suggests uniform affordability of education for all children. Project Hope's involvement in Xiao Fang's life allowed her to go to school indicating their active role in assisting less fortunate children with their education. However, their involvement goes beyond providing financial aid for education to children, as they also aid in repairing school buildings according to the article. Therefore, option C is invalid. While the article does suggest that more funding could allow Project Hope to build new schools, it specifically states that a donation of Y=300 would support one child's education for a year, thereby refuting option D. Hence, the only correct statement is option B, which correctly summarizes Xiao Fang's initial situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: Remy asked Robin's husband if their husband could go to the game. Given the question \\"How would Remy feel afterwards?\\", is \\"Hopeful Robin plays in the game\\" a valid answer? A:","completion":"Before we generate a detailed and long answer, we should first understand the situation. Remy asks Robin's husband if their husband could go to the game. Based on the given information, it is unclear whether Remy is referring to Robin's husband's attendance or if the wording might suggest a typo, and Remy is asking about Robin going to the game. Also, it is not clear which type of game this conversation is referring to. Additionally, we do not have any information about Remy's relationship with Robin or their husband. Because of this ambiguity, we may need to consider different aspects and scenarios to analyze whether \\"Hopeful Robin plays in the game\\" would be a valid answer to the question, \\"How would Remy feel afterwards?\\". Scenario 1: Remy is asking about Robin's husband's attendance at the game. In this scenario, the question Remy asks concerns Robin's husband attending the game, not Robin. Therefore, the response \\"Hopeful Robin plays in the game\\" does not seem relevant since it is about Robin and not Robin's husband. Remy's feelings after asking the question would more likely be related to hoping for an affirmative response for Robin's husband to attend the game. This could be because Remy feels excited about watching the game together, or Remy wants the company and support of Robin's husband at the game. In this case, a more appropriate answer might be something like \\"Hopeful that Robin's husband can join them at the game.\\" Scenario 2: Remy is asking about Robin's attendance at the game. In this scenario, Remy is asking if Robin could go to the game, which means that Robin's involvement in the game is somehow important to Remy. It could be that Robin is a player, a supporter, a coach, or a spectator. Based on this information, the response \\"Hopeful Robin plays in the game\\" can be considered a valid answer if Robin’s role in the game is, in fact, as a player. In this situation, Remy would likely feel a mix of emotions after asking the question. For example, Remy could feel hopeful that Robin can participate or even excitement about the prospect that Robin could join. Remy's emotions could also stem from concern for Robin if their attendance at the game affects their personal life, career, or health. Thus, Remy's emotions after asking the question will largely depend on the context and relationship between Remy and Robin. In conclusion, determining whether \\"Hopeful Robin plays in the game\\" is a valid answer to \\"How would Remy feel afterwards?\\" depends on understanding the context and relationships between the characters involved. Without that information, it is difficult to definitively say whether that response is valid. However, we can break down different scenarios and discuss the possible emotions Remy might experience after asking the question, and how the given response may or may not be applicable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Oprah Winfrey endorses the new Surface tablet in a gushy tweet -- sent from an iPad. Amused tech bloggers call the Twitter message a marketing gaffe. Others say it doesn't necessarily mean she doesn't use both tablets. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Oprah Winfrey's Surface Tablet Endorsement Goes Awry on Twitter Step 1: Introduce the topic In this article, we discuss how Oprah Winfrey, the famous American television personality, endorsed Microsoft's Surface tablet in a tweet but inadvertently fueled controversy by sending the message from an iPad. Step 2: Explain the context Oprah Winfrey, who is known for her influential endorsements, has been an avid supporter of the new Surface tablet by Microsoft. The tech industry pays special attention to celebrities' endorsements as they can significantly impact the product's popularity and sales. Step 3: Describe the endorsement tweet Recently, Oprah took to Twitter to express her admiration for the Surface tablet, tweeting with gushing excitement: \\"I love the new Surface tablet by Microsoft! It's the perfect combination of a laptop and a tablet, making it ideal for both work and play. Highly recommend it! #BestGiftEver\\". Step 4: Mention the controversy In an ironic twist, tech bloggers and social media users quickly pointed out that Oprah's enthusiastic endorsement was sent from her iPad instead of the Surface tablet. This led to widespread amusement and criticism, with many calling it a marketing gaffe. Step 5: Present the possible explanations While the incident raised eyebrows, some observers have brought forth the possibility that Oprah Winfrey uses both the Surface tablet and the iPad, so her tweet shouldn't necessarily discredit her endorsement. Celebrities are known to have multiple devices for different purposes, and it's plausible that Oprah could be using the Surface tablet for specific tasks and the iPad for others. Step 6: Analyze the impact The Twitter mishap sparked various debates on social media, with some questioning the credibility of the endorsement while others pointing out that it might be an honest mistake. The impact it had on the Surface tablet's reputation is hard to measure, but it spurred conversations about the competition between Microsoft's Surface tablet and Apple's iPad. Step 7: Offer a conclusion Oprah Winfrey's Surface tablet endorsement, although amusing to many, serves as a reminder that in the age of social media, even the smallest details can impact a product's public image and perception. In conclusion, Oprah Winfrey's endorsement of the Surface tablet resulted in debate and amusement, as the tweet was sent from an iPad. Whether this mishap would affect the Surface tablet's sales or credibility remains to be seen. However, it highlights the importance of carefully considering all aspects of social media promotions, especially when it comes to highly influential celebrities like Oprah Winfrey."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Arsenal's parent company, Arsenal Holdings plc, operates as a non-quoted public limited company, whose ownership is considerably different from that of other football clubs. Only 62,217 shares in Arsenal have been issued, and they are not traded on a public exchange such as the FTSE or AIM; instead, they are traded relatively infrequently on the ICAP Securities and Derivatives Exchange, a specialist market. On 10 March 2016, a single share in Arsenal had a mid price of £15,670, which sets the club's market capitalisation value at approximately £975m. Most football clubs aren't listed on an exchange, which makes direct comparisons of their values difficult. Business magazine Forbes valued Arsenal as a whole at 1.3 billion in 2015. Consultants Brand Finance valued the club's brand and intangible assets at 703m in 2015, and consider Arsenal an AAA global brand.

Hassan spots the burrow tunneling under the entrance of the cave and attempts to chase out the intruders, but has trouble remembering the command to open the door.

Furthermore, the mention of \\"Experimental Farm\\" in its name suggests a connection to agricultural research or educational activities that may have taken place or are still ongoing within the facility. This makes it plausible for the Blandy Experimental Farm Historic District to be categorized as an educational institution as well, given its potential role in research, learning, and the dissemination of knowledge related to agriculture, horticulture, or other related fields."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Silver makes a really lovely bell-like ringing sound when it is tapped on, particularly when it is tapped on with another form of metal. If you want to try this out before tapping on your questionable silver, find a United States quarter made before 1965. These were made of 90% silver while US quarters made later than 1964 are made of a copper-nickel alloy. The older quarter will give a high-pitched, clear ringing tone, while the newer quarters will give a dull thump of a sound. If it makes a sound like a bell ringing, you have a real silver coin in your hand. If it's dull, the silver is, most likely, mixed with other metals.","completion":"This article discusses that tapping silver produces a bell-like ringing sound, particularly when tapped with another metal.

Question 2: Is it illegal for a 16 year old boy to have sex with an over 18 year old girl? Pick from: 1. no; 2. yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, I will consider legal age and consent, as these factors impact the legality of such scenarios. Step 1: Identify age of consent In most jurisdictions, the age of consent ranges from 16 to 18 years old. However, specific laws may vary and it is essential to understand local regulations. Step 2: Determine the participants' ages For Question 1, the parties involved are a 15-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl. For Question 2, the parties involved are a 16-year-old boy and an over 18-year-old girl. Step 3: Evaluate the age difference and the age of consent When determining whether a sexual relationship between individuals with an age difference is legal, one must consider the age of consent. If one individual is below the local age of consent and the other is over the age of consent, then the relationship may be deemed illegal, and the older individual may be held liable. However, some jurisdictions have close-in-age exemptions (also known as \\"Romeo and Juliet laws\\"), which could affect the legal outcome in these cases. Now let's analyze the two questions based on the steps above: Question 1: Can a 15-year-old boy and an 18-year-old girl have sex? This depends on the age of consent in the specific jurisdiction. If the age of consent is 16 or older, this relationship would likely be considered illegal as the boy is under the age of consent. For example, in many parts of the United States, the age of consent is 16, meaning this particular relationship would not be legal in those areas. Providing a straightforward answer for this question without knowing the location's age of consent is difficult. Question 2: Is it illegal for a 16-year-old boy to have sex with an over 18-year-old girl? This question, again, depends on the specific jurisdiction's age of consent. If the age of consent is 16 or younger, then this relationship would likely be legal, as the boy is at or above the age of consent. However, some jurisdictions may have additional stipulations or close-in-age exemptions, which could potentially affect the legality of the relationship. Based on the analysis in Steps 1-3, we cannot guarantee that the answers to these two questions would be the same. The legality of the relationships in both questions may vary depending on the age of consent and other relevant laws in the specific jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The only discernible difference between them is that the latter is positioned five feet to the left of the first. The example is only possible if such a thing as absolute space exists. Such a situation, however, is not possible, according to Leibniz, for if it were, a universe's position in absolute space would have no sufficient reason, as it might very well have been anywhere else.

Question: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. Pat has 2 acres of land next to Tim's property. Tim's land is of similar size. The clay soil on Tim's property is very alkaline, so he had to amend it with aluminum salts to make it more acidic in order to grow crops.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Play is the basic business of childhood, and more and more in recent years research has shown the great importance of play in the development of a human being.From earliest infancy , every child needs opportunity and the right material for play, and the main tools of play are toys.The main function of toys is to suggest, encourage and assist play.To succeed in this, they must be good toys, which children will play with often, and will come back to again and again.Therefore, it is important to choose suitable toys for different stages of a child's development. In recent years research on infant development has shown that the standard a child is likely to reach, within the range of his inherited abilities, is largely determined in the first three years of his life.So a baby's ability to benefit from the right play materials should not be underestimated.A baby who is encouraged, talked to and shown things and played with, has the best chance of growing up successfully. The next stage, from three to five years old, curiosity knows no bounds.Every type of suitable toy should be made available to the child, for trying out, experimenting and learning, for discovering his own particular ability. Bricks and jigsaws and construction toys; painting, scribbling and making things; sand and water play; toys for imaginative and pretending play; the first social games for learning to play and get on with others. By the third stage of play development--from five to seven or eight years old-- the child is at school.But for a few more years play is still the best way of learning, at home or at school.It is easier to see which type of toys the child most enjoys. Until the age of seven or eight, play and work mean much the same to a child.But once reading has been mastered, then books and school become the main source of learning.Toys are still interesting and valuable, which lead up to new hobbies, but their significance has changed --to a child of nine or ten years old, toys and games mean, as to adults, relaxation and fun. Answer:","completion":"Which of the following statements best describes the role of toys in a child's development according to the article? A. Toys are only meant for entertainment and have no impact on a child's development. B. Toys have a critical role in suggesting, encouraging, and assisting play, and suitable toys should be chosen for different stages of a child's development. C. Toys are important only for infants and lose their significance once a child starts school. D.

Coffee didn't take off until the l400s when people figured out they could roast its seeds.By the l500s,the drink had spread to coffeehouses across the Arab world.Within another l50 years,it took Europe by storm. \\"It actually had a major impact on the rise of business,\\" historian Mark Pendergrast says.Coffeehouses became a spot not just to enjoy a cup but to exchange ideas.The insurer Lloyd's of London was founded hundreds of years ago in one of London's 2,000 coffeehouses.Literature,newspapers and even the works of great composers like Bach and Beethoven were also spawned in coffeehouses. It is often said that after the Boston Tea Party of l773,when American colonists attacked British tea ships and threw boxes of tea into the harbor,Americans universally switched over to drinking coffee.In a letter John Adams wrote to his wife,Abigail,the Founding Father claims his love of tea but says he will have to learn to embrace coffee instead,because drinking tea had become a symbol of not loving the country. For all the upsides coffee has brought the modern world,it also led to its fair share of downsides,too.Europeans carried coffee with them as they colonized various parts of the world,and this frequently meant they enslaved people in order to grow it.In Brazil -- where slavery was legal until l888 -- coffee plantations would use slash-and-burn agriculture,tearing down rain forests and planting coffee trees.Once the soil had been exhausted,growers would move on to another place. And yet,coffee,as Pendergrast says,\\"had a very good impact in many ways on our civilization,even though it was,for a long time,grown by slaves.\\" Question: Why did people enjoy going to coffeehouses?

UEFA gave special dispensation for Liverpool to enter the Champions League, giving England five qualifiers. UEFA subsequently ruled that the defending champions qualify for the competition the following year regardless of their domestic league placing. However, for those leagues with four entrants in the Champions League, this meant that if the Champions League winner finished outside the top four in its domestic league, it would qualify at the expense of the fourth-placed team in the league. No association can have more than four entrants in the Champions League.

However, it received poor reviews and the Broadway run, scheduled for the following April, was cancelled. A reworked and more successful West End production opened at the Aldwych Theatre on July 1, 1998. In addition to a full-length cast album for the London production, an album was released of well-known performers singing pop versions of the songs from the show. This album was produced by Steinman, as usual with Steven Rinkoff. Those performers include Tom Jones, Tina Arena, Boyzone, Elaine Paige, Donny Osmond, The Everly Brothers, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Sounds of Blackness, Bonnie Tyler, Michael Ball, and Lottie Mayor. One track, \\"No Matter What\\" performed by Boyzone, reached the peak position on the pop charts in many countries. The same track appeared on a Boyzone album and their greatest hits album.

Novak Djokovic retained his Miami Masters 1000 title with an emphatic 6-1 7-6 final victory over Britain's Andy Murray Sunday. The World No.1 was at his relentless best to avoid a repeat of his defeat to Murray in Dubai last month. The pair had also played an epic semifinal in the Australian Open at the start of the year, Djokovic going on to take the opening grand slam of the season. This was the Serbian's first title since his Melbourne heroics and his third on the hard courts of Crandon Park. World No.4 Murray was always on the back foot after losing the opening set, being broken twice and unable to make an impression on the rock solid Djokovic service. Murray fought hard in the second set, clinging on to his own service despite being taken to deuce four times. Djokovic gained the early mini-break in the tiebreak and always kept his nose in front. Murray closed to 3-2 after winning a 25-shot rally with a backhand sliced drop shot, but he double faulted on the next point and Djokovic took full advantage. He closed out the tiebreak and the match as Murray hit long, but admitted after his win that the latter stages of the second set were crucial. \\"Andy was very close to winning the second set.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information: - The abdomen (less formally called the belly, stomach, tummy or midriff) constitutes the part of the body between the thorax (chest) and pelvis, in humans and in other vertebrates. The region occupied by the abdomen is termed the abdominal cavity. In arthropods it is the posterior tagma of the body; it follows the thorax or cephalothorax. The abdomen stretches from the thorax at the thoracic diaphragm to the pelvis at the pelvic brim. The pelvic brim stretches from the lumbosacral joint (the intervertebral disc between L5 and S1) to the pubic symphysis and is the edge of the pelvic inlet. The space above this inlet and under the thoracic diaphragm is termed the abdominal cavity. The boundary of the abdominal cavity is the abdominal wall in the front and the peritoneal surface at the rear. - Japyx is a genus of diplurans belonging to the family Japygidae . These eyeless , predatory hexapods largely shun direct sunlight , remaining under stones and among detritus , where they use pincer - like cerci to catch their tiny prey . - Earwigs make up the insect order Dermaptera and are found on all continents except Antarctica. With about 2,000 species in 12 families, they are one of the smaller insect orders. Earwigs have characteristic cerci, a pair of forceps-like pincers on their abdomen, and membranous wings folded underneath short forewings, hence the scientific order name, \\"skin wings\\". Some groups are tiny parasites on mammals and lack the typical pincers. Earwigs rarely use their flying ability. - The japygids (family Japygidae) are a taxon of hexapods, of the order Diplura. In this family, the paired cerci at the end of their abdomens are pincer-like (superficially similar to the unrelated earwigs) and are used to catch their tiny prey. Seventy genera are recognised, divided among seven subfamilies. - The order Diplura is one of the four groups of hexapods, alongside insects, springtails and Protura. They are sometimes called \\"two-pronged bristletails\\". Around 800 species have been described, of which around 70 occur in North America, 12 in Great Britain and two in Australia. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'taxon'.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere. Question: \\"What essay did Camus reject being labeled as an Existentialist?\\" Answer: \\"Enigma\\" Is this answer correct?

Given the context: What will Jesse want to do next? Possible answers: have a drink, have no drink, avoid their date A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it is highly likely that Jesse will want to have a drink on their first date. The fact that Jesse spent two hours getting ready and selecting the perfect outfit suggests that they are eager to make a good impression on their date. This implies that they are looking forward to the experience and are genuinely interested in getting to know their dating partner better. After investing time and effort preparing, choosing the right outfit and taking a taxi for a good first impression, Jesse will most likely not avoid their date. The act of avoidance goes directly against their anticipatory actions and desire to make a positive impression.

A bar typically provides a relaxed atmosphere, which is conducive to engaging in conversation and sipping on beverages to help both parties feel more at ease. In addition, having a drink during a first date is a common social norm in many cultures, which people generally follow to abide by the conventions of dating and display courtesy to their dating partner. In conclusion, based on the context given, it is very likely that Jesse will want to have a drink on their first date.

He is the eldest son of an ironworker and a home economics teacher. Kaine attended an all-boys Jesuit high school, joining spring mission drives to fund Jesuit activities in Honduras. He went on to earn a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Missouri before entering Harvard Law School. Kaine took time off from his law studies to work with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps in Honduras for nine months in 1980-81, helping Jesuit missionaries who ran a Catholic school in El Progreso.

As hip hop's popularity grew, performers began speaking (\\"rapping\\") in sync with the beats, and became known as MCs or emcees. The Herculoids, made up of Herc, Coke La Rock, and DJ Clark Kent, were the earliest to gain major fame.

The first sentence, \\"They can be seen often long before they are heard\\", indicates that you are able to visually observe 'them' (whatever they may refer to) prior to being able to hear them. This could apply to a situation where an object or person is visible from a distance, giving you the opportunity to see them before you are close enough to hear any sound they might be making. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"They can be heard often long before they are seen\\", suggests that 'they' are often audible before they become visible. This would be the case in a situation where something or someone is making a noise before they come into sight. An example could be a person or an animal in the forest. You may hear the rustling of leaves or their call before actually seeing them. In summary, the ordering of 'seen' and 'heard' dramatically changes the meaning between the two sentences, as the first prioritizes sight, with sound following, and the second implies that you hear 'them' before you see them.

Which county used more chemicals that were picked up by rainwater? Two neighboring counties used different agricultural methods on their farm fields. Cook county used many fertilizers and pesticides, while Dane county used only organic methods and no pesticides. As a result, the waters in Dane county were cleaner. Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Answer:","completion":"Cook County used more chemicals that were picked up by rainwater. The paragraph states that Cook County employed many fertilizers and pesticides in their agricultural methods, while Dane County relied solely on organic methods and did not use any pesticides. Consequently, the waters in Dane County were cleaner. As mentioned in the paragraph, large amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields. When it rains, some of these chemicals get picked up by the rainwater and are carried away as runoff. This runoff eventually makes its way to nearby rivers or lakes, potentially causing an overgrowth of water plants and algae due to the dissolved fertilizer. In turn, this excessive growth can lead to the creation of dead zones in lakes and at the mouths of rivers, where no life can exist. Furthermore, some of the chemicals from farm fields can seep into groundwater, contaminating water wells. Drinking contaminated water poses a risk to human health, as it may lead to illnesses. Considering the agricultural methods used in Cook and Dane Counties, it can be concluded that Cook County used more chemicals that were picked up by rainwater, contributing to the water pollution in its area. This is evidenced by the fact that the waters in Dane County, which adopted organic methods and didn't use pesticides, were found to be cleaner."},{"prompt":"Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of one of the road commissioner's son? from the following article ?

Her unique style has won her admirers and followers, eagerly awaiting her next ensemble. One of JWoww's most daring looks, which has captured both the media's attention and massive audience on social media, is what has been coined \\"The Sideboob.\\" This provocative, eye-catching trend has become synonymous with the star's public image. The Rise of the Sideboob The word \\"sideboob\\" refers to the outer edge of a woman's breast, which becomes visible when she wears certain types of clothing. As a fashion trend, the sideboob has appeared on celebrities and designers' runways for over a decade, but few have embraced it as wholeheartedly as JWoww. The reality star has frequently opted for revealing outfits that accentuate this particular aspect of her anatomy, transforming her into an icon for fans of the look. JWoww's Attitude Towards Body Positivity JWoww's adaptive style choices are an essential part of what has endeared her to fans and those who appreciate the art of fashion. However, it is her importance as a body-positive role model that has garnered her massive praise and admiration. JWoww's unapologetic displays of body confidence are a testament to her belief in accepting and loving her body – both its dimensions and the inevitable changes that accompany life. As a mother of two, she has spoken openly about the challenges women face in adapting to their post-pregnancy bodies. By continuing to celebrate her appearance, JWoww encourages other women to embrace their bodies as they are, rather than adhere to unrealistic standards perpetuated by the media. How JWoww's Sideboob Moment Made the Trend Mainstream JWoww has helped bring the sideboob trend into the limelight, particularly after one red-carpet event where she dazzled in a long sequin sideboob-revealing gown. Her appearance was an instant hit, and the fashion world took notice. Soon after, the sideboob look became a popular fashion choice, gracing red carpets, photoshoots, and magazine covers. Critics of the Sideboob As with any adventurous fashion statement, JWoww's penchant for sideboob fashion has been met with its share of detractors. Critics argue that the look is overly provocative and objectifies women. Others have expressed concern about the potential negative impact on impressionable young women who may feel pressured to follow suit. JWoww's Response to Criticism Despite the backlash, JWoww remains a strong advocate of body positivity. She continually stresses the importance of women feeling comfortable in their skin, regardless of their choice of fashion. She has urged her fans not to emulate her style merely out of obligation or respect for the trend, but to prioritize their own comfort and love for their bodies first and foremost. In Conclusion The \\"Attack of the Sideboob\\" is not just a testament to JWoww's daring fashion choices, but also to her resilience and commitment to body positivity. In the face of both admiration and criticism, JWoww has remained consistent in her message to women worldwide: to recognize their worth beyond physical appearance while also embracing and celebrating their bodies in whichever way they choose. Through her fashion choices and personal journey, JWoww has indeed left a lasting impact in the world of fashion and body positivity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rob Preece. PUBLISHED:. 12:18 EST, 20 August 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:45 EST, 21 August 2012. Tensions between Japan and China escalated further today after thousands of Chinese protesters took to the streets and overturned Japanese cars. The demonstrations were the latest in an ongoing feud between the two countries over a group of disputed islands in the East China Sea. Chinese protesters denounced Japan's claims to the islands - which are known as the Diaoyu in China and as the Senkaku in Japan. Scroll down for video. Rising tensions: Protesters in Hangzhou, China, hold placards and banners at a demonstration against Japan's claim of the disputed islands. Tokyo responded by urging China to protect Japanese citizens. The demonstrations came after 10 Japanese nationalists swam to the islands on Sunday in a tit-for-tat move following a similar landing by Chinese activists last week. Both China’s government and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda are under domestic pressure to take a tough stance over the islands. But economic ties between the two countries are deeper than ever, and both are thought to be keen to prevent the feud spiralling out of control. Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said that they were anxious to contain the situation. Feud: Demonstrators carrying Chinese national flags attend an anti-Japan protest in Shenzhen, southern China. 'We would like to continue to deepen mutually beneficial relations between Japan and China, keeping a broader perspective in mind,' he said. 'Regarding the protests in China, we are asking, above all, to ensure the safety of Japanese nationals (in China).' The anti-Japanese protests in part reflect bitter Chinese memories of Japan’s occupation of large parts of China in the 1930s and 1940s. Chinese mainstream media were critical of Japan, but some also suggested that violent protest was not the way to proceed. Protests: Pro-China activists in Hong Kong have also taken part in demonstrations, waving Chinese flags and chanting slogans such as 'Down with Japanese militarism' 'Japan has made a series of mistakes. in the Diaoyu Island issue, and has hurt the Chinese people’s feelings,' said the China Youth Daily. 'The. young people’s patriotism is laudable ... but for a selected number of. those who are smashing their fellows’ vehicles, damaging public. property-that shows foolishness. 'This severely disrupts social order, injures the cities’ image, and furthermore, affected China’s image.' Japan, eager to keep the feud from escalating, deported the Chinese activists within days but the fate of the Japanese protesters remains undecided. Land grab: The protests in China came after Japanese activists swam to the islands and raised their national flag on the disputed territory. Disputed: A Japanese activist waves the country's flag after landing on a group of islands known as Senkaku in Japanese and Diaoyu in Chinese. Territory: An aerial view of Uotsuri Island, one of the disputed islands in the East China Sea.

The Marathi people have their own thriving film industry, and these productions can serve as useful educational tools in their own right. To make sure you’re able to absorb what you’re seeing, start with programs aimed at young viewers and work your way up from there. Play close attention to the dialogue and see how many words and phrases you can pick out from memory. If possible, turn on the subtitles in your native language. Seeing the dialogue written out will help you create associations between what you hear and the meaning displayed on screen. Movies often depict normal people in normal situations, which means you’ll be getting a valuable glimpse of how the language is used in everyday life. Throw on a pair of headphones and jam out to some Bela Shende or Raja Hasan during your workout or on your walk home from school. Because of its uncomplicated lyrical structure and repetitive nature, popular music can help reinforce language skills without ever feeling like work. Another plus to using music as a study aid is that you can pause and rewind a song whenever you come to a section you don’t understand. Maharashtra has produced many famous playback singers for Indian movies, so much of the music that comes out of the region contains vocals sung in Marathi. You can find recordings from many famous Marathi artists on websites like YouTube. Pick up a newspaper or magazine printed in Marathi and try to decipher as much as you can. This is great practice for going over the many symbols of the Marathi alphabet. As your comprehension improves, you can move onto more difficult material like novels and technical essays. Focus on headlines, blurbs, and other short passages on your first few attempts to keep from being overwhelmed. Children’s books and nursery rhymes are perfect for brushing up on basic Marathi grammar. Ask someone who’s fluent in the language if they would be willing to help you practice by carrying on a short conversation. They’ll be able to adapt to your individual skill level, help you with your pronunciation, and gently correct your mistakes. When learning to speak an unfamiliar language, there’s no substitute for firsthand experience. Many Indian people speak more than one dialect. It’s possible that your friend might have a good grasp of conversational Marathi, even if they’re not from Maharashtra. If you don’t personally know anyone who speaks Marathi, try making a new friend online who you can chat with via Skype or FaceTime.

Anisometropia is the condition in which the two eyes have unequal refractive power. Each eye can be nearsighted (myopia), farsighted (hyperopia) or a combination of both, which is called antimetropia. Generally a difference in power of two diopters or more is the accepted threshold to label the condition anisometropia. Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can a person be nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other?","completion":"Step 1: Identify the information needed to answer the question. The question asks whether a person can be nearsighted in one eye and farsighted in the other, so we need to determine whether such a combination is possible based on the given text. Step 2: Analyze the given text for relevant information. The text states that \\"each eye can be nearsighted (myopia), farsighted (hyperopia) or a combination of both, which is called antimetropia.\\" This indicates that there are various possibilities in terms of refractive power for each eye. Step 3: Answer the question based on the information found in the text.

Plants also detect the daily cycle of light and darkness. Do you know how plants respond to these changes? Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color. After the change in color, they fall off. This dormancy period helps trees. It allows them to survive the cold and dry winter. Plants only want to grow when conditions are right.

The Dutch Take Over: Intent on capturing a piece of the Portuguese trade in pepper and other spices, the Java-based Dutch Ailied with the Malays in 1633 to blockade Melaka. The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout this period, the east coast states enjoyed a relatively tranquil prosperity, Terengganu notably thriving from its textile industry and trading in pepper and gold with the Thais, Cambodians, and Chinese. The British, under the private auspices of the East India Company (EIC), were beginning to poke their noses into North Borneo.

Movie title: Wrath of the Titans Movie plot: Perseus (Sam Worthington), a son of Zeus (Liam Neeson), lives as a fisherman after the death of his wife, Io (portrayed by Gemma Arterton in the previous film), with his young son, Helius (John Bell). Zeus visits Perseus and asks for his help, saying that humans are not praying to the gods and as a result the gods are losing their power and becoming mortal and can no longer sustain the walls of Tartarus which are crumbling, and the imprisoned Titan Kronos will soon be free. Perseus, valuing his family's safety, refuses to get involved. Zeus meets his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Ãdgar RamÃ­rez) in Tartarus. He asks Hades's help in rebuilding Tartarus's walls, but Hades rejects the offer and attacks Zeus. Ares betrays Zeus, imprisoning him and stealing his thunderbolt. Hades and Ares plan to make a deal with Kronos: in exchange for remaining immortal, they will drain Zeus's divine power to revive Kronos. The walls of Tartarus break, unleashing monsters onto the world. After killing a Chimera that attacked his village, Perseus travels to meet his father. He instead finds a dying Poseidon who informs him of the circumstances and tells him to find his Demigod son Agenor (Toby Kebbell) who will lead him to Hephaestus, who knows the way into Tartarus. Poseidon then gives Perseus his trident and succumbs to the injuries he sustained when meeting Hades and dissolves into dust. Perseus, Andromeda (Rosamund Pike), and Agenor set out to find Hephaestus on a hidden island.

When the flight assistants announced a further 24-hour for 23 January, the Italian Guarantee Authority (Commissione di Garanzia) which regulates strikes in essential public services (under the terms of laws no. 194/1990 and no. 83/2000) (IT0004266F) accused the unions of breaching the legal provision that 10 days must elapse between one strike and the next. Can we draw the following conclusion? The flights were going to take off but did not Pick your answer from: *Yes *It's impossible to say *No","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that the flights were going to take off but did not. This is because flight cancellations occurred during the strike on January 19 and the days that followed, which indicates that the flights were scheduled to depart, but the strike actions by flight assistants prevented them from doing so. The announcement of a further 24-hour strike on January 23 also suggests that more flights were at risk of being cancelled, further supporting the conclusion that the flights were intended to take off but could not due to the strike. Moreover, the involvement of the Italian Guarantee Authority, which accused the unions of breaching legal provisions that require a 10-day break between strikes, highlights the impact of the strikes on essential public services, such as air travel. This adds to the evidence that flights were originally planned to take off but were cancelled as a result of the strike action by the flight assistants and their unions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although both the premise and hypothesis describe a man wearing a black shaggy hat and leopard printed sash, there are distinct differences between them. The premise specifically states that the man is holding a drum that says \\"Premier\\" on it, while the hypothesis states that the man is standing on his head. These are two separate actions and do not imply that one statement can be proven true based on the other. To analyze this further, let's break down the statements in each: Premise: 1. Man is wearing a black shaggy hat. 2. Man is wearing a leopard printed sash with red accents. 3. Man is holding a drum that says \\"Premier\\" on it. Hypothesis: 1. Man is wearing a black shaggy hat. 2. Man is wearing a leopard printed sash. 3. Man is standing on his head. As we can see, the premise and the hypothesis share similarities in the first two points, but the third point in each statement is different. The third point in the premise refers to the man holding a drum with specific branding, while the third point in the hypothesis states that the man is performing a physical act of standing on his head. Therefore, even if the premise is true, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true since they describe different actions.

Write a title for this article: A few minutes later, the message arrived — results that showed his tiny start-up company might have overcome one of the biggest obstacles in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease. It had found a dye and a brain scan that, he said, can show the hallmark plaque building up in the brains of people with the disease. The findings, which will be presented at an international meeting of the Alzheimer’s Association in Honolulu on July 11, must still be confirmed and approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But if they hold up, it will mean that for the first time doctors would have a reliable way to diagnose the presence of Alzheimer’s in patients with memory problems. And researchers would have a way to figure out whether drugs are slowing or halting the disease, a step that “will change everyone’s thinking about Alzheimer’s in a dramatic way,” said Dr. Michael Weiner of the University of California, San Francisco, who is not part of the company’s study and directs a federal project to study ways of diagnosing Alzheimer’s. Still, the long tale behind this finding shows just how difficult this disease is and why progress toward preventing or curing it has been so slow. Ever since Alzheimer’s disease was described by a German doctor, Alois Alzheimer, in 1906, there was only one way to know for sure that a person had it. A pathologist, examining the brain after death, would see microscopic black freckles, plaque, sticking to brain slices like barnacles. Without plaque, a person with memory loss did not have the disease. There is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer’s. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early. The questions though, are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer’s or is developing it? Even at the best medical centers, doctors often are wrong. Twenty percent of people with dementia — a loss of memory and intellectual functions — who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, did not have it. There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Half with milder memory loss, thought to be on their way to Alzheimer’s, do not get the disease. And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis, some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer’s are not treated for conditions, like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions, that are causing their memory problems. Brain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions — who has or is getting Alzheimer’s, whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death. Dr. Skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. They labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a PET scanner to directly see plaque in a living person’s brain. But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested. And that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day. Five years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in Philadelphia, to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with hospice patients to prove it worked. Hospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not. Some predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy. The Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for. “This is about as good as it gets,” he said that day. He went into a rotunda that serves as Avid’s lunchroom to tell the company’s 50 employees. “This is a big day for us,” he continued. “I thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it.” His employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups. The type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan. Other tests are being studied — ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; MRI scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer’s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy. Earlier this decade, two scientists at the University of Pittsburgh developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain. The researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations. “On and on it went,” Dr. Mathis said. Finally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in Sweden to test their dye in humans. On Valentine’s Day 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer’s patient with the dye, known as Pittsburgh Compound B, and scanned the patient’s brain. It worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call. A PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate. But Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer’s? Two weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer’s. There was no sign of telltale plaques. His sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer’s. “There was an audible gasp,” Dr. Mathis said. “The field was taken aback.” “The rest is history,” he added.

Edin Dzeko has insisted Manchester City will take nothing for granted as they attempt to defend their Barclays Premier League title. The reigning champions launched their defence with a hard-fought 2-0 victory at Newcastle on Sunday with an efficient, rather than dazzling, display. Title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal both enjoyed even narrower successes in their opening fixtures, and Dzeko knows there is no room for complacency during a campaign he expects to be as competitive as ever. Hard work: Manchester City will hope to retain their title this season but Dzeko knows that will be a tough task. Champions: The Bosnian striker has won the Premier League twice with Manchester City in 2012 and 2014. The 28-year-old frontman told CityTV: 'It's just the beginning of the season and it will be, definitely, a long season with the five teams fighting for the title. This is just the beginning. 'It's good to start with a win, but we are not there. There are so many games to come and we have to prepare for the next one, for the big game against Liverpool to try to win at home. 'We have brought in some great new players. Some of them still need time because it was the World Cup and a lot of us came later to the pre-season. 'I think we can still improve a lot. Each game, we can be better and better and just try to continue where we finished [at Newcastle].' Dzeko was a key figure in the win at St James' Park despite not finding his own way on to the scoresheet. It was his clever back-heel after he had drawn central defenders Fabricio Coloccini and Mile Williamson to the ball which allowed David Silva to fire City into the lead against the Magpies, just as he had done 12 months earlier. Opening win: David Silva scored City's first goal of the new Premier League season at Newcastle. Winner: Sergio Aguero, who has signed a new contract, scored the second of City's goals in the 2-0 win. VIDEO Important to start with a win - Pellegrini. But if Silva's 38th-minute intervention gave the visitors the advantage, it was one they were unable to push home until substitute Sergio Aguero beat Tim Krul at the second attempt in stoppage time at the end of the game. Dzeko said: 'We played very well. From the first minute, we were there like the manager wanted us to be, from the first minute to try to press them high, to try to score a goal. 'We didn't score an early goal, but it was the perfect time, five minutes before half-time, and I think we controlled the game during the 90 minutes, were definitely the better side and deserved this win.' New recruit: Fernando, signed from Porto for £12million, was impressive for Manchester City at Newcastle. Dzeko's impressive individual display came amid reports that he is close to signing a new contract at the Etihad Stadium, but it was collective, rather than individual plaudits which were of greater interest to the Bosnia-Herzegovina international. He said: 'I am very happy because of my performance and the performance of the team because I think we were brilliant. 'It's always good to start the season with a win, especially away at Newcastle where it is always tough to go.' Dzeko's mood was in sharp contrast to that of Newcastle debutant Jack Colback as he and his team-mates emerged from a tight encounter with nothing to show for their efforts. Manager Alan Pardew was quick to take positives from a spirited display in the immediate aftermath, and urged his players to take them into Saturday's trip to Aston Villa. Dream: Despite the result, Jack Colback fulfilled his dream by making his debut for boyhood club Newcastle. Colback told nufcTV: 'We are disappointed with the result. You get nothing for good performances, but defeats. 'We are not going to come up against the quality that City have every week and we are going to get more chances against the teams who aren't the so-called better teams, so we have got to take the positives out of Sunday and look to go there and get some points.' Tyneside-born Colback fulfilled a dream when he made his league debut for the club he supported as a boy after spending the whole of his career until the end of last season with arch-rivals Sunderland. The 24-year-old said: 'It was bittersweet, really, coming off with a defeat. It would have been fantastic to have come away with at least a point. 'But it was great to finally have that moment and get it under the belt.'","completion":"Highlights: - Manchester City's Edin Dzeko says the team must not be complacent in their efforts to defend the Barclays Premier League title. - The reigning champions began their defense with a 2-0 victory at Newcastle, emphasizing the competitive nature of this season. - Dzeko highlights the importance of winning games against fellow title rivals like Liverpool and Arsenal as the key to maintaining a strong position. - The Bosnian striker believes Manchester City can still improve, especially with the addition of new players. - Dzeko also acknowledged the strong performances of teammates David Silva and Sergio Aguero, who scored City's two goals in the 2-0 win against Newcastle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Battle of Shiloh took place during which war?","completion":"The Battle of Shiloh took place during the American Civil War, a conflict that occurred between 1861 and 1865 in the United States. The war arose from the long-standing tensions between the Northern (Union) and Southern (Confederate) states over issues like states' rights, westward expansion, and particularly slavery. The election of Abraham Lincoln as the 16th President of the United States in 1860 bolstered fears among the Southern states that their way of life, which depended on slave labor, is threatened. Consequently, these states started to secede from the Union, leading to the formation of the Confederate States of America and the eruption of the Civil War. The Battle of Shiloh, also known as the Battle of Pittsburg Landing, was fought from April 6 to April 7, 1862, in southwestern Tennessee. It was a critical early engagement in the Western Theater of the conflict. Confederate forces, led by Generals Albert Sidney Johnston and P.G.T. Beauregard, sought to strike a surprise blow against Union Major General Ulysses S. Grant's forces, which had recently captured Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in Tennessee. Grant's primary aim was to capture the Confederate railroad junction at Corinth, Mississippi, but his forces became concentrated near Pittsburg Landing, close to the Tennessee River. On April 6, Johnston launched his surprise attack on Grant's encamped forces, and despite being unprepared, the Union troops managed to form battle lines to resist the Confederate onslaught. Throughout the day, the Confederates pushed the Union forces back, but they could not achieve a decisive breakthrough. In the process, General Johnston suffered a fatal wound, and his death marked a pivotal moment in the battle. Command was then passed to General Beauregard, who decided to postpone further actions until the following day. During the night, Union reinforcements arrived under the command of Major General Don Carlos Buell, significantly bolstering Grant's forces. On April 7, the Union launched a counterattack, effectively driving the Confederates back and forcing them to retreat to Corinth. The Battle of Shiloh resulted in heavy casualties on both sides, with the Union suffering more than 13,000 casualties and the Confederacy incurring over 10,000 casualties. Despite the significant loss of life, the Battle of Shiloh was an essential strategic victory for the Union. The Confederate defeat prevented them from blocking the Union's advance into the heart of the Southern territory and also marked a sobering reminder of the war's escalating intensity. The battle also highlighted the importance of preparedness and the need for effective communication in military campaigns. Furthermore, the outcome of the battle indicated that the war would be long, hard-fought, and devastating for both sides. Shiloh was a turning point that demonstrated that the conflict would not be a quick and easy victory for either side, and instead, it would require a long and arduous struggle to reach a resolution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Is there a negative or positive tone to this product review? === Title: 51man Review: Just got it today. I was exited to mount it on. The bracket that holds the cage to the handlebars is not sturdy enough. Bought three cages for my wife and two sons two years ago. The brackets on all three are very sturdy. I believe They were sold by another vendor thru Amazon and did cost 7.00 a piece. This is cheaply made it's not worth buying it. To return it may cost more than it is worth. I guess I will trash it. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is predominantly negative. The negative tone is evident from the reviewer's dissatisfaction and disappointment with various aspects of the product. The primary reason for this negative tone is due to the reviewer comparing the newly purchased product to previous experiences and finding it inferior in quality. The negative tone begins with the statement, \\"The bracket that holds the cage to the handlebars is not sturdy enough.\\" This immediately conveys dissatisfaction with the product's quality because the reviewer feels that it lacks necessary durability. Moreover, the phrase \\"not sturdy enough\\" demonstrates that the product did not meet their expectations. The negativity continues when the reviewer compares their current product to ones they had bought for their family members, stating that \\"the brackets on all three are very sturdy\\" and implying that the new product they received is not as reliable as those previous purchases. This further emphasizes the disappointment because they are contrasting their superior past experiences with their negative present one. Another contributing factor to the negative tone is the mention of the price difference: \\"They were sold by another vendor thru Amazon and did cost 7.00 a piece.\\" By highlighting the higher expense of the better-quality cages they had bought previously, the reviewer questions the integrity and value of the cheaper product they just received, suggesting that it is \\"cheaply made\\" and \\"not worth buying.\\" Finally, the negative tone is solidified when considering the reviewer's current course of action: \\"To return it may cost more than it is worth. I guess I will trash it.\\" This decision to dispose of the product rather than return it shows a deep dissatisfaction with the quality and overall worth of the item, and their resignation highlights a consideration of the product as useless or wasted money. In summary, the tone of this product review is negative due to the overall dissatisfaction with the product's quality and the reviewer's decision to discard it rather than attempt a return. This tone is further accentuated through comparison to previous, better experiences and the identification of the newly purchased product as \\"cheaply made\\" and not worth the investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Funafuti's Tepuka Vili Vili islet was devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, with all its vegetation and most of its sand swept away during the cyclone. Along with a tropical depression that affected the islands a few days later, Severe Tropical Cyclone Ofa had a major impact on Tuvalu with most islands reporting damage to vegetation and crops. Cyclone Gavin was first identified during 2 March 1997, and was the first of three tropical cyclones to affect Tuvalu during the 1996–97 cyclone season with Cyclones Hina and Keli following later in the season. Q: What cyclone badly damaged Funafuti?","completion":"Cyclone Bebe, which occurred in 1972, badly damaged Funafuti, an atoll and the capital of the island nation of Tuvalu. The cyclone brought strong winds, heavy rainfall, and storm surges to the island, causing significant destruction to infrastructure, homes, and vegetation. Moreover, the islet Tepuka Vili Vili within Funafuti was completely devastated by Cyclone Meli in 1979, losing most of its sand and vegetation during the storm. Over the years, Tuvalu has witnessed several cyclones causing varying degrees of damage, such as Cyclone Ofa, Cyclone Gavin, Cyclone Hina, and Cyclone Keli. As a low-lying island nation, Tuvalu remains vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, including more frequent and powerful cyclones, sea-level rise, and flooding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was with the help and support of the Tuohy family that Michael Oher was able to invest his full potential into sports, particularly American football. American football, a popular sport in the United States, is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each. The objective of the game is to advance the ball across the opponent's goal line by either running with it or passing it to teammates. In American football, players have specific roles and positions allocated to them based on their strengths and abilities. In Oher's case, he played as an offensive tackle and utilized his remarkable size, strength, and agility to protect the quarterback and aid the offensive line. His football career began at Briarcrest Christian School in Memphis, Tennessee, where he first demonstrated his athletic prowess on the field. Upon graduation from high school, Michael Oher was offered a football scholarship to the University of Mississippi. During his college years, he continued to excel in American football, earning numerous accolades and titles, including becoming a First Team All-American. Following college, Oher was drafted in the first round of the 2009 NFL Draft by the Baltimore Ravens.

Soon afterward, in April 1993, Albini remarked to the Chicago Tribune that he doubted Geffen would release the completed album. Albini commented years later that in a sense he felt he spoke about the situation \\"from a position of ignorance, because I wasn't there when the band was having their discussions with the record label. All I know is ... we made a record, everybody was happy with it. A few weeks later I hear that it's unreleasable and it's all got to be redone\\". While Albini's remarks in the article drew no immediate reply from the group or its label, Newsweek ran a similar article soon afterwards that did. Nirvana denied there was any pressure from its label to change the album's sound, sending a letter to Newsweek that said that the article's author \\"ridiculed our relationship with our label based on totally erronous [sic] information\\"; the band also reprinted the letter in a full-page ad in Billboard. Rosenblatt insisted in a press release that Geffen would release anything the band submitted, and label founder David Geffen made the unusual move of personally calling Newsweek to complain about the article.Nirvana wanted to do further work on the recorded tracks, and considered working with producer Scott Litt and remixing some tracks with Andy Wallace (who had mixed Nevermind). Albini vehemently disagreed, and claimed he had an agreement with the band that it would not modify the tracks without his involvement. Albini initially refused to give the album master tapes to Gold Mountain, but relented after a phone call from Novoselic. The band decided against working with Wallace and chose to remix and augment the songs \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\" with Litt at Seattle's Bad Animals Studio in May 1993.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755. Question: \\"What happened to Prince Henry?\\" Response: \\"He was the only rightful claimant to the throne, but he died after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

(born 15 November 1931) is a Kenyan politician who was the third President of Kenya, serving from December 2002 until April 2013. Kibaki was previously Vice-President of Kenya for ten years from 1978 to 1988 under President Daniel arap Moi. He also held cabinet ministerial positions in the Kenyatta and Moi governments, including time as minister for Finance (1969-1981) under Kenyatta, and Minister for Home Affairs (1982-1988) and Minister for Health (1988-1991) under Moi. Kibaki served as an opposition Member of Parliament from 1992 to 2002. In preparation for the 2002 elections, Kibaki's Democratic Party affiliated with several other opposition parties to form National Alliance Party of Kenya (NAK). A group of disappointed KANU presidential aspirants then quit KANU in protest after being overlooked by outgoing President Moi when Moi had founding Father Jomo Kenyatta's son, Uhuru Kenyatta (now Kibaki's successor as Kenya's 4th President after the 2013 General Election), nominated to be the KANU presidential candidate, and hurriedly formed the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). NAK later combined with the LDP to form the National Rainbow Coalition (NARC). On 14 October 2002, at a large opposition rally in Uhuru Park, Nairobi, Kibaki was nominated the NARC opposition alliance presidential candidate after Raila Odinga made the famous declaration, Kibaki Tosha! On 3 December 2002, Kibaki was injured in a road accident while on his way back to Nairobi from a campaign meeting at Machakos junction 40 kilometres (25 miles) From Nairobi. He was subsequently hospitalized in Nairobi, then London, after sustaining fracture injuries in the accident. He still walks rather awkwardly as a result of those injuries. The rest of his presidential campaign was thus conducted by his NARC colleagues in his absence, led by Raila Odinga and Kijana Wamalwa (who went on to become the Vice President) who campaigned tirelessly for Kibaki after stating, \\"The captain has been injured in the field... but the rest of the team shall continue.\\" On 27 December 2002, Kibaki and NARC won a landslide victory over KANU, with Kibaki getting 62% of the votes in the presidential elections, against only 31% for the KANU candidate Uhuru Kenyatta.

Write an article based on this summary: London's leading shares fell again on Wednesday but sterling was steady as investors continued to digest the consequences of the UK's snap election call.","completion":"Title: London's Share Prices Drop Amidst Snap Election Uncertainty, Sterling Remains Resilient Introduction Last Wednesday, London's leading shares fell as the market continued to react to the abrupt announcement of a snap election called by UK's Prime Minister. Investors have been attempting to assess the potential consequences of the electoral decision, creating uncertainty which has led to the decline in share prices. Despite the turmoil in the share market, the pound sterling has managed to remain stable, demonstrating resilience amidst such unpredictable times. The Snap Election Call The snap election call came as a surprise on April 18th, as Prime Minister Theresa May announced her intention to accelerate the election process and secure a stronger mandate to negotiate Brexit. The decision is believed to be aimed at exploiting the weak opposition by the Labour party and consolidating the Conservative party's strength in the parliament. This bold move comes ahead of important negotiations with the European Union, where the outcome has significant implications on the UK's economic stability. Market Reaction To The Snap Election Call Financial markets are known to be vulnerable to unexpected changes in the political landscape, and this was clearly evident on Wednesday as London's leading shares fell. The uncertainty surrounding the impending election has led to investors adopting a cautious approach, causing a drop in share prices. The FTSE 100, the index that contains the UK's largest listed companies, witnessed a significant fall, led by financial institutions and multinational corporations. Considering the weight of the Brexit negotiations, it is no surprise that investors have found the sudden election announcement unsettling. The outcome of this snap election is expected to play a critical role in shaping the UK's negotiation strategy with the European Union. As a result, the market fluctuation observed on Wednesday is a manifestation of investor anxiety concerning the uncertainty. Sterling's Steady Performance Amidst the turbulence of London's share market, the British pound has managed to hold its ground. The sterling has kept a steady performance despite the unexpected announcement of the snap elections. Currency analysts believe that the resilience demonstrated by the pound can be attributed to the belief that the Conservative party will triumph in the elections, allowing Prime Minister Theresa May to secure better Brexit terms for the UK. Investors have, so far, maintained their faith in the British currency as they remain confident in the government's ability to navigate the complex Brexit process successfully. The market appears to believe that an increased conservative majority will ultimately lead to a smoother negotiation process and a favorable agreement with the European Union. Conclusion As the market continues to navigate through the political uncertainty caused by the snap election call, London's leading shares have experienced a substantial decline on Wednesday. The announcement has generated anxiety among investors, leading them to adopt a cautious approach to investment decisions.

In January 1454, the year that Casimir IV was married to Elisabeth Habsburg, the Prussian faction asked Casimir IV and protection by the Kingdom of Poland. Casimir asked the Prussian Confederation for a more formal petition. On 4 February 1454, the Secret Council of the Prussian Confederation sent a formal act of disobedience to the Grand Master. Two days later the confederacy started its rebellion and soon almost all Prussia, except for Marienburg, Stuhm , and Konitz , were free from Teutonic rule. Most of the captured Ordensburg castles were immediately destroyed. On 10 February 1454, the confederacy sent an official delegation to Poland, headed by Johannes von Baysen. By 20 February, the delegates were in Kraków and asked Casimir to bring Prussia into the Polish kingdom. After negotiating the exact conditions of incorporation, the king agreed and delegates of the Prussian Confederation pledged allegiance to Casimir on 6 March 1454. On the same day, the king agreed to all the conditions of the Prussian delegates — for instance Thorn demanded the destruction of the Polish city of Nieszawa — giving wide privileges to the Prussian cities and nobility. Three days later, Johannes von Baysen was named as the first governor of Prussia. After 15 April, most of the Prussian estates, with the exception of the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, pledged allegiance to their new ruler. Poland sent the Grand Master a declaration of war, predated to 22 February. Both sides expected the war to end quickly.

The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay.

In Cyrillic script, it represents the word \\"Aфиней,\\" which can be transliterated into the Latin script as \\"Aphiney.\\" Russian is an East Slavic language and belongs to the family of Indo-European languages. It is the most widely spoken language among the Slavic language family and serves as an official language for countries like Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Kyrgyzstan. Russian uses the Cyrillic script, which is a writing system developed during the 9th century and is currently employed by numerous languages across Eastern Europe, Central Asia, and some parts of the Balkans. Furthermore, Russian is one of the six official languages of the United Nations. It is important to note that the word \\"Афиней\\" on its own doesn't give a complete meaning, but if it refers to \\"Афинский\\" (Aphinskiy) or \\"Афина\\" (Aphina), which are more common Russian words, the meaning becomes clearer. In the second case, \\"Афина\\" is the Russian name for the Greek goddess Athena (Афіна), the goddess of wisdom, courage, inspiration, civilization, law, justice, strategic warfare, and arts. The name also refers to the Greek capital city, Athens (Афіны, Афіни), as it was named after the goddess Athena due to her significant role in Greek mythology.

The premise focuses on the various features of the region (coastline, inland waterways, forests, architecture, wine, and food), stating that they present the good life in abundant variety. This statement implies that if an individual values these aspects, they would find enjoyment and depth in what the region has to offer. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that based on the good life feeling (i.e., the aforementioned aspects of the region) that the region provides, you can find a lot to do in this region. By breaking down both the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that the premise and hypothesis are indeed related. The premise sets the stage by describing the various components (coastline, inland waterways, forests, architecture, wine, and food) that represent \\"the good life\\" in the region, while the hypothesis expands upon this concept by stating that an individual can find a variety of activities based on this good life feeling. In conclusion, if the premise is true, then it is very likely that the hypothesis is also true because the premise provides enough information about the region's different aspects that contribute to the \\"good life feeling,\\" and the hypothesis logically extends the premise by mentioning that there would be a lot to do in the region based on these aspects.

Today, we're going to talk about a big question that some smart people have about smallpox. You might be wondering, \\"What is smallpox?\\" Smallpox is a kind of sickness that used to make a lot of people very, very sick. But don't worry, nobody gets smallpox anymore because doctors and scientists found a way to stop it from spreading. Now, let's talk about the big question. Some people thought smallpox was a very, very old sickness. Like, older than your grandma or even the dinosaurs! But now, there are other people who think that maybe smallpox isn't as old as we thought. They look at things like old pictures, writings, and even the tiny pieces inside the body that make us who we are, called genes. By looking at all these clues, they try to figure out the true age of smallpox. This is important because knowing when smallpox first appeared can help us learn about other sicknesses, too. It's like solving a puzzle or playing detective. We can learn how sicknesses change over time and maybe even find ways to keep more people from getting sick in the first place. But don't worry, kids! Even though we still have questions about smallpox, we know a lot about how to keep people healthy. Thanks to the hard work of doctors, scientists, and the people who take care of us, we can enjoy our lives without worrying about smallpox. So, the next time you hear someone talk about smallpox or other sicknesses and wonder how old they are, remember that it's all a part of a big mystery we're trying to solve.

Answer: Corruption in elections and in the legislature reduces accountability and distorts representation in policymaking; corruption in the judiciary compromises the rule of law; and corruption in public administration results in the inefficient provision of services. Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Yes, the question has been answered in a satisfactory fashion. However, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer, it is essential to discuss the root causes of corruption and the channels through which it weakens service provision. Corruption refers to the abuse of power, authority, or entrusted responsibility for private gain. It has significant negative consequences for society in general, and particularly, for the provision of public services. Corruption manifests in various forms, such as bribery, embezzlement, nepotism, and fraud. When public funds and resources are mismanaged or misappropriated, it directly impacts the quality and availability of services delivered to citizens. Below are some specific reasons corruption leads to weak provision of services: 1. Bureaucratic inefficiencies: When corruption permeates a country's bureaucracy, it encourages red-tapism, delays in decision-making, and inefficiencies in the allocation and utilization of resources. This hampers the ability of public institutions to provide essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure effectively. 2. Insufficient funding: Corruption reduces the overall funds available for public service delivery by diverting resources towards personal gains or by allocating them to unnecessary and unproductive projects. This means that there is less money available to invest in the development and maintenance of vital services. 3. Skewed priorities: Corruption can lead to a distorted allocation of resources as officials may direct public funds to areas from which they stand to gain personally or politically, rather than prioritizing projects that benefit the public at large. As a result, sectors that require attention and investment may be neglected, leading to weak service provision. 4. Lack of accountability: When corruption is widespread and embedded in the public sector, it creates a lack of accountability and transparency, further weakening service delivery. In such environments, public officials are less likely to face consequences for their actions, enabling them to act with impunity. This can result in poor service provision and a lack of responsiveness to public needs. 5. Erosion of public trust: Corruption erodes public trust in government and its institutions, leading to increased cynicism and apathy among citizens. This can result in a lack of public engagement and participation in decision-making processes, which further hampers service provision. 6. Negative impact on human capital: Corruption can lead to the appointment and promotion of unqualified or underqualified individuals in key positions within public institutions, as meritocracy is replaced by favoritism and nepotism. In the long run, this negatively affects the quality and efficiency of public services. In conclusion, corruption in various sectors of government creates weak provision of services by fostering inefficiencies, misallocating resources, distorting priorities, diminishing accountability, eroding public trust, and negatively affecting human capital. To improve service delivery and ensure that all citizens have access to essential public services, it is crucial to address corruption through measures such as increased transparency, the establishment of strong legal frameworks, and the promotion of civic engagement."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: what does someone do when they do not reply to a question?

Plot title: Venus Movie plot: The plot concerns Maurice Russell, an elderly actor who finds himself increasingly attracted to his friend Ian's grand-niece Jessie while simultaneously finding himself in deteriorating health due to prostate cancer. Maurice's friend describes the grand-niece as a trouble maker and a nuisance, but Maurice discovers that Jessie warms up to him when he starts interacting with her. He takes her to the National Gallery in London to view his favourite painting, the Rokeby Venus, by the Spanish artist Diego VelÃ¡zquez. Jessie had expressed interest in modelling (Maurice initially mis-hears this as \\"yodelling\\") and Maurice arranges for Jessie to model nude for an art class. As a result of Jessie posing for the art class, and inspired by his favourite painting, Maurice decides to give Jessie the nickname \\"Venus\\". Maurice and Jessie develop a passive/aggressive relationship over the course of the film. Maurice is forward in terms of his attraction towards Jessie while Jessie occasionally indulges his whims to a limited extent, such as touching her hand and smelling her neck, but also retracts the indulgences when she feels that he has gone too far. The plot of the film revolves around the evolving friendship or relationship between the two characters. For Maurice, this appears to be the last attempt at something approaching a love life, as his prostate operation has left him impotent. For Jessie, it is less clear what she sees in Maurice. During the course of the film we see her do everything from exploiting him (trying to get him to buy her presents, trying to use his flat to have sex with a boy), taking care of him, flirting with him, and rejecting him sexually to engaging with him as a friend. During the course of the film we learn that she has been rejected by her mother and great-uncle for her promiscuous life style; it is implied that she is drawn to Maurice because he does not judge her as harshly as her family members have.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? -- yes -- no","completion":"Answer: The congregation in charge of the Old College at the University of Notre Dame is the Congregation of Holy Cross. The University of Notre Dame, founded in 1842 by Rev. Edward F. Sorin, C.S.C., is a prestigious Catholic research university located in Notre Dame, Indiana, United States. It is closely affiliated with the Congregation of Holy Cross, a Roman Catholic religious community of priests, brothers, and sisters founded in France in 1837 by Blessed Basil Moreau. Rev. Sorin and a group of Holy Cross religious journeyed from France to start this new American mission with the intention of educating young men in the United States. The Holy Cross community is dedicated to serving others through their motto, \\"Ave Crux, Spes Unica,\\" meaning \\"Hail the Cross, Our Only Hope.\\" Old College, the very first campus building at Notre Dame, built in 1843, has a rich history and has been utilized for various purposes, such as student housing, classrooms, and administrative offices. Today, Old College serves as one of two seminaries on campus operated by the Congregation of Holy Cross, the other being Moreau Seminary. The seminarians living at Old College are part of the Holy Cross Undergraduate Seminary Program, which forms and educates its members to become effective religious and pastoral leaders. Old College serves as both a residential and spiritual home for young men discerning their vocation to the priesthood or religious life. The residents, known as \\"Old Collegians,\\" are enrolled in undergraduate programs at the University of Notre Dame or Holy Cross College. While living at Old College, these seminarians participate in a formation program that includes daily communal prayer, spiritual direction, retreats, and opportunities for service and community involvement. The Congregation of Holy Cross is actively involved in the governance, administration, and spiritual life of the University of Notre Dame. Apart from Old College, Holy Cross priests and brothers also serve various roles within the university as professors, administrators, and chaplains. Moreover, Notre Dame's president has always been a Holy Cross priest since the university's founding. This strong connection makes the Congregation of Holy Cross an influential and essential part of the growth and development of the University of Notre Dame. Thus, through the Old College and other initiatives, the Congregation of Holy Cross continues its vital work in forming future generations of religious and pastoral leaders, strengthening the faith, and contributing to the overall mission of the University."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. The letter said that the sale \\"goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale\\" of the work.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Final Destination 5 Context: Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone on it, except for his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, who he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly; his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin; Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper; his boss Dennis Lapman; and co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block does not believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep his eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated\\", and warns them to be careful. Believing this to be nonsense, they ignore his warnings and leave. Later, Candice goes to gymnastics practice with Peter. A loose screw from a fan lands onto a balance beam, and when a gymnast lands on it she falls off in pain and knocks over the powdered chalk, which hits the fan and forms a cloud of chalk. This causes Candice to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session at a Chinese spa. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the eye doctor is out looking for files the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam realizes that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge. He and Molly study Death's design and realize that Nathan is next on Death's...

Please answer the following question: Information: - Auschwitz concentration camp was a network of German Nazi concentration camps and extermination camps built and operated by the Third Reich in Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany during World War II. It consisted of Auschwitz I (the original camp), Auschwitz IIBirkenau (a combination concentration/extermination camp), Auschwitz IIIMonowitz (a labor camp to staff an IG Farben factory), and 45 satellite camps. - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust. - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - The German extermination camps or death camps were designed and built by Nazi Germany during World War II (193945) to systematically kill millions of Jews, Slavs and others whom the Nazis considered \\"Untermenschen\\", primarily by gassing, but also in mass executions and through extreme work under starvation conditions. - Franciszek Piper ( born 1941 ) is a Polish scholar , historian and author . Most of his work concerns the Holocaust , especially the history of the Auschwitz concentration camp . Dr. Piper is credited as one of the historians who helped establish a more accurate number of victims of Auschwitz - Birkenau death camps . According to his research , at least 1.1 million people perished at Auschwitz - Birkenau , of whom about 960,000 were Jewish . He is the author of several books and chair of the Historical Department at the Auschwitz - Birkenau State Museum . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. - Following the Invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II, nearly a quarter of the entire territory of the Second Polish Republic was annexed by Nazi Germany and placed directly under the German civil administration. The rest of Nazi occupied Poland was renamed as the General Government district. The annexation was part of the \\"fourth\\" partition of Poland by Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, outlined months before the invasion, in the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. - Nazi Germany maintained concentration camps (KZ or KL) throughout the territories it controlled before and during the Second World War. The first Nazi camps were erected in Germany in March 1933 immediately after Hitler became Chancellor and his Nazi Party was given control over the police through Reich Interior Minister Wilhelm Frick and Prussian Acting Interior Minister Hermann Göring.

The story sheds more light on the now famous skill and daring of the SEALs. But the book's very existence stoked controversy because members of the elite unit don't usually divulge details of their operations.

Goodwin had been helping a neighbor clear brush from a property when he accidentally provoked the hive, resulting in a massive onslaught of the bees. Africanized honey bees are a strain of bees known for their fierce defense of their nest, and their highly aggressive behavior. In this case, Larry Goodwin became an unfortunate victim of their wrath. The fatal event occurred when Goodwin was assisting a neighbor in clearing brush on their land, with the intention of creating more space and fostering a better environment for wildlife. However, he unknowingly came too close to the bees' nest while carrying out the task, prompting a swarm of the Africanized honey bees to attack him. An unsuspecting Goodwin was engulfed by the bees and was unable to escape the relentless swarm that chased him for almost a mile. This is a common pattern observed in such bee attacks, where the insects will pursue a perceived threat for up to a mile, attacking in large groups that quickly become overwhelming. The entire incident was a chilling example of the potential dangers of Africanized honey bees and their forceful protection of their nest. These bees are widely acknowledged as a caution for residents and outdoor enthusiasts in regions where they are found, as their presence is not only a threat to human safety but also to native bee species. Descended from South African bees originally introduced to Brazil in an attempt to increase honey production, Africanized honey bees have since spread throughout the Americas, making their way to Texas in the 1990s. The species is a hybrid of the European honey bee and the African honey bee, which results in a bee that is much more aggressive and defensive than its European counterpart. The dangerous nature of these bees has garnered significant media attention in recent years, with several cases of individuals being seriously injured, and even killed, by the swarms. Experts advise that avoidance is the best course of action when it comes to these bees, urging people to steer clear of any hives they may encounter and to avoid making any sudden, loud noises or movements that could provoke the insects. Furthermore, residents in areas with a known presence of Africanized honey bees are encouraged to familiarize themselves with signs and measures to take if an attack occurs. Immediate retreat, covering one's face, and seeking shelter are crucial steps that can help minimize the risks during an encounter with these bees. Sadly for Larry Goodwin, however, these measures could not prevent the tragic outcome. As the community reels from the loss of a beloved member, the incident serves as an important reminder of the potential dangers posed by Africanized honey bees and the need for continued public education on how to avoid and manage encounters with these aggressive insects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: - You must decide the purpose of the satellite - You must draw up a plan to what kind of orbit the satellite will travel - You make preparations for the rocket that will travel into space - Prepare the crew that will send it there - You begin the countdown date for the rocket - And then you send the rocket carrying the satellite into space","completion":"The final step in the process of launching a satellite is to successfully deploy and activate the satellite in its intended orbit. This involves the following sub-steps: 1. Reaching the desired orbit: Once the rocket has been launched, it must reach the target orbit altitude and trajectory. This may involve multiple stages of the rocket separating and firing to achieve the required velocity and altitude. 2. Separating the satellite from the rocket: When the target orbit is attained, the satellite needs to be separated from the rocket. This is done using a release mechanism that detaches the satellite from the rocket at a specific point in the orbit. 3. Stabilizing the satellite: After separation, the satellite's onboard systems need to be activated, and it may need to use thrusters to adjust its orientation and stabilize its position in orbit. 4. Activating the satellite's systems: The satellite's communication, power, and payload systems must be switched on, tested, and brought online. This typically includes deploying solar panels to generate power, activating communication antennas, and starting any instruments or sensors onboard. 5. Establishing ground communication: The satellite must establish a connection with the ground control center to enable remote control of its operations and transmit data back to Earth. 6. Monitoring and maintaining the satellite: Once the satellite is operational, it enters a routine phase where it continuously performs its intended functions while being monitored and controlled by ground operators. Regular updates and fine-tuning of its position and systems may be required to ensure its ongoing performance. Additionally, periodic software updates and troubleshooting may be needed to resolve any technical issues that arise during the satellite's operational lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: What happened? Those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen. Nightmare on Elm St. had gone noticeably downhill after it's cult-classic of a first film, but I doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration. Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film, and nobody is more distraught about it than I am. This is by far the worst ANOES film of the lot. It doesn't seem too bad at the beginning, with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring Alice. But then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events. I mean, sure, Freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy, but this one is like a train-wreck in it's poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup. It feels like you're coming down with a terrible headache, not like you're getting scared. So the directing totally fails. None of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here, and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic (the death by food especially), except for that one cool scene that's crafted like a comic book battle. That's why this movie gets a point. The storyline...lame, lame, lame, LAME. It was an excuse to gross people out and to make the MPAA mad, and nothing more. The acting...should I mention how Freddy has been turned into a childish boogey-man-like clown figure? How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old's horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we've all known and loathed since the first film? That arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again...ugh. And his one liners, too. Throughout the whole movie, they suck. Badly. A grade-schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit Freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film. Hell, a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what Freddy's been told to say here. Who wrote the script for this? This movie is really irritating, too. It seems so pointless. Like a gnat buzzing around your head, a gnat that just WON'T go away. Freddy is just an annoyance now. We've seen him so many times before. This one's nothing different, and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one-liners and get off your TV screen. Alice, instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie, seems annoying and very shallow, and this is obviously due to the horrible, horrible script this movie was fitted with. Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor, and sometimes it shines through the cracks here, but she can't save this movie. The other actors just suck, mostly. The last 15 or 20 minutes of Freddy's existence in this film are awful and embarrassing. I hope Englund was ashamed of this. Who wants to see Freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out, laughing like a cartoon villain? This movie destroyed anything positive I felt for the Nightmare series. I can't ever watch them again without this image running through my head; of the mangled cartoon abomination that Krueger became. He was slowly becoming a jokey, retarded pop culture icon, but this is the lowest of the low. This is rock bottom. Nobody will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously again after seeing this film. He's naught but a joke, a clown that is long overdue for retirement. Pathetic. Of all the movies I could hate, why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St, a series which I once adored and liked a lot? The Dream Child represents the death of a legend, and the shattering of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St. series. Freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment, Freddy's Dead (which was more entertaining than this was, actually), and then he would go on to bring down the mood in Freddy VS Jason, and finally he would putter out into nothing, which is for the best. I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now, but this movie is overall, horrible, and one of the worst movies ever made. Not recommended to anyone, and even ANOES completionists won't want to see this one again.

Attic bedrooms don’t tend to have many storage cupboards or wardrobes, so it can be really useful to add hidden storage. This gives you places to put all your things and helps to prevent the room from looking cluttered. Consider installing a window bench that doubles as drawer space, or look for a bed frame with drawer space built underneath, or install a free-standing wardrobe. If you are on a budget, consider purchasing kit-set furniture to reduce the cost. Adding a chair to your room can help to create a separate space within the room. Utilise the chair as a reading nook, a place to rest clothes, or as a feature piece. Choose a chair that is comfortable and expresses your own personal style. Armchairs are great for reading, simple wooden chairs are good for hanging clothes, and peacock chairs are great feature pieces. The vertical poles on canopy beds help to accentuate the height of the room. Choose a canopy bed with soft, draping fabric to help promote a calm and relaxing ambience. Place the bed in the highest part of the attic room to maximise the ambient and lengthening effects of the bed. Purchase a canopy bed from a furniture store or online. The human eye tends to find symmetry calming and aesthetically pleasing. Place matching bedside tables on either side of the bed to create this effect. These are also useful for storage and displaying small ornaments or plants. Opt for bedside tables that match the rest of your furniture. For example, if your headboard is made of dark wood, choose bedside tables that are also made of dark wood. Aim to have your bedside tables at a similar height to your bed. This looks nice and makes it easier to reach the items on the tables. If your attic only has one or two windows, arrange your furniture so that the natural light will rest where you spend the most time. Most likely, this will be your bed; however, you could place a desk or chair in front of the window to catch the light instead. Natural light helps to give your room a warm, cosy, and fresh atmosphere. Watch where the sun falls throughout the day. If you spend the most time in your room in the mornings, check where the sun falls in the morning.

Answer: The two countries had similar health care systems before Canada reformed its system in the 1960s and 1970s. Question: how much does U.S. pay on health care per person","completion":"To answer the given question about the amount the U.S. pays on health care per person, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Gather data on the U.S. health care spending per capita. To find an accurate answer, I need to gather recent data on the U.S. health care spending per person. Most often, this data comes from reliable sources such as the World Bank, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), or government publications. Step 2: Analyze the data and extract the relevant number. Once the data on health care spending per person is obtained, I'll identify the latest available figure that represents the per capita spending on health care in the U.S. This will give an idea of how much the U.S. pays per person for health care services.

Jack Doyle, John Stevens and Vanessa Allen. PUBLISHED:. 05:44 EST, 16 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 09:55 EST, 16 July 2013. Ian McLoughlin is an 'astonishingly bright' man who has a violent hatred of gay men despite being bisexual himself. A double killer on the run who is suspected of murdering a third is bordering on genius level but harbours a violent hatred of gay men. Bisexual Ian McLoughlin, 55, viciously attacked a paedophile he met in jail and is believed to have stabbed a neighbour who rushed to his aid after a row broke out on Saturday. Grandfather and father of three, Graham Buck, 66, was killed as he tried to help paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 87, in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire. Today, it emerged that convicted killer McLoughlin – now the focus of a ‘massive manhunt’ has an IQ of 140 and is described as 'astonishingly bright'. Anyone with a IQ above this is considered a ‘genius’. The killer has already served one sentence for killing one gay man, and was 22 years into a second jail term for murdering another homosexual. McLoughlin, who also uses the surname. Baker, absconded on Saturday while on day release from an open prison. where he is serving a 25-year sentence for murdering homosexual Peter. Halls, 55, in 1990, just months after he finished a jail term for. another homophobic killing. He murdered Mr Halls by stabbing him. through the neck while he lay face down on a bed in 1990, seven years. after he killled Len Delgatty, 49, in Stoke Newington, north London. Mr Delgatty, who. was also gay, was battered with a hammer before being strangled with a. tourniquet and then left upside down to drown in his own blood. McLoughlin,. who is bisexual but is said to hate gay men, fled the scene but later. crashed his car while drunk and was found to have used Mr Delgatty's. credit card. McLoughlin was charged with murder but. convicted of manslaughter after claiming he was incensed by Mr Delgatty. playing him a tape in which he fantasised about having sex with a. teenage boy. The alleged tape was never found. Scroll down for video. Police looking for double killer Ian McLoughlin in connection with a suspected murder in a quiet village have released this image. Wanted: Ian McLoughlin is believed to have met convicted paedophile Francis Cory-Wright, 88, in prison. Family man: Graham Buck, 66, who died in the latest killing, is circled in a family photo. The trial heard that Mr Delgatty had previously served time in prison for under-age sex and another sex offence. McLoughlin's 13-year sentence for the killing was reduced to eight years on appeal, but within 17 months of his release, McLoughlin, a drifter from Barrow-in-Furness who is said to have worked as a rent boy, killed again in September 1990. Again, his victim was gay: Peter Halls, a. publican with whom McLoughlin had been living in Brighton. He forced. him to lie face down on his bed and then stabbed him through the neck. with such force that the knife came out the other side. Forensics officers yesterday worked at Cory-Wright's stone house in the village of Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire. McLoughlin then stole luxury goods worth thousands of pounds from him. The most recent killing took place in a quiet Hertfordshire village where, it is alleged,on his first day of unsupervised. release, McLoughlin is said to have targeted the £1million home of Old. Etonian Francis Cory-Wright, 87,a convicted paedophile he got to know. while the two were in prison together. He is believed to have been. interrupted by a neighbour, named yesterday as grandfather and. father-of-three Graham Buck, who overheard shouting and went to help. McLoughlin is suspected of grabbing a. knife from the kitchen and repeatedly stabbing Mr Buck, 66, a retired. businessman, before fleeing with thousands of pounds in cash. Victim's home: A statement released by Mr Buck's family today said: 'We were all in such a happy place as a family... We cannot get over that we have lost him' At the time of Mr Halls’ death, his sister Pamela. condemned his release from jail in the first place, saying: ‘McLoughlin. should not have been released after he committed this sort of crime the. first time.’ Yesterday, when it emerged that he was. granted day release from an open prison as part of his. ‘rehabilitation’, she branded the justice system ‘a joke’. The 71-year-old mother-of-two from. Brighton said: ‘This monster has struck again and has been allowed to. strike again because he has been freed to walk the streets just as he. was with my poor brother.' ‘I pray he is caught soon. Nothing can. change men like McLoughlin, he is evil and should have been left. rotting in a prison cell where he deserves to be, not free to kill and. kill again.’ Company director Graham Buck, 66, left, died after he went to help neighbour Francis Cory-Wright, 87, right. She said she had spent more than 20 years trying to come to terms with her brother’s killing. She said: ‘I have tried to put Peter’s. killing behind me but you never forget. Now all the terrible emotions I. felt have come back to the surface. ‘McLoughlin has never shown a scrap of remorse for what he did to Peter. I would be happy if they gave him a lethal injection.’ Mr Buck leaves a wife, two sons, a. daughter and two grandchildren, and a wife from a previous marriage. His. wife, Karen, a 55-year-old nurse, said: ‘I’ve lost my rock. I wouldn’t. be able to do half the things I’ve done since being with Graham if it. wasn’t for him. He and his family have always been there for me in. difficult times. I don’t know what I’ll do without him.’ In a statement, his family added: ‘We. have no words to express how much Graham will be missed. We were all in. such a happy place as a family. We were all so settled, with growing. numbers of grandchildren whom he adored being around. ‘We haven’t seen him happier than being around his grandchildren, he was so proud. We cannot get over that we have lost him.’ Police and forensics officers worked on the houses belonging to both Mr Buck and Cory-Wright today. Police guard the home of Cory-Wright in the sleepy Hertfordshire village of Little Gaddesden, near Berkhamsted. McLoughlin was known to the police in Cumbria where he grew up, and ended up in a juvenile care home. He was convicted of a string of crimes including theft and burglary, and was described as a 'drifter'. He was married briefly but, troubled by his sexuality, it did not last, and he soon turned to more serious crime. Yesterday Detective Chief Superintendent Jeff. Hill said McLoughlin went to Cory-Wright's house for a ‘purely financial. motive’ but warned the public that McLoughlin is ‘extremely dangerous’ and should not be approached. Paying tribute to Mr Buck, he said he had. ‘paid the ultimate price for intervening at the home of an elderly. neighbour’. Cory-Wright, who suffered injuries during the attack, was discharged from hospital yesterday. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Article: UPDATES with details: A rep for the Miss USA Pageant tells Deadline fans will be able to view the pageant via the Miss USA site – http://www.missuniverse.com/missusa – and more information will be announced soon. That presumably includes names of a new host, or hosts, for the pageant. Both previously announced co-hosts, who also host NBCU programs, confirmed today they were stepping down, in the wake of NBC’s announcement it was pulling its broadcast of the pageant in the wake of Donald Trump’s extremely controversial comment about Mexican immigrants. Trump has told Bill O’Reilly that those who have stepped away from participating in the pageant broadcast have “abandoned 50 of the most lovely women you’ve ever seen” and so far he’s sued Univision over its decision to yank its broadcast of the pageant. That interview airs tonight on FNC’s The O’Reilly Factor. Meanwhile, one of those bailed co-hosts, Thomas Roberts, this afternoon tweeted obliviously: Previous: An NBC rep confirmed Thomas Roberts is withdrawing as co-host from the Miss USA Pageant in the wake of NBC’s decision to pull the plug on its broadcast over co-owner Donald Trump’s comments about Mexican immigrants: NBC’s announcement yesterday it was pulling the plug on its Miss USA Pageant broadcast exploded the entire pageant on-air talent arrangement, given how much NBCU talent had been lined up for the competition/broadcast. Before Donald Trump laid out his thoughts on the Mexican border in announcing his White House bid, Roberts, host of NBCU’s MSNBC Live With Thomas Roberts, was announced as returning to host the Miss USA Pageant. He was to have been teamed, for the first time, with Cheryl Burke of NBC’s I Can Do That. Burke was first to make it official that she was exiting as Miss USA co-host. The first group of judges to join the Miss USA judging panel was going to include Terrence Jenkins, aka co-anchor of NBCU’s E! News. And, behind-the-scenes commentator Jeannie Mai, aka NBC’s Today fashion correspondent, was announced as returning to take viewers backstage to engage with contestants and talent throughout the telecast – a broadcast that no longer is happening. Roberts first hosted NBC/Trump’s other pageant, Miss Universe, in 2013 when it was caught up in another controversy. He and Mel B had replaced Andy Cohen and Giuliana Rancic, who dropped out because of the pageant’s filming location in Moscow and Russia’s anti-gay laws. Roberts said he aggressively campaigned to replace Cohen, seeing it as a big opportunity for LGBT people; he is openly gay. Back then, the Miss Universe Organization issued a statement that the new Russian laws are “diametrically opposed to the core values” of Miss Universe. Miss USA Pageant organizers announced this morning the 2015 competition still will take place on July 12, though NBC as well as Univision have bailed on broadcasting the annual event owing to co-owner Trump’s comments on Mexican immigration. “We are disheartened by recent events but the show will go on,” the pageant’s governing body announced this morning, calling it an event that “is built on a foundation of inclusion and continues to be a celebration of diversity and of all cultures,” adding, “This year’s Miss USA contestants represent many different ethnic backgrounds, including six Latinas (four of whom are of Mexican descent).” One day earlier, NBC announced it was dumping the pageant broadcast, as well as the Miss Universe Pageant broadcast, and was splitting from Trump, with whom NBC co-owns the two pageants. NBC said it was breaking up with Trump because of his remarks about immigrants made in his speech two weeks ago, announcing his White House bid. “At NBC, respect and dignity for all people are cornerstones of our values,” NBC said yesterday. “Due to the recent derogatory statements by Donald Trump regarding immigrants, NBCUniversal is ending its business relationship with Mr. Trump.” Univision had beaten NBC to the punch by a week, announcing it was dumping the Miss USA Pageant broadcast as well, owing to Trump’s comments. Yesterday’s NBC announcement had some industry pundits wondering what took NBC so long; the day Trump made his controversial remarks, NBC issued a statement saying it did not endorse them. The real estate tycoon, who says he will sue Univision and may sue NBC as well, made the remarks earlier this month as he announced his POTUS candidacy: “When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.” This morning, the Miss Universe Organization said, “It is unfortunate that recent events beyond our control have only served to negatively impact the women who participate in the pageant, our state directors, our sponsors and our fans. We want our supporters to know we remain to committed to them and we will be conducting the pageant, regardless of the current situation.” ||||| NEW YORK (AP) — As fallout built over Donald Trump's remarks about immigrants from Mexico, the Republican presidential candidate answered back with legal action to match his trademark brashness, filing a 500 million lawsuit.

Ora TV became the latest company to cut ties with Trump over his presidential campaign kickoff speech in which he declared that some Mexican immigrants bring drugs and crime to the U.S. and are rapists. The company did not give any details about the project it had been developing with Trump. Slim holds a majority interest in Ora TV, which produces shows including \\"Larry King Now\\" and \\"Off the Grid with Jesse Ventura.\\" And a day after Televisa, the Mexican TV network that airs Miss Universe, said there would be no telecast for the next contest, Miss Mexico pageant director Lupita Jones said Mexico would boycott Miss Universe. Jones said Trump damaged the pageant and its tradition of convening countries for an event that showcases \\"friendship, unity and breaking down cultural barriers.\\" NBC previously announced it would not air the Miss USA or Miss Universe pageants. In a TV interview, Trump said contestants are suffering because of the backlash. \\"We have 50 of the most lovely women you've ever seen right now in Louisiana, and they have been abandoned by NBC and abandoned by Univision,\\" Trump said on Fox News Channel's \\"The O'Reilly Factor,\\" adding, \\"They have been crushed.\\" Trump refused to back down from his campaign remarks, calling them \\"totally accurate.\\" The Miss USA pageant, set to take place July 12 in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, also lost both its co-hosts Tuesday, with \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" Cheryl Burke and MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts bowing out. The Miss USA pageant had no specifics on who might host in their place but said the proceedings would be live-streamed on its website. Last week, the hosts of the Univision simulcast, Roselyn Sanchez and Cristian de la Fuente, said they wouldn't take part in the Spanish-language telecast. Aftershocks spread into another lucrative part of Trump's empire, as the Ricky Martin Foundation announced it would withdraw a golf tournament from a Trump-owned property. The tournament, which draws professional players and big sponsors, raises money for child advocacy and scholarships for Latino students. It was to be held Aug. 21 at the Trump International Golf Club in Rio Grande, Puerto Rico. It has been moved to the Wyndham Grand Rio Mar Beach Resort. The PGA Tour, which runs a World Golf Championship at Trump Doral near Miami, and the PGA of America, declined to comment on whether Trump's remarks would impact their relationships with him. ___ Associated Press writers Mae Anderson, Katherine Corcoran, Doug Ferguson and Lynn Elber contributed to this report. ||||| Donald Trump has filed a 500 million lawsuit against Univision after the network dropped his Miss USA pageant over his comments about Mexican people. Univision last week announced it would not broadcast July 12’s Miss USA pageant taking place in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, after Trump described some Mexican immigrants as criminals and “rapists” during his June 16 announcement that he’s running for president. On Tuesday Trump filed a lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court. He said in a statement, “Nothing that I stated was different from what I have been saying for many years. I want strong borders, and I do not support or condone illegal immigration. There is a high level of crime occurring in this country due to unchecked illegal immigration. This is a major security issue for the United States. Additionally, the terrible trade deals our government is routinely entering into with Mexico are causing great financial harm to our country. We are losing a huge number of jobs, manufacturing opportunities and money due to poorly negotiated trade deals, a fact that [is] undisputable. That won’t happen if I become president — this disturbing trend will end and it will end quickly.” He continued, “I have great respect for Mexico and love for the Mexican people and their tremendous spirit! However, their leaders and trade negotiators are far smarter than those representing the United States, and our citizens and economy are suffering greatly as a result. We have to remedy the situation and do it fast. These have long been my views and I have the courage, unlike many others, to express them. “As a consequence of their inappropriate actions, Univision and NBC have abandoned fifty one wonderful young women who have come from all over the United States to pursue their dream of being crowned Miss USA. Their participation in this globally renowned pageant has come at great cost and after years of sacrifice and hard work. NBC and Univision have wronged them greatly.” In his 500 million lawsuit against Univision, Trump claims the decision to drop his Miss USA pageant was a political stunt masterminded by Hillary Clinton supporter, billionaire Haim Saban. The papers state, “The decision was, in reality, a thinly veiled attempt by Univision, a privately held company principally owned by longtime Clinton Foundation donor and current Hillary Clinton fundraiser, Haim Saban, to suppress Mr Trump’s freedom of speech under the First Amendment as begins to campaign for the nation’s presidency, and, in recent weeks, has dramatically risen in the polls while expressing critical views of Mrs. Clinton.” Donald Trump complaint ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a brief statement or account of the main points of a story, article, or event.

UPDATED:. 12:58 EST, 28 January 2014. She may have been living in her best friend Lucy Mecklenburgh's shadow but Ferne McCann is keen to make a name for herself. Her first port of call? Replacing Lucy as the face - and incredibly toned body - of By Caprice's Valentine's lingerie range. CEO and designer Caprice snapped up Essex's hottest new export to front the campaign for her new collection. Scroll down for video. Move over, Lucy! Ferne McCann has replaced her best friend Miss Mecklenburgh as the face of By Caprice's new lingerie range. The 23-year-old, who had. a particularly tumultuous appearance in the last series of the. Bafta-winning show, showcases her svelte body in a range of pretty pink lingerie in the new shots. Speaking about her latest signing, Caprice said: 'Ferne looks foxy in the Valentine's Day collection. 'She is empowered and confident in her own skin, a true natural in front of the camera. 'Ferne epitomises everything By Caprice encompasses and the perfect ambassador - she's fun, fashionable and sexy. Showcasing her physique: The 23-year-old dons a range of pretty pink lingerie in the new shots, just in time for Valentine's day. 'She has an incredible figure with curves in all the right places. We are absolutely thrilled to be working with Ferne.' But Ferne, who in this week's Closer magazine confessed to she 'loves posing in underwear', says she works hard for those curves - and is inspired by her TOWIE co-stars. 'It's hard not to get motivated when you look at Lucy Mecklenburgh's body, but I've had to put in more work than her,' she told the magazine. 'Lucy is naturally skinny - she had a head start. There's no doubt she's worked hard, but bigger girls have to work harder. I've got curves and a big bum - I'm completely different to Lucy.' Ferne confessed too that she exercises five times a week - three times with a personal trainer, once with a friend and a running session with her mother. As a result of the exercise and sensible eating, she says she now feels 'sexy'. Speaking about her latest coup, Ferne said: 'I am a huge fan of By Caprice and delighted to be fronting the new collection. 'The designs are not only beautiful and feminine but the cut also adds a touch of sexiness. The supportive designs give you amazing lift and are flattering on all body shapes, making you feel special from the inside out.' Essex's hottest new export: CEO Caprice said of Ferne: 'she has an incredible figure with curves in all the right places. We are absolutely thrilled to be working with her' Ferne split with boyfriend Charlie Sims when he was caught cheating last year, and took another. break over Christmas when she admitted to having 'trust. issues'. And in recent weeks, Ferne hinted at a third break-up. In her Star magazine column she wrote: 'I felt like I needed a break - I definitely needed some head space and some girly time. 'It has been lovely and I feel much more relaxed now.' There may be trouble ahead: Ferne has revealed that things are going to 'kick off' in the upcoming series of TOWIE. Collaboration: CEO and designer Caprice snapped up Ferne to front the campaign for her new collection. But admitted that she is preparing for it to all kick off when filming starts up again. Ferne told the magazine: 'When we. start filming TOWIE again in February it will be intense. I'm going to. have to face what's going on. 'Being on a reality show you have to do that. I'm sure it's going to all explode.' TOWIE pals: Ferne heads out for dinner with co-star Billie Faiers. The collection is available now.

Q:Information: - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett (19482015), set on the fictional Discworld, a flat disc balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle, Great A'Tuin. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard, H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens, and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with current cultural, political and scientific issues. The series is popular, with more than 80 million books sold in 37 languages. - William Shakespeare (26 April 1564 (baptised) 23 April 1616) was an English :poet, :playwright, and actor, widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He is often called England's national poet, and the \\"Bard of Avon\\". His extant works, including collaborations, consist of approximately 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a few other verses, some of uncertain authorship. His plays have been translated into every major living language and are performed more often than those of any other playwright. - Robert Ervin Howard (January 22, 1906 June 11, 1936) was an American author who wrote pulp fiction in a diverse range of genres. He is well known for his character Conan the Barbarian and is regarded as the father of the sword and sorcery subgenre. - In Classical Greek mythology, Hippolyta (\\"Hippolyte\\") was the Amazonian queen who possessed a magical girdle she was given by her father Ares, the god of war. The girdle was a waist belt that signified her authority as queen of the Amazons. She figures prominently in the myths of both Heracles and Theseus. As such, the myths about her are varied enough that they may be about several different women. - The Carpet People is a fantasy novel by British writer Terry Pratchett. It was originally published in 1971, but was later re-written by the author when his work became more widespread and well-known. In the Author's Note of the revised edition, published in 1992, Pratchett wrote: \\"This book had two authors, and they were both the same person.\\" - Sir Terence David John \\"Terry\\" Pratchett, OBE (28 April 1948 12 March 2015) was an English author of fantasy novels, especially comical works. He is best known for his Discworld series of 41 novels. Pratchett's first novel, \\"The Carpet People\\", was published in 1971. The first Discworld novel, \\"The Colour of Magic\\", was published in 1983, after which he wrote two books a year on average. His 2011 Discworld novel \\"Snuff\\" was at the time of its release the third-fastest-selling hardback adult-readership novel since records began in the UK, selling 55,000 copies in the first three days. His final Discworld novel, \\"The Shepherd's Crown\\", was published in August 2015, five months after his death. - The Colour of Magic is a 1983 comic fantasy novel by Terry Pratchett, and is the first book of the \\"Discworld\\" series. The first printing of the British edition consisted of 506 copies. Pratchett has described it as \\"an attempt to do for the classical fantasy universe what \\"Blazing Saddles\\" did for Westerns.\\" - Lords and Ladies is the fourteenth Discworld book by Terry Pratchett . It was originally published in 1992 . Much of the storyline spoofs elements of Shakespeare 's play A Midsummer Night 's Dream . - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs. - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics. - Howard Phillips Lovecraft (August 20, 1890 March 15, 1937) was an American author who achieved posthumous fame through his influential works of horror fiction. Virtually unknown and published only in pulp magazines before he died in poverty, he is now regarded as one of the most significant 20th-century authors in his genre. Lovecraft was born in Providence, Rhode Island, where he spent most of his life. Among his most celebrated tales are \\"The Call of Cthulhu\\" and \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\", both canonical to the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". Never able to support himself from earnings as author and editor, Lovecraft saw commercial success increasingly elude him in this latter period, partly because he lacked the confidence and drive to promote himself. He subsisted in progressively straitened circumstances in his last years; an inheritance was completely spent by the time he died at the age of 46. - John Ronald Reuel Tolkien, (3 January 1892 2 September 1973), known by his pen name J. R. R. Tolkien, was an English writer, poet, philologist, and university professor who is best known as the author of the classic high-fantasy works \\"The Hobbit\\", \\"The Lord of the Rings\\", and \\"The Silmarillion\\". - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812 9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. One of the leading contemporary recording artists, she is known for narrative songs about her personal life, which have received widespread media coverage. Born and raised in Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at the age of 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed with the label Big Machine Records and became the youngest artist ever signed by the Sony/ATV Music publishing house. One of Swift's earliest musical memories is listening to her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \\"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own\\". Swift has said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child. She also attributes her \\"fascination with writing and storytelling\\" to her mother. Swift was drawn to the storytelling of country music, and was introduced to the genre by \\"the great female country artists of the '90s\\"--Shania Twain, Faith Hill and the Dixie Chicks. Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence. Hill was Swift's childhood role model: \\"Everything she said, did, wore, I tried to copy it\\". She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments. The band's \\"Cowboy Take Me Away\\" was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar. Swift also explored the music of older country stars, including Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette. She believes Parton is \\"an amazing example to every female songwriter out there\\". Alt-country artists such as Ryan Adams, Patty Griffin and Lori McKenna have inspired Swift. Swift lists Paul McCartney, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models: \\"They've taken chances, but they've also been the same artist for their entire careers\\". McCartney, both as a Beatle and a solo artist, makes Swift feel \\"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind ... Any musician could only dream of a legacy like that\\". She admires Springsteen for being \\"so musically relevant after such a long period of time\\". She aspires to be like Harris as she grows older: \\"It's not about fame for her, it's about music\\". \\"[Kristofferson] shines in songwriting ... He's just one of those people who has been in this business for years but you can tell it hasn't chewed him up and spat him out\\", Swift says. She admires Simon's \\"songwriting and honesty ... She's known as an emotional person but a strong person\\". Swift has also been influenced by many artists outside the country genre. As a pre-teen, she enjoyed bubblegum pop acts including Hanson and Britney Spears; Swift has said she has \\"unwavering devotion\\" for Spears. In her high school years, Swift listened to rock bands such as Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World. She has also spoken fondly of singers and songwriters like Michelle Branch, Alanis Morissette, Ashlee Simpson, Fefe Dobson and Justin Timberlake; and the 1960s acts The Shirelles, Doris Troy, and The Beach Boys. Swift's fifth album, the pop-focused 1989, was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Annie Lennox, Phil Collins and \\"Like a Prayer-era Madonna\\". Did Taylor have a favorite rock band?","completion":"Yes, Taylor Swift enjoyed listening to rock bands when she was in high school. Some of her favorite rock bands were Dashboard Confessional, Fall Out Boy, and Jimmy Eat World."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: I heard that Kendall gave their friends money because they were in a time of need. And I was wondering How would Others feel as a result? The answer is:","completion":"To determine how others would feel about Kendall's action of giving money to their friends in need, we can analyze the different perspectives of individuals involved or witnessing the situation. I will break it down into three common categories. 1. Kendall's friends who received financial help: These friends would likely feel grateful and relieved since their financial burden has been eased during a difficult time. They might also appreciate Kendall's kindness and generosity, which could strengthen their bond and trust in their friendship. 2. Other friends who are not directly involved: These friends might feel a range of emotions, depending on their relationship with Kendall and their own values. Some may admire Kendall's generosity and compassion, while others may feel envious or concerned. Envy could arise if they compare their own friendship with Kendall to the one that received financial assistance, whereas concern may stem from a worry that Kendall may be taken advantage of or may expect something in return. 3. People who are not friends, but are aware of the situation: Their feelings may vary greatly depending on their values and perspectives. Some may view Kendall's actions as a commendable act of generosity, empathy, and compassion. On the other hand, some may question Kendall's motives or worry about the potential implications of financial dependence. In summary, people's feelings about Kendall's action of giving money to their friends in need may differ widely depending on their relationship to the individuals involved and their personal beliefs and values. Some common feelings may include gratitude, admiration, envy, concern, or skepticism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: In what century was this castle erected that was destroyed and replaced several times and whose name is derived from the common Scottish surname Douglas? Answer:","completion":"The castle in question is Douglas Castle, which was erected in the 13th century. Its history is quite elaborate, matching the complexity and intricacy of the question. Douglas Castle, located in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, was originally built around the late 13th century by the Douglas family, to whom the name of the castle owes its origin. The word 'Douglas' literally means 'black stream' in Gaelic, but it eventually evolved into a common Scottish surname over time, which was adopted by the family that lived in this castle. The original castle built in the 13th century was a stronghold for the Douglas family, playing an influential role throughout history, particularly during the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century. It was because of these wars, and the castle's strategic importance, that it was destroyed and reconstructed several times over the centuries. The different versions of the Douglas Castle have varied in structure and design, ranging from medieval strongholds to a large mansion house. The first castle was likely to be a simple wooden and earthwork construction. It was replaced by a stone castle in the late 13th or early 14th century, which was subsequently destroyed and replaced. This pattern of destruction and replacement persisted over several centuries with each reinvention of the castle reflecting the architectural style and defensive requirements of the period. Notably, one of the most famous structures, the 17th-century castle, was destroyed under the order of Oliver Cromwell during the Third English Civil War. A new castle was then erected during the late 17th and early 18th centuries; this building was known as the 'Castle Dangerous,' as it featured in Sir Walter Scott's novel of the same name. In the late 18th century, the aforementioned structure was replaced by a grand, Georgian mansion, which unfortunately was destroyed by fire in the 20th century. Today, all that remains are the ruins of the old castle and some remnants of the mansion, standing as a testament to its rich and tumultuous history across many centuries. The story of Douglas Castle's origin, its changes throughout history, and its current status as a historical ruin serve as a fascinating exploration of Scotland's past, from the medieval period, through the Renaissance, to modern times. It is a castle whose history is intimately tied to the evolution of Scottish architecture, military tactics, and the broader sociopolitical context of Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

What is the answer they should choose between \\"man flees for his life\\" and \\"man is sitting in the stands\\"? Logic test: A man is sitting in the stands watching bullfighters at work. He moves a little closer, just as one of the bulls breaks free of its enclosure. In a panic, the man flees for his life. He's more likely to work up a sweat while running because (A) he's exerting himself while running (B) he's not exerting himself at all while running Answer:","completion":"The answer your students should choose for this logic test is (A) he's exerting himself while running. To understand why this is the correct answer, let's break down the situation and the reasoning behind it. The test scenario describes a man who is initially sitting in the stands, calmly watching bullfighters at work. However, when a bull breaks free of its enclosure and puts the man in potential danger, his response is to flee for his life. When the man is sitting in the stands, he is not performing any strenuous physical activity. As a result, his body is not generating any extra heat, which would cause him to sweat. Sweating is the body's way of cooling itself down when it starts to overheat due to physical exertion. On the other hand, when the man starts running, his muscles are working much harder than they were when he was sitting. This increased activity requires more energy from his body, which in turn generates heat. As a result, the man's body temperature starts to rise, and this triggers the sweating process to help cool him down. Now, if we compare the two situations - the man sitting in the stands and the man fleeing for his life - it becomes clear that the man is more likely to work up a sweat while running. This is because his level of physical exertion is much higher when he is running away from the bull than when he is sitting and observing the bullfight. Consequently, his body will need to produce more sweat to regulate his temperature during this intense activity. Therefore, the answer your students should choose is (A) he's exerting himself while running. This option aligns with the logical reasoning and understanding of how the human body responds to differing levels of physical exertion. The other option, (B) he's not exerting himself at all while running, contradicts the logic of the scenario and the body's natural response to physical activity, making it an incorrect choice in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Open the cut, flattening the meat out as much as possible. If you want, you can take a meat tenderizer and hammer out the pork slightly, to open up the tenderloin to hold all the stuffing. Depending on how much stuffing you make, it might be necessary. You'll end up tying it up anyway, so feel free to flatten it out considerably. Stuffing tenderloin with a mixture of dry bread, cheese, bacon, and vegetables can up the ante considerably. If you want to kick grilled tenderloin up a couple of notches, stuffing it is the way to go. You can experiment with ingredients that you like, or go with a few tried-and-true standards. Bacon-mushroom stuffing: In a skillet, crisp up 3-4 slices of bacon, then add two cups of white button mushrooms, and a pinch of salt. Let the mushrooms sit untouched for one minute, then stir to coat them in the mixture and cook until soft. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and cook until soft. To this, add 2-3 tablespoons of dried breadcrumbs, and a handful of fresh chopped parsley to complete the stuffing mixture. Italian Spinach stuffing: In a food processor, add a cup of fresh baby spinach leaves, a half cup of fresh basil, two cloves of garlic, and 2-4 tablespoons of grated parmesan cheese. Add a pinch of crushed red pepper, Italian seasoning, and a drizzle of balsamic vinegar to finish the stuffing. Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Tenderloin: In a bowl, combine a small finely chopped onion, 1-2 stalks of celery, 1-2 slices of dry toast, torn into small pieces, 3 tablespoons of melted butter, and salt, pepper, and oregano. Use this to stuff the tenderloin, then roll it up and wrap the whole thing with 6-8 strips of bacon, around the width of the meat. Tie it and grill it as normal. It's a delicious combo. After you've flattened it out slightly, you can spread an even layer of whatever stuffing you've mixed up over the inside of the meat, then either roll it up or truss it up, depending on how flat it is and how thick a layer of stuffing you've added. If you want to roll up your tenderloin, spread a thin layer of stuffing on the meat, no more than a quarter inch or so. Start rolling the meat on the long flat side, tucking the stuffing on the inside, so it spirals. After you've rolled it up, tie it to keep it together. If you want to keep the tenderloin more whole, don't pound it out, and stuff your stuffing into the butterfly cut as thickly as you want. Wrap it tightly in plastic wrap to get the shape to hold, then you can tie it up with twine before grilling. Wrap a piece of cooking twine around the width of the meat to close up the cut. You don't have to get fancy, just take a few short pieces of twine and tie at least three times around the meat, one in the middle, and one at each end. If you don't have cooking twine, you can use some kebab skewers to pin the 2 sides of the meat together, pinching it closed. After the meat is cooked, remove the skewers and slice normally. Follow the basic instructions for grilling a whole tenderloin, browning on all sides, then cooking at a cooler part of the grill for about 20 minutes. If you've got a particularly-messy stuffing, you might move the tenderloin onto a piece of tinfoil after moving it to the cooler part of the grill, to collect the mess. Take some care when you're testing the temperature of the meat, so you don't stick the reader into the stuffing, getting an inaccurate reading. The internal temperature of the meat, not the stuffing, should be between 140 and 155 degrees F (68 degrees C) according to a meat thermometer. Don't remove the twine right away, or the meat might start to unroll and come apart. Let the stuffed tenderloin rest normally and it'll hold it's shape. After 10 or 15 minutes, remove the twine and slice into inch-thick portions, and serve. What is a summary?","completion":"The article provides a guide on how to stuff and prepare a pork tenderloin for grilling. To begin, cut and flatten the tenderloin to create space for the stuffing.

But when I did I was really impressed, and I can honestly say that nothing I’ve reviewed since has disappointed me! Today I’m reviewing Temple Spa Trufflesque, an Ultra Hydration & Radiance Masque for the face. Trufflesque aims to give hydration and radiance to the skin, and plumps to help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It’s a luxury mask suitable for all skin types, particularly dry or dull skin, and it helps to rejuvenate tired skin too. The impressive list of ingredients includes black truffles, gold and silk peptides, but unfortunately these expensive additives contribute to Trufflesque’s slightly expensive price tag. The first thing that strikes me about this product is the amazing packaging. All Temple Spa products have really amazing, premium packaging, and I feel that they add to the feeling that you are about to use something really special on your skin. The dark glass jar has a gold lid and it is nestled in a gold and chocolate brown box with the most amazingly cute mask brush slotted in too. The mask itself is gold and it shimmers so prettily, if you look closely it’s almost as if you can see the particles of real gold!

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Lukather is the original lead guitarist for Toto, serving in that capacity for the band's entire history, as well as a lead and backing vocalist and composer. Lukather won three of his five Grammy Awards for work with Toto, twice as an artist and once as a producer. David Paich led the band's songwriting efforts during the development of 1978's Toto—he penned all but two of the album's tracks, including all four of its singles. Lukather also credits Jeff Porcaro for his leadership within the band during that period. However, Lukather's role in Toto evolved over time owing to the changing needs of the band. In August 1992, Jeff Porcaro collapsed while doing yard work at home and subsequently died of heart failure. The death profoundly affected Toto and Lukather in particular, who felt that he needed to step up and make sure the band kept going. Thus, he began taking more of a leadership role. Toto went through several lead vocalists over the years, including Bobby Kimball, Fergie Frederiksen, and Joseph Williams. After the 1990 dismissal of their fourth vocalist, Jean-Michel Byron, Toto was without a lead singer until around 1997; Lukather assumed most of the vocal duties for the band during that time. He performed lead vocals for every track on 1992's Kingdom of Desire and 1995's Tambu except for two instrumental tracks. The Tambu single \\"I Will Remember\\", co-written by Lukather and Stan Lynch, reached number 64 on UK charts. Some Tambu reviewers contrasted Lukather's vocals with those of former singers Kimball and Williams (and indeed, heavily criticized the entire album), some concert reviewers noted that he struggled vocally on certain songs, and a number of backup singers and guest vocalists accompanied the band's live shows during that period. It was not until Toto brought back Williams and Kimball to collaborate on 1998's Toto XX that Lukather returned predominantly to the role of backup vocalist.Lukather's songwriting contributions grew from a smattering of tracks on early Toto albums to co-writing... answer the following question: What is the name of the person David encouraged to write more songs for the band?

From the moment my friends and I walked through the door, we were greeted with a warm and welcoming atmosphere that instantly put us at ease. The beautiful dining area is adorned with a subtle blend of rustic and modern décor, creating a charming ambiance that's perfect for any gathering, be it a family brunch, a romantic date, or a casual meet-up with friends. Given that the Café earns its namesake from its delightful and cozy atmosphere, one would be wise to claim a window seat to watch the world go by as they sip their coffee. One of the things I absolutely loved about the Cozy Corner Café is their impressive selection of freshly baked goods, decadent desserts, and handcrafted beverages. The café prides itself on artisanal offerings, ensuring the use of top-notch ingredients and presenting dishes that are as aesthetically pleasing as they are scrumptious. We simply couldn't resist trying an array of items, so we opted for the raspberry white chocolate scones, avocado toast with poached eggs, and their signature cappuccino with a touch of cinnamon. The standout of our dining experience had to be the raspberry white chocolate scones. These scones were nothing like the typical dry and crumbly ones you'll typically find; these were rich, moist, and bursting with the perfect balance of tangy raspberries and sweet white chocolate. Our taste buds were completely blown away! Additionally, the avocado toast was divine. The toast itself had a beautiful, rustic crust with a satisfying chew, topped with velvety avocado, ripe cherry tomatoes, and perfectly poached eggs. Breaking into the eggs, the creamy yolk cascaded down, merging harmoniously with the avocado and toast. It's safe to say that the Cozy Corner Café has set a new standard for avocado toast in my book. Finally, the cappuccino was the pièce de résistance of the entire meal. Expertly crafted and served with a beautiful cinnamon heart dusted on the foam, it elevated our entire dining experience. The flavors were bold and rich but not overpowering – a true testament to their skilled baristas. Above all, what sets the Cozy Corner Café apart from the rest is their outstanding customer service. Right from the warm welcome by the hostess to the attentive server who checked up on us just the right amount, every staff member we interacted with was genuinely friendly, courteous, and, most importantly, efficient. Their obvious passion for quality service made a lasting impression on our group. In conclusion, the Cozy Corner Café exceeded my expectations by leaps and bounds. Their commitment to providing top-notch food, a comfortable ambiance, and outstanding service is immediately apparent, and I know that this café has earned itself a lifelong customer in me. I highly recommend the Cozy Corner Café to anyone looking for a memorable dining experience – you will not be disappointed!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? OPTIONS: (1). no. (2). yes.","completion":"These two questions are quite different in terms of the functions being considered; thus, the correct option in terms of the similarity of the given questions is as follows: (1). No. Now, let's solve each question separately: 1. [math]limlimits_{xtoinfty} frac{1+2+3+cdots x}{x²}[/math] First, we know that the sum of integers from 1 to x can be written as: [math]frac{x(x+1)}{2}[/math] So the expression becomes: [math]limlimits_{xtoinfty} frac{x(x+1)/2}{x²}[/math] Now, let's simplify this expression by dividing both numerator and denominator by x²: [math]limlimits_{xtoinfty} frac{frac{1}{2}(1 + frac{1}{x})}{1}[/math] Taking the limit as x approaches infinity, the term (1/x) tends to zero: [math]limlimits_{xtoinfty} frac{frac{1}{2}(1 + 0)}{1} = frac{1}{2}[/math] So, the value of the limit is [math]frac{1}{2}[/math]. 2. [math]ninmathbb{N}[/math], [math]lim_{xtoinfty} x^n cdot e^{-x} [/math] Let's analyze the behavior of the given limit using L'Hôpital's rule. It's important to note that L'Hôpital's rule is valid when both the numerator and the denominator tend to either 0 or [math]infty[/math]. Therefore, we should first rewrite the expression to make it suitable for the rule: [math]lim_{xtoinfty} x^n cdot e^{-x} = lim_{xtoinfty} frac{x^n}{e^x}[/math] Now the expression fits the conditions for L'Hôpital's rule. Taking the derivative of the numerator and the denominator, we get: [math]lim_{xtoinfty} frac{nx^{n-1}}{e^x}[/math] However, this indeterminate form continues: applying L'Hôpital's rule n times will yield: [math]lim_{xtoinfty} frac{n!}{e^x}[/math] Now, let's rewrite the function as an exponential function: [math]lim_{xtoinfty} frac{n!}{e^x} = lim_{xtoinfty} e^{ln(n!) - x}[/math] As x goes to infinity, the exponential term [math]e^{-x}[/math] goes to 0 since [math]ln(n!)[/math] is a constant. Therefore, the limit is: [math]lim_{xtoinfty} x^n cdot e^{-x} = 0[/math] In conclusion, the solution to the first question is [math]frac{1}{2}[/math], and for the second question, the solution is zero.

Although it is believed Harry was off duty at. the time, the battle continued for four hours resulting in the deaths of two US. servicemen and the destruction of several planes and helicopters. Nasrullah, his face covered by a scarf, asked. in the secret Mirror interview why the British people did not take notice of. the suffering of children in Kunar province as a result of NATO air strikes.

For evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant, without being unfairly prejudicial, and it must have some indicia of reliability. The general rule in evidence is that all relevant evidence is admissible and all irrelevant evidence is inadmissible. - Forensic anthropology is the application of the science of anthropology and its various subfields, including forensic archaeology and forensic taphonomy, in a legal setting. A forensic anthropologist can assist in the identification of deceased individuals whose remains are decomposed, burned, mutilated or otherwise unrecognizable, as might happen in a plane crash. Forensic anthropologists are also instrumental to the investigation and documentation of genocide and mass graves. Along with forensic pathologists, forensic dentists, and homicide investigators, forensic anthropologists commonly testify in court as expert witnesses. Using physical markers present on a skeleton, a forensic anthropologist can potentially determine a victim's age, sex, stature, and ancestry. In addition to identifying physical characteristics of the individual, forensic anthropologists can use skeletal abnormalities to potentially determine cause of death, past trauma such as broken bones or medical procedures, as well as diseases such as bone cancer. - The American Academy of Forensic Sciences (AAFS) is a society for forensics professionals, founded in 1948.

Do these sentences have the same meaning? A race observer sits in the passenger seat of the vehicle following the contestant car to record broken rules and track of the car 's time . A race observer sits in the passenger seat of the follow vehicle to record any broken rules and also keep track of the car 's time .","completion":"While these sentences appear to convey similar ideas, there are subtle differences between them that provide nuance to their meanings. Let's break down each sentence and compare their individual components. Sentence 1: \\"A race observer sits in the passenger seat of the vehicle following the contestant car to record broken rules and track of the car's time.\\" Sentence 2: \\"A race observer sits in the passenger seat of the follow vehicle to record any broken rules and also keep track of the car's time.\\" Both sentences describe a race observer sitting in the passenger seat for the purpose of recording and timekeeping during a race. However, the specific details about the vehicle and the observer's tasks differ between the two sentences. 1. In Sentence 1, the observer is in \\"the vehicle following the contestant car,\\" implying that this vehicle is directly behind the contestant's car. In Sentence 2, the observer is in \\"the follow vehicle,\\" which, while still suggesting that the vehicle is following the race, may not necessarily be directly behind the contestant's car as in Sentence 1. The term \\"follow vehicle\\" could potentially imply that this is a designated and possibly official vehicle used specifically for this purpose. 2. The tasks assigned to the observer in each sentence are similar but differ in scope: - In Sentence 1, the observer \\"records broken rules and track(s) of the car's time.\\" This suggests that the observer is only recording violations of rules and keeping track of the time. - In Sentence 2, the observer is assigned to \\"record any broken rules and also keep track of the car's time.\\" This implies that the observer is not limited to recording only broken rules but also the potential absence of any violations throughout the race. The \\"any\\" in the sentence implies a broader scope of rules, while “also” highlights that these are two separate tasks. In conclusion, while these sentences at first glance seem to carry the same overall meaning, a more detailed analysis reveals subtle differences in the vehicle's positioning and the scope of the observer's responsibilities. Sentence 1 presents a more specific description of the vehicle and the observer's tasks, whereas Sentence 2 provides a broader view of the observer's duties and the vehicle's nature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a text based on \\"pope in christmas message recalls children suffering in world 's\\" Text:","completion":"Title: \\"The Pope's Christmas Message: A Call to Remember the Suffering Children in Today's World\\" Every year, people around the world eagerly await the Pope's annual Christmas message, and the words he uses to remind us of the true essence of this time of the year. Christmas is not just a season for merrymaking, exchange of gifts, and family gatherings, but also an opportunity to commemorate the birth of Jesus Christ and emphasize the various teachings associated with His life. This year, Pope Francis chose to confront an issue that has been plaguing humanity for centuries – the suffering of innocent children worldwide. Pope Francis, in his Christmas message, directed our attention towards the plight, challenges, and hardships endured by children worldwide. By doing so, he hoped to spur action, empathy, and unity among different nations, cultures, and faiths. With a heavy heart, the Pope emphasized the need to acknowledge the suffering of children, the most vulnerable segment of society, and the responsibility to alleviate their pain. Drawing inspiration from the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, Pope Francis believes that we can achieve significant progress only when we refuse to turn a blind eye to the plight of the suffering children. As Jesus taught us, the responsibility of a compassionate and caring society extends equally to each of its members, and with it, the need to extend kindness, generosity, and understanding to those who need it the most. In this spirit, Pope Francis calls on all humanity to stand in solidarity with each other and ensure the protection and safety of the children. The Pope's appeal is both insightful and timely, as millions of children living in poverty, famine, and war-ridden areas continue to be deprived of essential rights, from education to healthcare. While some are abandoned and left to fend for themselves, others are recruited by extremist groups and forced to fight, losing their innocence to violence, hatred, and radical ideologies. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic has brought further anguish to children as it disrupted education, increased poverty levels, and negatively affected mental health. The widening gap of social and economic disparities exposes more young minds to a myriad of challenges that they should not be facing at such a tender age. Pope Francis urged us to reconsider our priorities and assess whether we, as a collective, are truly doing enough to ensure the physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being of the next generation. As we celebrate this Christmas, the Pope's Christmas message is a reminder, a wake-up call, and a call to action. Heeding this message is not limited to just practicing Catholics but extends to all individuals seeking peace, justice, and compassion in our world today. His words resonated not only to those living in affluence but also to the individuals in power, urging them to create and implement policies that significantly reduce child suffering. To honor the true essence of Christmas, let us strive to live by the Pope's message: to remember and work towards alleviating the suffering of children in our world. By playing our part, whether through local communities, non-profit organizations, or simply spreading awareness, we can collectively create a safer, more nurturing environment for the children. As they are our future, it is in our hands to provide them with a world where they have equal opportunities to thrive, unburdened by the weight of suffering. Let this be our gift to the children, in tandem with the teachings of Jesus Christ, as we work together to create a brighter future and share the joy, hope, and love that Christmas symbolizes to people across the globe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In general, Czech does not use definite articles like \\"the\\" before nouns, so \\"the canyon\\" becomes simply \\"kaňon.\\" Considering these points, the full sentence in Czech is \\"Ne, než uvidím kaňon.\\" This translation conveys the same meaning as the original English sentence, which implies that the speaker will not agree or proceed with something until they have seen the canyon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Collections of beautifully shot images of people's passions -- food, fashions, architecture, etc. -- helped make Pinterest a hit. Now Houzz, the interior-design platform, is turning similar photos into extremely popular mobile apps that tap into the home improvement craze. At its core, Houzz is an addictive, never-ending gallery of luscious images of home interiors and exteriors. Its website and apps are popular resources for people who idly dream of redoing their homes or moving into new ones. Home improvement and design, both the real and daydream variety, is a hot industry right now. Just look at the glut of home improvement and house-flipping shows that fill up channels such as HGTV. The home improvement product market is expected to hit 287 billion in 2013, according to the Home Improvement Research Institute. Houzz gently guides people through the process. You begin by looking at bathrooms, graduate to having a scrapbook of dream bathrooms, then read the Houzz tutorials on bathroom renovation and eventually hire someone through its directory or local experts on bathroom renovation. \\"Many times people start on the inspiration side but end up taking actions because of that,\\" said Houzz founder Adi Tatarko. \\"People became very obsessed with it.\\" Tatarko and her husband, Alon Cohen, were working full time and raising their two children in the Bay Area when they started a home renovation project four years ago. They had difficulty finding professionals and found that contractors too had their own frustrations with customers expecting too much. \\"There was lots of miscommunication in the process,\\" Tatarko said. The couple started Houzz in 2009 as a side project, but the next year it went from a hobby to a full-fledged business. The Palo Alto, California-based company now has 120 employees, and its iOS app has more than 100,000 five-star reviews in the Apple App Store. Every month, 15 million people search Houzz by room, style or metro area -- more than half through a smartphone or tablet. The company has a library of more than 2 million images. The sheer volume of photos housed in Houzz means you can spend hours drilling down into your particular project, say, ideas for Mediterranean-style storage closets in Austin, Texas. Browsing high-resolution photos is the initial draw. You can save favorites into Ideabooks for later -- for example, a selection of outdoor wall gardens or midcentury modern living room chairs in a particular shade of yellow. But for Houzz, the money comes when people take action. Interior designers, contractors and architects upload many of the images. There are more than 250,000 such professionals active on Houzz. What makes the app more than just pretty pictures is the information that goes with each image. You can click to see the companies and people who worked on a project, ask questions about how they did certain things or where to find furniture or other products. The people who post images are good about providing answers. There also is a directory of professionals with reviews, sort of an Angie's List but with splashier visuals. Going local is a key part of Houzz's business. If you see a dreamy spread in a magazine such as Dwell, the information disclosing who worked on a house is only useful if you live in that area. Houzz shows examples of work from people close enough to hire, divided into 425 metro areas. A Houzz survey (PDF) of 100,000 people found that 84% of respondents were planning to decorate or redecorate, 40% were considering remodeling or building an addition, and 10% were planning on building a custom home. Online tools are an increasingly important resource for the people diving into these projects and the professionals hoping to get their business. Also, 18% of people said they were renovating to incorporate new technologies into their homes. While free to users, Houzz is making money from brand-name partnerships with big companies such as Kohler and Nest, and through a subscription marketing program for professionals. Investors said they are confident the company will be profitable -- it's raised 48.6 million in funding so far. Tatarko said she hopes Houzz will help more people jump from fantasizing about home improvement to picking up a hammer themselves or a phone to reach someone who uses hammers professionally. \\"Our homes are a very significant part of our lives,\\" she said. \\"I think it (home improvement) was just so hard before, so people just stayed away from it.\\"","completion":"Houzz is a home-design platform that has turned beautiful photos into popular mobile apps for the home improvement sector.

Choose the correct sentiment from candidates: a. negative b. positive TEXT:My Comments for VIVAH :- Its a charming, idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao. The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegroom's families sleeping on the floor, playing games together, their friendly banter and mutual respect. Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals. Yes, the central romance is naively visualized. But the sneaked-in romantic moments between the to-be-married couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism. The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom, on the wedding night, tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries: \\"Come let me do your dressing\\" V I V A H - showcases a lot of good things - beauty of arranged marriage, beauty of Indian culture, beauty of Indian woman, last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the about-to-be-couple waiting to get married .... playing by the rules ! Simple yet Beautiful; Such a Simple story .... no plot ... no villain - as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films. Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST. He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION. Its a very sweet film - which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage & the Union of 2 Families. I think AMRITA RAO - looks very good & she has acted very well. She has most of the good scenes - although i thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur - who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance. I also liked the acting of all others for ex. the Choti i.e. Amrita Prakash, Alok Nath, Anupam Kher, Shahid's bro & sis-in-law. It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could. Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya, HAHK & Hum Saath Saath Hain. The chemistry between Shahid & Amrita is AWESOME. Stuff like Sanctity in a Marriage/Relationship, Avoiding Courtship, Mutual Respect, Care & Space, Waiting for getting Married \\"officially\\", Praying/Sacrficing for Ur Beloved - all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah. There's still some good audience who r going & enjoying this film. Some of the folks/audience are already excited after seeing, that they r thinking bout Arranged-Marriage :) Thats Success if you ask me. it seems AMRITA RAO - our actress-from-Vivah {Result for a nice performance} has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006 !! Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo, even though Vivah , Shahid or Amrita didn't get any of the film-fare & other awards; @ least this is news to CHEER about !! Congrats to AMRITA RAO- for showing us a visual of Indian Bride-to-be in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way :) Shudn't forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today !! Imagine, to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar .......... Its no mean achievement !! Congrats to Amrita Rao - for taking her Career to another level with this award .... I personally feel - she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur !! They make a cute couple and their on-screen chemistry reminds me of {SRK-Kajol} or {Aamir Khan & Juhi Chawla} ................. Some points that I observed,few of the elements :- #1 If u notice carefully, Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses. She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence - in this film !! Perfect Fit #2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us - not exactly ready for marriage or early-marriage .... but PREM listens carefully to the step-wise talk given by his DAD - having full faith in Anupam Kher. Eventually \\"Honesty\\" & \\"Trust\\" are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita. Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person. But according to what I saw in this film, I have a feeling - that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also, Its possible !!! #3 In the entire movie - there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid & Amrita are together - or shown to be together. Its unlike most other romantic/wedding-based movies where Hero & Heroine are always singing/dancing or nowadays - doing cheap stuff. But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences :- Characterized by restraint, innocence & respect for the other ! #4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH & Amrita Rao. These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughters/girl-kids in some parts of India. #5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely - no cheap scenes,songs are beautifully pictured !! Words like \\"Jal\\",\\"praarthana\\" e.t.c. are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film :) Personally, I really am fond of many dialogs in this film. #6 Last but not the least - The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts \\"sindhoor\\" to Amrita when shes struggling for Life - is terrific. Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVE/I-cant-do-without-U ; Its a Hats-Off feeling !!! *** In many ways, VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya, DDLJ, Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak, Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam - for the freshness/on-screen-chemistry of the LEAD pair :) :) *** IF U ASK ME :- Along with films like Rang De Basanti, Lage Raho Munnabhai, DOR, CORPORATE and Kabul Express, V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006. IN FACT - i think Vivah does deserve better viewing/business than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those time-pass/fuzzy/style/crap movies !!","completion":"b. positive"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What are used to produce energy by burning?\\" considering the given answer choices and the information about coal and petroleum is \\"Fossil Fuels\\". The reason the best answer is fossil fuels is due to their widespread utilization and the significant energy they provide when burned. Fossil fuels contain a high proportion of carbon and hydrocarbons, and they were formed millions of years ago from the remains of living organisms. These include coal, oil, and natural gas, all of which are primary sources of global energy production due to their immense energy density. Coal, as pointed out in the information, is burned to produce electricity in coal-fired power stations. This burning process releases energy stored in the coal, which is then used to generate electricity. Similarly, petroleum, also a fossil fuel, is widely used for energy production, particularly in vehicles and industry, where it is burned to produce thermal energy or mechanical work. In comparison to the other choices provided, only organic molecules may also be used to generate energy by combustion. However, the categorization is too broad as it encompasses a numerous variety of compounds beyond just those typically used for large-scale energy production. Cigarettes and firecrackers do burn, but they are not used to produce usable energy. Instead, they produce light, heat, and in the case of firecrackers, a loud noise, but these are not harnessed for energy production in the same way as fossil fuels. Carbon dioxide, atoms, and dust can't be used to produce energy by burning. In fact, combustion processes typically produce carbon dioxide as a byproduct, not a fuel. Batteries store chemical energy and convert it into electrical energy through an electrochemical reaction, rather than through burning. Thus, considering all factors, fossil fuels fit best in the context of being used to produce energy through combustion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Newfoundland is a large Canadian island off the east coast of the North American mainland. Thus, we can conclude that the Titanic sank near Canada. The Titanic disaster is undoubtedly one of the most famous maritime tragedies in history. The vessel was dubbed unsinkable due to its extensive compartmentalization below the waterline, but its unfortunate encounter with the iceberg resulted in considerable damage that eventually took the ship to a disastrous end. Titanic's journey began on April 10, 1912, from Southampton, England, and was heading to New York City when the disaster occurred. On the night of April 14, despite several iceberg warnings received over the wireless, the ship continued to sail on. At 11:40 p.m., the lookout spotted an iceberg directly ahead. The first officer ordered the ship to turn, but it was too late. The Titanic's hull scraped along the iceberg on the ship's starboard side, causing the ship's compartments to flood. When the Titanic started to sink, there were simply not enough lifeboats for all the passengers on board, leading to the death of around 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history.

After the breakup of the Pixies, Santiago went into a depression for the first couple of years but remained on good terms with bandmate Black Francis (who soon adopted the name Frank Black). Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded \\"Free\\" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of Empire Records. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft. He scored the 2003 film The Low Budget Time Machine and wrote two songs, \\"Birthday Video\\" and \\"Fake Purse,\\" for the Showtime television series Weeds in 2005. Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live.

MobileNets, developed by Google, are a family of neural network architectures designed for mobile devices and other resource-constrained environments. They are optimized for speed and efficiency while maintaining a high level of accuracy in various computer vision tasks, such as object detection and classification. MobileNets achieve this by using depth-wise separable convolutions, which break down the standard convolution process into two steps: depth-wise convolution and point-wise convolution. This results in a significant reduction in the number of parameters and computations needed, making them suitable for devices with limited computational capabilities. The mentioned program utilizes the MobileNets architecture to detect and identify various objects in images and videos. This particular implementation can recognize up to 1,000 different object categories, including everyday items like chairs, oranges, and cups. To accomplish this, the program relies on a large dataset of labeled images, each containing one or more of these object types. This dataset is used to train and fine-tune the MobileNet model, allowing it to make accurate predictions when encountering new, unseen images. When the trained model is used for object detection, the process typically involves the following steps: 1. Preprocessing: The input image is resized and normalized to match the format expected by the model. This may include adjusting the dimensions, aspect ratio, and pixel values. 2. Inference: The preprocessed image is passed through the MobileNet model, which processes it through multiple layers of depth-wise and point-wise convolutions, nonlinear activation functions, and pooling layers. The output is a dense feature map that encodes information about the objects present in the image. 3. Decoding: The feature map is parsed by a decoding algorithm that extracts the locations, dimensions, and class probabilities of the detected objects. This may involve identifying local maxima in the probability map and applying non-maximum suppression to remove duplicate detections. 4. Post-processing: The final list of detected objects is returned, along with their class labels and confidence scores. This output can then be used for various applications, such as tracking objects in a video, automating inventory management, or enabling augmented reality interactions. In summary, a program based on MobileNets can efficiently detect a wide range of objects on resource-limited devices, thanks to its lightweight and highly optimized architecture. Such a program has numerous practical applications across various domains, illustrating the power of deep learning and computer vision techniques on edge devices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer because it does not answer the question correctly. The question asks about the size Texel guinea pigs can grow, not about Satin guinea pigs or their coats. Typically, a Texel guinea pig is fairly large, with adults weighing between 1.5 to 2.6 pounds (700 - 1200 grams), and measuring 8 to 12 inches long (20 - 30 cm). The lifespan of a Texel guinea pig is about 4-7 years, so they may potentially grow throughout their life. Texel guinea pigs are characterized by their long and curly hair and they do require regular grooming due to their unique coat. These guinea pigs originated in England in the 1980s and are a crossbreed of the Silkie and Rex guinea pigs.

However, when his owner, Trey (Dash Mihok) tries to convince him to perform a skydiving stunt, the plane malfunctions and Rexxx is sent tumbling from the sky, landing in a truck full of tomatoes. Whilst Trey mourns his apparent death and begins to regret not treating him like a 'real dog', Rexxx settles into an abandoned warehouse, desperately missing his owner. Meanwhile, Shane Fahey (Josh Hutcherson) is struggling with his uncle Marc's death from a recent fire. Realizing he forgot to study for a test, Shane ditches school, but is quickly caught by two other firefighters, Lionel and Terrence. Arriving back at the fire station in disgrace, he is chastised by his father Connor Fahey (Bruce Greenwood), the captain of the station, who is having problems of his own; the station 'Dogpatch' Engine 55 is about to be closed due to a lack of funding, less infrastructure remaining around the station, and overall bad publicity.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided pertains to the Aleksey Chirikov, which is an icebreaker ship, and a specific detail of its construction: a shipBeam measurement of 21.2 meters. This information refers to the Aleksey Chirikov's characteristics, which can help understand its capabilities and overall design. To do that, let's look into the context and impact of this data. An icebreaker is a specifically designed ship that can navigate through ice-covered waters by breaking the ice into smaller pieces and creating a path for itself and potentially other ships following it. Icebreakers are vital for maintaining crucial trade routes and maritime activities in polar regions, primarily the Arctic and Antarctic areas, where heavy ice drifts can cause significant challenges for standard vessels. The Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker is a high-performance vessel that was constructed in Russia. Icebreakers are typically built with reinforced hulls and powerful engines to generate the necessary force and physical strength to break through ice sheets and continue sailing without suffering damage. In addition, they usually have a unique hull design that incorporates a specific curvature to direct broken ice underneath the vessel, preventing it from accumulating in front of the ship. The shipBeam measurement, which stands at 21.2 meters in this case, refers to the overall width of the Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker at its widest point. This measurement is crucial as it provides a clear understanding of the size and capacity of the vessel. A wide beam contributes to increased stability, allowing the ship to maintain its balance while navigating through challenging and uneven ice conditions. In the context of the Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker, a 21.2-meter shipBeam suggests that it is a substantial vessel, capable of accommodating a large crew, significant onboard facilities, and having the necessary power and maneuverability for breaking through ice sheets in the polar regions effectively. A wide beam also increases the vessel's working deck area, which is essential for carrying out various operations and managing equipment related to icebreaking and other maritime tasks. In conclusion, the data provided highlights essential details about the Aleksey Chirikov icebreaker. Specifically, the shipBeam measurement of 21.2 meters indicates that this icebreaker is a large and well-equipped vessel, designed to handle the challenges of navigating through ice-covered waters effectively. Understanding this data allows for a deeper appreciation of the Aleksey Chirikov's capabilities as a crucial asset for maintaining maritime activities in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, contributing to global trade, scientific research, and other essential operations in these remote areas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When the swim season began, my 11-year-old daughter, Elizabeth, and I cut a deal. She would go to practice three times a week and try really hard, and I wouldn't make her compete in the swim meets because on the day of a meet, she would be nervous all day. Her nerves rooted from the possibility that she would do something horribly wrong and let everyone down. Recently, they had a T-shirt relay, which works like this: one person from each relay team puts on a T-shirt and a pair of socks, swims 50 meters, and gets out of the pool. She takes off the clothes and puts them on the next person, who then swims 50 meters. This continues until everyone on the team has completed a lap. By the last leg, Elizabeth's team had built up a moderate lead. Then it was Elizabeth's turn to swim. She seemed to swim faster in the T-shirt and socks than when she wasn't wearing them. Approaching the halfway mark, she was still in the lead. Then one of Elizabeth's socks fell off and was floating in the pool. \\"She has to get that sock on before the end of the race,\\" a swimming official told her team, \\"or you will be disqualified.\\" Everybody on her team started screaming, \\"Elizabeth! Elizabeth! Stop! Get the sock!\\" But she couldn't hear them. As she started her last 25 meters, a girl in Lane 2 was gaining on Elizabeth. It was time for desperate measures. A girl on my daughter's team jumped in the pool, grabbed the sock, and swam after Elizabeth. She grabbed Elizabeth's foot. \\"You have to put the sock on,\\" the girl screamed. Elizabeth continued swimming while her teammate put on the sock. By now, the girl in Lane 2 was about to pass Elizabeth. With the sock finally on, Elizabeth swam her heart out for the last 15 meters. It was close, but Elizabeth beat the other girl to the wall for the victory. On the ride home, she relived her moment of glory again and again.

From the provided context, we can understand that the Apple A7 is a 64-bit system on a chip (SoC), and it was used in the iPhone 5S, which was introduced in 2013. The A7 is not just a component used in the iPhone 5S, but it is the actual SoC of the iPhone 5S. The hypothesis seems to suggest that the iPhone 5S used some other SoC before the A7, and this information is inaccurate as per the given context. Also, it's important to note that the \\"System on Chip\\" or SoC technology isn't an invention of Apple or first used by Apple in 2013. SoC has been used by many companies for many years. Apple A7 is Apple's own version of an SoC, and it's a particular model of SoC. So, based on the presented information in context, the correct response would be \\"No\\", the hypothesis that the system on chip (SoC) was first used in Apple in 2013 on iphone 5s before it was used on the Apple A7 is not accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They fought encroachments of machinery and unskilled labor on autonomy of skilled shoe workers.

When Alex tells Robin that they have to leave because it's time to do homework, this implies that both of them might have homework assignments to complete. The primary concern at this moment is to finish their homework within a stipulated timeframe. Out of the provided options, the most plausible option for Robin to choose is number 3, which is to go home. This is because the most immediate need is to start and finish their homework.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I read this background article the other day: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities. I am facing a new situation today: Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person had a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage? A:","completion":"Based on the background article you read, a person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. In the situation you're facing, Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill and fell after hitting a large rock. Tammy was diagnosed with a serious brain injury, whereas Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Given this information, Tammy had a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage compared to Rob. This is due to the serious nature of her brain injury, which typically results from an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, that causes brain dysfunction. The article further explains that those with serious brain injuries may have trouble talking, controlling body movements, and might experience personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. While the severity of Tammy's injuries remains uncertain, the fact that she was diagnosed with a serious brain injury puts her at a higher risk for permanent brain damage. On the other hand, Rob experienced a mild concussion, which is generally considered a less severe form of brain injury. Although mild concussions still result from external forces affecting the head and can cause temporary complications, they usually do not lead to permanent damage in most cases. The recovery time for mild concussions can vary from days to weeks, and individuals can typically regain normal function after appropriate treatment and rest. While Rob should still receive proper care and monitoring, he had a lower chance of suffering permanent brain damage than Tammy in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening.

Here is an article: General Dempsey, who if confirmed by the Senate would take over from Adm. Mike Mullen as the nation’s highest ranking military officer, has not taken a public position on how many troops should be withdrawn starting in July, the date set by the president for beginning to reduce the United States military presence in Afghanistan. But he will be walking into a debate that has been simmering within the administration for two years. On one side are those who want to maintain troop levels as much as possible and to continue a counterinsurgency strategy that emphasizes clearing key regions of Taliban fighters and helping the Afghan government build stable institutions. On the other are those who want to focus on counterterrorism, using fewer troops to carry out targeted strikes on Al Qaeda and Taliban forces. Mr. Obama gave no hint of which way he was leaning, saying only that he expected General Dempsey, now the Army chief, to present him with a full range of options on how to begin bringing American troops home. “I’ll be looking to you, and the rest of the Joint Chiefs, for what I value most in my advisers, your honest, unvarnished advice, and the full range of options, especially when it comes to our most solemn obligation, protecting the lives of our brave men and women in uniform,” Mr. Obama said to the general in a ceremony in the Rose Garden. As chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Dempsey will become the president’s senior military adviser, working alongside Leon E. Panetta, the Central Intelligence Agency director, who is in line to become defense secretary when Robert M. Gates retires in late June, and Gen. David H. Petraeus, a strong proponent of the counterinsurgency strategy and the commander in charge of carrying it out, who will take over from Mr. Panetta at the C.I.A. The president chose General Dempsey over Gen. James Cartwright, who was seen as a supporter of the more limited counterterrorism approach advocated by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and a number of other administration aides. In selecting General Dempsey, Mr. Obama was in some ways bowing to the preferences of Admiral Mullen, whose term expires Sept. 30, and Mr. Gates, who were said by colleagues to be unhappy that General Cartwright had provided advice to the White House during the troop-buildup debate in 2009 without keeping them in the loop. The debate over the scale and pace of any troop withdrawal will take place against evolving domestic and foreign policy considerations. Already, many Democrats in Congress, and even a few Republicans, are beginning to call for a quicker pullout in light of the killing of Osama bin Laden this month and the growing fiscal pressures on the government. Those calls could strengthen the hand of aides like Mr. Biden, who advocated a tighter, more focused mission to begin with. In addition, American officials have begun backing their Afghan counterparts in negotiations with the Afghan Taliban, as part of the effort to speed up a political reconciliation. Those efforts have yet to bear fruit, but military officials say they hope that the death of Bin Laden will force the Taliban to reconsider their position. Mr. Obama alluded to the debate on Monday when he noted that General Dempsey understood that “security gains and political progress must go hand in hand.” Mr. Obama also announced that he was appointing Adm. James A. Winnefeld Jr. as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, replacing General Cartwright, who is retiring. Admiral Winnefeld is now the top officer of the Northern Command, based in Colorado Springs, a headquarters created after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and given responsibilities for defense of the American homeland. Admiral Winnefeld was in command of the carrier Enterprise, which was steaming home after a deployment in the Middle East when he heard of the terrorist strikes on Washington and New York. Admiral Winnefeld, without waiting for orders from the Pentagon, ordered the carrier to turn around to be in attack position in case action was ordered, which it was within weeks. Similarly, in April 2004, General Dempsey’s First Armored Division was completing a 12-month deployment to Baghdad when he was given a new and final mission, to stay an extra 90 days to suppress a Shiite rebellion inflaming south-central Iraq. But one-fourth of his 30,000 soldiers and more than half of his 8,000 tanks, armored vehicles and artillery pieces had already left Iraq. General Dempsey recalled his troops and armored equipment and sent them to battle the Shiite militias. “I called together all my commanders, and I told them that we were going to demonstrate that a heavy force could be agile, to put heavy and agile in the same sentence, a place where they had never been before,” General Dempsey said in an interview at the time. He mounted a counteroffensive that combined fierce attacks, political negotiations and the quick infusion of reconstruction money to damaged neighborhoods to knock back the Shiite militias and offset their influence. The president appointed another Iraq war veteran, Gen. Ray Odierno, to replace General Dempsey as the Army chief. General Odierno had three combat command tours in Iraq before being named top officer of the military’s Joint Forces Command. Although General Petraeus is credited with turning around a failing mission in Iraq, it was General Odierno, then the No. 2 commander, who was in charge of the day-to-day fight during the so-called surge.

The answer to the question: Who befriends an elderly neighbor? is inside the article: The Creed family—Louis, Rachel, and their children Ellie and Gage—move from Chicago to rural Ludlow, Maine, after Louis is offered a job as a doctor with the University of Maine. They befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall, who takes them to an isolated pet cemetery (misspelled \\"sematary\\") in the forest behind the Creed's new home. On his first day at work, Louis encounters Victor Pascow, a jogger who has been mortally injured after being hit by a truck. He warns Louis about the pet cemetery before he dies, calling Louis by name despite the fact they have not previously met. That night, Pascow comes to Louis as a ghost and leads him to the Pet Sematary, warning him not to cross the barrier because the ground beyond is \\"sour\\". Louis awakens, assuming it was a dream, but notices his feet are covered in dirt. During Thanksgiving while the family is gone, Ellie's cat, Church, is run down on the highway. Realizing that Ellie will be devastated, Jud takes Louis beyond the cemetery and deep into the woods, where they reach an ancient Micmac burial ground. Jud instructs Louis to bury the cat and warns him not to tell anyone else about what they have done. The next day a reanimated Church returns to the house, a shell of what he was before; he stinks, moves sluggishly, and is vicious towards Louis. Jud explains that as a boy he himself revived his beloved pet dog in the Micmac ground, and that although the cat might be different, it will save Ellie the grief of losing her favorite pet. Sometime later, the young Gage is killed by a truck along the same highway. The family is devastated, and Jud anticipates that Louis is considering burying his son in the Micmac ground, although Louis denies it. Jud believes that introducing Louis to the ritual ground aroused the malevolent forces present there, which caused Gage's death., can you guess it ?","completion":"In the article, the Creed family—Louis, Rachel, Ellie, and Gage—move to rural Ludlow, Maine, and befriend their elderly neighbor Jud Crandall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coppola was born in Detroit, Michigan, to father Carmine Coppola (1910-1991), a flautist with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, and mother Italia Coppola (nee Pennino; 1912-2004). Coppola is the middle of three children: his older brother was August Coppola, his younger sister is actress Talia Shire. Born into a family of Italian immigrant ancestry, his paternal grandparents came to the United States from Bernalda, Basilicata. His maternal grandfather, popular Italian composer Francesco Pennino, immigrated from Naples, Italy. Coppola co-wrote the script for Patton in 1970 along with Edmund H. North. This earned him his first Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay. However, it was not easy for Coppola to convince Franklin J. Schaffner that the opening scene would work. Coppola later revealed in an interview: I wrote the script of Patton. And the script was very controversial when I wrote it, because they thought it was so stylized. It was supposed to be like, sort of, you know, The Longest Day. And my script of Patton was--I was sort of interested in the reincarnation. And I had this very bizarre opening where he stands up in front of an American flag and gives this speech. Ultimately, I wasn't fired, but I was fired, meaning that when the script was done, they said, \\"Okay, thank you very much,\\" and they went and hired another writer and that script was forgotten. And I remember very vividly this long, kind of being raked over the coals for this opening scene. \\"When the title role was offered to George C. Scott, he remembered having read Coppola's screenplay earlier. He stated flatly that he would accept the part only if they used Coppola's script. 'Scott is the one who resurrected my version,' says Coppola.\\" The movie opens with Scott's rendering of Patton's famous military \\"Pep Talk\\" to members of the Third Army, set against a huge American flag. Coppola and North had to tone down Patton's actual language to avoid an R rating; in the opening monologue, the word \\"fornicating\\" replaced \\"fucking\\" when criticizing The Saturday Evening Post. Over the years, this opening monologue has become an iconic scene and has spawned parodies in numerous films, political cartoons and television shows.

I have a new situation: It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear. Sarah is going to a family picnic in the park and is trying to decide what dress to wear. She knows it is going to be very hot and sunny today and she has narrowed her choices down to two different dresses. One is a dark colored dress and the other is a white dress. But I can use this background: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. What is an answer for this question: Would the white coat absorb more or less sunlight?","completion":"Based on the background information provided, the white coat would absorb less sunlight compared to the black coat. This is because white and lighter colors tend to reflect more sunlight, while dark colors, like black, absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. Consequently, the white coat would keep Johnathan relatively warmer in the cold winter weather due to less absorption of sunlight, and for Sarah, the white dress would keep her cooler in the hot and sunny weather as it would reflect more sunlight and absorb less, preventing an increase in her body temperature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: You are presented with the question \\"What requires either insects or wind.\\" and the following answer choices: - Pollen grains - swamp vegetation - animals - earth - Animal survival - bloom time - Most plants - nature Now knowing that pollination requires pollinators and most plants are either insect pollinated or wind pollinated, choose the best answer. The answer is:","completion":"Most plants. The question inquires about what requires either insects or wind. Providing an overview of the answer choices, we can analyze and determine which one fits the best as the most appropriate answer. - Pollen grains: While it is true that pollen grains are involved in the process of pollination, they are only a part of the entire process and not the subject that directly requires insects or wind. - Swamp vegetation: Although some swamp plants may require insects or wind for their pollination, this answer choice is too specific and doesn't encompass the wide variety of plants that require these pollination agents. - Animals: Animals, in general, do not specifically require insects or wind, as the question is referring to the process of pollination in which insects and wind serve as pollinators for majority of plants. - Earth: The term 'earth' is too broad and non-specific, as it refers to the planet as a whole and not directly to the subject matter of pollination and its requirements. - Animal survival: Animal survival is a broad concept that has numerous factors involved including finding food, shelter, and avoiding predators. While some animals may rely on plants for their survival, it is not implied in the context of the question. - Bloom time: The term 'bloom time' refers to the period when plants produce flowers. Although the presence of flowers is necessary for pollination, the term doesn't directly express the requirement of insects or wind for the flowers. - Nature: Like 'earth', 'nature' is a very broad term that encompasses diverse elements of the environment. This answer choice does not specifically address the necessity of insects or wind for any particular aspect of the natural world. Upon analyzing all the answer choices, we can conclude that \\"Most plants\\" is the best and most accurate answer to the question. Most plants require pollination for reproduction, and insects and wind are the primary agents that facilitate this process in a majority of plant species. Therefore, it can be said that most plants require either insects or wind for successful pollination and reproduction."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The accurate hypothesis, based on the context provided, should be: Three Mills Residential Moorings is a community of twenty residential narrowboats moored on the Three Mills Wall River Weir near Three Mills in the East End of London. To provide more detail on the context, Three Mills Residential Moorings is an area designated for a community of twenty residential narrowboats on the Three Mills Wall River Weir close to the historical Three Mills in London, United Kingdom. This location was initially a tidal stretch of water, with the natural ebb and flow of tides affecting the water levels. However, in anticipation of the London 2012 Olympics, a weir was constructed in the area, which turned the moorings into non-tidal waters. The construction of the weir provided a more stable and controlled environment for the residential narrowboats and their inhabitants, making it suitable for long-term residential purposes. The weir also offers protection for the moored boats from potential damage that might be caused by the tidal forces or adverse weather conditions usually associated with tidal waters. In conclusion, based on the context given, the hypothesis about Three Mills Residential Moorings being in Milan is incorrect. The correct hypothesis must identify the location in the East End of London, where a community of twenty residential narrowboats enjoys a stable and controlled mooring environment thanks to the construction of a weir in preparation for the London 2012 Olympics."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ's toolkit and his beer. Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm. I watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall, and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong.

Despite its positive aspects, there are certain aspects of the emulator that could use improvement. The first positive aspect is the app's user interface. It is sleek, well-organized, and intuitive. Navigating through the app is straightforward, and I could easily find the options I needed. Additionally, being able to customize on-screen controls make it a user-friendly experience. However, on the performance side, I encountered a few issues. While playing several games, I noticed occasional lagging and frame rate drops. As an avid gamer, I found this frustrating. Given that other users may have different experiences depending on their devices, I suggest the developers improve performance and optimization to provide a consistent gaming experience for everyone. Another issue I encountered was compatibility. While many popular games ran smoothly, I found that some lesser-known or obscure titles simply would not work. This could be disheartening for users interested in playing those particular games. The developers may need to work on expanding the emulator's compatibility to cater to a wider variety of PSP titles. The app does provide support for external controllers, which is a plus. However, I found it difficult to set up and configure my Bluetooth controller, causing some frustration. In conclusion, org.ppsspp.ppsspp is a decent PSP emulator for Android but could use improvements in performance, compatibility, and controller support. With some extra development and updates, I believe this app has the potential to become a high-quality emulator for many gamers looking to relive or explore PSP games on their mobile devices.

You want to install the fitting so that it can be screwed on over your flare. Make sure you add the fitting now, as it can be difficult to add later. Most lines are flared on both ends, so make sure you add two fittings, pointing opposite directions, before beginning. The long free piece of the flaring tool should be clamped firmly into a table vice, keeping it in place as you put pressure down to flair the line. The actual flaring tool should hang over the edge of the table, as the brake lines need to drop down below the tool as you work. You can do this free-handed if you don't have a vice, but it is much easier with one. This is the part you'll be flaring, but you don't need much exposed to make your connection. 1-2mm above the flaring base should be enough. Note how, in the video, the tube is in the far left hole of the flaring tool. Thus, the left-most screw is tightened first, keeping the tube in place, before the screw on the right is tightened. These only need to be hand-tightened. You want a nice flat surface to create your connection. Make sure it has a nice flat top. Take a small reaming tool and insert it straight into the top of the line, rotating it with even pressure down into the tube.

Options: - misfire - explode - jam - break - take life Answer:","completion":"The most reasonable options out of the given ones for what could happen to guns if they are wet are: - misfire - jam Step-by-step Explanation: 1. When asked about what could happen to a gun if it gets wet, a handful of potential occurrences could lead to disruption of normal functioning. It depends partly on the degree of wetness and the type of firearm. 2. In the given options, the possibility for a gun to \\"explode\\" or \\"break\\" is less likely because guns are designed to endure tough conditions and are generally hardy. While severe exposure to moisture over an extended period could potentially cause some types of damage, it would be unexpected for a gun to simply explode or break from being wet. 3. The option \\"take life\\" is inappropriate as it's not a direct consequence of the gun being wet, but of someone using the gun with intent to harm. 4. The options left are \\"misfire\\" and \\"jam\\" which are both possible outcomes when a gun gets wet. Moisture can affect the ammunition or the firing mechanism leading to misfire. Similarly, it could also lead to the gun jamming if the water causes rust or other obstructions in the gun's mechanisms. Therefore, the most sensible answers are \\"misfire\\" and \\"jam\\", as these issues are a common concern when firearms are exposed to water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. Which of the two areas was more oxygenated? Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] The answer to this question is:","completion":"Area B was more oxygenated. From the information provided, Area A has high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the Danube River. This stratification forms layers in the water, which act as barriers to water mixing, resulting in limited oxygen exchange between layers. On the other hand, Area B is situated 35 miles south, where the water is less stratified and, consequently, more oxygenated. The reduced stratification in Area B allows for better mixing of the water masses, resulting in increased oxygenation compared to Area A."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does the author seem to most probably believe about the availability of seasonal produce? Options: - that seasonal produce is in limited supply - most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live - not enough information - that seasonal produce is most likely available only at farmers markets Answer:","completion":"most likely that people can find places that sell seasonal produce where they live"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Document hoard found at al-Qaida leader’s hideout contained ‘a considerable number of pornographic videos’ but the US does not plan to release them The list of documents recovered from Osama bin Laden’s Pakistan hideout and released by US intelligence officials includes operational notes, family letters, political analysis and histories of Islamist militancy. Osama bin Laden's bookshelf: Noam Chomsky, Bob Woodward, and jihad Read more But one portion of the document hoard seems unlikely ever to be declassified: Osama bin Laden’s porn collection. Since the 2011 Navy Seal raid in which the al-Qaida chief was killed, there have been numerous unconfirmed reports that the documents included “a considerable quantity of pornographic videos”. On Wednesday, the office of the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, confirmed for the first time that “some pornographic material” was contained in Bin Laden’s recovered papers and personal effects. But while the US declassified a substantial number of documents and released detailed lists of Bin Laden’s reading preferences, details the pornography kept by the man who was the world’s most-hunted terrorist will remain hidden. “We are not going to release these materials due to the nature of their contents,” Clapper’s spokesman, Jeffrey Anchukaitis, told the Guardian. For years, Bin Laden evaded a global manhunt by the world’s most sophisticated intelligence agencies by giving off as few electronic signals as possible. He communicated with the outside world through documents on flash drives supplied to couriers and transmitted through internet cafes. He stayed away from phones, air-gapped his computers and did not use the internet. Osama bin Laden documents reveal intimate correspondence with family Read more Yet despite the self-imposed limitations on interacting with the outside world, Bin Laden had porn in his possession. A Reuters report from 2011 described his collection as “fairly extensive”, and including recent-vintage video smut. Anchukaitis declined to specify the sort of porn Bin Laden preferred. While al-Qaida and other global jihadists project an image of religious asceticism, jihadist militants – comprising as they do men interacting under conditions of stress – often have pornographic material close to hand. According to Louise Shelley, a professor at George Mason University, porn smuggling routes operate in territory controlled by the Islamic State. Jihadists are also reported to conceal messages to each other inside pornographic imagery – a sort of X-rated steganography – though the contention has not been confirmed. ||||| I n the weeks following the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, by United States forces, U.S. Intelligence Community analysts sifted through the recovered digital and hard copy materials in search of clues that would reveal ongoing al-Qa'ida plots, identities and locations of al-Qa'ida personnel, and other information of immediate importance. On May 20, 2015, the ODNI released a sizeable tranche of documents recovered from the compound used to hide Osama bin Laden.

I n the weeks following the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, by United States forces, U.S. Intelligence Community analysts sifted through the recovered digital and hard copy materials in search of clues that would reveal ongoing al-Qa'ida plots, identities and locations of al-Qa'ida personnel, and other information of immediate importance.

Photo Some of the books are mainstream history or journalism: “Obama’s Wars” by Bob Woodward, “The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers” by Paul Kennedy, “The United States and Vietnam 1787-1941” by Robert Hopkins Miller. Others are conspiracy-mongering tomes like “Bloodlines of the Illuminati” by Fritz Springmeier, “The Taking of America, 1-2-3” by Richard Sprague, and “Secrets of the Federal Reserve” by Eustace Mullins, a Holocaust denier. There are two works by Bin Laden’s early mentor, Abdullah Azzam (“The Defense of Muslim Lands” and “Join the Caravan”), about jihad. There is also a sizable cache of documents relating to France, such as “Wage Inequality in France” and “France on Radioactive Waste Management, 2008.” And there are books by the left-wing writers Greg Palast (“The Best Democracy Money Can Buy”) and Noam Chomsky (“Hegemony or Survival: America’s Quest for Global Dominance”) that Bin Laden probably thought ratified some of his own views about American imperial ambitions and corporate corruption.

He also read Foreign Policy magazine articles and RAND Corporation studies on counterinsurgency, trying to keep a handle on the war on terrorism he had set off. His bookshelf is a weird hodgepodge. It’s hard to know how complete a list it is, and whether he requested certain books from aides, or if aides sent him works they thought he might like or that might influence his thinking. The declassified letters and correspondence reflect Bin Laden’s managerial concerns — Al Qaeda had become a kind of giant corporation. His self-prescribed syllabus included works on global issues, like climate change, and ran a spectrum from historical works to crackpot conspiracy tracts. The eclectic nature of the list speaks to both Bin Laden’s reach as Al Qaeda’s leader and his limitations as an international fugitive; his ambitions to think globally and his naïve susceptibility to theorists who talk conspiracy to explain the perfidies of the West; his fascination with America; and his determination to find new ways to attack it by trying to understand the dynamics of its political and economic systems. As Steve Coll wrote in his compelling biography of the Bin Laden family, “The Bin Ladens: An Arabian Family in the American Century”: “Osama was not a stranger to the West,” having grown up in one of Saudi Arabia’s wealthiest families and traveled abroad, “but by age 15, he had already erected a wall against their allures. He felt implicated by the West, and by its presence in his own family, and yet, as he would demonstrate in the years ahead, he lacked a sophisticated or subtle understanding of Western society and history. He used his passport, but he never really left home.” ||||| US intelligence officials have released more than 100 letters and documents found during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011, revealing the al-Qaida leader’s intense fear of drones and surveillance, correspondence with his family, and continued preoccupation with launching attacks against the west. Osama bin Laden's bookshelf: Noam Chomsky, Bob Woodward, and jihad Read more Alongside scores of declassified Arabic documents – mainly correspondence with key lieutenants, associates and groups spread around the Islamic world – the Office of the Director of National Intelligence also released the contents of Bin Laden’s library, including works by Islamist thinkers, but also English language books on history and current affairs by authors including Noam Chomsky and Bob Woodward. The documents were released after a “rigorous interagency review” led by the CIA, said Jeffrey Anchukaitis, spokesman for Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Anchukaitis said the review continues, but that “given the large number of documents to review, and the increasing public demand to review those documents”, the White House asked for them to be released as they were ready. The documents’ release follows a high-profile and intensely debated article by the veteran investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, which accused the Obama administration of misleading the public over events before, during and after the May 2011 raid that killed Bin Laden. Anchukaitis denied that the release of documents was related to the Obama administration’s pushback against Hersh’s report. The declassified documents reveal Bin Laden’s abiding concern with operational security. In letters, he tells his lieutenants not to communicate by email and tells them not to gather in large groups, lest they become the target of a drone strike. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Clips from the al-Qaida leader’s ‘home videos’ show him obsessively watching himself on TV news programmes The internet “is OK for general messages,” Bin Laden writes his deputies, “but the secrecy of the mujahideen does not allow its usage and couriers are the only way”. In other documents he advises members of al-Qaida to destroy cellphone Sim cards, to keep prescriptions with them to avoid frequent visits to doctors, and to learn Urdu because “it is also of extreme importance, security-wise”. In one missive, he worries over the possibility that a wiretap could be concealed in his wife’s clothing. “Before Um Hamza arrives here, it is necessary for her to leave everything behind, including clothes, books, everything that she had in Iran,” Bin Laden wrote in a September 2010 letter. “Everything that a needle might possibly penetrate. “Some chips have been lately developed for eavesdropping, so small they could easily be hidden inside a syringe,” he said, adding that “Iranians are not to be trusted” and a listening device could be planted in his wife’s belongings. Bin Laden also fixates on his al-Qaida heirs, including how to get his son Hamza into Pakistan, and about what precautions the group can take against drone strikes. In other letters, he pleaded with his lieutenants to turn away from internecine and regional attacks and to concentrate on major plots against the US. “The focus should be on killing and fighting the American people and their representatives,” Bin Laden wrote in one of the documents. “We should stop operations against the army and the police in all regions, especially Yemen.” In one undated report, he wrote of “a number of brothers” sent to attack Britain, Russia and Denmark, including a plan to blow up a gas line or an American embassy. He issued orders on a granular level of transportation and explosives manufacturing, and blamed “bad luck” for the failed plots, saying “God wasn’t on our side.” When uprisings erupted in Tunisia, Egypt, Syria and around the Middle East, he urged al-Qaida leaders to seize the moment of “revolution” to recruit young people around the region to his cause. Bin Laden also exhorted al-Qaida to move away from small, local attacks in the region, but found himself marginalized within the organization, as lone wolf, “individual jihad” attacks gained increasing prominence for other al-Qaida leaders. In another document, he cites the unpopularity of the Vietnam war in the US and says that the only way to change American policy is to “start striking America to force it to abandon these rulers and leave the Muslims alone”. The titles included in Bin Laden’s personal library reveal an eclectic reader with a predictable taste for classics of jihadi literature, a deep interest in both US foreign policy and a keen desire to see how his own organisation was being portrayed in the international media. There are two works by Bin Laden’s mentor, Abdallah Azzam: Join the Caravan and The Defence of Muslim Lands, both of which remain hugely influential among radical Islamists. Azzam led Arab “mujahideen” during the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan and laid down fundamental principles of violent Islamic extremism. Bin Laden also had a copy of The America I Have Seen, a vitriolic memoir of a short trip to the US by the Egyptian thinker and activist Syed Qutb, considered the godfather of modern jihadi thinking. The collection also included several works on international relations and current affairs, including Obama’s Wars by Bob Woodward, Hegemony or Survival: America’s Quest for Global Dominance by Noam Chomsky, and the Best Democracy Money Can Buy by Greg Palast. Bizarrely, the library includes several works by conspiracy theorists, including New Pearl Harbor, which argues that the government of George W Bush was complicit in the 9/11 terror attacks, and Bloodlines of the Illuminati, which claims to reveal the secret network of power-brokers who rule the world. Osama bin Laden documents reveal intimate correspondence with family Read more Bin Laden’s letters reveal the al-Qaida chief as a dedicated family man who worries about his four wives, 20 children and other relatives and offered detailed advice and instructions on how to behave. “By God, I miss you so much,” he writes in an undated letter to his daughter, Umm Muadh. He asks how her son is progressing with his studies of the Qu’ran and other school subjects. “What is his latest funny news?” he asks. The letter is short, he says, because “the power keeps going on and off.” In another he asks that one of his wives take care of his daughters, “and be careful of bad company for them, especially after puberty”. “If you can marry them to mujahideen, then that is best, or else to good people,” he wrote. Another declassified document is apparently an application for membership in al-Qaida, and features such questions as: “What is your favorite material: science or literature?”, “Do you wish to execute a suicide operation?” and “Any hobbies or pastimes?” It ends: “Who should we contact in case you become a martyr?” Notable by its absence in the document trove is Bin Laden’s collection of pornography. At the time of the Abbottabad raid, Navy Seals reportedly uncovered a “fairly extensive” cache of pornography, to include modern-seeming videos. Clapper’s office confirmed that the documents recovered from the compound included “some pornographic material”. But Anchukaitis said the US would not release the pornography “due to the nature of their contents”. He declined to give any further details. ||||| Output:","completion":"The US intelligence officials released more than 100 letters and documents found during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden in 2011.

When Amy Winehouse transformed the musical landscape with her classic albums Frank and Back To Black, a wave of talented homegrown divas emerged in her wake, with Adele, Duffy and Paloma Faith all becoming major stars. But her influence stretched beyond these shores, as Dutch singer Caro Emerald acknowledges. The 31-year-old from Amsterdam, with a Rubenesque figure and voice straight out of the Forties, is gaining a substantial following in this country, thanks to appearances on Strictly Come Dancing, Jools Holland and Children In Need. Forties chic: New fans for 'The Shocking Miss Caro Emerald' Last month, she sold out the Royal Albert Hall, and new dates have been added to her autumn tour. And a lot of the credit, she admits, should go to Amy. ‘She was my big inspiration,’ Caro says. ‘When she came along, there wasn’t much jazz or swing in the charts. But Amy sexed up the whole genre. ‘I discovered her while studying jazz at the Amsterdam Conservatory. I loved the old-school singers but also R&B, hip-hop and soul.’ Winehouse’s lead has given Caro impressive staying power, too. Her million-selling debut, Deleted Scenes From The Cutting Room Floor, this week returned to the UK Top 20, two years after its first chart run. Talent: Caro Emerald bombed out in an audition for Dutch TV talent show ¿Idol¿ and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was discovered singing backup. But, as Caro explains, her recording. career began by accident. A struggling session singer in the Dutch. capital, she bombed out in an audition for Dutch TV talent show ‘Idol’ and was making ends meet as a music teacher when she was invited to sing. on a demo tape by Canadian songwriter Vince Degiorgio and two local. producers. Inspiration: Late singer Amy Winehouse. The song she performed, Back It Up,. was going to be offered to other artists, but her stunning vocals. changed all that. It became her first single and launched a partnership. with her team that is still intact. If. Emerald’s music is built around Forties big-band flourishes and. smouldering vocals, her image is also a quirky mix of old and new. Her voluptuous curves are draped in chic vintage clothes on her new album sleeve; sexy but strangely demure. ‘You can be sexy without throwing everything on the table,’ she insists. ‘I wouldn’t have wanted to live in the Forties, though. As a woman, I wouldn’t have the same rights as now. I’m a liberal Amsterdam girl, so I wouldn’t have been happy, but it’s nice to be nostalgic about the past.’ Caro’s new album pushes her music beyond the Hollywood theme of her debut. With its dramatic string sections recorded at Abbey Road, it harks back to the romance of Twenties Paris, with Black Valentine also nodding to Portishead. A stylish sequel, it should further enhance the status of a singer who was once dubbed the ‘Dutch Adele’. ‘Any comparison with Adele is a compliment, though I think my voice is different’ Caro tells me. ‘I’d love to have a beer with her one day.’ The Shocking Miss Emerald is out on May 6 on Dramatico.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son.

Please answer the following question: Johnathan is trying to find two blocks of wood with the same mass for a project he is working on. He doesn't have a balance, so he makes a crude one out of materials he has on hand. He put a block of wood on either side and the block on the left side was at a lower level than the block on the right. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: If Johnathan put two new blocks of wood on the balance and their levels are equal is their mass uneven or the same? Hint: Mass is a measure of the amount of matter in a substance or an object. The basic SI unit for mass is the kilogram (kg), but smaller masses may be measured in grams (g). To measure mass, you would use a balance. In the lab, mass may be measured with a triple beam balance or an electronic balance, but the old-fashioned balance pictured below may give you a better idea of what mass is. If both sides of this balance were at the same level, it would mean that the fruit in the left pan has the same mass as the iron object in the right pan. In that case, the fruit would have a mass of 1 kg, the same as the iron. As you can see, however, the fruit is at a higher level than the iron. This means that the fruit has less mass than the iron, that is, the fruit's mass is less than 1 kg. A:","completion":"Based on the given information, if Johnathan put two new blocks of wood on the balance and their levels are equal, it indicates that their mass is the same.

What is the answer: Who was the son of Darius and King of Persia from 486 to 465 BC?","completion":"The son of Darius and King of Persia from 486 to 465 BC was Xerxes I, also known as Xerxes the Great. Born around 519 BC, he was the eldest son of Darius I and Atossa, the daughter of Cyrus the Great, which made Xerxes a direct descendant of the Achaemenid dynasty's founder. Xerxes I became the King of Persia following the death of his father, Darius, in the autumn of 486 BC. As a ruler, Xerxes was known for his extensive military campaigns and his ambitious architectural projects. Throughout his reign, he significantly extended the Persian Empire by conquering territories across Egypt, Greece, and other regions. One of Xerxes' most notable campaigns was during the Greco-Persian Wars, particularly the Second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BC. It was during this invasion that the famous Battle of Thermopylae took place, where 300 Spartans and their Greek allies, led by King Leonidas, fought against thousands of Persian troops. Despite suffering some initial setbacks, Xerxes eventually emerged victorious, capturing and burning down the city of Athens. In addition to his military accomplishments, Xerxes was also a prolific builder, commissioning several large-scale architectural projects throughout his empire. Among them were the completion of the royal palace in Persepolis, the building of the famous Gate of All Nations in the same city, and the construction of a canal across the Mount Athos peninsula in Greece. Regarding his personal life, Xerxes had multiple wives and children, some of whom would go on to play critical roles in the Achaemenid Empire's politics and future. His most notable spouse was Queen Amestris, who bore him several children, including his eventual successor, Artaxerxes I. Xerxes I's reign came to an abrupt end in 465 BC when he was assassinated by Artabanus, the commander of the royal bodyguard. Following Xerxes' death, Artabanus briefly seized power, but a few months later, Xerxes' son Artaxerxes I emerged as the rightful heir, executing Artabanus and beginning his own rule. In summary, Xerxes I, the son of Darius and King of Persia from 486 to 465 BC, was an influential ruler known for his military conquests and ambitious architectural projects. His reign marks a significant period in the history of the Achaemenid Empire as he expanded the empire's territories and continued the legacy of his predecessors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi). They are invited to join a party on the bus. The group arrives at their destination, only to learn that a curse rests over the village and that every female child turns into a lesbian vampire on her 18th birthday. There is an old legend stating that the Vampire Queen, Carmilla, descended on the village during the night of a blood moon, killed its menfolk and seduced its women to her evil.

We all know that some of the greatest movies of all time were based on books. While not particularly accurate adaptations, these movies were nonetheless excellent films. Some great examples are the Harry Potter series, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and, to a lesser extent, almost every Disney film ever made. However, I must regretfully announce that A Wrinkle in Time is not one of those movies. Not only does it fail to meet some of the most basic expectations of Madeleine L'Engle's fan base, it manages to defy the standards of scriptwriting, acting, special effects and, ultimately, respect for the audience. Mind you, I'm not trying to be mean; on the contrary, I went into this affair with an open mind. I figured that a made-for-T.V. movie would make up for its lack of razzle-dazzle in its script. After all, the Star Wars spin-off Ewoks was decent, if a little silly. Come to think of it, the original Star Wars was made on \\"a lunch money budget\\", and look where it took George Lucas! However, from the first scene onward, disappointment started enveloping me as if I'd gotten too close to the Black Thing while tessering. The same way Greedo shooting first became the symbol of the Star Wars Special Edition of 1997 (a disaster of monumental proportions involving a disgruntled director making several hideous changes to a beloved classic), Mrs. Whatsit has officially become my personal symbol for the confusion and stupidity that is A Wrinkle in Time. The reason for this is the fact that she has been mutated beyond belief. Aside from the slightly controversial decision of casting Alfre Woodard (Star Trek: First Contact and Radio) as our favorite star-turned-mentor, the filmmakers decided it appropriate to introduce her as a crow. That's right, a crow. Moreover, the heavenly centaurion form of this greatly beloved character has been hacked at by what looks to be a demented eight-year-old; the majestic half-man, half-horse with wings has become a huge human head with a creepy smile mounted awkwardly on the bowlegged body of a horse that happens to be sporting a pair of wings in the middle. Had I been five, this would have psychologically traumatized me for life. The worst part is the fact that when it spoke, it was shown from behind so as to avoid the responsibility to lip sync, resulting in a scene that was spent looking at the back of its head and seeing a single, unmoving cheek, thus rendering the piece of special effects less believable than E.T. Having gotten the most painful part out of the way, I must go on to the tear-inducing one: the characters, the acting, and the story. I, personally, had always imagined Meg to look somewhat similar to Moaning Myrtle from the Harry Potter films: plain hair, glasses, and a figure most supermodels would find laughable. She was always a slightly anxious, humorously pessimistic math genius who quite simply could not have cared less about the imports and exports of Nicaragua. In the film, she is an unpleasant know-it-all for whom I have no sympathy whatsoever. In fact, she makes me feel sorry for poor Mr. Jenkins, her school principal, who continuously has to deal with her. Calvin, the kind, intelligent kid who everyone thinks is a jock has becomea jock! The irony is horrible. As for the memorable Happy Medium, they took the pleasant old woman who liked to look at happy things and replaced her with a being who is \\"above gender\\" and likes to look at \\"funny\\" things, such as girls falling off of swings. The only three people I can think of who did a decent job are Charles Wallace, Mrs. Whatsit and the Man With Red Eyes (nicknamed \\"the Dude With Red Eyes\\" due to his complete reinvention as a character). The story is a mess. A good comparison to this aspect of the movie is Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which didn't do a good job of retelling the story found in the book, yet kept the sole of the original work. Here, the sole of the book is having a pleasant chat with Hades down in the underworld, apparently unaware that its body is being destroyed. As the Dark Lord complements the sole on how well it showed that truth has to be felt and not seen, the flat-nosed wookies of Ixchel (who replace the wondrous beings who hold Aunt Beast among their ranks) tear the spine up. As the God of the Dead notes how subtle the terror of the Earth-like Camazotz was, the torn pages are scattered in the sandstorm and lost in the darkness of the land of evil. I am very sorry that this film exists. I do not believe that the actors were genuinely bad. It's the way the characters are written that ruins it. A Wrinkle in Time deserved to be adapted by Lawrence Kasdan, directed by George Lucas or Steven Spielberg, enhanced at Industrial Light and Magic, scored by John Williams, given its sound at Skywalker Sound, edited by THX and marketed by Twentieth Century Fox. In its current state, the film is unworthy to be shown to self-respecting people. Even Madeleine L'Engle thought it was bad. The book was Good, the film was Bad, and Mrs. Whatsit was Ugly. Score: 0.1/10 (If I could) Pros: They got the names right. Cons: It had horrible problems with the Cliffs Notes level of adaptation, script, acting and special effects, not to mention lack of evidence of ever having read the book. Oh, and the main cover/poster has a picture of the three main characters riding a flying horse over a castle. Some might say that this symbolizes high adventure.

Question: \\"What was Die Alpen?\\" Context: \\"Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons. Rousseau's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity. Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude. Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets, artists, and musicians, as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature.\\" Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"Die Alpen was a poem written by Albrecht von Haller that described the Alps as an area of mythical purity.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 1079 = 26*i + 40*i + 23 for i, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the terms with i. 26*i and 40*i are both terms with i as the variable, so we can combine them: (26*i + 40*i) = 66*i. Step 2: Rewrite the equation with the combined terms. Now, the equation becomes 1079 = 66*i + 23. Step 3: Isolate the variable term by moving the constant term to the left side. Subtract 23 from both sides of the equation: 1079 - 23 = 66*i + 23 - 23 1056 = 66*i Step 4: Solve for i. To find the value of i, we need to divide both sides by 66: 1056/66 = 66*i/66 i = 16 The solution for the equation 1079 = 26*i + 40*i + 23 is i = 16."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"China is a highly diverse country with numerous regional languages and dialects. The official language of China is Standard Mandarin, also known as Putonghua, which is based on the Beijing dialect. It is the most widely spoken language in the country and is taught in schools as the primary language across the nation. However, in addition to Standard Mandarin, there are several other varieties and dialects of the Chinese language that are spoken in different regions, the most prominent of which are as follows: 1. Cantonese (Yue): Primarily spoken in the Guangdong and Guangxi provinces, as well as in Hong Kong and Macau, Cantonese is one of the most significant regional languages in China. It is also widely spoken among overseas Chinese communities. 2. Shanghainese (Wu): This dialect is predominately used in the city of Shanghai and the surrounding areas within the Yangtze River Delta region. Shanghainese is notable for having significant differences in pronunciation and vocabulary when compared to Mandarin. 3. Hokkien (Min): Spoken mostly in the Fujian province, as well as in Taiwan, Singapore, and Malaysia, Hokkien is another essential regional language within China. There are several dialects within the Min language group, but Hokkien is the most widely spoken. 4. Gan: The Gan language is predominantly used in Jiangxi province and has different dialects, such as Changjing, Yiping, and Fuguang. While Gan shares some similarities with Mandarin, it has retained many ancient features that are not present in Standard Mandarin. 5. Hakka: Spoken by the Hakka people, this language is used in several provinces across China, including Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and Sichuan. The Hakka people also have a strong presence in Taiwan, as well as overseas Chinese communities. 6. Xiang: This language is primarily spoken in Hunan province and is known for its melodic and musical qualities. Xiang has two main branches, New Xiang and Old Xiang, with the latter being considered more conservative and closer to Middle Chinese. 7. Hui: Hui is the language predominantly spoken in Anhui province and is divided into three main groups – Jixi, Hu-Rao, and Xuancheng. It shares similarities with both Mandarin and Jianghuai Mandarin but is still distinct in many aspects. 8. Ping: Also known as Guangxi Pinghua, this language is mainly spoken in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region. It is closely related to Guangdong and Guangxi Cantonese, and it is further classified into two varieties – Northern and Southern Ping. While these languages and dialects are some of the most widely spoken, China is also home to numerous other linguistic variations and minority languages.

Paragraph: In the rest of the world, China's supreme sage, Kongfuzi (K'ung Fu-tzu), is better known by the romanized name \\"Confucius.\\" He was born in 551 b.c. in what is now Shandong Province in eastern China. So profound was his influence that eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to the birthplace of the Great Teacher. You, too, can pay your respects at the vast temple raised on the site of his home in the small town of Qufu (Chufu), and at his tomb in the woods just to the north. The classics of Confucius, while seldom addressing spiritual and metaphysical matters, set standards for social and political conduct that still underlie many of the Chinese ways of doing and perceiving. Confucius laid great stress on the proper and harmonious relationships between ruler and subject, parent and child, teacher and student, the individual and the state. These relationships were deemed to be hierarchical and dictatorial. If the order was disturbed, dire consequences inevitably resulted. The son who disobeyed the father would bring disaster upon himself and his family, just as the emperor who defied the \\"mandate of heaven\\" or ignored the good of the empire brought ruin upon the nation. Over the centuries Confucius has suffered more changes of fortune than probably any other philosopher. Honored soon after his death as the greatest of scholars, he was later revered as semi-divine; you can still visit temples to Confucius in many Chinese cities. During the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), however, he was denounced as a counter-revolutionary force. It was only after the death of Chairman Mao (1976) and the opening of China to the outside world under more progressive reformers that Confucius, too, was \\"rehabilitated.\\" Unlike Confucius, about whose life many specific and even colorful details are known, the philosopher Laozi (Lao Tse or Lao-Tzu) is an enigma. Estimates of his date of birth vary by well over a century. One legend even says he taught the young Confucius. Laozi is immortalized by his book of thoughts on man, nature, and the universe, Daodejing (\\"The Way and Its Power\\"), which became the major text of China's greatest indigenous religion, Daoism (Taoism). With its emphasis on nature, intuition, the individual, paradox (\\"The knowledge which is not knowledge\\"), and the cosmic flow known as \\"The Way,\\" Daoism became the religion of artists and philosophers. After the death of Confucius, the Zhou Dynasty entered a period of strife known as the \\"Warring States\\" period (475–221 b.c.). Question: \\"What is the current name of the Province that the eleven Chinese emperors made pilgrimages to?\\" Answer: \\"Zhou\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"No, the answer is not correct.

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Answer the following question: who holds the most hits in mlb history?","completion":"The Major League Baseball (MLB) player with the most hits in history is Pete Rose. Born on April 14, 1941, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Pete Rose, also known as \\"Charlie Hustle,\\" played in MLB for 24 seasons from 1963 to 1986. Rose spent the majority of his playing career with the Cincinnati Reds before playing for the Philadelphia Phillies and Montreal Expos. Throughout his remarkable career, Rose demonstrated an incredible ability to make contact with the ball and consistently get hits. He has accumulated a staggering 4,256 career hits, the most in MLB history. This record has placed Pete Rose at the top of the all-time hits leaders, surpassing legends like Ty Cobb, who held the previous record of 4,189 hits. Rose's hitting prowess was an integral part of his game and significantly contributed to his team's success during his playing years. In addition to his record for career hits, Rose also holds the record for games played (3,562), singles (3,215), and at-bats (14,053). Over his 24-year career, Rose was a 17-time All-Star, a three-time World Series champion (1975, 1976, and 1980), a three-time batting champion (1968, 1969, and 1973), and a Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1973. Pete Rose's legacy on the field is undeniable, and the significance of his most hits record cannot be overstated. It speaks volumes about his remarkable consistency, longevity, and commitment to the game of baseball. However, Rose's legacy has been marred by controversy off the field. In 1989, it was discovered that he had been betting on baseball games, including those of his own team, while he was a player and a manager for the Cincinnati Reds. This revelation led to the imposition of a lifetime ban from baseball and made Rose ineligible for induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame. Despite the controversy surrounding his off-field actions, Pete Rose's achievements on the field remain a testament to his exceptional talent and dedicated work ethic. As the holder of the most hits in MLB history, Rose's impact on the game of baseball is apparent, and his incredible accomplishments continue to resonate with fans, players, and historians alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The students in a school in Shanghai will go to the USA with his parents during the Spring Festival. \\"Overseas touring has always been a dream for me,\\" he said happily. Nowadays, Chinese people enjoy longer holidays, such as the three \\"Golden Week Holidays\\"(the Spring Festival, May Day and National Day). They have more time to travel. Rising incomes also make travelling abroad realistic for ordinary Chinese people. Nearly 7 million Chinese travelled overseas in 2001, according to the National Tourism Administration . The most common problem travellers face is how to choose the best routes . By the end of 2002, Chinese citizens were allowed to travel to 19 foreign countries and regions at their own expense. The top 10 places included Hong Kong, Macao and Thailand. European countries are also becoming increasingly popular. \\"More and more Chinese people have shown interest in travelling to Europe, particularly France and Finland,\\" said Tan Wen, a general manager of China Youth Travel Service. \\"Sooner or later, there will be a peak in European tours.\\" Another consideration is choosing the right travel agencies and finding the best price. The China Consumers' Association(CCA,)offered tips to consumers on choosing the right travel agencies to help prevent a relaxing vacation from turning into a costly disaster. \\"Price should not be the single most important factor in choosing a travel agency,\\" said Zhang Yuanchao, CCA vice-secretary general. Consumers are advised to choose large State travel agencies with good reputations and official approval to organize overseas tour groups. Zhang's association dealt with more than 5, 000 complaints about travel agencies last year. And the majority of the complaints were about _ in travel routes, bad tour guides, and forced shopping. Travellers were warned to look carefully at their contracts with agencies and to buy travel insurance . The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following factors has contributed to the increase in overseas travel by Chinese citizens? A. Longer holidays, such as the \\"Golden Week Holidays\\" B.

The passage describes Martha as being in the middle of an extremely long hike, feeling tired, and wanting to give up. However, she is determined to finish the hike and, ultimately, feels thrilled and proud of herself when she does. While her determination and eventual success could imply that she may have had some preparation or training for the hike, there is no concrete evidence within the passage to support this conclusion. The passage focuses more on Martha's emotions and experiences during the hike rather than her background or preparation. Additionally, her feelings of tiredness and desire to give up might imply that the hike was more challenging than she anticipated, which could mean that her training level, if any, may not have been sufficient for the difficulty of the hike.

The main focus of visiting a glacier is to enjoy the natural beauty, not to profit from it. (3). Using the colors found at a glacier to dye things is not a logical reason to pay an entrance fee. Glaciers are composed of ice and snow, and their colors come from the way sunlight interacts with the ice molecules. You cannot take or use these colors in any practical way. (4).

Keeping the temperature of the oven slightly lower will help the fish cook through consistently without falling apart. Lay each pike fillet on a sheet of aluminum foil. You can then add your herbs, spices and other ingredients of choice. When you’re done seasoning, fold the edges of the aluminum foil up around the fillets, making sure they’re completely covered. Baking fish uncovered often causes it to come out too dry. Add a burst of flavor to baked pike with aromatics like onion, capers, diced bell peppers, and oregano, or keep things simple with a little minced garlic and a drizzle of lemon-infused butter. Transfer the aluminum-wrapped fillets to the baking sheet, leaving a little space between each. Open the oven and slide the baking sheet onto the center rack. In addition to heating the fish more effectively, the aluminum foil will also lock in moisture and help the seasonings cook into the meat itself. Set a timer to keep track of how long the fish has been in the oven. When it’s finished, it should be tender and flaky with an opaque white coloring all the way through. Let the fillets cool for a few minutes, then plate and serve. You can test whether the fillets are done by cutting into them with a fork.

Article: If you still have the name and contact information for the doctor or clinic that gave you immunizations, they typically have those records on file. In most cases, this is the fastest way to get your immunization record. To protect patient privacy, you may have to go to the office in person and show a government-issued photo ID before your records will be released to you. If a doctor has retired, or a clinic has changed ownership, medical records typically are sent to a medical record storage company. You can still get your immunization records through the company, but you may have to pay a small fee for retrieval and copying. Many schools require immunization records from attending students. It may be easier to get your immunization records from your school than from your healthcare provider, particularly if you moved around a lot or saw several different doctors. This option typically is only available if you recently graduated. To protect students' privacy, schools usually don't keep these records for more than a year or two after graduation. You may have filed your immunization records along with other important papers and later forgotten about them. If you're looking for childhood immunization documents, check in baby books and other records your parents may have kept. Old papers from your childhood also might show the name of your pediatrician or other healthcare provider, who you could then contact for help locating your immunization records. In many countries, including the United States, there isn't a national immunization registry.

Here is an article: Bundle up and get outside early about an hour before dawn this week to see a potentially incredible grouping of bright planets in the eastern sky. Jupiter and Venus will be close in the morning sky with Mars not far behind Monday, and the three planets will appear to move nearer to on another as the week goes on. The three bright worlds will form a very close triangle in the sky on Wednesday morning. You won't need any special equipment to spot the planetary conjunction — the astronomy term for a close grouping of objects in the sky. The two planets are some of the brightest objects in our skies, and they look like gleaming stars. Skywatchers around the world should be able to catch a good view of Jupiter and Venus, weather permitting. Venus, Jupiter and Mars in the eastern sky on Oct. 28, 2015. Venus will be just a little more than 1 degree from Jupiter in the sky, meaning that the two bright planets will be incredibly close. (For reference, if you hold one of your fingers up to the sky at arm's length, that should cover about 1 degree of sky.) An average set of binoculars magnifies about a 6 or 7 degree patch of sky, according to NASA, so you could get a truly amazing view of three planets with a typical set of backyard skywatching binoculars this week. Binoculars could also reveal four of Jupiter's moons — Io, Ganymede, Europa and Callisto — if held steady by a tripod or leaning on something, NASA added. \\"The configuration of the moons will be different every morning,\\" NASA said in a video. Venus is brighter than Jupiter, which might seem a little counter-intuitive. Jupiter is larger in size, but it is much farther from Earth than Venus is, so the smaller planet seems to shine more brightly than the huge gas giant. Mars will be the dimmest of the three and tinted slightly red, but it will be relatively close to Venus and Jupiter, so it shouldn't be difficult to spot. The planets are actually millions of miles away from one another in the solar system, but these kinds of conjunctions happen every now and then when the worlds align from our perspective here on Earth due to the way the planets orbit the sun. This time of year is actually great for some skywatching in general. If you happen to miss the close conjunctions this week, you'll have more opportunities to see more close alignments of these cosmic bodies and the crescent moon next month. On Nov. 6, Jupiter will be above Mars and Venus with the moon hovering near the giant planet, while the moon will move down near Venus on Nov. 7. Saturn is in the night sky after sundown this month, and Mercury actually creeps just above the horizon before dawn. The Leonid meteor shower also peaks in mid-November, so that might be a good way to get your stargazing fix for the month. Have something to add to this story? Share it in the comments.

More than 600 parents of kids up to the age of 5 were queried for the survey, which found: 81% of parents think all children at day care should be vaccinated. If parents were told that 25% of kids at day care weren't immunized, 74% of parents would considering pulling their own children out. That scenario may mirror reality: The associate director of the poll tells LiveScience one in four preschoolers may not be up to date on their vaccinations. Nearly three-quarters of the respondents (74%) think day care providers should insist on yearly vaccination checks; most states don't require these annual checks, LiveScience notes. Most parents (66%) think they should be told if there are children attending day care who aren't current with their vaccines, but only one-quarter of them think the provider should name names. And if a child isn't up to date with his or her vaccines? Parents are split, with 41% thinking the child should be barred from attending entirely until they get immunized, 28% voting for a \\"grace period\\" in which the child can still attend (but has to eventually get vaccinated), and 21% OKing attendance with a doctor's waiver. Only 10% feel the child should be allowed to stay in day care as is. (Meanwhile, vaccine costs are rising.) Expand this summary.","completion":"A recent study conducted by the University of Michigan's CS Mott Children's Hospital has highlighted the concerns of parents regarding vaccinations in day care settings. The study involved surveying more than 600 parents with children up to the age of 5 years old and revealed that an overwhelming majority of 81% believe that all children attending day care should be vaccinated. Additionally, the research discovered that if parents were informed that 25% of the children at day care were not immunized, a significant 74% would consider withdrawing their own children from the facility. This concern is not unwarranted – according to the associate director of the poll, one in four preschoolers may not be up-to-date with their vaccinations. Evidently, the prospect of unvaccinated children attending day care centers has led to a heightened sense of anxiety for many modern parents. Most respondents (74%) feel that day care providers should enforce yearly vaccination checks, which is not currently a requirement in the majority of U.S. states. Furthermore, 66% of parents surveyed believe they should be informed if a child attending the day care is not up-to-date with their vaccinations. However, only a quarter of respondents felt that day care providers should identify the unvaccinated child by name. As for the appropriate response to unvaccinated children, the surveyed parents were divided in their opinions. While 41% believed that such children should be barred from attending day care until they received the necessary vaccinations, 28% were in favor of allowing a \\"grace period\\" during which the child could still attend, provided they eventually got vaccinated. Another 21% of parents were comfortable with a child attending day care without vaccinations, as long as a doctor provided a waiver. Interestingly, a mere 10% felt that the child should be allowed to stay in the day care facility without any changes to their vaccination status. In conclusion, the study by the University of Michigan's CS Mott Children's Hospital highlights the fact that a significant majority of parents believe all children attending day care should be vaccinated, with many even considering withdrawing their own children if others at day care are not immunized. This view extends to parents calling for annual vaccination checks in day care facilities and greater transparency in communicating the vaccination status of children attending the centers. With this in mind, it is essential for day care providers and public health officials to address these parent concerns and adopt policies that ensure a safe and healthy environment for all children in day care settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – New numbers on health insurance costs probably won't have employers tripping over themselves to make new hires: The average annual cost of a family premium paid by employers spiked 9% this year to 15,073, reports the New York Times. For single workers, the figure rose 8% to 5,429, notes the Wall Street Journal. Why the big hikes? At least part of the reason is likely because insurers are getting in hefty increases while they can before tougher new rules take effect next year under President Obama's overhaul. The higher premiums paid by employers comes as more employees pay higher deductibles and co-pays. About 50% of workers at small companies have yearly deductibles of at least 1,000, up from 16% in 2006, notes the Washington Post. “Without any real national discussion or debate, there’s a quiet revolution going on in what we call health insurance in this country,” says the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey of employers. \\"Health insurance is becoming less and less comprehensive. … And we expect that trend to continue.”","completion":"Title: Rising Health Insurance Costs Impact Employers and Employees Alike Introduction Health insurance costs have been on the rise, with the average annual cost of a family premium paid by employers spiking 9% this year to 15,073, as reported by the New York Times. Single workers have also been impacted, with the average cost rising 8% to 5,429, as noted by the Wall Street Journal. This increase in health insurance costs is causing employers to think twice before making new hires and has a significant impact on the benefits provided to employees. Several factors have contributed to these cost increases, including changes in insurance regulations under President Obama's overhaul. Reasons Behind the Health Insurance Cost Increase One of the primary reasons for the increase in health insurance costs is the anticipation of new rules and regulations set to take effect next year under President Obama's overhaul. Insurers are likely raising premiums to compensate for future restrictions, resulting in higher premiums paid by employers. Higher Deductibles and Co-Pays Rising health insurance costs have not only affected employers, but also employees who now have to pay higher deductibles and co-pays. The Washington Post reports that about 50% of workers at small companies have yearly deductibles of at least 1,000, which is up from 16% in 2006. This trend is indicative of a shift in the nature of health insurance, becoming less comprehensive while placing more financial burden on employees. The Quiet Revolution in Health Insurance According to the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which conducted the survey of employers, there is a \\"quiet revolution going on in what we call health insurance in this country.\\" The rising costs of health insurance and employer-sponsored coverage have necessitated a change in the structure of providing health benefits. Employers are forced to reevaluate their approaches to health insurance and navigate the changing landscape of employee benefits. Conclusion The substantial increase in health insurance costs is affecting both employers and employees, making it more expensive and less comprehensive than ever before. As insurers attempt to adapt to new rules and regulations under President Obama's overhaul, it is crucial for employers to be aware of the implications these changes will have on their workforce and develop innovative strategies to continue offering competitive benefits packages to their employees. As the national discussion surrounding health insurance continues to evolve, it is essential for all stakeholders to participate in creating solutions that balance affordability and comprehensive coverage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If Japan's progress toward parliamentary democracy was halted in the 1930s by the growing nationalism being imposed on government by the generals and admirals., can we conclude that \\"The generals and admirals imposed nationalism because they had to, not because they wanted to.\\"?","completion":"To determine the validity of the statement \\"The generals and admirals imposed nationalism because they had to, not because they wanted to,\\" we need to delve into the historical context in which these actions took place and explore the motivations behind them. In the 1930s, Japan's political landscape was characterized by a delicate balance between civilian government institutions and the military's influence. The rise of nationalism during this period can be attributed to various factors, including Japan's rapid industrialization and modernization, the worldwide depression of the 1930s, and the perception of Japan as a counterweight to the Western powers' influence in Asia. As Japan's economy grew, so did its military power. By the time of the London Naval Treaty in 1930, the Japanese navy was the third-largest in the world, and its army was also expanding. Due to Japan's economic and geopolitical situation at the time, the military saw nationalism as a means to mobilize public opinion and garner support for their agenda, which centered on territorial expansion and a greater Japanese presence in global affairs. Now, let's look at some of the reasons why Japanese generals and admirals might have felt compelled to impose nationalism on the government: 1. Military influence in politics: Owing to the Meiji Constitution (enacted in 1890), the military wielded a significant amount of power within the government. Both the Army and Navy Ministers had to be active-duty officers, enabling military factions to veto decisions they disagreed with. Thus, the military's promotion of nationalism may not have been solely out of personal conviction but rather as a means to maintain and consolidate their power over civilian political institutions. 2. Perceived threats from other nations: The Washington Naval Treaty (1922) and the London Naval Treaty (1930) placed limits on Japanese naval expansion, which was seen by some military leaders as an attempt by Western powers to limit Japan's ability to protect its interests. This led to the belief that Japan needed to assert itself more assertively on the international stage to protect its sovereignty and interests. 3. Economic hardships: The global depression of the 1930s severely impacted Japan's economy, resulting in unemployment, low agricultural prices, and labor unrest. Military leaders saw the promotion of nationalism as a means to revitalize domestic industries, particularly the heavy industries critical to military strength, and to create a united front against external threats. 4. Desire for territorial expansion: Military leaders saw territorial expansion, particularly into resource-rich Manchuria and China, as vital for ensuring Japan's continued economic growth and securing its place as a dominant force in East Asia. Promoting nationalism would rally public support for aggressive foreign policies and justify expansionist goals. While it is undeniable that the rise of nationalism in Japan during the 1930s served the interests of military leaders, it would be overly simplistic to conclude that the generals and admirals imposed nationalism solely because they \\"had to\\" and not out of personal conviction. It is likely that the palpable effects of international pressures, economic downturns, and a push for territorial expansion combined with the military's vested interests in maintaining power and influence, contributed to the promotion of nationalism. In conclusion, the imposition of nationalism by the generals and admirals during the 1930s can be viewed as both a strategic move to advance their interests and as a response to external and internal challenges faced by Japan at the time. It is essential to acknowledge the complex interactions and motivations behind their actions to gain a comprehensive understanding of this period in Japan's history."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It's a cultural event, showing we are at the top of the food chain, like no other food can. Nutritionally speaking, the tri-tip is one of the better cuts of beef.

Regrettably, in recent years, the state has also become known for something far less desirable—wildfires. Throughout this fire season, Californian firefighters are tirelessly working to combat the spread of major wildfires across the state. As the flames continue to rage, these brave men and women go up against extraordinary challenges in their attempt to protect lives and property. Step 1: Elaborate on the scale and impact of the wildfires: California has seen an unprecedented increase in wildfire frequency and intensity, largely as a result of climate change and prolonged drought. These fires have caused loss of life, destroyed countless acres of valuable land, and forced many people to evacuate from their homes. The economic impact and emotional toll of these disasters have soared, with millions of Californians grappling with the effects for years to come. Step 2: Discuss the roles of firefighters and the response measures: During these most trying times, firefighters play a critical role in mitigating the spread of wildfires. Working relentlessly on the front lines, they use an array of specialized equipment, techniques, and strategies to combat the fires. These include deploying firetrucks, helicopters, and other essential vehicles, as well as using controlled burns to prevent the fire's spread and save crucial infrastructure. Step 3: Highlight the challenges faced by the firefighters: The burgeoning wildfires create formidable obstacles for the firefighters. These obstacles include, but are not limited to, unpredictable weather conditions, hazardous materials, and dangerous topography. The men and women fighting these fires face both physical and mental exhaustion, with many remaining on the front lines for extended periods. The challenges posed by these wildfires necessitate seamless teamwork, exhaustive training, and immense personal sacrifice in completing their mission—the protection of California's citizens and resources. Step 4: Discuss preventative measures and future implications: In addition to battling existing wildfires, efforts are being put into research and development for new technologies and strategies focused on preventing future occurrences. The implementation of these measures remains crucial for the long-term safety of California's citizens and preservation of the state's cherished ecosystems. Furthermore, policymakers must craft legislation that addresses the root causes of these fires, primarily climate change, and other contributing factors. Conclusion: The firefighting efforts of California's heroes will continue until the last ember has been extinguished, but their work should not go unrecognized. The bravery and commitment they display as they struggle against the elements to protect their communities demonstrate the resilience of the human spirit and the importance of unity in the face of adversity. It is imperative that we continue to stand behind and support these individuals, while also striving to implement innovative prevention measures and policies to mitigate the effects of wildfires, not just in California, but around the globe."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Danny Meadow Mouse waited until all the rest of Peter Rabbit's friends had left the Old Briar-patch after paying their respects to Peter and Mrs. Peter, He waited for two reasons, did Danny Meadow Mouse. In the first place, he had seen old Granny Fox and Reddy Fox hanging about a little way off, and though they had disappeared after a while, Danny had an idea that they were not far away, but were hiding so that they might catch him on his way home. Of course, he hadn't the slightest intention of giving them the chance. He had made up his mind to ask Peter if he might spend the night in a corner of the Old Briar-patch, and he was very sure that Peter would say he might, for he and Peter are very good friends, very good friends indeed. The second good reason Danny had for waiting was this very friendship. You see, Peter had been away from the Green Meadows so long that Danny felt sure he couldn't know all about how things were there now, and so he wanted to warn Peter that the Green Meadows were not nearly as safe as before Old Man Coyote had come there to live. So Danny waited, and when all the rest of the callers had left he called Peter to one side where little Mrs. Peter couldn't hear.

Summarize this article: An alliance of regional parties took 178 seats out of 243. The BJP won 58. Mr Modi won a convincing victory in last year's national elections, but this poll was seen as a referendum on his economic programme. Defeat is a major setback for the prime minister, says the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder, in Delhi. However, a spokesman for the Hindu-led nationalist BJP rejected suggestions the result was a personal blow for Mr Modi, saying the party \\"managed a creditable performance\\". The prime minister had been hoping a victory in Bihar would boost his party's strength in India's upper house of parliament, which is made up of representatives of state legislatures and where he lacks a majority. With a population of 100 million, Bihar is one of India's largest states and one of the poorest. The BJP's defeat in Bihar is the second consecutive setback for Narendra Modi's Hindu nationalist party since it swept to power in Delhi last year. Earlier this year the BJP suffered a drubbing at the hands of an upstart anti-corruption party in Delhi. Now a \\"grand alliance\\" of powerful regional parties has handed out a defeat in what is one of India's most politically crucial states. Despite what his defenders say, Sunday's defeat is another blow to the charismatic Mr Modi, who is arguably the party's biggest vote-getter and who attended 26 campaign rallies in Bihar ahead of the vote. The results make it clear that Mr Modi's vote-catching abilities are on the wane and voters are already holding him to the promises he made to them last year. For India's bedraggled opposition, the Bihar victory is a major shot in the arm. They will now be emboldened to challenge Mr Modi by forging alliances and change the narrative of Indian politics.

Does it follow that \\"The DSM praises the victims by giving them courage to speak out against the injustices done to them.\\"? Possible answers: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","completion":"(c). No. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) that provides a common language, standard criteria, and classification of mental disorders for use by mental health professionals. It is important to note that the DSM is a diagnostic tool and not a commentary on individuals' experiences or the societal injustices they face. The original statement argues that the DSM insults victims of traumas and societal injustice by labeling their problems as mental disorders, which could lead to the perception that these individuals are \\"wacko\\" or responsible for their own suffering. This interpretation of the DSM sees it as further stigmatizing individuals who are already facing trauma and social inequalities. On the other hand, the proposal that the DSM praises victims by encouraging them to speak out about injustices they have experienced is not a direct or accurate interpretation of the DSM's function or intent. The primary goal of the DSM is to provide mental health professionals with a comprehensive, evidence-based system for diagnosing mental disorders. While providing a diagnosis can potentially help individuals understand their experiences and seek appropriate treatment, the DSM does not inherently encourage or praise victims for speaking out against injustices. Furthermore, while some argue that the DSM may inadvertently contribute to the stigmatization of certain individuals or groups, many mental health professionals and advocates believe that the DSM's diagnostic framework can contribute to better understanding, treatment, and support for those experiencing mental health challenges. However, this potential benefit does not guarantee the empowerment of individuals to speak out against societal injustice, as that is not the core function of the DSM. In conclusion, the answer is \\"no\\" because the DSM does not inherently praise or encourage victims of trauma or societal injustice to speak out, as its main purpose is to serve as a diagnostic resource for mental health professionals. While there may be benefits and drawbacks related to the DSM, relating it directly to praising or empowering victims to discuss injustices is not a direct or accurate representation of its purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize: The BBC has learned that despite having \\"direct oversight\\" of Network Rail, and pledging extra electrification in the election campaign, ministers were kept in the dark about the rail operator's plans. Sources at the Department for Transport said a Network Rail minute revealing a decision would have to be taken soon after polling day was not sent to the government until 22 May. The sources said neither ministers nor officials were informed. It means Conservatives made a rail manifesto pledge to electrify rail routes in ignorance of Network Rail's plans. However, Labour insisted the news showed ministers must have known rail electrification projects would be paused in June, and that they had misled voters. The Conservatives pledged to electrify rail routes in their manifesto, only to put plans for electrifying two lines on hold shortly after polling day. Minutes of a Network Rail board meeting from March show the board agreed to a plan that included making \\"decisions required jointly with the DfT re enhancement deferrals from June\\". \\"Enhancement\\" is industry jargon for upgrade. \\"Enhancement deferral\\" refers to delaying upgrades. It is understood rail executives had judged that taking any longer to pause struggling projects would incur extra costs. The government has had \\"direct oversight\\" of Network Rail since September last year. One senior rail executive has told me further delays are expected of major projects in the north of England. Network Rail's plans there had become a \\"standing joke\\" the executive said. Rail schemes were at the heart of George Osborne's election promise to create a \\"northern powerhouse\\". Shadow transport secretary Michael Dugher said: \\"This revelation shows ministers must have known before the general election that vital rail electrification projects would be shelved. \\"It is becoming increasingly apparent ministers deliberately decided to cynically mislead people during the general election campaign that key rail lines would be electrified in the Midlands and the North, knowing full well that they would then renege on these commitments after the election. \\" Minutes from Network Rail board meetings as early as November reveal there were concerns about the \\"deliverability\\" and affordability of upgrades.

Summarize: Media playback is not supported on this device Cook batted for almost 10 hours, his eventual dismissal prompting England's declaration at 514-8. Dawid Malan, looking to secure a place at number five, scored 65, his maiden Test half-century. West Indies had reached 44-1, 470 behind, when rain forced the players off with 26 overs left to bowl. That was a decent effort from the tourists, who spent a day and a half in the field and were facing the pink ball in cold, cloudy conditions. Still, West Indies, who have not won a Test in the UK since 2000, face a huge task simply to avoid the follow-on. Play will start half an hour earlier than scheduled at 13:30 BST on the remaining three days Saturday to make up for the lost overs. Cook was in good touch in the 3-1 series win over South Africa, but did not make the big score he seemed capable of. That continued a trend in the former captain's batting that dates back for four years - in his previous 98 innings he had converted only five of his 31 half-centuries into hundreds. Here, he picked up from his overnight 153 and methodically gorged himself on a tame West Indies attack that at least showed some improvement from the first day. Whereas Cook played uncharacteristic cover drives on Thursday, his Friday accumulation was with more familiar cuts and clips off the pads. He barely scored a run down the ground. He looked to up the pace after lunch, an England plan that saw Ben Stokes, Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali fall cheaply. Cook finally made a misjudgement to play across the line to Roston Chase, the off-spinner earning an lbw decision on review for figures of 4-113. Middlesex's Malan managed only 35 runs in two Tests against South Africa and was in need of a score to press his claim for a place on this winter's Ashes tour to Australia. He survived against the second new ball and under lights on day one, albeit after being dropped on two, and resumed on 28 when England started the day on 348-3. The left-hander played attractive drives both through and over cover, as well as collecting runs behind square on the leg side. Malan extended his partnership with Cook to 162 and had the opportunity for a Test century when he edged a good delivery from Chase to slip. Three figures would perhaps have guaranteed him a trip down under but, as it is, he may well need another score in this three-match series. Former England captain Michael Vaughan told BBC Test Match Special: \\"Malan will be delighted, but today was a perfect opportunity for him to get a big score. There were runs for the taking.\\" England declared just as the clouds began to close in and fears that West Indies could capitulate were enhanced when Kraigg Brathwaite edged James Anderson behind without a run on the board. However, Kieran Powell and debutant Kyle Hope found a way to survive, although both needed some good fortune. Powell was reprieved by Stokes at gully on two and Hope survived a tough chance that barely carried to Moeen at third slip, both off Stuart Broad. Rain had been forecast for earlier in the day, but when it arrived just before 19:30 it quickly became apparent that no further play would be possible. Not that it dampened the spirits of a large group who gathered at the back of the Hollies Stand, singing the loudest songs of the day even after the abandonment came at 20:10. Media playback is not supported on this device Ex-England captain Michael Vaughan on TMS: \\"Today was all about Alastair Cook and the way in which he occupied the crease. When you have players of his quality, they never miss out. \\"Full credit to West Indies' batsmen - they coped with Anderson. Broad didn't find his rhythm - he bowled short and wide.\\" West Indies all-rounder Roston Chase: \\"Yesterday we weren't at our best - we were a little ill-disciplined with our bowling. We had a chat about it and we made a better effort today. \\"The guys were batting well. We were confident they would have taken us to the end of the play.\\" Former West Indies fast bowler Sir Curtly Ambrose on TMS: \\"The West Indies bowlers weren't penetrative enough on day one. I didn't see any aggression. They ran into a road block in Root and Cook. \\"It's not going to be easy for West Indies. They will have to bat well and try to avoid the follow-on - that will be key. If they don't, they will be in trouble.\\"","completion":"In a cricket game, Cook played really well and batted for almost 10 hours. He helped England declare at 514-8. Dawid Malan also did well, scoring 65 points. West Indies got a little bit closer with 44-1, but then rain stopped the game. They still have a big challenge to avoid falling behind. The game will start a little earlier on the next three days to make up for lost time. Everyone is excited to see how it will turn out, and players from both teams are focused on doing their best."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Argentina in the late nineteenth century was an exciting place. Around 1870,it was experiencing an economic boom, and the capital, Buenos Aires, attracted many people. Farmers, as well as a flood of foreigners from Spain and Italy, came to Buenos Aires seeking jobs. These jobs didn't pay well, and the people felt lonely and disappointed with their new life in the city. As the unhappy newcomers mixed together in the poor parts of the city, the dance known an the tango came into being. At the beginning the tango was a dance of the lower classes. It was danced in the bars and streets. At that time there many fewer women the men, so if a man didn't want to be left out, his only choice was to dance with another man so that he could attract the attention of the few available women. Gradually, the dance spread into the upper classes of Argentinean society and became more respectable. In Europe at this time, strong interest in dance from around the world was beginning. This interest in international dance was especially evident in Paris. Every kind of dance from ballet to belly dancing could be found on the stages of the Paris theaters of the Paris theaters. After tango dances from Argentina arrive in Europe, they began to draw the interest of the public as they performed their exciting dance in cafes. Though not everyone approved of the new dance, saying it was a little too shocking, the dance did find enough supporters to make it popular. The popularity of the tango continued to grow in many other parts of the world. Soldiers who returned to the United States from World War I brought the tango to North America. It reached Japan in 1926, and in 2003 the Argentinean embassy in Seoul hired a local tango dancer to act an a kind of dance ambassador, and promote tango dancing throughout South Korea.

Q: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

Overwhelmed by life's adversities, we often find ourselves caught up in a vicious cycle of negative thinking. However, it's essential to understand that negative thoughts can significantly impact our mental health, overall well-being, and the way we navigate our lives. To promote a more positive mindset, let's delve into various techniques that can help us acknowledge, release, and transform our negative thought patterns. Step 1: Acknowledge your negative thoughts The first step in overcoming negative thoughts is to acknowledge their presence. Instead of ignoring or suppressing these thoughts, accept them as part of your current mental state. This step's significance lies in developing self-awareness, as denial can only exacerbate the situation. Being honest with yourself and recognizing negative thoughts will set the stage for subsequent steps. Step 2: Release your negative thoughts Once you've acknowledged your negative thoughts, it's time to let them go. The act of releasing these thoughts helps to reduce their power and influence over you. There are various techniques you can employ for this purpose, such as deep breathing exercises, visualization, or journaling. Find a method that works best for you and practice it regularly to create a habit of releasing negative thoughts. Step 3: Have concerns without dwelling on them It's natural to have concerns about various aspects of our lives, such as work, finances, or relationships. However, it's essential to differentiate between having concerns and dwelling on those concerns. Continuously ruminating on negative thoughts can have an adverse impact on our mental health and daily functioning. Focus on identifying any genuine concerns, creating a plan to address them, and then moving forward without letting them dominate your thoughts. Step 4: Don't buy into the negative thinking Negative thoughts can be deceptive, masquerading as the truth. It's crucial not to buy into the negative thinking. This step involves developing a healthy skepticism towards your thoughts and questioning their validity. By employing critical thinking skills and challenging your thoughts, you can disrupt the negative cycle and gain better control over your emotions. Step 5: Determine the source of your negative thinking To manage your negative thoughts effectively, it's helpful to identify their root cause. This requires a deep understanding and self-reflection about your beliefs, upbringing, experiences, and influences that have shaped your thought patterns. By identifying and resolving the underlying factors contributing to negative thoughts, you can work towards fostering a more optimistic mindset. Step 6: Think of the worst possible outcome that could happen One of the most powerful strategies for transforming negative thoughts into more constructive ones is to imagine the worst possible outcome of a situation. This exercise helps in putting things into perspective and makes you realize that your fears may be irrational or exaggerated. As you become more aware of the unrealistic nature of your negative thoughts, you can start replacing them with more balanced and positive ones. Conclusion Overcoming negative thoughts is an ongoing process that requires commitment, self-awareness, and consistent practice. By acknowledging, releasing, and transforming negative thinking, we can actively cultivate a positive mindset and reshape our lives. Embrace these techniques to nurture a healthier, happier outlook and promote a more fulfilling life experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ABC News’ Jonathan Karl reports: Senior House Democratic aides say that House Ways and Means Chairman Charlie Rangel is negotiating terms with Democratic leaders to step down temporarily from his post atop the powerful tax-writing committee, pending the completion of several ethics committee investigations into his conduct. But while aides say he is temporarily negotiating to step down, Rangel remained publicly defiant and emerged from a meeting with Democratic leaders tonight saying he would hold on to the chairman’s gavel. According to aides, Rangel was in the Democratic cloakroom Tuesday evening, working out the details of a temporary resignation with House parliamentarian and Democratic leaders. But upon leaving the meeting, Rangel was asked by reporters if he would remain chairman, and he replied, “You bet your life.” Pelosi, who was at the meeting, declined to comment. Rangel also said he was still the chairman, and denied that he was stepping down as chairman. Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., is next in line in seniority and would be the most likely person to take over at least temporarily. ABC News' Dean Norland contributed to this report. ||||| Ways and Means Chairman Charles Rangel is still clinging to his gavel, but it is no longer a question of if – but when, how and to whom – he will give it up, according to Democratic insiders. With his ethics problems becoming an albatross around the necks of his party’s most politically vulnerable members, the venerable New York Democrat was pushed deep into a corner Tuesday night – meeting with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a covey of aides in her ceremonial office in the southeast corner of the Capitol. He insisted he that he is still chairman of the powerful tax-writing committee but couldn’t guarantee that would still be the case by the end of today. “I can’t make all those promises at my age,” he said as he left the meeting with Pelosi late Tuesday. Republicans are ready to a force a floor vote on whether he should be stripped of his chairmanship, and that’s a lose-lose proposition for Rangel. For him to win that kind of vote, some Democrats in tough swing districts – including those in his home state of New York – would have to put themselves in further electoral jeopardy by backing him up. Last week’s ethics committee judgment that Rangel violated House gift rules by accepting travel to the Caribbean appeared to be the last straw for many of his rank-and-file colleagues. Even as House Democratic leaders said over the weekend that they would await the outcome of the committee’s work on several other allegations against Rangel, so-called Frontline Democrats – those the party has identified as most vulnerable to defeat in November – began making their decisions to dump Rangel. If all House members vote and all 178 Republicans favor removing Rangel, the GOP would need 39 Democrats to help oust him. The public list of Democratic defectors was still less than half that Tuesday night, but Democratic lawmakers and aides said the ranks were swelling quickly behind closed doors. The group that has publicly abandoned Rangel includes not just members who are in danger of losing their seats but also at least three – Artur Davis who is running for governor of Alabama and Reps. Brad Ellsworth and Paul Hodes, who are seeking Senate seats in Indiana and New Hampshire, respectively. Those camps could easily be joined by “good government” liberals who are uncomfortable not only with the first judgment against Rangel but also the scope and nature of the allegations against him: that he failed to pay taxes on a Dominican rental property, that he improperly solicited funds for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York, that he broke New York City rules by maintaining multiple rent-regulated apartments and that he omitted hundreds of thousands of dollars of income and assets from financial disclosure forms that lawmakers are required to file with the House. As the defections mounted, press aides were quick to send out releases to reporters working on the story – or at least make sure their bosses were included on lists of those who would not support Rangel in a floor vote. ||||| New York Rep. Charles Rangel temporarily stepped aside as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday as he struggled with mounting ethics woes that left his political future uncertain at best. Rangel's decision cheered Democrats who feared political fallout affecting their own futures, but did little to satisfy Republicans who had been seeking a formal vote bringing about his temporary removal from the chairmanship. The 20-term congressman has played a key role in President Barack Obama's attempts to win passage of historic health care legislation. Veteran Rep. Fortney \\"Pete\\" Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the panel, will serve as acting chairman. First elected in 1970, Rangel is among the longest-serving African-American members of Congress, ranking just behind Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., in seniority, and he was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. Rep. Barbara Lee of California, the caucus chairman, said, \\"We look forward to the conclusion of the investigation and to him resuming his position as chairman.\\" A number of questions have been raised about the 79-year-old Rangel's conduct. Ethics investigators are looking into his use of his official position to raise money for a New York college center to be named after him and his belated disclosure of at least hundreds of thousands of dollars in assets and his use of rent-controlled apartments in New York. Republicans had been calling for Rangel to step aside since last year, and these demands multiplied after the House ethics panel last Friday released a report accusing him of violating House gift rules in connection with a series of trips he took to the Caribbean. The panel said that he had violated standards of conduct by accepting 2007 and 2008 trips to Caribbean conferences that were financed by corporations. It said it could not prove whether Rangel knew of the corporate payments but concluded that members of his staff knew about them — and the congressman was responsible for their actions. For his part, Rangel said he didn't even have \\"constructive knowledge\\" of the corporate sponsorship of the trips and couldn't be held responsible for something staff members may have known but which he didn't. His political problems were compounded by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's promise to drain the swamp of ethics problems after Democrats took over the House — following a 2006 campaign accusing Republicans of fostering a culture of corruption. Rangel called his news conference Wednesday on short notice, telling reporters, \\"My chairmanship is bringing so much attention to the press, and in order to avoid my colleagues having to defend me during their elections, I have this morning sent a letter\\" asking to be granted \\"a leave of absence until such time as the ethics committee completes its work.\\" Rangel said later Wednesday that his stepping aside \\"should take care of the political problem\\" that other Democrats have as a result of his ethics problems. \\"It just seems to me that I should not do anything that would impede the success of other Democrats,\\" he told reporters. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., chairman of the House Democratic caucus, said Rangel told a party meeting \\"There are things that are bigger than yourself,\\" including his love for his city and state and the important matters before Congress. \\"I think he stands taller in the minds of many people in our caucus for doing it,\\" Larson said. Pelosi met with Rangel Tuesday night and declined to endorse his continuing on as chairman. She said Wednesday in a statement, \\"I commend Chairman Rangel for his decades of leadership on jobs, health care, and the most significant economic issues of the day.\\" Fundraising power Rangel has raised considerable money for fellow Democrats. His leadership political action committee raised 2.2 million in the 2008 election cycle and spent 2 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He also raises money through a Rangel Victory Fund. Republican campaign officials have started criticizing individual Democrats for holding on to chunks of campaign contributions that resulted from Rangel's fundraising. As an example of his eroding support, several Democratic House members said they were giving campaign donations affiliated with Rangel away to charity.

Wow ... as they say , \\" When it rains it pours . \\" Our auxiliary backup emergency dog Remy passed away this morning . She was 13 . She was not feeling well and we took her to the vet yesterday . For some unknown reason , her red blood cells were attacking each other . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What may be the reason that Remy ’s red blood cells start attacking each other ?","completion":"I'm not a veterinarian, but there could be several potential reasons that Remy's red blood cells were attacking each other, leading to her not feeling well. Here are some possible causes: 1. Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA): This is a condition where the dog's immune system mistakenly identifies its own red blood cells as foreign substances and attacks them. This results in a rapid decrease in the number of red blood cells, leading to anemia. IMHA can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary, where it is triggered by an underlying condition such as an infection, cancer, or reaction to a drug. 2. Parasite infection: Certain parasites, such as Babesia species, can invade and destroy red blood cells, leading to anemia. These parasites are often transmitted through tick bites, and diagnosing the infection usually involves testing the blood for the presence of the parasite. 3. Toxic exposure: Ingestion of certain chemicals, toxins, or drugs can cause oxidative damage to red blood cells and lead to their destruction. Common examples include ingestion of zinc (commonly found in pennies and other metal objects), onions or garlic (toxic to dogs), and certain medications, including over-the-counter painkillers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. 4. Genetic disorders: Some dogs might be predisposed to red blood cell abnormalities due to genetic factors. Hereditary spherocytosis, for instance, is a rare congenital disorder that affects the stability and shape of red blood cells, making them more susceptible to rupturing. Certain breeds, such as Cocker Spaniels and Basenjis, may be more prone to these types of genetic conditions. 5. Underlying illness: In some cases, red blood cell destruction could be a result of an underlying disease or condition, such as cancer (e.g., lymphoma or leukemia), liver or kidney failure, or autoimmune disorders. In such instances, the reason for red blood cells attacking each other is a consequence of the primary illness affecting the body. In summary, there are various potential reasons that Remy's red blood cells started attacking each other, ranging from immune-mediated hemolytic anemia to toxic exposure or an underlying illness. A veterinarian would be best suited to diagnose the exact cause and provide appropriate treatment or recommendations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Problem:Paragraph: Virus attachment to host cells is mediated by dedicated virion proteins, which specifically recognize one or, at most, a limited number of cell surface molecules. Receptor binding often involves protein-protein interactions, but carbohydrates may serve as receptor determinants as well. In fact, many different viruses use members of the sialic acid family either as their main receptor or as an initial attachment factor. Sialic acids (Sias) are 9-carbon negativelycharged monosaccharides commonly occurring as terminal residues of glycoconjugates. They come in a large variety and are differentially expressed in cells and tissues. By targeting specific Sia subtypes, viruses achieve host cell selectivity, but only to a certain extent. The Sia of choice might still be abundantly present on non-cell associated molecules, on non-target cells (including cells already infected) and even on virus particles themselves. This poses a hazard, as high-affinity virion binding to any of such \\"false\\" receptors would result in loss of infectivity. Some enveloped RNA viruses deal with this problem by encoding virionassociated receptor-destroying enzymes (RDEs). These enzymes make the attachment to Sia reversible, thus providing the virus with an escape ticket. RDEs occur in two types: neuraminidases and sialate-O-acetylesterases. The latter, originally discovered in influenza C virus, are also found in certain nidoviruses, namely in group 2 coronaviruses and in toroviruses, as well as in infectious salmon anemia virus, an orthomyxovirus of teleosts. Here, the structure, function and evolution of viral sialate-O-acetylesterases is re-R.J.d.

The guidelines provided are clear: 1. Read the provided paragraph from a research paper. 2. Given the paragraph's content, decide whether the proposed title is suitable. 3. If you think the title adequately captures the main points of the paragraph, you would return \\"True.\\" 4. If the title does not fit the paragraph's content accurately, you would return \\"False.\\" So, using these steps, here's what we do: 1. Read the paragraph: This paragraph discusses the role of Sia (sialic acids) in virus attachment to host cells and the problems these pose, such as the possibility of binding to \\"false\\" receptors. It also talks about Receptor-Destroying Enzymes (RDEs), with a focus on sialate-O-acetylesterases that are found in various viruses. 2. Evaluate the title: \\"Structure, function and evolution of the hemagglutinin-esterase proteins of corona-and toroviruses\\". The title mentions 'hemagglutinin-esterase proteins of corona-and toroviruses', but there's no mention of these specific proteins in the paragraph. The paragraph rather talks about sialate-O-acetylesterases, a type of RDE. 3. Therefore, based on the content of the paragraph, the title doesn't seem suitable as it doesn't match the main theme of the paragraph which is about sialate-O-acetylesterase enzymes and how they make the attachment of viruses to Sia reversible. 4.

For decades, it was hypothesized that exercise-induced endorphin release is solely responsible for a runner’s high, but recent evidence has suggested that endocannabinoids also may play a role. Here, we demonstrate that wheel running increases endocannabinoids and reduces both anxiety and sensation of pain in mice. Ablation of cannabinoid receptor 1 receptors on GABAergic neurons inhibits running-induced anxiolysis, and pharmacological blockage of central and peripheral cannabinoid receptors inhibits analgesia. We thus show for the first time to our knowledge that cannabinoid receptors are crucial for main aspects of a runner’s high. Abstract Exercise is rewarding, and long-distance runners have described a runner’s high as a sudden pleasant feeling of euphoria, anxiolysis, sedation, and analgesia. A popular belief has been that endogenous endorphins mediate these beneficial effects. However, running exercise increases blood levels of both β-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid). Using a combination of pharmacologic, molecular genetic, and behavioral studies in mice, we demonstrate that cannabinoid receptors mediate acute anxiolysis and analgesia after running. We show that anxiolysis depends on intact cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) receptors on forebrain GABAergic neurons and pain reduction on activation of peripheral CB1 and CB2 receptors. We thus demonstrate that the endocannabinoid system is crucial for two main aspects of a runner's high. Sedation, in contrast, was not influenced by cannabinoid or opioid receptor blockage, and euphoria cannot be studied in mouse models. ||||| ALTANTA (CBS Atlanta)– The “high” you get after running may be linked to the same high you get from smoking weed, according to a new study. Researchers found the post-exercise feeling of euphoria provides a similar effect as smoking marijuana due to the brain’s cannabinoid receptors that relieve pain, as reported by Daily Mail. University of Hamburg and University of Heidelberg researchers studied cannabinoid receptors in mice after they ran. Previous research indicates that the pleasant feeling associated with a runner’s high is due to raised levels of beta-endorphins. However, the new findings suggest that these endorphins are actually too large to get through the blood-brain barrier and that it’s more likely the feeling is associated with the cannabinoid receptors. These receptors can affect appetite, pain, mood, and memory. “Running exercise increases blood levels of both beta-endorphin (an opioid) and anandamide (an endocannabinoid),” the researchers wrote. Researchers tested the theory by conditioning a group of mice to run on a treadmill, they were then separated into two groups. One group ran on the treadmill for five hours while the other group stayed inactive. Both groups were then evaluated for reduced anxiety by seeing how the mice behaved in the dark and by testing their tolerance for pain. A second experiment used all the same factors, but also gave the mice endocannabinoid and endorphin antagonists that blocked the effects. This time the mice who ran showed no results of a runner’s high. “[This shows] for the first time to our knowledge that cannabinoid receptors are crucial for main aspects of a runner’s high,” study authors note. ||||| Photo Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. We’ve probably all heard someone exclaim, “Ah, my endorphins are kicking in!” at the end of a good run. Endorphins are famous for supposedly producing “runner’s high,” that fleeting sense of calm and euphoria that engulfs many of us after a satisfying workout. But in fact, endorphins may be unfairly hogging the credit for making workouts enjoyable, according to an enlightening new experiment with animals. The findings suggest that endorphins have little to do with runner’s high. Instead, that euphoric feeling may be the product of a completely different but oddly familiar substance — the body’s own endocannabinoids, the chemicals that, like the cannabinoids in marijuana, lighten mood. Endorphins first became a household word in the 1980s, when researchers found that blood levels increased after prolonged exercise. This finding made sense. Exercise can cause discomfort or pain, and endorphins are the body’s self-produced opiates, with pain-relieving properties much like morphine. From that discovery, it was a short step to believing that endorphins must also produce the pleasurable mental sensations that many people feel after exercise. But there is a substantial problem with that idea, and it involves the substantial-ness of endorphins. They are large molecules, too big to pass through the blood-brain barrier. They might staunch pain in the muscles, but they wouldn’t have effects directly inside the brain, where any high would originate. So for the past decade or so, scientists have been looking for other substances that might be involved in making exercisers feel high, which led them, perhaps unsurprisingly, to endocannabinoids. Endocannabinoids are, essentially, internally produced marijuana, or cannabis. Cannabis contains cannabinoid molecules, which are small enough to cross the blood-brain barrier and attach there to receptors, producing a floaty, hey-dude high. In recent years, scientists have found that exercise raises the levels of endocannabinoids in the bloodstreams of people and animals, making these molecules good candidates to underlie the runner’s high. But few studies have directly compared the effects of endorphins and endocannabinoids to determine which really makes exercise mildly intoxicating. So for the new study, which was published this week in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers with the Central Institute of Mental Health at the University of Heidelberg medical school in Mannheim, Germany, rounded up healthy lab mice, tested their anxiety levels by putting them in cages with pockets of darkness and light (anxious animals stick to the shadows), and then gave them running wheels. Mice generally like running, engaging in the activity even when they are not being pursued. That suggests, researchers believe, that they gain some kind of mental satisfaction or reward from it, experiencing the mouse version of a runner’s high. That possibility was borne out in an early portion of the new experiment, when the scientists noted elevated levels of both endorphins and endocannabinoids in the animals’ bloodstreams after running. The scientists also found that the animals were more tranquil after running, spending longer periods of time in lighted areas within their cages — something that anxious, twitchy animals won’t do — and that they were more pain tolerant when exposed to slight physical discomfort. In general, these post-running mice were more chill than before. But when the researchers used drugs to block the workings of some of the animals’ endocannabinoid system, so that receptors in the animals’ brains couldn’t take up the molecules, their post-run cool disappeared. The animals proved to be as anxious then after running as they had been before and very sensitive to pain. Without a working endocannabinoid system, they developed no runner’s high. However, when the researchers similarly blocked the animals’ response to endorphins, while leaving their endocannabinoid system unchanged, the mice enjoyed all of the soothing effects of running. They were calmer in their cages afterward and seemed to experience less sensitivity to pain. Even without the ability to respond to endorphins, in other words, they experienced the rodent version of a runner’s high, strongly suggesting that endorphins do not contribute to the high, but endocannabinoids do. The practical implications of these results are somewhat limited, of course, because they involve mice, not people, and tell us only what goes into creating a runner’s high and not how to ensure that we will feel that same post-run serenity. One possible if slightly disheartening lesson of the study could be, in fact, that we may need to cover considerable mileage in order to experience a runner’s high; the mice in the study, small as they are, averaged more than three miles every day on their wheels. More broadly encouraging, though, the results should remind us that, like mice, we were built through evolution to be in motion. Our ancestors ran to avoid danger and hunt food. For them, “reduced sensations of pain and less anxiety through long-distance running would have been a benefit,” says Johannes Fuss, now a professor at the University of Hamburg, who led the new study. To survive as a species, we seem to have needed to run, and nature obligingly found ways to make this strenuous movement pleasurable by providing us with a runner’s high. So the subtle upshot of the new study may be that we should run. And if we don’t feel a high, perhaps try running more, until eventually a gentle euphoria may settle in and we can turn to our running companion and say, “Ah, my endocannabinoids are kicking in at last!” Related: ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Sure, I can explain this in a simpler way. You know how when you play a lot and run around, sometimes you feel really, really happy afterward? That's called a runner's high. Scientists used to think this happy feeling only came from something inside us called endorphins. But this article is talking about a new study that says something else inside us might also make us feel happy after running. This something else is called endocannabinoids, which work in a similar way as a substance in the plant that makes people feel relaxed, called marijuana. To understand better, these scientists made mice run a lot and saw that not only did the mice seem happier and less scared, but they also didn't feel as much pain. But, if the scientists made it so the mice's bodies couldn't use endocannabinoids, the mice didn't get that happy, relaxed feeling after running. So, they think endocannabinoids might be an important part of that happy feeling we get after lots of exercise."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: EPA estimates on drilling pollution unreliable, report says WASHINGTON – Limited data and unreliable estimates on air pollution from oil and natural gas production is hindering the Environmental Protection Agency's efforts to police the drilling boom, the agency's internal watchdog said in a report released Thursday. Inspector General Arthur Elkins Jr. said the EPA has failed to directly measure emissions from some pieces of equipment and processes, and some estimates it does have are of \\"questionable quality.\\" \\"With limited data, human health risks are uncertain, states may design incorrect or ineffective emission control strategies, and EPA's decisions about regulating industry may be misinformed,\\" Elkins said. The EPA, under President Barack Obama, has stepped up regulation of natural gas drilling, which has been booming thanks to hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. About 25,000 wells a year are being fracked, a process in which water, chemicals and sand are injected at high pressure underground to release trapped natural gas. Obama also wants to expand natural gas production, as long as it doesn't damage the environment. Oil and gas production, from the well site to processing plants to storage tanks and transmission lines, releases toxic and cancer-causing air pollutants, smog-forming gases and methane, a potent greenhouse gas blamed for global warming. The oil and gas industry has said the EPA has overestimated emissions of methane and argued that they already were working to reduce pollution, without the agency's intervention. The EPA last year issued the first-ever standards to control smog- and soot-forming gases from gas wells site, and updated existing rules to reduce cancer-causing pollution, such as benzene, from other equipment. The agency, in response to the report, agreed to develop a comprehensive strategy to improve its pollution figures. An industry association, America's Natural Gas Alliance, had not seen the report and had no comment late Thursday.","completion":"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is having trouble keeping an eye on air pollution from oil and natural gas production.

The pilots of Northwest Flight 188 did not fall asleep when they overflew their destination by more than 100 miles in October, the National Transportation Safety Board said Thursday in a detailed report on the wayward flight. The two pilots \\"became distracted by a conversation\\" about the airline's new work schedule system and by laptop computers they were using in violation of company policy and did not communicate with air traffic control for about 1 hour and 17 minutes while they cruised past their Minneapolis, Minnesota, destination at 37,000 feet, the NTSB said. The safety board also faulted the Federal Aviation Administration for air traffic control shortcomings. The NTSB report gives the most complete official account to date of the errant flight, which prompted the FAA to revoke both pilots' licenses, prompted the airline to suspend them from flying and prompted the FAA to adopt new procedures to notify the U.S. military in cases where the FAA loses contact with commercial aircraft. According to the account, the flight from San Diego, California, was routine until the plane was in the Denver, Colorado, region. There, air traffic controllers directed the crew of the Airbus A-320 to change their radio frequency. The co-pilot, or first officer, acknowledged the frequency change and read back the correct frequency. However, neither the captain nor the first officer contacted controllers on the new frequency until about 1 hour and 17 minutes later, when Winnipeg, Manitoba, controllers directed the crew to contact Minneapolis. The NTSB said that because of the proximity of the Winnipeg frequency to the last frequency acknowledged by the pilots (Winnipeg is 132.125 megahertz, while the last frequency used was 132.17) it is \\"likely the first officer began to dial in the new frequency but never completed the frequency change by pushing an activation button. Nor did the first officer attempt to contact the next controller.\\" The NTSB said the frequency change likely occurred while the captain was taking a restroom break and while a flight attendant was serving dinner. \\"These events may have distracted the first officer from completing the frequency change or attempting to contact the next ATC controller,\\" the NTSB said. Further, the captain's absence would have prevented him from checking the co-pilot's actions. When the captain returned, the pilots became involved in a conversation over new scheduling procedures, and the first officer tutored the captain using their computers, the NTSB said. \\"The pilots allowed this conversation to monopolize their attention,\\" the board said. \\"Both pilots state that they heard radio chatter but did not hear a radio call for NWA188.\\" The laptop computers they used likely blocked their view of numerous visual alerts, including text messages sent by airline dispatchers and at least nine messages regarding their position on the airplane's primary flight display, the NTSB said. Northwest Airlines policy prohibited the use of the laptops, the NTSB said. Both pilots told the NTSB the first indication of anything unusual was when a flight attendant called to ask about their arrival time. The captain \\"looked at his navigation display and saw Duluth [Minnesota] to his left and Eau Claire [Wisconsin] to his right,\\" the board said. The NTSB said it could not determine why the pilots did not respond to numerous radio calls, but said it could be because the volume was turned down, the pilots were distracted or the plane was outside the coverage for the 121.5 megahertz transmitters. The NTSB faulted the FAA for not catching the pilots' errors earlier, saying the plane entered two Denver sectors uneventfully, but radio contact was not established in the next two sectors, where controllers were preparing for a shift change. \\"Neither sector controller's relief briefing included information that communication had not been established\\" with the plane, the NTSB said. The NTSB said the FAA had no standard procedures to indicate that an aircraft had not made radio contact when electronic radar handoffs of planes occurred from one sector to the next. \\"Because of this lack of standardization, NWA188 passed through two Denver ATC sectors without the controllers being aware that it had not made radio contact,\\" the safety board said. Almost 30 minutes had elapsed before the next sector's controller attempted to regain contact with the plane and realized the plane was unresponsive to radio calls, the board said. Recognizing the problem, controllers first attempted to regain contact by calling Northwest dispatchers, then by calling an emergency frequency, but did not use words such as \\"emergency\\" or \\"mayday\\" that may have helped capture the pilots' attention, the NTSB said. The pilots did not respond. As a result of the investigation and of the crash of an executive jet in Montana in 2009, the safety board is recommending steps to prevent a repeat of the incidents. Six days after the event, the FAA revoked the licenses of Capt. Timothy Bryan Cheney and First Officer Richard Irwin Cole, saying their lack of awareness that they had overflown the Minneapolis airport was \\"completely unacceptable\\" and \\"put your passengers and your crew in serious jeopardy.\\" But in a settlement signed with the pilots on Monday, the pilots acknowledged no wrongdoing, and the FAA agreed to allow the pilots to reapply for their licenses in August, two months shorter than would ordinarily be allowed. A spokesman for Delta Airlines, which merged with Northwest, said this week the airlines' internal investigation is continuing.

Joseph James said he knew something was wrong with his fraternal twin brother Johnathan James in August 2011, but he was terrified of doing anything. Joseph's step-mother Tina Alberson and his father Michael James, of both Dallas, Texas, face life in prison over charges that they caused 10-year-old Jonathan's death by depriving him of water.

Joseph recounted that Johnathan was severely punished and confined to a room without water for days. Joseph knew his brother was in tremendous pain and desperate for water, but the fear of his step-mother and the potential consequences prevented him from intervening. In the days that followed, Joseph continued to watch helplessly as Johnathan's condition worsened. He described seeing his brother's lips go dry, his energy fade, and him becoming increasingly weak as his body succumbed to the effects of dehydration. One fateful evening, Joseph heard a thud from the room where Johnathan was kept. He found his brother passed out and called out for help, but despite his parents attempting CPR, Johnathan could not be revived. Authorities were informed, and an investigation was launched into Johnathan's tragic and untimely death. Medical examiners confirmed that Johnathan had died due to severe dehydration, and the gruesome details of his unfathomable suffering emerged during the trial. As the case against Joseph's step-mother Tina Alberson and his father Michael James unraveled in court, details of their abusive behavior began to surface, utterly shocking the community. Both parents were portrayed as cruel and heartless individuals who subjected their son to a barbaric form of punishment - one that ultimately ended in his death. After all the evidence was presented, the jury found the parents, Tina Alberson and Michael James, guilty of first-degree murder for causing Johnathan's death. They were both sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. As for Joseph, following the harrowing loss of his beloved twin brother, and having to testify against his own parents in court at such a young age, he was taken into the care of Child Protective Services and placed in a foster home. Throughout the years, he received significant support from a loving foster family, therapy to heal from the trauma, and community resources that helped him rebuild a life beyond those tragic events. Joseph was determined not to become a product of his upbringing; instead, he channeled his pain and emotions into advocacy. As he grew older, he dedicated his life to raising awareness about child abuse and neglect and played an active role in helping other children who had faced similar circumstances. Ultimately, the tragic story of Johnathan's untimely death brought the horrors of child abuse and neglect to light. Joseph's resilience and strength gave hope to countless others, and his efforts led to the implementation of stricter laws and regulations, ensuring that the welfare and safety of children would be a top priority for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years. - Childrens Hospital (originally titled Children's Hospital as webisodes) is a satirical American comedy television series and web series that parodies the medical drama genre, created by and starring actor/comedian Rob Corddry.

Risk factors include mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, alcoholism, or substance misuse. Others are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, troubles with relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to method of suicide, such as firearms and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, there is little evidence for their effectiveness. The most commonly used method of suicide varies between countries, and is partly related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Suicide resulted in 842,000 deaths globally in 2013 (up from 712,000 deaths in 1990). This makes it the 10th leading cause of death worldwide. Approximately 0.5% to 1.4% of people die by suicide, about 12 per 100,000 persons per year. Three quarters of suicides globally occur in the developing world. Rates of completed suicides are generally higher in men than in women, ranging from 1.5 times as much in the developing world to 3.5 times in the developed world. Suicide is generally most common among those over the age of 70; however, in certain countries those aged between 15 and 30 are at highest risk. There are an estimated 10 to 20 million non-fatal attempted suicides every year. Non-fatal suicide attempts may lead to injury and long-term disabilities. In the Western world, attempts are more common in young people and females. Views on suicide have been influenced by broad existential themes such as religion, honor, and the meaning of life. The Abrahamic religions traditionally consider suicide an offense towards God due to the belief in the sanctity of life.

Please answer the following question: WASHINGTON--A baby born with the virus that causes AIDS appears to have been cured, scientists announced Sunday, describing the case of a child from Mississippi who's now 2.5 and has been off medication for about a year with no signs of infection. There's no evidence that shows that the child will remain healthy, although complex testing uncovered just traces of the virus' genetic material still lingering . If so, it would mark only the world' s second reported cure. Specialists say Sunday's announcement, at a major AIDS meeting in Atlanta, offers promising clues for efforts to remove HIV infection in children, especially in African countries where too many babies are born with the virus. \\"You could call this about as close to a cure,\\" Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health, who is familiar with the findings, told The Associated Press. A doctor gave this baby faster and stronger treatment than usual, starting a three-drug mixture within 30 hours of birth. That was before tests confirmed the infant was infected and not just at risk from a mother whose HIV wasn't diagnosed until she was in labor . \\"I just felt like this baby was at higher-than-normal risk, and deserved our best shot,\\" Dr. Hannah Gay, a pediatric HIV specialist at the University of Mississippi, said in an interview. That fast action apparently knocked out HIV in the baby's blood before it could form hideouts in the body. Those so-called reservoirs of dormant cells usually rapidly reinfect anyone who stops medication, said Dr. Deborah Persaud of Johns Hopkins Children's Center. Next, Persaud's team is planning a study to try to prove that, with more aggressive treatment of other high-risk babies. \\"Maybe we'll be able to block this reservoir seeding.\\" Persaud said. No one should stop anti-AIDS drugs as a result of this case, Fauci warned. Which of the following is NOT true? A) The doctor treated the baby with a three-drug mixture.

Question: suppose isotope has less protons happens, how will it affect isotope loses more atomic particles. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. Step 1: Consider the isotope with less protons. Step 2: Analyze how this will impact the isotope's instability. Since the isotope has fewer protons, its instability may be lessened. Step 3: Examine the relationship between instability and the emission of radiation. A less unstable isotope will emit less radiation than a more unstable one. Step 4: Reflect on the decay process. An isotope that emits less radiation will also experience a slower decay process. Step 5: Consider the loss of atomic particles. Given that the isotope's decay process is slower, it will lose atomic particles at a reduced rate. Step 6: The reduced rate of losing atomic particles will result in a smaller change in the isotope's overall makeup. Step 7: The isotope turning into a different element may be less pronounced or take longer to occur, due to the slower decay process. Step 8: Given the overall slower decay and fewer particle losses, the influence of the supposed perturbation of having less protons has a lessened effect on the second effect mentioned (isotope losing more atomic particles)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Irish were almost all Roman Catholics and had fought en masse for the Stuart dynasty in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms in the 1640s, in the hope of securing religious toleration and political self-government. They had been defeated by 1652 and were punished by the English Commonwealth regime with land confiscations and penal legislation. They were largely disappointed with the failure of King Charles II to completely reverse this situation in the Act of Settlement 1662. The majority of Irish people were \\"Jacobites\\" and supported James II due to his 1687 Declaration of Indulgence or, as it is also known, the Declaration for the Liberty of Conscience, that granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland and also due to James II's promise to the Irish Parliament of an eventual right to self-determination. James had given them some concrete concessions in the 1680s by appointing an Irish Catholic, Richard Talbot, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell as Lord Deputy of Ireland, and by re-admitting Catholics as Army officers and into other public offices. When James fled England in 1688 he looked to Ireland to muster support for a re-conquest of his Three Kingdoms. In 1689 he held what became known as the \\"Patriot Parliament\\" in Dublin, which reversed the confiscations of the 1650s and confirmed his support from most of the Irish landed gentry.

This declaration granted religious freedom to all denominations in England and Scotland. On the other hand, William of Orange (William III) died later, on March 8, 1702. The Declaration of Indulgence was one of the reasons Irish Catholics supported James II, while William of Orange received financial support from Pope Innocent XI to aid in his fight against James II."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Scan the poem for words that jump out at you or feel important. You may notice certain words are repeated several times or referring to throughout the poem. Select 1-2 keywords to create a title that provides the reader with a glimpse of what the poem is about. For example, you may choose keywords like “good” and “sister,” creating a title like “The Good Sister” or “Be good, Sister.” You can also look up the keywords in the poem and find other words that mean the same thing, but have a better sound or ring to them. For example, you may use a synonym for “good” to create a title like, “The Excellent Sister” or “My Precious Sister.” If the poem has a main character or characters who are named, use their names in the title. If there is a main setting or place referred to in the poem, use it in the title to help ground the reader. For example, if your poem focuses on a girl named Eva and her pet swan, you may use a title like “Eva and the Swan.” If your poem is about a Denny’s in your hometown of Sturgis, you may use a title like “Denny’s in Sturgis” or “Denny’s, Sturgis.” Focus on any verbs or adjectives that stand out to you in the poem and highlight them in the title. Find 1 verb or 1-2 adjectives and place them together. For example, you may choose a verb like “beating” and create a title like, “Beating” or “I Beat.” Or you may pick adjectives like “blue,” “dying,” and “stunning” to create a title like, “Dying Blue” or “Stunning Blue.” If your poem has lines that repeat or a verse that appears several times in the poem, use it as the title. Often, lines or verse that repeats are important and worth highlighting for the reader. For example, you may take a repeating line like “she jumped high in track and field” to create a title like “High in Track and Field” or “She Jumped.” Draw the reader in and engage them with an image that is memorable, strange, or interesting. Find an image that feels important in the poem and use it in the title so your reader is encouraged to keep reading. > Avoid picking an image that might give away the crux or turn in the poem. The image should provide some context for the reader but not give any revelations in the poem away. For example, you may use an image of a woman leaping over hurdle on the field, red dirt flying in her wake in the poem, and create a title like, “Red Dirt Flys” or “Woman Leaps.” The last line usually contains key details about the subject matter in the poem. Pick out an image or words in the last line and use them in the title. For example, if you have a last line like, “She ran off the field, in victory,” you may create a title like, “In Victory.”","completion":"To create a fitting title for a poem, analyze it for important keywords, characters, or settings. Consider using synonyms for keywords or focusing on verbs and adjectives that stand out. Repeated lines can serve as a title, as can memorable or intriguing images from the poem. Avoid revealing the poem's main twist using an image or words from the last line to give some context without spoiling the content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","completion":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"She has kissed she,\\" I will analyze it using grammar rules and syntactic structure. Step 1: Determining the parts of speech \\"She\\" is a pronoun that typically stands for a female subject in a sentence. The verb \\"has kissed\\" is a present perfect tense verb which indicates that the action of kissing has occurred in the past and may have relevance to the present. Step 2: Analyzing the sentence structure The sentence structure appears to follow Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) order. However, there is an issue with the object pronoun \\"she.\\" In this structure, it is grammatically correct to use an object pronoun, such as \\"her,\\" instead of the subject pronoun \\"she.\\" Step 3: Correcting the sentence To maintain linguistic integrity, the sentence should be corrected to \\"She has kissed her.\\" This change ensures that the correct object pronoun is used, and the sentence now follows proper SVO order and grammar rules. In conclusion, the original sentence \\"She has kissed she\\" has a low linguistic integrity due to the use of an incorrect object pronoun. By correcting the sentence to \\"She has kissed her,\\" the linguistic integrity is significantly improved, resulting in a grammatically correct and coherent statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person Arthur succeeds as King of Britain? ? Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia Regum Britanniae, completed c. 1138, contains the first narrative account of Arthur's life. This work is an imaginative and fanciful account of British kings from the legendary Trojan exile Brutus to the 7th-century Welsh king Cadwallader. Geoffrey places Arthur in the same post-Roman period as do Historia Brittonum and Annales Cambriae. He incorporates Arthur's father Uther Pendragon, his magician advisor Merlin, and the story of Arthur's conception, in which Uther, disguised as his enemy Gorlois by Merlin's magic, sleeps with Gorlois's wife Igerna (Igraine) at Tintagel, and she conceives Arthur. On Uther's death, the fifteen-year-old Arthur succeeds him as King of Britain and fights a series of battles, similar to those in the Historia Brittonum, culminating in the Battle of Bath. He then defeats the Picts and Scots before creating an Arthurian empire through his conquests of Ireland, Iceland and the Orkney Islands. After twelve years of peace, Arthur sets out to expand his empire once more, taking control of Norway, Denmark and Gaul. Gaul is still held by the Roman Empire when it is conquered, and Arthur's victory leads to a further confrontation with Rome. Arthur and his warriors, including Kaius (Kay), Beduerus (Bedivere) and Gualguanus (Gawain), defeat the Roman emperor Lucius Tiberius in Gaul but, as he prepares to march on Rome, Arthur hears that his nephew Modredus (Mordred)—whom he had left in charge of Britain—has married his wife Guenhuuara (Guinevere) and seized the throne. Arthur returns to Britain and defeats and kills Modredus on the river Camblam in Cornwall, but he is mortally wounded. He hands the crown to his kinsman Constantine and is taken to the isle of Avalon to be healed of his wounds, never to be seen again. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Uther Pendragon is the full name of the person Arthur succeeds as King of Britain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Review: emerge dazed , confused as to whether you 've seen pornography or documentary Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","completion":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as predominantly negative, with some undertones of ambiguity. First and foremost, the use of words like \\"dazed\\" and \\"confused\\" suggests a sense of disorientation and bewilderment, which is usually not a positive reaction one would expect from a movie review. These words indicate that the viewer experienced difficulty in understanding the movie's content or purpose, with the possibility that the film failed to convey a clear message or theme. Additionally, the comparison of the movie's content to \\"pornography or documentary\\" raises uncertainty about the quality and intention of the film. By mentioning these two contrasting genres, the reviewer seems to question the direction and focus of the movie. In general, the audiences typically expect well-defined and structured narratives in movies, and this apparent confusion about the film's genre could imply that the film may have lacked coherent storytelling. However, the mention of \\"pornography or documentary\\" might also add a certain degree of ambiguity and intrigue to the review. Some readers might argue that the reviewer's comparison demonstrates the film's unique or challenging nature, pushing the boundaries of conventional storytelling. As a result, some readers who seek unusual or disruptive film experiences might interpret this unexpected comparison as an indication that the movie may be a hidden gem or a daring work that pushes the viewer out of their comfort zone. In conclusion, the review mainly projects a negative outlook on the movie, but the choice of words might generate ambiguity and curiosity for specific readers. This sentence suggests that the movie failed to deliver a clear-cut experience, which could potentially be a result of ineffective storytelling or unconventional narrative structures, deterring the general audience and raising questions about the film's quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How is \\"Anchovy\\" said in Finnish?","completion":"In Finnish, the word \\"anchovy\\" is translated as \\"sardelli.\\" Finnish, like other languages, has its unique set of rules and vocabulary, which makes it distinct from English and many other languages. The anchovy is a small fish, typically found in the Mediterranean region, and it is widely used in various cuisines worldwide, including Finnish cuisine. Although Finnish and English are unrelated languages, there might be some similarities in the translation of words, as various languages can borrow words from each other over time. For instance, in some European languages, the word anchovy is relatively similar to its English equivalent, like \\"anchois\\" in French and \\"anchoa\\" in Spanish. However, when it comes to the Finnish language, which belongs to the Uralic family, loanwords aren't as common. In this case, the word \\"sardelli\\" happens to be the translation for anchovy in Finnish. In Finnish cuisine, anchovies can be used in different dishes, such as salads, sauces, and the regional favorite \\"Janssonin kiusaus\\" or \\"Jansson's temptation\\" – a casserole made from potatoes, onions, pickled sprats (sometimes referred to as \\"sardellit\\" or anchovies in Finnish), and cream.

The first part of the tweet, \\"Hospitals are the lowest point,\\" clearly depicts a negative sentiment. It indicates that the individual is going through a rough time, probably due to illness, injury or some distress related to hospitals. It could also be something concerning a loved one. This statement exhibits frustration, bitterness, or sadness, none of which carry a positive connotation. However, the second part of the tweet, \\"... Tuesday will be better right?\\" offers a glimmer of hope and optimism, indicating a small positive sentiment. The person seems to be trying to look forward to a better day or situation, signaling an attempt to move past the negativity, probably looking for affirmation or encouragement. It's important to note though that this positive sentiment is also tinged with uncertainty and insecurity, evident in the \\"right?\\" at the end of the statement. Other than expressing hope for a better future, the user seems to be seeking validation or assurance that things will indeed get better. In summary, while the tweet does contain elements of both negative and positive sentiments, the overall tone could be considered negative, given the stronger emphasis on the challenging circumstances related to hospitals and the struggle the individual appears to be going through.

Those who failed would be deported directly to their country of origin. Calais has become the focal point of France's refugee crisis. The Jungle camp is expanding and almost every night people there try to hide inside vehicles entering the port and the Channel Tunnel to get to Britain.

Under the treaty, British immigration officials check passports in Calais and their French counterparts do this in Dover. Mr Bertrand does not have the power to change the treaty but two of the candidates thought most likely to win next year's French presidential election support his idea that it be either reformed or annulled. It is understood Home Secretary Amber Rudd will go to Paris this week to discuss the treaty.

Can you tell me the answer to where does the water in whitewater ca come from??","completion":"Whitewater, California is a small community located in Riverside County, near Palm Springs. The water supply in Whitewater comes from various sources, including local groundwater, imported water, and the Whitewater River. A detailed explanation of each source is provided below. 1. Local Groundwater: Whitewater, like many communities in Riverside County, relies on local groundwater as a major source of its water supply. The groundwater comes from underground aquifers, which are natural reservoirs of water stored in permeable rock formations beneath the Earth's surface. These aquifers are replenished through a process called groundwater recharge, where water from precipitation, snowmelt, and runoff percolates through the soil and collects in the aquifer. In Whitewater, the primary aquifers are located in the San Gorgonio Pass Groundwater Basin and the Upper Coachella Valley Groundwater Basin. Through wells and pumping stations, water is extracted from these aquifers and transported to the community for their drinking, sanitation, and irrigation needs. 2. Imported Water: In addition to relying on local groundwater, Whitewater also receives imported water from other sources. This imported water is primarily sourced from the State Water Project (SWP) and the Colorado River Aqueduct (CRA). The SWP is a network of reservoirs, aqueducts, and pumping stations that deliver water from Northern California to Southern California. Whitewater receives a portion of its water supply from Lake Perris, a major reservoir in the SWP, which is managed by the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California (MWDSC) and the Eastern Municipal Water District (EMWD). The CRA is a 242-mile-long aqueduct system that transports water from the Colorado River to Southern California. Managed by the MWDSC, the CRA provides water to Whitewater as part of the desert region's water allocation. The imported water from both the SWP and CRA is used to supplement local groundwater resources, ensuring a reliable water supply for the community. 3. Whitewater River: The Whitewater River also serves as a vital water source for the community. Originating from the San Gorgonio Wilderness, the river flows southwest through the San Gorgonio Pass, passing through the community of Whitewater before eventually joining the Coachella Valley Stormwater Channel. The Whitewater River helps recharge local groundwater basins through natural percolation as well as a process called \\"spreading,\\" where water from the river is diverted to recharge basins to infiltrate the ground and replenish the aquifers. The local water agencies, like the Coachella Valley Water District (CVWD) and the Desert Water Agency (DWA), operate these spreading facilities along the Whitewater River for groundwater replenishment purposes. In summary, the water supply in Whitewater, California comes from a combination of local groundwater, imported water from the State Water Project and the Colorado River Aqueduct, and the Whitewater River. All these sources work together to ensure a reliable water supply for the community's needs while maintaining the health and sustainability of the local environment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lily is almost fourteen years old and has an abusive father and no mother. In the first scene, a woman in a dress wanders around a room and goes back and forth in a closet. A marble rolls on the ground and a little girl is playing with a clear glass shooter marble and a mirror. The mother, Deborah Owens (Hilarie Burton) is taking clothes from the closet and putting them into a suitcase. Suddenly a man barges in and starts to rage at her, saying that she isn't going to leave him. He throws the suitcase onto the ground and grabs her roughly. The woman reaches for a gun in the closet and points it at the man, telling him that she just wants to go. The man wrestles the gun out of her hand and it falls on the ground. The child's hand goes to pick up the gun. The gun goes off and the scene fades to an older Lily lying in bed, her eyes open.\\"I killed my mother when I was four years old.

Given the question: Information: - Amoraim (Aramaic: plural , singular Amora ; \\"those who say\\" or \\"those who speak over the people\\", or \\"spokesmen\\") refers to the Jewish scholars of the period from about 200 to 500 CE, who \\"said\\" or \\"told over\\" the teachings of the Oral Torah. They were concentrated in Babylonia and the Land of Israel. Their legal discussions and debates were eventually codified in the Gemara. The \\"Amoraim\\" followed the \\"Tannaim\\" in the sequence of ancient Jewish scholars. The \\"Tannaim\\" were direct transmitters of uncodified oral tradition; the \\"Amoraim\\" expounded upon and clarified the oral law after its initial codification. - Jose the Galilean ( Hebrew : , Yose HaGelili ) , d. 15 Av , was a Jewish sage who lived in the 1st and 2nd centuries of the common era . He was one of the Tannaim , the rabbis whose work was compiled in the Mishna . Jose was a contemporary and colleague of Rabbis Akiva , Tarfon , and Eleazar ben Azariah . Neither the name of his father nor the circumstances of his youth are known , though his name ( \`\` HaGelili '' ) indicates that he was a native of Galilee . He suffered from the prejudice commonly held against the Galileans by the Judeans ; on one occasion a woman who wanted to make a point with him began by calling him a \`\` stupid Galilean '' . When he entered the academy at Yavne , he was entirely unknown . It is also noted that he was extremely modest and addressed Tarfon as \`\` my master '' . He was , nevertheless , a thorough scholar even then , and his arguments nonplused both Tarfon and Akiva . His first appearance at Yavne thus obtained for him general recognition , and the two rabbis considered him not as a pupil , but as a colleague . Akiva was obliged to endure more than one sharp criticism from Jose , who once said to him : \`\` Though thou expound the whole day I shall not listen to thee '' . Tarfon expressed his high esteem of Jose by interpreting Daniel viii. 4 - 7 as though it contained an allusion to him : \`\` I saw the ram , that is , Akiva , and saw that no beast might stand before him ; and I beheld the he - goat , that is , Jose the Galilean , come , and cast him down to the ground . '' As a matter of fact , Jose was the only one who opposed Akiva successfully , and the latter frequently abandoned his own interpretation in favor of his opponent 's . Jose frequently showed a tendency to revert to the older Halakha , explaining the text according to its literal meaning Generally , though , his halakic exegesis differed little from that of Akiva , and both often employed the same rules of interpretation He taught that poultry may be cooked in milk and eaten , as was done in his own native... - Av (\\"Av\\" \\"\\" \\"Abba\\"; from Akkadian \\"abu\\"; \\"father\\") is the eleventh month of the civil year and the fifth month of the ecclesiastical year on the Hebrew calendar. The name is Babylonian in origin and appeared in the Talmud around the 3rd century. This is the only month which is not named in the Bible. It is a summer month of 30 days. Av usually occurs in JulyAugust on the Gregorian calendar. - Tannaim (, singular , \\"Tanna\\" \\"repeaters\\", \\"teachers\\") were the Rabbinic sages whose views are recorded in the Mishnah, from approximately 10-220 CE. The period of the \\"Tannaim\\", also referred to as the Mishnaic period, lasted about 210 years. It came after the period of the \\"Zugot\\" (\\"pairs\\"), and was immediately followed by the period of the \\"Amoraim\\" (\\"interpreters\\"). - Rabban Gamaliel II (also spelled Gamliel) was the first person to lead the Sanhedrin as Nasi after the fall of the second temple, which occurred in 70 CE. Gamliel was appointed nasi approximately 10 years later. Gamaliel II was the son of Shimon ben Gamaliel, one of Jerusalem's foremost men in the war against the Romans, and grandson of Gamaliel I. To distinguish him from the latter he is also called Gamliel of Yavne. - The Sanhedrin (Hebrew: \\"sanhedrîn\\", Greek: , \\"synedrion\\", \\"sitting together,\\" hence \\"assembly\\" or \\"council\\") was an assembly of twenty-three to seventy-one men appointed in every city in the Land of Israel. In the Hebrew Bible, Moses and the Israelites were commanded by God to establish courts of judges who were given full authority over the people of Israel, who were commanded by God to obey every word the judges instructed and every law they established. Judges in ancient Israel were the religious leaders and Teachers of the nation of Israel. The Mishnah arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: it must be possible for a \\"community\\" to vote for both conviction and exoneration. The minimum size of a \\"community\\" is 10 men (10 vs 10). One more is required to achieve a majority (11 vs 10), but a simple majority cannot convict, and so an additional judge is required (12 vs 10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23 (12 vs 10 and 1). This court dealt with only religious matters. - The Gregorian calendar is internationally the most widely used civil calendar. It is named after Pope Gregory XIII, who introduced it in October 1582. - Halakha (; also transliterated as halacha, halakhah, halachah or halocho) is the collective body of Jewish religious laws derived from the Written and Oral Torah. It includes the 613 \\"mitzvot\\" (\\"commandments\\"), subsequent Talmudic and rabbinic law and the customs and traditions compiled in the \\"Shulchan Aruch\\" (literally \\"Prepared Table\\", but more commonly known as the \\"Code of Jewish Law\\"). - Ezra ('; fl. 480440 BCE), also called Ezra the Scribe and Ezra the Priest in the Book of Ezra, was a Jewish scribe and a priest. According to the Hebrew Bible he was a descendant of Seraiah (Ezra 7:1) the last high priest to serve in the first temple (kings 2 25:18), and a close relative of Joshua the first High Priest of the second temple (chronicles 1 5:40-41. see also Ezra 3:2). He returned from the Babylonian exile and reintroduced the Torah in Jerusalem (Ezra 710 and Neh 8). According to 1 Esdras, a Greek translation of the Book of Ezra still in use in Eastern Orthodoxy, he was also a high priest. Rabbinic tradition holds that he was only a common priest. - The Shulchan Aruch (, literally: \\"Set Table\\") also known by various Jewish communities but not all as \\"the Code of Jewish Law.\\" There are various legal codes in Judaism but the Shulchan Aruch is the most widely consulted. It was authored in Safed (today in Israel) by Yosef Karo in 1563 and published in Venice two years later. Together with its commentaries, it is the most widely accepted compilation of Jewish law ever written. - Eleazar ben Azariah, was a 1st-century CE Jewish tanna, i.e. Mishnaic sage. He was of the second generation and a junior contemporary of Gamaliel II, Eliezer b. Hyrcanus, and Joshua b. Hananiah, and senior of Akiva. He was a kohen and traced his pedigree for ten generations back to Ezra, and was very wealthy. These circumstances, added to his erudition, gained for him great popularity. When Gamaliel II, in consequence of his provoking demeanor, was temporarily deposed from the patriarchate, Eleazar, though still very young, was elevated to that office by the deliberate choice of his colleagues. He did not, however, occupy it for any length of time, for the Sanhedrin reinstated Gamaliel. He was retained as vice-president (\\"ab bet din\\"), nevertheless, and it was arranged that Gamaliel should lecture three (some say two) Sabbaths, and Eleazar every fourth (or third) Sabbath. - Zugot \\"Pairs\\" (\\"tqufath hazzughoth\\") refers to the hundred-year period during the time of the Second Temple (515 BCE 70 CE), in which the spiritual leadership of the Jews was in the hands of five successive generations of \\"zugoth\\" (\\"pairs\\") of religious teachers.

As they push their way through the crowd at the crime scene, they see Brad McCullam leaving with a coffee cup. Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancÃ©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner. Back in the present, Brad demands pizza for himself and the hostages, along with a car for transportation to Mexico. In another flashback, we see Brad in rehearsals for a Greek tragedy directed by Lee Meyers. As the pizza is delivered to Brad, Lee arrives at the scene of the crime. Lee talks with Havenhurst about Brad, and we flash back to Lee and Brad visiting Uncle Ted's ostrich farm. Brad convinces Uncle Ted to give him the antique sword which would be used in the crime. Brad uses the sword in more rehearsals for the play, in which he plays the part of a man who kills his mother, who is played by his fiancÃ©e Ingrid.

Later in the first quarter after Jeff Feagles punted inside the one-yard line, LaVar Arrington sacked Drew Bledsoe in the endzone for a safety. In the second quarter, Giants kicker Jay Feely kicked a 31-yard field goal. Dallas would score before halftime as Bledsoe ran 1-yard touchdown on a quarterback sneak. Bledsoe also threw a costly interception just before halftime that would have given the Cowboys a 14-12 lead at the break.

Write the answer: What fictional family has a gigantic, ominous butler named Lurch?","completion":"The fictional family that has a gigantic, ominous butler named Lurch is the Addams Family. The Addams Family is a creation of American cartoonist Charles Addams, who introduced this peculiar and macabre household in a series of cartoons beginning in 1938, which were later published in The New Yorker magazine. Over the years, the Addams Family has been adapted into various forms of media, including television series, movies, and stage productions, making them a prominent part of popular culture. The Addams Family is composed of characters with eccentric personalities and sinister, yet endearing qualities. They embrace an unconventional and gothic lifestyle, which sets them apart from societal norms. The primary family members include Gomez Addams, the passionate and wealthy patriarch; Morticia Addams, the elegant and sophisticated matriarch; Wednesday Addams, the intelligent and morbid daughter; Pugsley Addams, the mischievous and macabre son; Uncle Fester, Gomez's oddball brother; Grandmama, the wise and mystical elderly relative; and Cousin Itt, a small, mysterious, and hairy creature. Lurch serves as the family's loyal butler and resembles a large, looming figure - often likened to Frankenstein's monster, both in terms of physical appearance and his stoic demeanor. Standing well over six feet tall, Lurch possesses superhuman strength and is almost entirely mute, save for his distinctive resonant groaning or occasional one-word responses. Despite his intimidating and ominous appearance, Lurch possesses a tender heart, and often shows great affection and concern for the members of the Addams family. Lurch dutifully attends to the needs of the family, often assisting with the children's dangerous and bizarre pursuits, undertaking tasks that cater to the family's peculiar tastes, and helping Gomez and Morticia execute their extravagant and sometimes macabre parties and events. He is also known to play the harpsichord, providing live musical accompaniment for the family's various activities. Throughout the various adaptations of the Addams Family, Lurch has been portrayed by several actors, most notably by Ted Cassidy in the original 1960s television series and Carel Struycken in the popular 1990s feature films. Regardless of the adaptation, Lurch continues to play a pivotal role in the Addams Family saga, faithfully carrying out his duties as the family's devoted butler while endearing himself to audiences with his unique blend of strength, silence, and steadfast loyalty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Solve this instance: The city of Edinburgh grew up around the steep, ragged cliff of the Castle Rock and its easily defended summit. Archaeological excavations have revealed evidence of habitation here as long ago as 900 b.c. Very little, however, is known about the Rock and its inhabitants in the centuries between its first occupation and the time of the MacAlpin kings. A few shadowy details have been left to us by the Romans and by an epic poem from the seventh century. Romans and Britons The Romans invaded Scotland in a.d. 78–84, where they met a fierce group called the Picts, whom they drove north. They consolidated their gains by building Antonine's Wall across the waist of Scotland between the Firth of Forth and the River Clyde in about a.d. Roman legions encountered the strongholds of the Castle Rock and Arthur's Seat, held by a tribe of ancient Britons known as the Votadini. Little is recorded about this group, but they were probably the ancestors of the Gododdin, whose feats are told in a seventh-century Old Welsh manuscript. The capital of the Gododdin was Din Eidyn (the \\"Fort of Eidyn,\\" almost certainly the Castle Rock), whose name lives on in the Edin- of Edinburgh. Din Eidyn fell to the Angles in 638 and became part of the Anglian kingdom of Northumbria. It was the first of many times that the Fort of Eidyn would change hands between the kingdoms of the north and the south. The MacAlpin Kings Four distinct peoples once inhabited the land now known as Scotland: the Picts in the north, the Britons in the southwest, the invading Angles in the southeast, and the Scots in the west. The Scots were Gaelic-speaking immigrants from the north of Ireland. Kenneth MacAlpin, who ruled as king of Scots at Dunadd, acquired the Pictish throne in 843, uniting Scotland north of the River Forth into a single kingdom. He moved his capital — along with the Stone of Destiny (on which Scottish kings were crowned) — to the sacred Pict site of Scone, close to Perth. His great-great-great-grandson, Malcolm II (1005–1034), defeated the Angles at the Battle of Carham in 1018 and extended Scottish territory as far south as the River Tweed. <sep>Where is the city of Edinburgh located?

Given those answer options, answer the question: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is the ideal mean radiant temperature Suggested answer: Thermal comfort is maintained when the heat generated by human metabolism is allowed to dissipate, thus maintaining thermal equilibrium with the surroundings. Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"Yes, you should validate this answer, as it reasonably addresses the concept of mean radiant temperature and its relation to thermal comfort. However, it is essential to provide a more comprehensive and detailed explanation of the ideal mean radiant temperature and its context in order to better understand the subject matter. Mean radiant temperature (MRT) is an essential factor in assessing human thermal comfort in various environments, and it represents the combined effect of direct and reflected radiation from surrounding surfaces on a person's heat exchange with the environment. It is a weighted average of the temperatures of the surfaces that an individual can see, taking into account the viewing angle of each surface, surface temperature, and relative size. When considering the ideal mean radiant temperature, it is important to note that it depends on the specific situation and individual factors, such as the activity level, clothing, and personal preferences of the person involved. Nevertheless, some general guidelines can be applied to determine appropriate MRT values for specific scenarios. The ideal MRT should facilitate a balance between a person's metabolic heat production and their heat transfer with the surrounding environment to achieve a comfortable thermal equilibrium. The context of thermal comfort plays a crucial role in understanding the ideal MRT. Thermal comfort is affected by various factors, including air temperature, humidity, air movement, and MRT. It is the combined effect of these factors, along with personal factors such as activity and clothing level, that contribute to determining an individual's thermal comfort. ASHRAE (American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers) Standard 55-2017 provides guidelines for thermal comfort, and it specifies the ranges of indoor environmental conditions that are acceptable for most people in terms of thermal comfort. These guidelines state that an optimal MRT depends on the combination of air temperature, relative humidity, and air speed in a specific environment. In conclusion, although the suggested answer you provided does express the importance of maintaining thermal equilibrium for individual comfort, it would be more appropriate to expand upon the concept of mean radiant temperature and its connection to other factors contributing to thermal comfort. Additionally, the ideal MRT would vary depending on multiple factors, and it ultimately aims to achieve a balance between an individual's heat generation and heat dissipation in the surrounding environment. Acknowledging the influence of ASHRAE guidelines also provides a more in-depth understanding of determining the ideal MRT for various scenarios and environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of, was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger? , can you please find it? After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

A:","completion":"The feelings of others in this context would depend on various factors such as their relationship with Sasha, the environment they are in, their understanding of Sasha's intentions, and their individual personalities. Given that we do not have a complete understanding of these factors, we can explore several potential ways in which others might feel as a result of Sasha's actions. 1. Empathy: Some individuals might empathize with Sasha's need for relaxation and her choice of going to the bathroom to achieve it. They might understand that people have unique preferences and methods for unwinding, and attempting to destress in the bathroom might be comforting for Sasha. Therefore, these individuals would feel understanding and supportive of Sasha's actions. 2. Concern: Other individuals might feel concerned about Sasha's well-being, especially if her behavior appears odd or out-of-character. They might wonder if something is bothering her or if she is feeling unwell. If Sasha is typically relaxed and open, observing her seeking solace in the bathroom might trigger feelings of worry or unease in those around her. 3. Confusion: If people around Sasha are not familiar with the concept of utilizing the bathroom as a spot for relaxation, they might feel confused by her actions. They could fail to understand her motives, causing feelings of perplexity and bewilderment. 4. Ignorance: In some cases, others might not pay attention to Sasha's actions at all, or they might not be affected by her decision to relax in the bathroom. People who are preoccupied with their own activities or thoughts would be indifferent to Sasha's choice of retreat. 5. Annoyance: On the off chance that the bathroom is shared or located in a public area with limited access, other individuals might feel annoyed or inconvenienced by Sasha's prolonged stay in there. These people might desire equal access to the bathroom for their own needs, and they could feel frustrated by the lack of availability. In summary, the emotions of others in response to Sasha going for a walk all the way to the bathroom to relax would differ based on their relationships with Sasha, the context of the situation, and their ability to comprehend her aim. Feelings could range from empathy and support, worry and concern, confusion, ignorance, to even annoyance in some cases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Activate the amp like you normally would and note what happens. No matter what type of amp you have, something is supposed to change when you hit the on switch and turn up the volume. A lot of amps have power lights that activate when the amp is live. Also, listen for any noises the amp makes, since that could also help you determine the source of the problem. Car amps, for example, often have a green power LED light and a red “protect” light. The protect light often means a blown fuse, so you know to check the wiring when you see it. Go over all the wires, double-checking that they are plugged in correctly. If the amp doesn’t activate at all when you turn it on, the problem could have to do with the power supply. Sometimes you have to contend with a loose cord, which is a very easy fix to make. Wiggle the wires, testing them to see if they are in place and cause the amp to activate at all. Car amps, for instance, often have a red power wire and a black ground wire. It also has a blue remote turn-on wire that powers the amp when you turn on your vehicle. If your amp plugs into the wall, test the power cord. Also, make sure your guitar, speakers, subwoofers, and other devices are connected to the amp if you’re using them. So your amp turns on, which is a plus, but it doesn’t sound right. Sound distortion can be caused by a few different issues depending on what kind of amp you have. It is often from loose wires, but it could also be your overall setup. Sometimes replacing the wires, fixing the amp’s components, or changing your setup suddenly makes everything better. If you don’t hear any sound but know your amp is on, the wiring is likely the culprit. Moving the wires may give you a burst of sound. You may also need to detach speakers or other devices overpowering the amp.","completion":"To summarize, the process of troubleshooting an amplifier involves several steps to identify potential issues and rectify them. Firstly, turn on the amp and observe any lights, sounds, or indicators that may point to the source of the problem. Power lights and protect lights can provide valuable information, such as potential blown fuses or power supply issues. Next, carefully inspect all wires and connections, making sure they are plugged in correctly. Loose cords can often cause issues and are simple to fix. In the case of car amps, pay particular attention to the red power wire, the black ground wire, and the blue remote turn-on wire. Ensure that any connected devices, such as guitars, speakers, and subwoofers, are properly linked to the amp. If your amplifier turns on but produces distorted sound or no sound at all, first examine the wiring for any loose connections. Adjusting or replacing the wires, fixing the amp's components, or modifying your setup may address the issue. Additionally, consider detaching any speakers or devices that could be overpowering the amp. By following these steps and examining specific aspects of your amplifier and its connections, you can effectively troubleshoot and identify the source of the problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Summarize this article: If your bank closed your account, you may have negative information on your ChexSystems report. However, not all banks use ChexSystems. There also are some that review all applications on a case-by-case basis. Likewise, if your bank used a different service, you should look for banks that don't use that service. These banks will be more likely to open an account for you because they won't know about what happened between you and the bank that closed your account. You may be able to find this information on the bank's website. If not, you can always call the toll-free customer service line and ask. Many branches also have the logo of the service they use on their doors. Smaller community banks are far more likely to review applications on a case-by-case basis, and typically are more forgiving if you had your account closed because you over-drafted or made a mistake. If you apply for an account at a small community bank, go into the branch in person rather than applying online (many of these small banks don't even accept applications online). Dress presentably in clean, neat clothing so you make a good impression with the banker. Be as open and honest as possible about your past relationship with your old bank and the reason you want to open an account. This can prevent you from having problems again with this bank if they discover you lied on your application or failed to disclose important information. Since credit unions are owned by their members, they tend to be more forgiving of past mistakes. Credit unions also typically offer more assistance with budgeting and financial responsibility, if that has been a problem for you in the past. Credit unions typically only allow certain types of people to be members. For example, they may only accept employees of certain companies, people who live in a certain community, or people who fit other criteria. Check the credit union's website to find out if you meet their membership criteria before you apply. You also might ask your employer if there are any credit unions you qualify for because you work there. In the United States and some other countries, a number of large banks offer second chance checking accounts for people who have a history of troubled banking relationships. Use these accounts as a last resort. They typically have annual fees and may require you to maintain a fairly substantial minimum balance at all times. They also may have other requirements that you would have difficulty meeting. If you do get a second chance checking account, you typically have the option of converting it to a regular account after you maintain it responsibly for a year or longer.","completion":"The article highlights several strategies for individuals with a negative ChexSystems report or a history of problematic banking relationships, helping them find ways to open new bank accounts.

What would be a realistic plan to lose weight? Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"To lose weight, there are several steps that you need to follow. Here's a realistic plan for weight loss including a step-by-step approach: Step 1: Setting a goal Determine how much weight you want to lose and set a realistic time frame for achieving your goal. Make sure that your goal follows the SMART criteria: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic, and Time-bound. Step 2: Analyzing your current lifestyle Take a close look at your current lifestyle and diet. Track your daily caloric intake, exercise habits, and any other factors that might influence your weight. Step 3: Creating a calorie deficit A calorie deficit is necessary for weight loss. You can create this deficit by either consuming fewer calories or increasing your physical activity, or a combination of both. A safe and sustainable calorie deficit is typically around 500 calories per day, which can result in a weight loss of about 1 pound (0.45 kg) per week. Step 4: Choosing a healthier diet Replace high-calorie, processed foods with nutrient-dense, whole foods. Incorporate more lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats into your diet. Don't forget to control portion sizes and drink plenty of water. Step 5: Increasing physical activity Include regular exercise in your daily routine. Aim for a combination of both cardiovascular exercise and strength training. The American Heart Association recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity per week, or a combination of both, preferably spread throughout the week. Step 6: Tracking your progress Regularly monitor your weight and measurements, as well as other health markers such as body fat percentage. Adjust your diet and exercise routine as necessary. It can be helpful to take pictures or maintain a journal to document your progress. Step 7: Seeking support Having social support from friends, family, or support groups can be beneficial in maintaining motivation and accountability throughout your weight loss journey. As for your second question, \\"How do I lose weight?\\" and \\"What would be a realistic plan to lose weight?\\" are similar but not exactly the same. The first question is a general inquiry on the process of losing weight, while the second question specifically asks for a practical plan to achieve weight loss.

Solve -5*d + 0*d - 1238 = -1268 for d.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the math problem step by step, like we're telling a story to a five-year-old. So, we have a problem that looks like this: -5*d + 0*d - 1238 = -1268 1. First, we know that if you have \\"0\\" of something, it means you have none of it. So \\"0*d\\" is the same as having \\"0\\". Our equation now looks like this: -5*d - 1238 = -1268 2. Now, let's isolate \\"d\\" (which means we want to get it all by itself). We'll start by adding 1238 to both sides of the equation to cancel out the \\"-1238\\" on the left side: -5*d - 1238 + 1238 = -1268 + 1238 This will change our equation to: -5*d = -30 3. Our last step is to get \\"d\\" all by itself. Right now, there is a \\"-5\\" that is multiplied by \\"d\\"- so we need to divide both sides by \\"-5\\" to cancel it out: -5*d / -5 = -30 / -5 By doing this, we now have: d = 6 And that's it!

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","completion":"To determine which method is more reasonable for transferring unpolished steel tubings for your project, I am going to outline a few potential methods and then compare their advantages and disadvantages. After that, we should be able to identify the most reasonable option based on your specific project requirements. Method 1: Truck transportation This is one of the most common methods used to transport steel tubing. Trucks can easily accommodate the length and weight of steel tubing, making it straightforward to load, transport, and unload the material. Advantages: - Accessible and common transportation method - Can accommodate a wide range of cargo sizes - Suitable for short to long distances, depending on the type of truck Disadvantages: - May be limited by weight restrictions and truck availability - Traffic and road condition might affect delivery times Method 2: Rail transportation For large quantities of steel tubing, rail transportation can be a viable option. Railcars are capable of handling huge loads, making them ideal for transporting significant amounts of steel tubing. Advantages: - Capable of handling large quantities of steel tubing - Can travel over long distances in a relatively short amount of time - Time efficient and generally on-schedule travel Disadvantages: - Limited availability of rail networks can result in transit to inconvenient drop-off points - May be difficult to arrange transport for a smaller project or for small amounts of material Method 3: Intermodal transportation Intermodal transportation combines different modes of transport, like trucking and rail, to complete a single shipment. This method offers flexibility in dealing with potential issues like weight restrictions, distance, and accessibility. Advantages: - Provides a combination of the best features of truck and rail transportation - Allows for flexibility in meeting project-specific requirements - Can be more cost-effective for longer distances Disadvantages: - Requires additional coordination and management between different transportation modes - May result in longer transit times due to transfers between modes Method 4: Non-conventional transportation methods This category includes any other transportation methods not covered by the previous options. Examples include shipping via air or using specialized vehicles, like cranes or flatbed trailers, to handle oversized loads. Advantages: - Offers specialized solutions for challenging transportation requirements - Can overcome obstacles posed by site access, weight restrictions, and other issues Disadvantages: - Often more expensive than other transportation methods - May be more complicated to organize and manage To conclude, the most reasonable method for transferring unpolished steel tubings depends on several factors such as the quantity of steel tubing, the distance it needs to be transported, site accessibility, and budget constraints. If your project requires a small to moderate quantity of unpolished steel tubing to be transported within a short to moderate distance, truck transportation would be the most reasonable option. If your project requires a large quantity of steel tubing, or if the distance is quite long, intermodal transportation or rail transportation could be more appropriate. And finally, for unique scenarios that don't fit within the parameters of the previously mentioned options, non-conventional transportation methods might be necessary."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This sentence, when broken down into its individual words, clearly communicates that the kitchen being described is well-stocked and has all the necessary tools and utensils to allow someone to cook their meals. Here's a more detailed elaboration on this sentence: The kitchen, which is the central part of any home and a space where families and friends typically gather to enjoy food and conversations, has a complete variety of items, appliances, and utensils that one would require to make any type of dish from scratch. This includes general necessities such as a stove, oven, microwave, refrigerator, and dishwasher, as well as a range of smaller appliances like a toaster, blender, coffee maker, and electric kettle. Furthermore, it also implies that the kitchen is equipped with a wide assortment of cooking accessories, for example, pots and pans with various sizes and designs, sharp and efficient knives for cutting, chopping, and dicing, different types of spoons, spatulas, and ladles to stir, mix, and serve the food, and other essential tools like graters, peelers, can openers, and measuring cups. Besides these items, the kitchen also contains a well-stocked pantry filled with staple ingredients, spices, and condiments. In addition, it is likely that it has a variety of cooking oils, vinegars, sauces, and seasonings that can be used to add depth and flavor to the dishes being prepared. Moreover, the phrase \\"fully equipped\\" might even encompass more specialized cooking tools, such as a food processor, mixer, or even a slow cooker, which can come in handy when preparing more complex recipes or pursuing culinary projects. The presence of a fully equipped kitchen is often much appreciated by those who favor home-cooked meals over dining out or ordering takeout. It allows individuals and families to have full control over the ingredients, preparation methods, and nutritional content of their meals. Additionally, having a well-stocked kitchen can save time and money, as it eliminates the need to purchase new equipment or ingredients every time one wishes to try out a new recipe. In summary, the sentence \\"The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need to prepare your own food\\" paints a clear picture of a well-organized and complete kitchen that caters to the cooking needs and preferences of its users, enabling them to create a wide range of appetizing and wholesome dishes in the comfort of their own home."},{"prompt":"Q: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public.

(2) The Edmonton Oilers were the first National Hockey League team in Alberta when they were absorbed by the NHL as the WHA Fold. Similar to the first sentence, this one also states that the Edmonton Oilers were the first NHL team in Alberta. However, the structure here focuses more on their status (being the first) at the moment when they were incorporated into the NHL because the WHA folded.

Step 1: Combine like terms On the left side, we have two terms that both contain the variable k: -104*k and 455*k. -104*k + 455*k = 351*k The left side of the equation now becomes 351*k - 6331. On the right side, we have two constants: -3994 and 12405. -3994 + 12405 = 8411 The right side of the equation now is 8411. So, the equation now is: 351*k - 6331 = 8411 Step 2: Isolate the variable k To isolate k, we need to get rid of the constant term -6331 on the left side of the equation. To do this, we add 6331 to both sides of the equation. 351*k - 6331 + 6331 = 8411 + 6331 351*k = 14742 Now, to completely isolate k, we need to divide both sides by the coefficient of k, which in this case is 351. 351*k / 351 = 14742 / 351 k = 42 So, the solution for the given equation is k = 42."},{"prompt":"Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Creatures of the Night.

This isn't necessary, but it will be very helpful, especially if you're new to weight training. A personal trainer can talk with you about your goals and design workouts to help you reach them. Most gyms have personal trainers on staff, so ask about these services at your gym. Make sure you inform a personal trainer about your diabetes. This will help him design workouts that will work best for you. It is also important for safety, because your trainer can monitor you for signs of hypoglycemia or other complications. When working with weights, aim to do two or three sets of 8-12 repetitions within each set. Let your body rest for about a minute in between sets. When lifting, breathe out when you perform the lift or exertion, and breathe in when returning to your start position. You can apply these general guidelines to any weight-based workout. This focus will give you faster results over your whole body. The major areas you should concentrate on are the back, chest, arms, and legs. There are several workouts you can do to train each of these areas and increase your overall muscle mass. While beginners to weight training often overlook the back, it is important for balanced upper body strength. There are large muscles here that can be strengthened and toned with several good workouts. Pull-ups. This simple exercise can be performed with only a bar and no other equipment. It trains the muscles of your upper and mid back. Grasp the bar with your hands roughly shoulder-width apart, then pull your chin over the bar. Make sure you keep your shoulder blades pinched together to ensure that you are keeping the workout focused on your back muscles. As an added bonus, pull-ups will strengthen your biceps as well. See Do Pullups for a more detailed description of performing pull-ups. Lat Pull-down. This workout is similar to a pull-up, except it is done sitting down with a machine. Grab the bar with your hands a bit wider than shoulder-width apart. Then pull the bar down to your chest and smoothly raise it again. Cable row. With this workout, you'll sit down on a bench and pull a weighted handle towards you. This workout trains the middle back, as well as the biceps. Click here for a video description of this workout. Shrugs. This workout will train your trapezius, the muscle between your neck and shoulders. To perform a shrug, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Hold a barbell, or a dumbbell in each hand. Then raise your shoulders to your ears. The chest contains the pectoralis major and minor muscles. These are large muscles that can add a lot of mass if trained properly. Try the following workouts to increase the size and strength of your chest. Pushups. You don't need any equipment for this workout, just the floor. It will train your chest, as well as your triceps. Read Do a Push Up for a detailed description of proper technique and variations of this workout. Pushups are also a good way to warm up before lifting heavier weights. Dumbbell press. This is similar to a pushup, except it is done on a bench with dumbbells. Lay back on a bench with a dumbbell in each hand. For your starting position, hold the dumbbells just above your shoulders. Then press your hands up and have the dumbbells touch above your chest before returning to the start position. Pectoral Flyes. This workout is done with a machine. You sit upright on a bench and place your hands on the pads or handles that will be on each side of you. Then you push forward and have your hands meet in front of you. This exercise isolates the chest more than pushups or the dumbbell press, so use it if you want to focus on the chest. The two major muscle groups in your arms are the biceps and triceps. You should train both groups to strengthen your arms and build muscle mass. Several of the exercises already mentioned will also train your arms: pullups and pull downs will train your biceps, and pushups and dumbbell presses will train your triceps. In addition, there are other exercises that will isolate the arm muscles and train them specifically. Bicep curls. With this exercise, you will isolate the biceps. You can perform this exercise standing or sitting. Take a dumbbell in each hand and start with your arms at your sides. Then bend your arms at the elbows, bringing your hands up to your shoulders. Click here for an instructional video demonstrating a proper curl. Tricep push downs. This exercise isolates the triceps and is done with a machine. Grab either a bar or rope attached to a weight. Your starting position should be with your hands in front of you about chest-height. Then, using only your elbows, push the bar down to your hips before returning to the start position. Some of the biggest muscles in your body are in your legs, so training this area will give you a big increase in muscle mass. There are numerous workouts you can choose from, all of which will train your legs in different ways. Squats. This workout primarily trains the quads and glutes, but it also works the entire leg and lower back. Read Do a Squat and watch this video to learn the proper technique before trying this. It would also be a good idea to consult a trainer at the gym to instruct you- it is a great workout, but you can seriously hurt your knees, back, and neck if you don't use proper form. Leg extensions. This workout trains the quads. It involves placing your feet into a machine. Then you extend your legs forward, which will lift a weight attached to a cable. Lunges. This workout will train your hamstrings, on the back of your leg. To perform the workout, hold a dumbbell in each hand. Then stand with your feet shoulder-width apart with your arms at your sides. Take a big step forward with one leg, then bring your other leg forward so you are standing with your feet shoulder-width again. Read Do a Front Lunge Exercise for more details on this workout. Calf raises. This workout will train your calves, which are on the lower part of your leg. They can be done either with a machine or by just holding a weight. To perform the workout, place your feet halfway onto a ledge so your heels dangle off the back. Then, either holding a weight or using a machine, shift your weight to the balls of your feet and lift your heels up. Then return to the starting position with your heels dangling off the side of the ledge. When you workout with the same exercises for several weeks, your muscles start to adjust, and the exercises won't give you great results anymore. This is called a plateau. To avoid this, don't let your muscles get used to the workout. Perform only one or two of these suggested workouts per muscle group at a time. Then in a few weeks, replace the exercises with a new one. By keeping your muscles guessing, you'll ensure that you see maximum results from your workout regimen. Summary:","completion":"A personal trainer can help design workouts tailored to your needs and goals, focusing on major muscle groups like back, chest, arms, and legs, while periodically changing exercises to avoid plateau and maximize results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Initially, the two men were charged with felonies. Glenn Taylor, 45, and David Hall, 42, appeared in Utah's 7th District Court to enter their pleas under a deal with prosecutors. The two men from Highland were sentenced to a year of probation and ordered to pay fines and restitution, which has not yet been determined.

Freedom: David Hall (left) and Glenn Taylor (right) avoided jail time for destroying an ancient rock formation in Utah. Deal: Attorney Scott Card (left) brokered the deal for the two former Boy Scout leaders that will is likely to also include a hefty fine. A video shot by Hall and posted on YouTube shows Taylor dislodging the formation at Goblin Valley State Park in central Utah that's filled with thousands of the pillars called 'hoodoos.' Hall, Taylor and a third man were seen cheering and high-fiving after the formation toppled. The men claimed it might have been ready to fall and kill a visitor. Both were later stripped of their Boy Scout positions. Scott Card, an attorney for Taylor, told the Salt Lake City Tribune that the restitution will be thousands of dollars and will go toward putting up signs in the park to warn others against damaging the formations. Both men were originally facing felony mischief charges. If Taylor and Hall meet the requirements of their probation, the offenses will later be removed from their records. The alleged cameraman: Dave Hall has been charged with aiding criminal mischief. Accused: Glenn Taylor has been charged with tipping over the rock while his son and friend cheered him on. Park officials. have said the rock formation had been standing for much of human. history, if not longer. The central Utah park is dotted with thousands. of the eerie, mushroom-shaped formations. 'We are taking it seriously,' Blackwell said. 'It's been an interesting case, mostly because of the attention it's garnered.' Caught on camera: Glenn Taylor was filmed pushing the 'loose' rock in Goblin Valley State Park. Destroyed: The massive rock, which had been in place for 20 million years, crashes to the ground beneath. Celebration: Glenn and Dylan Taylor high-five while the cameraman, Dave Hall laughs. Blackwell. said any defense asserting the goblin-shaped rock was ready to tip over 'would need to have a lot of expert testimony, and it would probably go. both ways.' The round-shaped rock, which was pushed off a natural pedestal, weighed thousands of pounds, he said. 'I. understand why the state brought felony charges - it's a definite. deterrent effect,' Taylor's lawyer, Scott Card, said when his client initially was charged with a felony, 'but I believe it's. an overcharge. We will be defending Mr. Taylor in court.' The two men faced up to five years in prison and a fine of up to 5,000. The rock formations at Goblin Valley State Park in Utah are thousands of years old, formed by the erosion of the material around the base of the rock. Showing off: Glenn Taylor, a Boy Scout leader, flexes his muscles after forcing the rock from its perch. Highlights:","completion":"Two men from Utah, who were Boy Scout leaders, knocked down a very old rock formation in a park. They made a video of it and put it on the internet. People saw the video and the men got in trouble. They had to go to court and say they were sorry. They won't go to jail but they have to pay money for the damage they did. The rock formation was very, very old, and it was special. Now, the park will put up signs to remind people not to break things or hurt the park."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake. A few years ago, this wasn’t such a common sight at the market in Florence. It still isn’t, in that you won’t get them by the crateful like you do fava beans and artichokes, though they’re not particularly difficult to find now. They’re just one of those special things that don’t last long. Blink and you’ll miss them, or come late to the market and they could easily be sold out. It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course). If you’ve never tasted agretti before, it’s worth seeking out if you’re in the right place at the right time and find a bunch or see it on a menu.

(not typically how its done) at this point i was like well this has no possible good outcomes. i go up and ask him whats up with it and he starts explaining how it was weird cole and i got the same step on the problem, that nobody else got. so he asks me \\"did you two work on it together?\\" me being me, i was like thinking i can get out of this. so i was like \\"nope!\\" and then the professor explained to me how we both magically got the same wrong step! i also sit near cole in class, so he knows i talk to him. to get the same wrong step... at this point i knew his question was not asking for an answer, but a confession. the professor knew the answer already. so i owned up to it. as a result got kicked out of the course for academic dishonesty, and had to retake it in the spring. this was in very early december. i only had like 7 more lectures and i would have been out of there. i had to retake the whole course, for practically the third time. the kicker part of the story. cole was failing that class even before this homework. he had no chance of passing. so he got kicked out too, but it did not matter to him because he was retaking it anyway. so i lost my back for trying to help him for no good reason. i could have technically been dismissed from the school for something like that, but rather got lucky and only had to retake a class. so it was not too much of a fuck up, but one worth noting. after note: i passed calc 1 fine the second time and now am going to pass calc 2 soon. so its all good in the end, but i learned to say no to helping other people with things i should not be.

I visited with high expectations after hearing a fair amount of praise from friends, but those expectations were far from met. Upon entering, the first thing I noticed was the uncleanliness of the venue. The floors were sticky and littered with debris, as if they had not been cleaned for days. The poor lighting only served to accentuate the grime and heightened the overall sense of neglect. I hoped that the staff would be more attentive, but I was sorely mistaken. We were greeted with glacial indifference by a bored employee who seemed to be more focused on her phone than on providing us with any helpful information or welcoming pleasantries. It took a whopping 30 minutes just to get seated, despite numerous empty tables around us. This was a telltale sign that our overall experience could prove disappointing. To our dismay, the food did not fare any better. My meal was served cold – the exact opposite of what I had hoped for. An attempt to inform the staff about the issue, gave way to eye rolls and exasperated sighs. A replacement dish would have gone a long way in remedying the situation, but apparently, that was too much to ask for. Moreover, the menu variety was underwhelming, with a lack of options catering to different dietary preferences, such as vegetarian or gluten-free. For a place that had been praised for offering diverse options to cater to its patrons, it utterly failed to deliver on that count. As we tried to make the best of our experience, we couldn't help but feel suffocated by the noise level within the establishment. The music was painfully loud, making it impossible to carry a conversation without shouting. We ended up surrendering to the cacophony and focused on hoping our food would offer some modicum of comfort. Alas, it did not. Lastly, to end our unfortunate experience, we were presented with a bill that made us question whether we had dined at a different venue altogether. The exorbitant prices did not match the quality of the service or food we received. In conclusion, my overall experience at this place was a letdown through and through. From subpar customer service to dismal cleanliness, insufficient menu options, excessive noise, and unreasonable pricing, my visit ticked off all the markers of a negative experience. I genuinely hope that the establishment heeds this feedback and considers making improvements. Until then, I cannot recommend this place, and I urge potential patrons to look elsewhere for a positive and more enjoyable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A former party-lover has given up cocktails, cigarettes and burlesque dancing and converted to Islam after falling for a Muslim man nine years her junior. Mother-of-three Claire Birkill, 37, from Nottingham, overhauled her lifestyle after a trip to Gambia in January where she met fiance, Sarif Jallow, 28. In her days of burlesque dancing, she would parade around in nothing but knickers and nipple tassels. Claire Birkill, left, now Jameela, has changed her ways as well her her name after converting to Islam, right. Ashamed: The mother-of-three now regrets pictures like this from her days as a burlesque dancer. But since converting, she now covers up in a hijab and says she is ashamed she was once such an exhibitionist. She's also changed her name by deed poll to Jameela. She said: 'Before I enjoyed weekly burlesque classes. I would strip down to silky corsets and do sexy dances. Now I'm so ashamed of my past, I can barely look at old photos. I feel like I've been reborn.' Jameela, who has three children aged six, 16, and 18, met her fiance, Sarif, following the breakdown of her first marriage and said it was love at first sight. She explained: 'My eight-year marriage broke down in 2013 around the time I decided to study tourism at college.' As part of the course last January, she travelled to the Gambia, West Africa, where she met Sarif. 'He was a teacher and nine years younger than me but it was love at first sight,' Jameela said. 'He was so intelligent and kind. On the last day of the trip in March he told me he loved me. 'As I left the airport I cried and cried for three hours straight.' Party animal: Jameela used to love going out drinking before converting to Islam. Changed her life: Now she's happier and healthier after meeting Sarif, right, who proposed in March. Back home, Jameela, then still Claire, spoke to Sarif on the phone every night and he proposed weeks later. She used to be a Methodist but after listening to Sarif talk about his religion, she decided to research it on the internet and 'immediately felt a connection'. She said. 'It's about peace, empathy, love and kindness, all things I believe in. I realised I needed to become a Muslim.' She converted in a special ceremony in June and changed her name to one that's traditionally Muslim. She has not asked her children to convert, leaving them to make their own decisions on whether they want to follow a path of religion. She also began observing Ramadan, explaining: 'It's a month-long period of prayer, fasting, charity-giving and self accountability for Muslims. It was difficult but incredibly fulfilling. Romantic thoughts are forbidden during Ramadan, so I banned myself from talking to Sarif in daylight hours because I got too turned on by his voice.' It's a far cry from her former hedonistic lifestyle. As a young woman, she had a weakness for cigarettes and alcohol and was often promiscuous. She said: 'Before becoming a mum I'd think nothing about bringing a man home after a night out. Normally it was alcohol-induced but I'd never do it now. Long distance love: The couple will initially live apart as Sarif works as a teacher in Gambia and Jameela doesn't want to pull her youngest son out of school in the UK. 'I used to smoke 40-a-day too. I was like a chimney and nearly always had a cigarette in my hand. I can't imagine smoking now, ruining my body.' She added: 'I used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week too. I was a huge G&T fan and would relax with a few in the evenings. That was just a normal week. 'If I went out with the girls, I'd drink more. I loved cocktails and would work my way through the menus in bars. 'The next morning I'd feel terrible and would waste the day feeling sorry for myself. When I think of how I behaved, I'm so ashamed.' She's also now given up her hobby of burlesque dancing, which she started in 2012 after signing up for classes at a local dance studio. 'I wanted to improve my body confidence. I would perform routines, starting off fully dressed and ending up in just silky pants and nipple tassels,' she explained. 'I'd never dream of doing it now. 'Looking at pictures of me in a pink silk basque I see it is very un-Islamic. Islam believes a woman's body is just for her husband.' Mocked: Not everyone has been supportive of Jameela's decision to chance religion. The way she eats and dresses on a daily basis has changed dramatically too. 'I travel ten miles to ensure I only buy Halal meat from a specialist butcher. I used to joke \\"don't wake me up in the morning unless bringing me a bacon butty and coffee\\" – I'd never say that now. 'Giving up bacon has been the hardest thing but Halal prohibits it. 'I always cover my legs as requested to by Islam. I found the headscarf quite restrictive at first. But now I wear it tighter because I want to.' Jameela said Sarif was 'heartbroken' when she told him about her past but she said: 'He knows how committed I am now and believes I've changed.' Sarif is still living in Gambia and the couple will continue to have a long distance relationship after they marry because Jameela does not want to disrupt her youngest son's education. Given up alcohol: The mother used to get through at least a bottle of gin a week. 'After the wedding we will live apart. Because of the age of my youngest son, I won't take him out of school, so I can't leave the UK,' she said. Jameela said she's never been happier since meeting Sarif and changing her religion but the decision has cost her a number of friends. She is often mocked or abused when she goes out in public wearing a hijab. She said: 'Some friends don't want to know me anymore and others are refusing to call me by my new name. 'In the street one person asked why I wasn't wearing a letterbox, meaning a burkha. It's so disrespectful. I've heard sniggering in the playground when I've picked my son up from school and laughed at in Primark by teenage girls. Jameela said friends who knew her as Claire refuse to call her by her new name and she's been laughed at for wearing a hijab but she's never been happier. 'People I know locally are pulling coats over their head and running round with them, shouting, \\"I'm Jameela\\". I've also been called a terrorist by strangers and even former friends.' But she said for all the friendships she has lost, she has also gained new ones. 'The Muslim community is very welcoming. I've been invited into their homes and made to feel more welcome by them then I ever was as a Methodist. 'I've never been happier or healthier than now. And that's all thanks to meeting Sarif.'

Despite the challenges Jameela has faced due to her conversion, such as losing friends and experiencing mockery and abuse in public, she asserts that she has never felt happier and healthier in her life. She credits the supportive and welcoming Muslim community, as well as her love and commitment to Sarif, for her newfound contentment and sense of belonging. Jameela's story is an inspiring example of the power of love and spirituality in helping individuals overcome their past and embrace a new, fulfilling lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instead of an X and Y coordinate, this might be listed as a number of steps Left or Right (on either side of the 50 yard line) and a number of steps in front of or behind the hash line that runs parallel to the Visitor-Home sidelines. Drill charts are read from the viewpoint of the director. If the chart says “in front of” it means toward the director. If the chart says “behind” it means away from the director's viewpoint. In order for the marching band to look uniform, it's important that everybody moves about the same distance with each step they take. Drill chart instructions will be listed in steps. The standard marching style is called 8-to-5, which means there are 8 steps for every 5 yards. Since there will be 5-yard lines on a standard football field, it creates a grid marchers can follow, counting 8 steps between each line. You can also think of each step as being an average of 22.5 inches, since there should be 8 steps in 5 yards. This measurement is often used as a standard. More important than knowing the average size of a standard step while you're marching is to be moving at the same pace as those around you. Each position in a drill chart corresponds to a count in the music. As the song progresses, you will move across the field into a new position. You will start on the count of 0 and generally move in increments of 8. Summary:","completion":"A drill chart helps marching band members know where to stand on a field.

This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

Indeed, the Duchess's decision to stray from the usual side parting may have been a conscious one – a decision to take ownership of her changing appearance and to debunk the myth that aging should be hidden or feared. By stepping out with a new style that doesn't conceal the signs of aging, the Duchess uses her influence and public platform to encourage women everywhere to accept and celebrate the natural progression of life. Moreover, the Duchess's elegant attire and poised demeanor prove that having silver roots does not equate to diminished beauty or sophistication. Instead, her choice of hairstyle could represent a gentle reminder to refocus on the more important aspects of life – such as her involvement with charitable causes like London Poppy Day and the military supporters, servicemen and women she met. In conclusion, the Duchess of Cambridge's choice to showcase her silver roots with a flat, middle-parted hairstyle is an empowering move. It not only breaks the mold of traditional beauty expectations but also highlights the importance of honoring the aging process and maintaining a healthy perspective on personal appearances. Through her choice to embrace her natural hair, the Duchess sends an encouraging message for women to be confident in their appearances, regardless of their age and perceived beauty standards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: BE KIND REWIND is the name of a quaint, little video store that carries VHS titles only because the owner (Danny Glover) can't afford to upgrade to DVD films. It's a small shop set in the middle of a crumbling, poverty stricken neighborhood, made up mostly of minorities. The film stars Jack Black as Jerry, a junkyard worker who magnetizes his brain while trying to sabotage a power plant that he thinks is responsible for his constant headaches. Rapper Mos Def plays Mike, his best friend and the only employee of the video store. The store's owner (Danny Glover) goes on 'vacation' (to spy on a huge franchise video chain), leaving Mike in charge with strict instructions not to let Jerry inside. Of course, Jerry gets in anyway and manages to 'magnetize' all of the VHS movies and wipe them clean. Soon Mike and Jerry are shooting their own versions of classic films like GHOSTBUSTERS and the RUSH HOUR movies with a camcorder, laughably bad 'special effects' and using neighborhood folks in small roles. Unexpectedly, their movie versions (which are referred to as SWEDED becuase Jerry charges 20 bucks to rent a movie, claiming that they are Swedish Imports), become so popular that the small store (facing foreclosure) is actually making money. They begin taking custom orders for movies and end up filming SWEDED versions of THE LION KING, DRIVING MISS DAISY, ROBOCOP and more. Soon, however; they attract the attention of the Feds, who inform them they are breaking the law (of course) and that they must cease and desist. What will they do to save the store now? They make an original film about the history of the city and about a 'famous' musician who was born and raised there. They charge admission and the whole neighborhood comes out to see the film, making them a small profit that still won't save the place from demolition. But a tough, city councilman has a change of heart, in the end after seeing the outpouring of neighborhood support. A:","completion":"Considering the movie plot of BE KIND REWIND, which primarily revolves around Jerry and Mike creating their own low-budget 'Sweded' versions of popular movies to save their struggling video store, how does the film explore the themes of community, creativity, and the impact of technology on small businesses?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press) Busch was suspended by NASCAR indefinitely Friday after a judge said the 2004 former champion almost surely choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall and there was a \\"substantial likelihood\\" of more domestic violence from him in the future. The suspension came two days before the season-opening Daytona 500, and Busch immediately said he'd appeal. Although an appeal can be heard as early as Saturday, Stewart-Haas Racing has already decided to use Regan Smith in the Daytona 500. The move to Smith by SHR, perhaps spurred by Chevrolet's decision to suspend its affiliation with Busch on Friday, is a blow to the Busch camp. \\"We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat,\\" Busch attorney Rusty Hardin said in a statement, adding the assault allegation has led to \\"a travesty of justice\\" that will become clear as Busch continues to defend himself. Busch is the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence. Chairman Brian France had maintained the series would let the process play out before ruling on Busch's eligibility — and the series came down hard in finding that he committed actions detrimental to stock car racing and broke the series' behavioral rules. Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil. But it's a different time in sports since former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice's own case of domestic violence forced leagues to take a harsh stance against participants accused of assault. After the suspension was announced, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker \\"#41 Ray Rice.\\" Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet. In a 25-page opinion explaining why he issued the no-contact order this week, Family Court Commissioner David Jones of Delaware concluded that it was more likely than not that Busch abused Patricia Driscoll by \\"manually strangling\\" her and smashing her head into a wall inside his motorhome at Dover International Speedway last September. The 36-year-old Busch has denied the alleged assault, which is the subject of a separate criminal investigation, but the judge said Driscoll's version of the incident was more credible than Busch's. Driscoll said she was never motivated to have Busch punished by NASCAR. \\"I reported a crime, just like anybody else who has been abused should do, because no one is above the law,\\" Driscoll said. \\"I'm very encouraged that NASCAR is taking steps to recognize that domestic violence is a serious issue, and I hope that we see them develop a very clear policy on it.\\" It is Busch's third career suspension. He was suspended in 2012 by NASCAR for threatening a reporter, and parked for the final two races of the 2005 season by Roush-Fenway Racing after he was pulled over by police in Arizona. He now races for SHR. Busch has 25 career wins but only one since 2011. It came last year, his first season with SHR, the team that helped resurrect his career. Team co-owner Gene Haas hand-picked Busch to drive a car paid for out of pocket by Haas because the machine tool manufacturer wanted to see a driver take his company to victory lane. Busch was fired at the end of 2011 by Roger Penske for a series of on- and off-track incidents, and he spent two seasons driving for low-budget teams before Haas extended the olive branch. Busch had been on a resurgence of sorts at SHR, which allowed him to compete in both the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day last year. He finished sixth at Indianapolis last May and was named rookie of the race. But his season began to unravel late last summer as his performance tailed off. Although he made the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship, he was eliminated after the first round. It was the weekend of the first elimination race, at Dover, where Driscoll alleged Busch assaulted her in his motorhome. She said she drove to the track out of concern for Busch, who sent her alarming text messages following a poor qualifying effort. She said the two argued in the bedroom section of the motorhome before he slammed her head against a wall three times. Driscoll did not file charges until November, and the Delaware attorney general has not decided if Busch will be charged. But Driscoll sought a no-contact order, and the couple spent four days over December and January in a Delaware court presenting their sides. At one point, he accused of her of being a trained assassin. SHR said only that Smith, who filled in on short notice for Tony Stewart at Watkins Glen last August, would race Sunday. No plans were announced for next week's race at Atlanta, but since Haas pays for that car specifically for Busch, the team co-owner could conceivably park it if Busch does not win his appeal. ||||| DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. -- NASCAR suspended Sprint Cup driver Kurt Busch indefinitely Friday, two days before the Daytona 500, for actions detrimental to stock car racing after a judge ruled he almost surely choked and beat a former girlfriend last fall. Earlier Friday it was ruled that Busch smashed his ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll's head against his motor home wall Sept. 26 at Dover International Speedway, according to the conclusions of a Kent County (Del.) family court commissioner who granted Driscoll's request for a protective order Monday. \\"Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately,\\" NASCAR said in a statement. \\"He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice. Editor's Picks Oreovicz: NASCAR had no choice The report issued Friday in the Delaware Family Court case between Kurt Busch and ex-girlfriend Patricia Driscoll left NASCAR no choice but to suspend the former Sprint Cup champion. \\"Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.\\" Busch on Friday night filed paperwork for an appeal on his suspension, which will be heard at noon ET Saturday in Daytona, NASCAR spokesman David Higdon said. \\"We are extremely disappointed that NASCAR has suspended Kurt Busch,\\" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in a statement Friday afternoon. \\"We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold.\\" Hardin, who cannot represent Busch in the NASCAR appeal because the appeal process does not allow for lawyers to represent NASCAR members, reiterated his hope that the family court commissioner reconsiders his opinion based on additional evidence that would show Driscoll is not credible. \\"It is important for everyone to remember that the commissioner's report has to do with a civil, family law matter and no criminal charges have been filed against Mr. Busch,\\" Hardin said. \\"We ask everyone's patience as this case continues in the court of law and are confident that when the truth is known Mr. Busch will be fully vindicated and back in the driver's seat.\\" NASCAR has suspended Stewart-Haas driver Kurt Busch indefinitely after a judge detailed concerns about domestic violence in a ruling Friday. Chris Trotman/NASCAR/Getty Images NASCAR appeals are heard by a three-member panel selected from a list of former drivers, racing promoters and racing executives in the NASCAR rule book. During the appeal, NASCAR will present its evidence, Busch will make his argument and then they both are permitted opportunities for rebuttal. Both sides can bring witnesses but not legal counsel, and the panelists can summon any NASCAR member from whom they want to hear. If Busch loses the appeal, he can make one last appeal to former Gulfstream president Bryan Moss, NASCAR's final appeals officer. NASCAR chairman Brian France also has the ability to lift the suspension at any time. It wasn't immediately clear if Busch wins his appeal whether he could still drive for SHR, which gets a significant amount of financial support from Chevrolet. In her statement, Driscoll said she did not consider this a \\"victory.\\" \\"For victims of domestic violence there are no victories,\\" she said. \\"My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice. \\"Unfortunately we live in a culture where stories like mine are often swept under the rug out of fear and with the knowledge that for every person who shows empathy many more will seek to disparage the victim. It is bad enough to endure the actual physical abuse, but the verbal attacks that follow when a victim speaks up are sometimes just as painful.\\" NASCAR executive vice president Steve O'Donnell did not take questions from the media during Friday's brief news conference. \\"As we stated last year, NASCAR fully recognized the serious nature of the specific situation involving Kurt Busch and really the broader issue of domestic violence. Based on our review of the available details, including the court's findings that were released earlier today, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch.\\" NASCAR executive VP Steve O'Donnell \\"As we stated last year, NASCAR fully recognized the serious nature of the specific situation involving Kurt Busch and really the broader issue of domestic violence,\\" O'Donnell said. \\"Based on our review of the available details, including the court's findings that were released earlier today, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch.\\" O'Donnell, who resigned his spot on the board of Driscoll's Armed Forces Foundation late last year, disputed comments from Driscoll that indicated that other women in the NASCAR industry have been abused by others in the NASCAR community. \\"NASCAR has made it very clear to our entire membership and the broader industry that any actions of abuse will not be tolerated in the industry,\\" O'Donnell said. \\"We want to make it clear that any inference that there is a culture or tolerance for this type of behavior is patently false.\\" Busch will be replaced for the Daytona 500 by 31-year-old Regan Smith, who has one win in 172 career starts and competes full time in the Nationwide Series for JR Motorsports. Smith replaced SHR driver/co-owner Tony Stewart at Watkins Glen last August, the day after Stewart's sprint car struck and killed Kevin Ward Jr. at Canandaigua Motorsports Park. Smith will be able to practice during the 85-minute Sprint Cup practice session Saturday. Although Busch would have started 24th Sunday, Smith will have to move to the rear of the field at the start of the Daytona 500 because of the driver change. SHR, in a news release, said that it has not determined who will drive the car beyond Daytona. \\"We understand NASCAR's position regarding Kurt Busch and accept their decision,\\" Stewart-Haas Racing executive vice president Joe Custer said in a statement. Chevrolet was quick to suspend ties with Busch following NASCAR's announcement. \\"Chevrolet has suspended its relationship with Kurt Busch indefinitely,\\" said Jim Campbell, Chevrolet vice president of Motorsports and Performance Vehicles in a statement. \\"We will continue to monitor the events surrounding Mr. Busch and are prepared to take additional action if necessary.\\" Busch is the first driver suspended by NASCAR for domestic violence. Travis Kvapil, who qualified second for Friday night's Truck Series race, was arrested and charged with assault of his wife in 2013. NASCAR took no action against Kvapil. A short time after the suspension was announced, on the glass outside of Busch's garage stall at Daytona, someone had scrawled in black marker \\"#41 Ray Rice,\\" a reference to the former Baltimore Ravens running back whose own case of domestic violence dominated much of last year. Busch drives the No. 41 Chevrolet. It is Busch's third career suspension. He was suspended in 2012 by NASCAR for threatening a reporter, and parked for the final two races of the 2005 season by Roush-Fenway Racing after he was pulled over by police in Arizona. \\"The Court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that, on September 26, 2014, Respondent [Busch] committed an act of domestic violence against Petitioner [Driscoll] by manually strangling her by placing his left hand on her throat, while placing his right hand on her chin and face and smashing her head into the wall of his motor home,\\" commissioner David Jones wrote in his findings and conclusions. Regan Smith, who competes full time in the Xfinity Series for JR Motorsports, will fill in for Kurt Busch in Sunday's Daytona 500. Todd Warshaw/Getty Images As part of his decision, Jones will require Busch \\"to be evaluated by a licensed mental health professional\\" and complete any further steps for treatment that person recommends. Jones wrote that he would not require Busch to enter into a \\"batterer's intervention program,\\" because in his opinion, Busch did not profile as a habitual \\"power and control batterer.\\" Jones characterized the incident of domestic violence as \\"likely situational in nature.\\" Busch claims Driscoll entered his motor home uninvited -- the couple had broken up a week earlier -- and he cupped her face with his hands while repeatedly asking her to leave. In his opinion released Friday, Jones wrote that Driscoll's version of the events that night was more credible, citing, among other things, her demeanor when she recalled and described the events of that night. \\"[Busch's] version of the events is implausible, does not make sense and is unlikely to be true given the totality of the other evidence admitted at trial,\\" Jones wrote. Busch has asked Jones to reconsider the ruling, and Jones has still not decided whether to reopen the case. \\"We are confident that if the Commissioner agrees to hear newly available evidence that contradicts the testimony of Ms. Driscoll, he will be able understand the actions of that night as well as Ms. Driscoll's character and motivations and reconsider his judgment\\" Hardin said in Friday's statement. \\"He has already found that Ms. Driscoll lied under oath at least once. Our newly available evidence will make it clear that much more of her testimony was untruthful and was purposefully kept from the Commissioner by Ms. Driscoll's attempts to intimidate and threaten witnesses.\\" Busch told ESPN.com on Wednesday that he was \\"focused on racing\\" and declined further comment. \\"It's a matter of just knowing that the truth has been told, and we'll see how things unfold,\\" Busch said Feb. 12, the day before practice began at Daytona. Both sides tried to shed doubt and attacked each other's credibility during the family court hearing, which at times took bizarre turns. Driscoll characterized Busch, the 2004 Cup champion, as battling alcoholism and depression leading up to the alleged assault. Busch testified he was afraid of Driscoll, whom he believed was a trained assassin because of the stories and photos she had shared with him. \\"The assertion that [Busch] would be chastened from assaulting [Driscoll] for fear of the possibility of physical injury is further discredited, in the Court's view, by the fact that [Busch] makes his living risking his life on an almost daily basis by aggressively driving a race car at speeds often approaching 200 miles per hour in close contact with others driving in the same manner, at the same speed,\\" Jones wrote. Busch opted to get his side of the story out in court over two days of Delaware family court hearings in December and two more days in January. Busch is basing his request for reconsideration on the protective order on new evidence his attorneys claim shed more doubt on Driscoll's claims and reinforce their argument that Driscoll is a spurned lover looking to ruin the NASCAR driver's career. Included in that evidence, according to the motion for reconsideration, is Beverly Young, whom Driscoll considers her mother although they are not biologically related, stating that she did not believe Driscoll's claims. Busch, the 2004 NASCAR champion, has 25 career wins but only one since 2011. It came last year, his first season with SHR, the team that helped resurrect his career.

A Court Commissioner on Friday said it is more likely than not that Busch committed an act of abuse in September in Dover. (Photo: DOUG CURRAN/SPECIAL TO THE NEWS JOURNAL) A Kent County Family Court Commissioner said it is more likely than not that NASCAR's Kurt Busch committed an act of abuse last September. Commissioner David Jones in a written opinion filed Friday wrote that evidence presented during the four-day protection order hearing was enough to convince him that Busch had used his left hand to manually strangle his ex-girlfriend, Patricia Driscoll, while placing his right hand against her chin and face, causing her head to \\"forcefully strike the interior wall\\" of Busch's motorhome. The alleged incident happened during raceweek in Busch's motorhome at Dover International Speedway. Busch's attorneys deny Driscoll's allegations of abuse. Jones also wrote that there could be future acts of abuse against intimate partners because of his \\"propensity to lose control of his behavior and act out violently in response to stressful, disappointing and/or frustrating situations involving his racing.\\" Jones said the incident was \\"likely situational in nature\\" where the \\"stressors of the situation\\" overwhelmed Busch's ability to \\"cope and control his tendency to act out violently in response to stress and frustration, causing him to 'snap' and assault\\" Driscoll. Friday evening NASCAR announced it would suspend Busch indefinitely for \\"actions detrimental to stock car racing,\\" according to a statement. Busch, the 2004 Sprint Cup champion, was scheduled to participate in Sunday's Daytona 500. \\"Given the serious nature of the findings and conclusions made by the Commissioner of the Family Court of the State of Delaware, NASCAR has indefinitely suspended driver Kurt Busch, effective immediately. He will not be allowed to race nor participate in any NASCAR activities until further notice,\\" the e-mailed release said. \\"Kurt Busch and his Stewart-Haas Racing team are fully aware of our position and why this decision was made. We will continue to respect the process and timetable of the authorities involved.\\" Carolyn McNeice, Driscoll's attorney, said in an email that she was very pleased with the opinion's contents. In a statement, Driscoll said she hopes what she went through will help other women. \\"For victims of domestic violence there are no 'victories.' My only hope is that the pain and trauma I suffered through this process will help other victims find their voice. Unfortunately we live in a culture where stories like mine are often swept under the rug out of fear and with the knowledge that for every person who shows empathy many more will seek to disparage the victim. It is bad enough to endure the actual physical abuse but the verbal attacks that follow when a victim speaks up are sometimes just as painful. \\"Today NASCAR took an important step and deserves to be commended. The next steps are to develop a thorough process and policies that reenforce the organization's position it took today: Domestic violence will not be tolerated in NASCAR.\\" Busch's attorney, Rusty Hardin, said in an e-mailed statement that his team was \\"extremely disappointed\\" that NASCAR suspended the driver. He said he plans an immediate appeal and is confident that Busch will be vindicated and back in the driver's seat once the truth is known. \\"We assure everyone, including NASCAR, that this action against Mr. Busch will turn out to be a travesty of justice, apparent to all, as this story continues to unfold,\\" Hardin said in the e-mailed statement. \\"We are confident that if the Commissioner agrees to hear newly available evidence that contradicts the testimony of Ms. Driscoll, he will be able understand the actions of that night as well as Ms. Driscoll's character and motivations and reconsider his judgment. He has already found that Ms. Driscoll lied under oath at least once,\\" he added. \\"Our newly available evidence will make it clear that much more of her testimony was untruthful and was purposefully kept from the Commissioner by Ms. Driscoll's attempts to intimidate and threaten witnesses.\\" Jones's opinion comes after he issued a protection order against Busch on Monday. The civil order, good until 2016, said Busch has to stay 100 yards away from Driscoll, her home and workplace. At NASCAR races he has to maintain the maximum \\"practicable\\" distance from her and not attempt to contact her, according to the order. Driscoll is the president of the Armed Forces Foundation, which holds events at NASCAR races across the country. Busch is also not allowed to contact Driscoll by phone, email or any other means and has to be evaluated for mental health problems related to anger control and impulse control. He also may not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms or ammunition. Busch's attorneys filed a motion Thursday to re-open the protection order hearing. They claim that multiple witnesses have come forward since the hearing's conclusion and provided information that contradicts versions of the events, and asked Jones to delay his opinion until ruling on his motion. In a letter to attorneys, Jones did not discount that motion and wrote he decided to publish the opinion, as scheduled, because his reasoning may offer some clarity regarding the motion to reopen. Busch's attorneys said that Driscoll had repeatedly lied on the stand and committed perjury. In his opinion, Jones wrote that he could not find that any conflict or contradiction that constituted perjury. Discrepancies in testimony were likely the result of a misunderstanding or misremembering by Driscoll because of her emotional state, rather than intentional falsehood, Jones wrote. Rusty Hardin, Busch's attorney, requested the Delaware Attorney General's Office to investigate separate allegations that Driscoll had tampered with witnesses. A spokesman from the Attorney General's office confirmed an email from Busch's attorneys and referred it to the Dover Police Department. The Attorney General's office has yet to rule on the criminal charges filed against Busch last year. In an e-mail, a spokesman said they had no comment on the court opinion or Busch's suspension.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A controversial gun measure won't become law in Missouri after a push to override the governor's veto fell one vote short of approval in the state's Senate on Wednesday. The measure, HB 436, would have essentially nullified federal gun laws in the state. Senators voted 22-12 in favor of overriding Gov. Jay Nixon's veto, but the vote fell just short of the two thirds majority required to pass. Earlier Wednesday, the state's House of Representatives voted 109-49 in favor of overriding the veto. If it had passed, the law would have technically not only let residents own a machine gun but also arrested federal agents if they tried to take it away. The bill also would have made it illegal for anyone to publish any information about a gun owner. The legislation passed earlier this year in Missouri's Republican-led House and Senate but vetoed by Nixon, a Democrat. Nixon argued that the legislation violated a provision in the U.S. Constitution called the Supremacy Clause. The Supremacy Clause gives preference to federal laws over state laws. Lawmakers had argued that what they were proposing was not only constitutional but essential to protect the rights of gun owners. \\"There are people saying this is the same as seceding from the Union,\\" said gun owner Kevin Jamison. \\"Missouri did not secede from the Union in 1862, and it does not do so by passing this law.\\" Colorado recall a proxy in national gun control debate. What the bill said. \\"This bill doesn't put one new gun on the street,\\" said State Rep. Doug Funderburk, a Republican. \\"It strictly says that Missouri is going to protect the Second Amendment rights of Missourians.\\" By superseding federal regulations, House Bill 436 would have made it a criminal offense to enforce background checks or to publish the name and address of a gun owner in the state. It would also have technically allowed citizens to own a machine gun, which is banned under federal regulations, according to the governor's office. And it would have nullified federal gun laws and allowed citizens to take legal action against officers who try to enforce them. Gun permits for the blind? Iowa grants them, stirs debate. Opponents worry. Ohio, Minnesota and Texas have pursued similar bills in recent months in reaction to attempts at federal gun control legislation after the December shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut. Opponents worry such laws could all but end any joint operations between local and federal law enforcement agencies when it comes to taking guns off the streets. St. Louis Police Chief Sam Dotson has been one of its most vocal opponents. \\"(We are) basically saying to criminals, 'OK criminals, it's OK to come to Missouri.
