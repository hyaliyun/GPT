Information: - Leonard Michael Maltin (born December 18, 1950) is an American film critic and historian, as well as an author of several mainstream books on cinema, focusing on nostalgic, celebratory narratives. He is known as a \\"go-to\\" critic for the major studios, for writing the shortest review in the U.S. and for creating the Walt Disney Treasures series. - Humphrey the Bear is a cartoon character created by the Walt Disney studio in 1950. He first appeared in the Goofy cartoon \\"Hold That Pose\\", in which Goofy tried to take his picture. After that he appeared in four classic Donald Duck cartoons: \\"Grin and Bear It\\", \\"Bearly Asleep\\", \\"Rugged Bear\\", and \\"Beezy Bear\\". Disney gave him his own series in 1955, but only two films resulted (\\"Hooked Bear\\" and \\"In the Bag\\") before Disney discontinued making theatrical short subjects. When the shorts division closed, Humphrey was the last of only seven Disney characters who had been given a series of their own, starring in cartoons who opened with their own logo (the six others were Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, Pluto, Chip 'n' Dale (counting as one), and Figaro). The Humphrey cartoons have been aptly described by Leonard Maltin as \\"belly-laugh\\" shorts, and they feature a broader, wilder style of comedy than the usually cute or coy Disney gags. - Mickey Mouse is a funny animal cartoon character and the official mascot of The Walt Disney Company. He was created by Walt Disney and Ub Iwerks at the Walt Disney Studios in 1928. An anthropomorphic mouse who typically wears red shorts, large yellow shoes, and white gloves, Mickey has become one of the world's most recognizable characters. - Featurette is a term used in the American film industry to designate a film usually of three reels in length, or about 2440 minutes in running time, thus longer than a two-reel short subject but shorter than a feature film. Hence, it is a \\"small feature\\" (the ending \\"-ette\\" is a common diminutive suffix derived from French). The term was commonly used from before the start of the sound era into the 1960s, when films of such length as the Hal Roach's Streamlinersand several French films of that lengthceased being made, or were made as experimental or art films and subsumed under the more general rubric of short. Its use outside the USA is unknown, although it was as commonly applied to foreign imports as to domestic productions within that country. - Hooked Bear is a 1956 short film in the Humphrey the Bear series . The short can be found on disc 2 of Disney Rarities : Celebrated Shorts : 1920s -- 1960s and also in a handful of cheap public domain VHS tapes . - Goofy is a funny-animal cartoon character created in 1932 at Walt Disney Productions. Goofy is a tall, anthropomorphic dog with a Southern drawl, and typically wears a turtle neck and vest, with pants, shoes, white gloves, and a tall hat originally designed as a rumpled fedora. Goofy is a close friend of Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck and is one of Disney's most recognizable characters. He is normally characterized as extremely clumsy and dimwitted, yet this interpretation is not always definitive; occasionally Goofy is shown as intuitive, and clever, albeit in his own unique, eccentric way. - A short film is any film not long enough to be considered a feature film. Although no consensus exists as to where that boundary is drawn, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences defines a short film as \\"an original motion picture that has a running time of 40 minutes or less, including all credits\\". The term featurette originally applied to a film longer than a short subject, but shorter than a standard feature film. - Chip and Dale (also rendered as Chip 'n' Dale or Chip an' Dale) are two chipmunk cartoon characters created in 1943, at Walt Disney Productions. Their names are a pun based on the name of the famous 18th-century cabinet maker Thomas Chippendale. This was suggested by Bill \\"Tex\\" Henson, a story artist at the studio. - Donald Duck is a cartoon character created in 1934 at Walt Disney Productions. Donald is an anthropomorphic white duck with a yellow-orange bill, legs, and feet. He typically wears a sailor shirt and cap with a bow tie. Donald is most famous for his semi-intelligible speech and his mischievous and temperamental personality. Along with his friend Mickey Mouse, Donald is one of the most popular Disney characters and was included in TV Guide's list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time in 2002. He has appeared in more films than any other Disney character, and is the most published comic book character in the world outside of the superhero genre. - In the Bag is a 1956 Walt Disney's animated theatrical short directed by Jack Hannah and featuring park ranger J.

We have the equation: -12 = 3 * j - 0 * j Step 1: First, let's simplify the equation. Since anything multiplied by zero is zero, we have: -12 = 3 * j - (0 * j), which becomes -12 = 3 * j Step 2: Now, we want to find out the value of 'j'. To do this, we need to get 'j' alone on one side. Right now, it's being multiplied by 3. Imagine we have 3 boxes and inside all those boxes together, we have -12 cookies. To find out how many cookies are in 1 box, we would need to divide the -12 cookies evenly among the 3 boxes. So, we're going to divide both sides of the equation by 3. It will look like this: (-12 ÷ 3) = (3 * j ÷ 3) Step 3: Now let's do the division! -12 divided by 3 is -4. So, on the left side, we have: -4 = j (or j = -4) Yay! We found the value of 'j'. It's -4.

Is \\"In the first notable encounter between the two commanders, Napoleon pushed back his opponent and advanced deep into Austrian territory after winning at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797.\\" the correct answer?","completion":"While the statement provided does highlight Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Tarvis in March 1797 and his advance into Austrian territory, it doesn't accurately address the distance between the French incursion into Leoben and how close they were to reaching Vienna. Let us delve deeper into the details to provide a more comprehensive answer. The French incursion into Leoben happened during the French Revolutionary Wars, specifically as part of the War of the First Coalition. Napoleon Bonaparte, a young and ambitious general, took charge of the French armies and sought to achieve victory against the Austrian forces. After Napoleon's victory at the Battle of Tarvis, the French forces advanced further into Austrian territory. They eventually reached the town of Leoben in April 1797. Leoben is located approximately 145 kilometers (90 miles) southwest of the Austrian capital, Vienna. French forces had made significant progress, but they were still some distance away from the capital. Furthermore, as they approached Leoben, they encountered the Austrian armies led by Archduke Charles, who sought to defend their homeland from the French forces. At that time, Napoleon opted for diplomacy instead of continuing the campaign towards the Austrian capital. On April 18, 1797, the preliminary Treaty of Leoben was signed between France and Austria. This treaty, which was largely a truce, established the framework for future negotiations that would culminate in the Treaty of Campo Formio later that year. The Treaty of Campo Formio would officially end the War of the First Coalition and result in territorial gains for France. In conclusion, the French incursion into Leoben did bring them closer to Vienna, but they were approximately 145 kilometers (90 miles) away from the capital when the preliminary Treaty of Leoben was signed. This halted Napoleon's advance towards Vienna and marked a turning point in the diplomatic relations between France and Austria during the French Revolutionary Wars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick. Paragraph: Two neighboring towns used different approaches to agriculture. Big town used pesticides and fertilizers, while Small town applied permaculture principles and organic farming methods. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which town had more fertilizers picked up by rain water? A:","completion":"Big town"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Herb Jeffries (born Umberto Alexander Valentino; September 24, 1913 - May 25, 2014) was an African-American actor of film and television and popular music and jazz singer-songwriter, known of his baritone voice. He was of African descent and Hollywood's first singing black cowboy. In the 1940s and 1950s Jeffries recorded for a number of labels, including RCA Victor, Exclusive, Coral, Decca, Bethlehem, Columbia, Mercury and Trend. His album Jamaica, recorded by RKO, is a concept album of self-composed calypso songs. From Detroit, at the urging of Louis Armstrong, Jeffries moved to Chicago where he performed in various clubs. One of his first gigs was in a club allegedly owned by Al Capone. Jeffries began his career working with Erskine Tate and his Vendome Orchestra. Tate signed the 19-year-old Jeffries to a contract with his Orchestra at the Savoy Ballroom in Chicago. His break came during the 1933 Chicago World's Fair A Century of Progress International Exposition singing with the Earl Hines Orchestra on Hines' national broadcasts live from the Grand Terrace Cafe. His first recordings were with Hines in 1934, including \\"Just to be in Carolina\\". By 1940, he was singing with the Duke Ellington Orchestra and then recorded with him from 1940 to 1942. His 1940 recording of \\"Flamingo\\" with Ellington, released in 1941, sold more than 14 million copies in its day. His name had been Herbert Jeffrey, but the credits on the record mistakenly called him Jeffries, so he renamed himself to match the typo. \\"Flamingo\\" was later covered by a white singer, the popular vocalist Tony Martin. During his time with the Duke Ellington Orchestra as a lead vocalist, Jeffries proved his talent as a mature singer, demonstrating his wide vocal range in such songs as \\"I Don't Know What Kind of Blues I've Got,\\" \\"The Brownskin Gal,\\" and \\"Jump for Joy\\" (all 1941). The 1944 single \\"My Little Brown Book\\" by Ellington and his Famous Orchestra, on which Jeffries provided vocals, reached No. 4 on Billboard R&B chart. Later on, Jeffries was replaced in the Ellington's band by Al Hibbler. In his teens, Jeffries had developed a fine voice, initially singing in higher registers. He started out his singing career as a lyrical tenor, but, on the advice of Duke Ellington's longtime music arranger, Billy Strayhorn, he lowered his range to mimic the vocal stylings of crooner Bing Crosby. Jeffries became a \\"silken, lusty baritone,\\" according to music critic Jonny Whiteside. In 1945, Jeffries had a hit on the Billboard R&B chart with \\"Left A Good Deal In Mobile\\" (No. 2), on which he was accompanied by pianist Joe Liggins and his band Honeydrippers. Then, he moved to Europe and performed there for many years, including at nightclubs he owned. He was back in America by the 1950s, recording jazz records again, including 1957 collection of ballads, Say It Isn't So. In 1995, at age 81, he recorded The Bronze Buckaroo (Rides Again), a Nashville album of songs on the Warner Western label.

However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews. As it happens, Eichmann and Himmler's suspicions are well-founded – despite appearing to be the perfect Aryan couple, Hans and Ingrid are actually Jews working deep undercover with the underground Resistance.

It's when people stop working because they want better things like more money or better rules at work. They do this to tell their bosses and the people in charge that they want things to change. Well, in Wales, there is a group of people called the Welsh Government. They are like the moms and dads that help make the rules for everyone living there. Right now, they are talking about a new rule. This new rule is about people who work in the public sector. The public sector is a group of jobs where people work to help others, like teachers, nurses, or those who keep our cities clean. Right now, there are some rules that do not let public workers go on strike easily. The Welsh Government wants to change that with this new rule. They want to make it easier for the workers to say when they are unhappy and want better conditions at work. Why would they want to do this? The people who work in the public sector are very important because they help keep our towns, cities, and lives running smoothly. If they are not happy, they might not do their jobs as well. The Welsh Government wants to make sure that these workers feel heard and have a way to tell everyone if something is unfair. But, like all new rules, some people might not like the idea. They may worry that public workers going on strike will make it hard for everyone else who needs their help. There might be some arguments and discussions about this new rule, but that's okay. It's important for everyone to share their thoughts and try to figure out the best way to help the public workers and the people living in Wales. So, with this new rule, the Welsh Government is showing that they care about public workers and want to make sure they have a way to share their feelings and ask for change. We will have to wait and see if this rule becomes a new law or not, but it is a good step towards helping people who work hard to keep our communities safe and happy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas. and a hint : Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.

Continue writing the following text. Peggy filled the bathtub with hot water and bubbles but not salts, because the Possible answers: [a]. salts smelled awful.; [b]. bubbles smelled awful.;","completion":"[a]. salts smelled awful. Peggy lived alone in a small, cozy apartment nestled within the heart of the bustling city. Its size might warrant complaints from some, but she found it comforting – more like a snug nest of warmth and familiarity than anything else. Every object in that small space was utterly and completely hers, every inch of the room saturated with her presence. From the little trinkets that adorned her bookshelf, to the lusciously green houseplants placed strategically by the window – they all played a part in creating an environment that screamed ‘Peggy’. Amongst everything that filled her haven, her bathtub shared a special place in her heart. It wasn't fancy, not a clawfoot or a jacuzzi, just a simple, old-fashioned tub. But she cherished it for what it was – a sanctuary where she escaped the day's humdrum. As the shadows grew long and the city outside her window danced with reflections of setting sun, Peggy found solace in the ritual of filling up the bathtub. Hot water from the taps gushed forth, sprinkling into the belly of the white ceramic tub. She watched as the steam curled upward in gentle waves and lost itself in the bathroom's dampened air. Quietly, she dripped shower gel into the water and watched as hundreds of tiny bubbles started to form, each catching the soft gleaming light, twinkling like minuscule stars suspended on a celestial sea. She was always careful about what she put into the bathwater. Despite the market’s myriad of invitations to indulge in Epsom salts, Dead Sea salts, Himalayan pink salts – all promising to detox, to rejuvenate, and uplift – Peggy decided against them. Her reason was trivial to some but very personal to her. Simply put, the salts smelled awful. On one of her ventures to the city's famous organic markets, she decided to buy a bag of lavender-infused Epsom salts, swayed by the vendor's captivating description of a soothing, skin-nourishing experience. But upon arriving home, she realized that the scent was nothing like the lavender fields that she had always imagined. It was overpowering and too artificial, more like a perfume factory gone wrong. It invaded her senses in a way that felt intrusive. Peggy was a woman of simple tastes. She liked the more refined scents – the fresh aroma of dew-kissed grass, the intoxicating smell of old, musty books, and the lingering fragrance of rain on fresh earth. The scent of bath salts, on the other hand, was too loud, too assertive, too out of place in her sanctuary that welcomed gentle fragrances. So, the bag of lavender-infused Epsom salts found its way into the bin, and Peggy never again invited bath salts into her routine. While some might argue that she missed out on their promised benefits, Peggy would simply smile. For her, the experience of wafting through a sea of mild-scented bubbles was heady enough, and anything else that dared disturb this precious solitude was not welcome. It was in the simple combination of hot water and bubbles, free of any additional salts, that Peggy found her ultimate comfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

He is very good at his job, and has a reputation for liking it. His sexual liaisons are casual and rough. When Flowers decides to take over a betting shop, owned by Joey Maddocks (Anthony Valentine), he forbids Chas to get involved, as he feels Chas's complicated personal history with Maddocks (which is at least partly gay) may lead to trouble. Chas is angry about this and later humiliates Maddocks, who retaliates by wrecking Chas's apartment and attacking Chas. Chas shoots him, packs a suitcase and runs from the scene. When Flowers makes it clear that he has no intention of offering protection to Chas but instead wants him eliminated, Chas decides to head for the countryside to hide but instead winds up hiding out in London, requesting that Tony (a trusted friend he refers to as 'Uncle') helps him get out of the country. He assumes a new name, Johnny Dean, and appears at the house of Turner (Mick Jagger), makes a clumsy attempt to ingratiate himself with Pherber (Anita Pallenberg), one of the female inhabitants, and moves in.

In his 1924 publication dealing with Kent, the archaeologist O. G. S. Crawford, then working as the archaeological officer for the Ordnance Survey, listed the Coldrum Stones alongside the other Medway Megaliths. In 1926, the Coldrum Stones were given to The National Trust, which dedicated it as a memorial to the Kentish prehistorian Benjamin Harrison. A plaque was erected to mark this, which erroneously termed the monument a stone circle; in 1953, the archaeologist Leslie Grinsell expressed the view that \\"it is hoped that this error may be rectified in the near future\\". Still owned by the Trust, the site is open to visitors all year round, free of charge. On their website, the Trust advises visitors to look for \\"stunning views from the top of the barrow\\". John H. Evans characterised the site as \\"the most impressive\\" of the Medway Megaliths, while Grinsell described it as \\"the finest and most complete\\" of the group.Among the Pagans who use the Coldrum Stones for their ritual activities, there is general satisfaction with the Trust's management of the site, although some frustration at the poor access for disabled visitors. A patch of scorched earth exists on the grass in the centre of the monument, perhaps used by Pagans as well as non-Pagans, and the Trust warden responsible for the site has decided to leave it there rather than seeding it over, in order to encourage any who do light fires to do so in the same spot rather than nearer to the stones themselves. The site also faces a problem from litter left by visitors, although Pagans who regularly visit the site clean this up.

It was released on March 4, 2000 in Japan, October 26, 2000 in North America, November 24, 2000 in Europe, and November 17, 2000 in Australia. It competed with Sega's Dreamcast, Microsoft's Xbox, and Nintendo's GameCube in the sixth generation of video game consoles. - A video game console is an electronic, digital or computer device that outputs a video signal or visual image to display a video game that one or more people can play. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - In the history of video games, the sixth-generation era (sometimes referred to as the 128-bit era; see \\"Bits and system power\\" below) refers to the computer and video games, video game consoles, and video game handhelds available at the turn of the 21st century which was from 1998 to 2008. Platforms of the sixth generation include the Sega Dreamcast, Sony PlayStation 2, Nintendo GameCube, and Microsoft Xbox. This era began on November 27, 1998 with the Japanese release of the Dreamcast, and it was joined by the PlayStation 2 in March 2000 and the GameCube and Xbox in 2001. The Dreamcast was discontinued in 2001, the GameCube in 2007, Xbox in 2009 and PlayStation 2 in 2013. Though the seventh generation of consoles started in November 2005 with the launch of the Xbox 360, the sixth generation did not end until January 2013, when Sony announced that the PlayStation 2 had been discontinued worldwide. - The Guitar Hero series (sometimes referred to as the Hero series) is a series of music rhythm games first published in 2005 by RedOctane and Harmonix, and distributed by Activision, in which players use a guitar-shaped game controller to simulate playing lead, bass guitar, and rhythm guitar across numerous rock music songs. Players match notes that scroll on-screen to colored fret buttons on the controller, strumming the controller in time to the music in order to score points, and keep the virtual audience excited. The games attempt to mimic many features of playing a real guitar, including the use of fast-fingering hammer-ons and pull-offs and the use of the whammy bar to alter the pitch of notes. Most games support single player modes, typically a Career mode to play through all the songs in the game, and both competitive and cooperative multiplayer modes. With the introduction of \\"Guitar Hero World Tour\\" in 2008, the game includes support for a four-player band including vocals and drums. The series initially used mostly cover versions of songs created by WaveGroup Sound, but most recent titles feature soundtracks that are fully master recordings, and in some cases, special re-recordings, of the songs. Later titles in the series feature support for downloadable content in the form of new songs. - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia. Located in the Pacific Ocean, It is lying off the eastern coast of the Asia Mainland (east of China, Korea, Russia) and stretching from the Sea of Okhotsk in the north to the East China Sea and near Taiwan in the southwest. - Activision Publishing, Inc., also known as Activision, is an American video game publisher.

Choices: - activision - flagship - harmonix music systems - lg electronics - microsoft - nintendo - produce - samsung - sega - sony - sony computer entertainment - taiwan","completion":"The entity with which 'Guitar Hero' exhibits the relationship of 'developer' is 'Harmonix Music Systems'. According to the provided information, Harmonix Music Systems, also simply known as Harmonix, is an American video game development company based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They are recognized for their specialty in creating music video games. Among their remarkable works, they developed Guitar Hero, a notable music rhythm video game, which was subsequently published by RedOctane for the PlayStation 2 video game console. This particular game was the first in the 'Guitar Hero' series. Released in North America in November 2005 and later in Europe and Australia in 2006, the development of this game came into realization due to the collaborative efforts between RedOctane and Harmonix. The game was designed to simulate a Guitar Freaks-like game but for an American audience. Guitar Hero incorporated a uniquely-shaped guitar controller, a miniature resemblance of the Gibson SG, to realize the idea of playing rock music. The gameplay of Guitar Hero shares a similar concept with GuitarFreaks - this involves the player pressing buttons on the guitar controller in sync with the musical notes that appear on the game screen. The game offers a selection of around 30 popular rock songs that were contemporary from the 1960s till 2005, including bonus tracks. Guitar Hero didn't just become a surprise hit but also received critical acclaim, winning multiple awards from major video game publications. This propelled it to become one of the most influential games during the first decade of the 21st century. The immense success of Guitar Hero paved the way for the development of the 'Guitar Hero' franchise, which has since generated over 2 billion in sales. This has led to the creation of numerous sequels, expansions, and other game-related products. Thus, Harmonix Music Systems plays the key role of a developer in the 'Guitar Hero' franchise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Very Serious Bots Henry Farrell looks at an Economist editorial on France and wonders whether any human intelligence was involved: But I do know that this is one of the most exquisitely refined examples of globollocks that I’ve ever seen. It’s as beautifully resistant to the intellect as an Andropov era Pravda editorial. A few more years of this and the Economist won’t have to have any human editing at all. Even today, I imagine that someone with middling coding skills could patch together a passable Economist-editorial generator with a few days work. Mix in names of countries and people scraped from the political stories sections of Google News, with frequent exhortations for “Reform,” “toughminded reform,” “market-led reform,” “painful reform,” “change,” “serious change,” “rupture,” and 12-15 sentences worth of automagically generated word-salad content, and you’d be there. I wonder whether even the writer of this editorial would be able to define ‘reform’ or ‘change’ if he were asked, beyond appealing to some sort of ‘social protection bad, market good’ quasi-autonomic reflex embedded deep in his lizard brain. I also wonder whether the people in there are as cynical about their product as Andropov-era journalists were, or whether they actually believe the pabulum they dish out. I think this question can and should be asked about a lot of what passes for wisdom these days. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses Henry Farrell's critique of an Economist editorial on France, questioning the involvement of human intelligence in its creation. Farrell describes the piece as an example of \\"globollocks,\\" comparing it to an Andropov era Pravda editorial.

What if one never passes close enough to the flower? Hoping the wind will blow is also risky for a plant. What if the wind does not blow? What if the blowing pollen does not land on another flower?

Here are two sentences: Whitney said officials evacuated a YMCA camp that had been scheduled to host 250 people beginning Sunday . Whitney said officials evacuated a camp where 250 people were expected to arrive Sunday . Do they have the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, both sentences essentially convey the same meaning. They describe a situation in which a camp is being evacuated by officials due to some unspecified reason. The main difference between the two sentences lies in the way they are structured and the details they emphasize, but their core meaning remains the same. In both sentences, we can identify the following key components: 1. Whitney, who is the source of the information in both sentences. 2. The focus on officials being responsible for the evacuation. 3. Mention of a camp in the context of the evacuation. 4. A reference to 250 people being affected or related to the evacuation. 5. The expected date of the people's arrival or beginning of the event, which is Sunday. The first sentence, \\"Whitney said officials evacuated a YMCA camp that had been scheduled to host 250 people beginning Sunday,\\" emphasizes that the camp in question is a YMCA camp and highlights that 250 people were scheduled to be hosted at the camp. The phrasing \\"had been scheduled\\" implies that there was a plan in place for the people to arrive at the camp on Sunday, but the evacuation disrupted that plan. The second sentence, \\"Whitney said officials evacuated a camp where 250 people were expected to arrive Sunday,\\" places more emphasis on the 250 people who were expected to arrive at the camp. The camp is not explicitly identified as a YMCA camp in this sentence, but the core message of the evacuation still remains the same. This sentence also implies that the evacuation disrupted the expected arrival of the 250 people on Sunday. In conclusion, although the two sentences have slightly different structures and details, their core meaning is the same: a camp was evacuated by officials, and this evacuation affected 250 people who were scheduled to be at the camp on Sunday."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What facet of evolution by natural selection was highlighted by Wallace in the work presented to the Linnean Society? Context: Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation. The answer is:","completion":"The facet of evolution by natural selection highlighted by Wallace in the work presented to the Linnean Society was the focus on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Unlike Darwin, who emphasized competition between individuals and compared natural selection to artificial selection practiced by animal breeders, Wallace did not draw a comparison to selective breeding and instead concentrated on how ecological factors contributed to the adaptation and survival of various species within their local environments.

Summarize this article: Pte Cheryl James, from Llangollen, Denbighshire, was found with a bullet wound to her head in Surrey in 1995. A pre-inquest review at Woking Coroner's Court was told her body was exhumed last month and metallic fragments had been recovered. A fresh inquest into her death is expected to take place in February. Pte James was one of four young recruits found dead with gunshot wounds at the barracks between 1995 and 2002. The open verdict recorded at the original inquest held in December 1995 was quashed by High Court judges last year. Coroner Judge Brian Barker QC told the pre-inquest review that Pte James' remains were exhumed and then reburied after two pathologists carried out a post-mortem examination. He said the metallic fragments recovered would be subject to ballistic analysis. The family of Pte James was present during a short reburial ceremony last month, Judge Barker said. They had repeatedly called for her body to be exhumed to resolve a dispute over the ballistics evidence. Alison Foster QC, representing the family, insisted the experts that studied the metallic fragments \\"ought not to have a significant connection either with the MoD [Ministry of Defence] or indeed a police force and certainly no connection with Surrey Police\\" owing to a \\"considerable shadow\\" over the initial handling of the case. Of the MoD and Surrey Police, she added: \\"We make significant criticisms of both.\\" Judge Barker said \\"reasonable progress\\" had been made getting hold of witnesses but urged anyone who had previously given a statement and not been contacted during the inquiry to contact the coroner's court. At a previous hearing, he said the full inquest would consider whether there were \\"shortcomings\\" with the barracks's policies on sexual behaviour, supervision of young females, drugs, alcohol and accommodation. It is due to begin on 1 February and expected to last for seven weeks. Surrey Police's request that Pte James' inquest should be heard alongside fresh inquests into the deaths of Privates Sean Benton, Geoff Gray and James Collinson was turned down in May.","completion":"The body of Private Cheryl James, a young soldier who was found dead with a bullet wound to her head in 1995, was exhumed last month and metallic fragments were recovered for further analysis.

The customers say they really like how there is never a draft in the room but they feel weird when they leave the room and their ears pop like when they are are on an airplane and the pressure is uneven. and a hint : Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Please answer this question : Will the pressure of a sealed container increase or decrease when a gas inside it is heated?","completion":"The pressure of a sealed container will increase when a gas inside it is heated. This phenomenon can be explained using the Ideal Gas Law and the relationship between temperature, pressure, and volume. The Ideal Gas Law is represented by the equation: PV = nRT where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles of the gas, R is the ideal gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. When a gas is heated, its temperature (T) increases. In the given situation, the volume (V) of the container is constant because it is a sealed container with a fixed volume. As a result, when the temperature increases, the pressure (P) must also increase to maintain the equilibrium stated in the Ideal Gas Law. This principle is demonstrated in the hint you provided. When the temperature of the gas in the cylinder is increased to 600 K (double the initial temperature of 300 K), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules also increases. This causes more forceful collisions with the walls of the container, which results in a doubling of the pressure inside the container. Conversely, if the temperature were decreased, the pressure of the gas in the sealed container would also decrease. Therefore, the pressure of a sealed container will increase when the gas inside it is heated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Migration in birds is usually influenced by factors such as change in climate, availability of food, or breeding habits, among others. To verify the hypothesis, one would need specific and reliable data on the North African ostrich's migration habits.

Let me clarify the steps leading up to this conclusion: 1. Forest fires burn forests: This results in the destruction of habitats, including flora and fauna. 2. The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide: Due to the loss of their habitats, animals become more vulnerable to threats such as predation and exposure. 3. Predators can now find their prey easier: With less cover, prey species are more easily found and hunted by predators, which could lead to a decline in their population. 4. Birds will fly away from the area: As resources become scarce and threats increase, birds and other species might migrate to other areas in search of better living conditions. Final step: The ecosystem of the forest becomes imbalanced - Due to the cascading effects of forest fires, the overall biodiversity in the area may decrease, and the ecosystem may take a long time to recover or rebalance, if at all.

Drafted by the government of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, with additional assistance from the country's opposition parties, it was approved by the Parliament on April 10 and ratified on 14 August 1973. - The Pakistan Navy (reporting name: PN) is the naval warfare branch of the Pakistan Armed Forces, responsible for Pakistan's of coastline along the Arabian Sea, and the defence of important civilian harbours and military bases. The Pakistan Navy came into the existence after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. The President of Pakistan serves as the Supreme Commander of the Navy under Article 243 (2) of the Constitution of Pakistan, and the Chief of Naval Staff heads the Navy. Navy Day is celebrated on 8 September in commemoration of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. - The President of Pakistan ( ), is the ceremonial head of state of Pakistan and a figurehead who represents the \\"unity of the Republic.\\" The President holds the legal title \\"de jure\\" and is a civilian commander-in-chief of the Pakistan Armed Forces as per the constitution of Pakistan. - Several nations observe or have observed a Navy Day to recognize their navy. - The Arabian Sea is a region of the northern Indian Ocean bounded on the north by Pakistan and Iran, on the west by northeastern Somalia and the Arabian Peninsula, and on the east by India. Historically the sea has been known by other names including the Erythraean Sea and the Persian Sea. Its total area is and its maximum depth is . The Gulf of Aden is in the southwest, connecting the Arabian Sea to the Red Sea through the strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, and the Gulf of Oman is in the northwest, connecting it to the Persian Gulf. - The Pakistan Armed Forces (\\"Musallah Afwaj-e-Pakistan\\") are the military forces of Pakistan. They are the sixth largest in the world in terms of active military personnel and the largest among Muslim countries. The armed forces comprise three main service branches Army, Navy, and Air Force together with a number of paramilitary forces and the Strategic Plans Division Force. Chain of command of the military is organized under the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee (JCSC) alongside chiefs of staff of the army, navy, and air force. All of the branches work together during operations and joint missions under the Joint Staff Headquarters (JS HQ). - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - From its modern interpretations to its antecedents when maritime nations would send young naval officer candidates to sea (e.g., see Outward Bound), sail training provides an unconventional and effective way of building many useful skills on and off the water. - PNS Rah Naward is a sail training ship of the Pakistan Navy . She was commissioned in 2001 as Prince William for the Tall Ships Youth Trust and sold in 2010 to the Pakistan Navy and renamed Rah Naward ( \`\` Swift Mover '' ) . Rah Naward has the callsign ARNR and the IMO number 9222326 . - The Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 was a culmination of skirmishes that took place between April 1965 and September 1965 between Pakistan and India. The conflict began following Pakistan's Operation Gibraltar, which was designed to infiltrate forces into Jammu and Kashmir to precipitate an insurgency against Indian rule. India retaliated by launching a full-scale military attack on West Pakistan. The seventeen-day war caused thousands of casualties on both sides and witnessed the largest engagement of armored vehicles and the largest tank battle since World War II. Hostilities between the two countries ended after a United Nations mandated ceasefire was declared following diplomatic intervention by the Soviet Union and the United States, and the subsequent issuance of the Tashkent Declaration. Much of the war was fought by the countries' land forces in Kashmir and along the border between India and Pakistan. This war saw the largest amassing of troops in Kashmir since the Partition of British India in 1947, a number that was overshadowed only during the 20012002 military standoff between India and Pakistan. Most of the battles were fought by opposing infantry and armoured units, with substantial backing from air forces, and naval operations. The war exposed Pakistan's inadequate standards of military training, its misguided selection of officers, poor command and control arrangements, poor intelligence gathering and bad intelligence procedures. In spite of these shortcomings, the Pakistan Army managed to fight the larger Indian Army. Many details of this war, like those of other Indo-Pakistani Wars, remain unclear. - Tall Ships Youth Trust is a sail training organisation in the United Kingdom that currently owns and operates a two mast brig, the \\"Stavros S Niarchos\\", and four 22m/72 ft Challenger class racing yachts. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"They will be shut up in cages.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this.\\" true?","completion":"To determine whether the hypothesis \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this\\" is true or not, based on the premise \\"They will be shut up in cages,\\" we must first scrutinize various factors associated with both the situation and the individuals or entities being locked away. 1. Context: The nature of the situation plays a crucial role in establishing the validity of the hypothesis. Suppose the scenario deals with animals being locked up in cages for destructive human activities like illegal trading, animal abuse, or entertainment activities that harm their well-being. In that case, the hypothesis could be true. However, if the situation involves locking up animals for public safety reasons or rehabilitation, the hypothesis may be considered incorrect or debatable. 2. Ethical considerations: The morality of the action is significant in determining the truth of the hypothesis. Ethics vary among different individuals and cultures, but the general consensus ascribes specific rights and freedoms to all living beings. If locking away \\"them\\" in cages goes against these ethical standards, one could argue that the hypothesis holds. 3. Justification: The reasons behind \\"them\\" being locked away must be examined closely as well. If they pose a danger to society or themselves, being confined might be necessary for safety reasons. In this case, the hypothesis may not be entirely true. Nonetheless, if the primary reason is purely for exploitation, abuse, or unstructured and harmful experimentation, it can be argued that the hypothesis— \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this\\"—is true. 4. Alternate solutions: The presence of viable alternatives to this confinement should be considered. If less harmful or restrictive alternatives exist outside of cages, it lends credibility to the idea that they do not deserve to be locked away. However, if no feasible alternatives are available to handle the situation or address the problem, it is challenging to argue for the truth of the hypothesis. 5. Quality of life: Evaluating the living conditions and environment inside the cages is another essential factor in assessing the hypothesis's authenticity. If these cages provide a low quality of life, causing unnecessary distress, suffering, or health degradation, it can support the hypothesis. However, if the life inside the cages is comparable to that outside, or is only a temporary solution addressing a broader issue, it weakens the argument. In conclusion, determining the truth of the hypothesis \\"They don't deserve to be locked away like this\\" heavily depends on the context, ethical considerations, justifications, alternate solutions, and quality of life. These factors must be carefully analyzed to form a well-informed opinion or judgment on the validity of the hypothesis based on the given premise. Since we lack significant information and context behind the premise \\"They will be shut up in cages,\\" it is impossible to assert, with certainty, whether the hypothesis is true or false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Since 1985, he has recorded 20 studio albums and charted more than 50 singles on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Songs charts, and 16 of these were number-one hits.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - Fiddle is another name for the bowed string musical instrument more often called a violin. It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - The harmonica, also known as a French harp or mouth organ, is a free reed wind instrument used worldwide in many musical genres, notably in blues, American folk music, classical music, jazz, country, and rock and roll. There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway. When the free end is made to vibrate by the player's air, it alternately blocks and unblocks the airway to produce sound. - Recorded history or written history is a historical narrative based on a written record or other documented communication. Recorded history can be contrasted with other narratives of the past, such as mythological, oral or archeological traditions. - Kenneth Arnold \\"Kenny\\" Chesney (born March 26, 1968) is an American country music singer, songwriter and record producer. He has recorded 20 albums, 14 of which have been certified Gold or higher by the RIAA. He has also produced more than 40 top 10 singles on the U.S. \\"Billboard\\" Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay charts, 29 of which have reached number one on the charts. Most of these have also charted high within the top 40 of the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart, making him one of the few successful crossover country artists. He has sold over 30 million albums worldwide. - Love Is Strong is the title of the fourth studio album by country music artist Paul Overstreet released in 1992 . It produced three singles , \`\` Me and My Baby '' , \`\` Still Out There Swinging '' and \`\` Take Another Run '' . While this album was not as successful as his previous two , \`\` Me And My Baby '' managed to reach the top 40 while the others did n't . The album itself peaked at # 28 on the Billboard Top Christian Albums Chart while only reaching # 60 on the Top Country Albums chart . The song \`\` There But for the Grace of God Go I '' also won a Dove Award for Country Recorded Song of the Year at the 24th GMA Dove Awards in 1993 . - The Judds were an American country music duo composed of Naomi Judd (born 1946) and her daughter, Wynonna Judd (born in 1964). Signed to RCA Records in 1983, the duo released six studio albums between then and 1991. One of the most successful acts in country music history, the Judds won five Grammy Awards for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, and eight Country Music Association awards. The duo also charted twenty-five singles on the country music charts between 1983 and 2000, fourteen of which went to Number One and six more of which made Top Ten on the same chart. In 1985, the duo appeared on the PBS music program \\"Austin City Limits\\" during Season 10. The duo appeared on the PBS children's show \\"Square One TV\\" many times. - The word Dobro is, in popular usage, the generic term for a wood-bodied, single cone resonator guitar. It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins. - Jackie Keith Whitley (July 1, 1954 May 9, 1989), known professionally as Keith Whitley, was an American country music singer. During his career, Whitley charted 19 singles on the \\"Billboard\\" country charts. What is the relationship between 'love is strong ' and 'rca records'?

Aiden entered the study. The watermelon is in the red_envelope. Phone rang. Aiden exited the study.

I think this meets the criteria as it separates the story and the question for further analysis. Part #2: Determine which of the three scenarios the story falls under. Usage: The story falls under the third scenario, \\"when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs.\\" This is because Jackson moved the watermelon after Aiden left the study and believes Aiden is still searching for the watermelon in its original location. Part #3: Discern the location of the object in the story. Usage: The watermelon's location at the beginning is in the red_envelope, and it is later moved to the red_suitcase by Jackson. This meets the criteria as it identifies the object and its locations throughout the story. Part #4: Recognize and eliminate distractor sentences from the story. Usage: The distractor sentence in the story is \\"Phone rang.\\" This sentence does not have any relevance to the location of the watermelon or the characters' beliefs. Thus, it meets the criteria of being unrelated to the question and is designed to confuse the reader. Part #5: Answer the question based on the relevant information in the story and the identified scenario. Usage: Based on the relevant information and the third scenario, the answer is that Jackson thinks Aiden searches for the watermelon in the red_envelope.

The Big Diesel/Shamrock announced his retirement in a brief video posted online today. “We did it. Nineteen years, baby,” he said. “I want to thank you very much, that’s why I’m telling you first, I’m about to retire.” When ESPN asked why he’d announced it that way, he replied, “Once a businessman, always a businessman. I am the emperor of the social media network.” A Celtics spokesman said O’Neal hadn’t yet told them of his decision, but Rajon Rondo tweeted, “Shout out to @SHAQ on the hall of fame career. One of a kind player.” In an interview with ESPN, Shaq said he was retiring because of his nagging Achilles injury; team doctors said he’d need surgery and a lengthy rehab stint. “I really, really thought about coming back,” he said. But “we’d have the same outcome as this last year—everyone sitting around and waiting for me.” Article:","completion":"Shaquille O’Neal Announces Retirement from NBA in Online Video: The End of an Era Shaquille O'Neal, more commonly known as \\"Shaq\\" or \\"The Big Diesel,\\" has officially announced his retirement from his Hall of Fame-worthy NBA career in a short online video posted today. Having played for 19 years in the league, Shaq casually made the announcement, saying, \\"We did it. Nineteen years, baby. I want to thank you very much, that’s why I’m telling you first, I’m about to retire.\\" This unique, surprising and perhaps fitting way to announce his retirement is a testament to Shaq's innovative approach not just to the game of basketball, but also to self-promotion and marketing. When asked by ESPN about his decision to make the announcement online, Shaq explained, \\"Once a businessman, always a businessman. I am the emperor of the social media network.\\" Although the Boston Celtics, Shaq's most recent team, were not initially informed of his decision, they have since released a statement acknowledging his retirement. Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo also took to Twitter to congratulate Shaq on his phenomenal career, tweeting, \\"Shout out to @SHAQ on the Hall of Fame career. One of a kind player.\\" Shaq's decision to retire stems primarily from his persistent Achilles injury, which would require surgery and an extensive rehabilitation period. Speaking to ESPN, he said, \\"I really, really thought about coming back. But we’d have the same outcome as this last year—everyone sitting around and waiting for me.\\" Shaq has opted to prioritize his long-term health over continuing to play in the NBA, a difficult decision that shows his maturity and wisdom both on and off the court. Over the course of Shaquille O’Neal's remarkable career, he demonstrated exceptional skill, athleticism, and a larger-than-life personality, earning him numerous accolades and records. The 7-foot-1 center was the number one overall pick in the 1992 NBA Draft by the Orlando Magic and went on to win Rookie of the Year. During his tenure in the league, Shaq played for the Orlando Magic, Los Angeles Lakers, Miami Heat, Phoenix Suns, Cleveland Cavaliers, and Boston Celtics. Among his most significant achievements, Shaq was a 15-time NBA All-Star, a four-time NBA champion, and a three-time NBA Finals MVP. He was also recognized as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History in 1996. With a career boasting numerous memorable moments, from his thunderous dunks to his entertaining interviews, Shaq has undoubtedly left an indelible mark on the NBA and the world of sports. As Shaquille O’Neal hangs up his basketball sneakers, fans around the world will reflect on the incredible impact he had on the sport. Over the past 19 years, his larger-than-life presence both on and off the court has brought joy, entertainment, and excitement to countless basketball enthusiasts. As he transitions into the next chapter of his life, Shaq leaves behind a lasting legacy as an incredible athlete, an entertainer, a businessman, and truly, a one-of-a-kind player."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"Windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine waters make a memorable Caribbean snapshot (best from the hillside village of Gosier itself).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make a nice photo opportunity.\\"?","completion":"If the given premise is true, that \\"Windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine waters make a memorable Caribbean snapshot (best from the hillside village of Gosier itself),\\" it provides considerable support for the hypothesis \\"The aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make a nice photo opportunity.\\" Let us break down the premise and its implications for the hypothesis. 1. Memorable Caribbean snapshot: The premise implies that the scene of windsurfers and sailboats on the aquamarine waters creates a striking and unforgettable image associated with the Caribbean. This suggests that the scene is visually appealing and worthy of being captured in a photograph. Consequently, the hypothesis that the scene makes for a nice photo opportunity is consistent with the premise. 2. Aquamarine waters: The use of the term \\"aquamarine waters\\" to describe the sea in the premise helps establish the setting's aesthetic appeal. Aquamarine is a visually pleasing shade of blue that evokes thoughts of calm, refreshing waters. Thus, the presence of aquamarine waters in the hypothesis reaffirms the idea that the scene would make an attractive photograph. 3. Windsurfers and sailboats: The presence of windsurfers and sailboats in the premise indicates a synergy of human activity and nature, adding an element of excitement to the scene. Sailboats and windsurfers, with their vibrant sails, contribute to the colorful and energetic atmosphere, enhancing the photogenic qualities of the seascape. This detail from the premise is carried over to the hypothesis, lending further support to the idea that the scene presents a nice photo opportunity. 4. Hillside village of Gosier: The premise states that the best view of this scene is from the hillside village of Gosier itself. This detail implies that there is an optimal vantage point from which the scene in question can be photographed. Having an ideal location to shoot from inherently strengthens the hypothesis that the aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make for a nice photo opportunity. In essence, the premise provides ample support for the hypothesis, as it depicts a vibrant and visually enticing scene of aquamarine waters, windsurfers, and sailboats. The specific mention of the hillside village of Gosier as the best vantage point further bolsters the assertion that this scene makes for an appealing photo opportunity. Therefore, it can be concluded that if the premise is true, it does entail the hypothesis \\"The aquamarine waters with windsurfers and sailboats make a nice photo opportunity.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The Governor, a significant antagonist in the Walking Dead, is a character from the popular comic book series and television show. He is portrayed as the ruthless and cunning leader of the Woodbury community and clashes with Rick Grimes and his group of survivors. The Governor's death is shown differently in the comics and television series, so I will discuss both instances to provide a comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding his demise. In the comic series: The Governor, whose real name is Brian Blake, meets his end in issue #48. During an assault on the prison where Rick and the other survivors have established their base, The Governor is ultimately responsible for the death of several characters, including Lori and Judith Grimes. In his attempt to kill Rick and take over the prison, he orders the prison fences to be destroyed, thus allowing hordes of zombies to invade the compound. While The Governor remains focused on successfully capturing the prison, his own people turn against him. During this intense battle, Lilly Caul, one of his Woodbury soldiers, realizes the terrible acts they have been carrying out under The Governor's orders. She becomes outraged after witnessing the deaths of innocent lives, including Lori and Judith. It's during this moment, driven by her anger and desire for justice, that Lilly takes matters into her own hands. She shoots and kills The Governor, thus ending his reign of terror. Following this event, Lilly and other remaining residents of Woodbury join forces with Rick's group to create a stronger community. In the television series: The Governor, played by actor David Morrissey, has a slightly different storyline in the television series, but his ultimate demise is not unlike that depicted in the comic books. After the initial confrontation with Rick's group and the fall of Woodbury, The Governor becomes a fugitive and eventually assumes a new identity as \\"Brian Heriot.\\" He forms a new group and attempts to take over the prison once again. In season 4, episode 8, titled \\"Too Far Gone,\\" The Governor initiates a fierce battle against the prison group. He captures Michonne and Hershel as hostages and demands that Rick's group vacate the compound. Despite Rick's pleas for peace, The Governor is adamant and proceeds to execute Hershel. Seeing this horrific act, Lilly, who was previously involved with The Governor romantically, finally understands the true nature of his malicious intent. While The Governor and Rick engage in a brutal fight, Michonne manages to wound The Governor by stabbing him through his chest with her sword. Michonne lets him suffer instead of finishing him off, as she knows that he is already a dying man. It is then that Lilly steps forward, full of disappointment and anger towards the man she once knew. She delivers the final blow, shooting The Governor in the head and ending his life. This scene highlights the recurring theme of revenge and retribution that permeates the storyline of the Walking Dead and underscores the eventual consequences of The Governor's selfish actions and manipulative tactics. In conclusion, The Governor, a notorious and ruthless antagonist in the Walking Dead, is killed by Lilly Caul. Although the circumstances leading to his death vary slightly in the comic books and television series, Lilly's act of vengeance is consistent in both narratives. This event is a turning point that leads to the eventual merging of the remaining Woodbury residents with Rick's group, signaling a new era of cooperation and relative stability in the post-apocalyptic world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In this case, the premise is about a young mother and her child engaging in an activity (the child licking a wooden cooking spoon), while the hypothesis is about the child's state (sleeping). Step 3: Assess whether the premise can support the hypothesis. The premise describes an action of the child, licking a wooden cooking spoon clean, which would require the child to be awake. Step 4: Draw the conclusion. Based on the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis is false because the child must be awake to engage in the activity described in the premise (licking a wooden cooking spoon clean). The premise contradicts the hypothesis because the child cannot be both awake (licking the spoon) and asleep at the same time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: how does sagebrush effect community idaho I found the following answer on Google: Several major threats exist to sage brush ecosystems, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing , invasive plant species , wildfires , and climate change . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the answer you found on Google is generally correct. Sagebrush affects the community in Idaho in several ways, primarily through its impact on the local ecosystem. Sagebrush ecosystems, which are found throughout much of the western United States, including Idaho, provide important habitat for a variety of wildlife, including species such as the Greater Sage-grouse. The threats mentioned in the answer, including human settlements, conversion to agricultural land, livestock grazing, invasive plant species, wildfires, and climate change, can all have significant impacts on sagebrush ecosystems. These threats can lead to the loss or degradation of the sagebrush habitat, which in turn can affect local communities in a variety of ways. Some potential impacts on communities in Idaho due to changes in sagebrush habitat include: 1. Loss of biodiversity: As sagebrush ecosystems degrade, the species that depend on them are likely to be affected. Loss of local wildlife can have knock-on effects on the broader ecosystem, as well as reducing opportunities for wildlife-related tourism and recreation. 2. Economic impacts: The threats mentioned in the answer can all have economic consequences for communities in Idaho. For example, wildfires can lead to significant property damage and loss, while the practice of converting sagebrush lands to agricultural use can lead to the depletion of soils over time, reducing the productivity of the land. 3. Ecosystem services: Sagebrush ecosystems play an important role in providing a range of ecosystem services, such as water regulation, soil stabilization, and carbon sequestration. As these ecosystems are degraded or lost, the ability of the landscape to provide these services can be compromised, potentially leading to negative consequences for local communities. Overall, the relationship between sagebrush ecosystems and local communities in Idaho can be complex, with a range of potential impacts resulting from changes in these ecosystems. The answer you found on Google offers a good starting point for understanding the threats to sagebrush ecosystems and their potential implications for communities in Idaho."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Birthdays often involve surprises. But this year's surprise on the birthday of the great British playwright William Shakespeare is surely one of the most dramatic. On April 22, one day before his 441st birthday anniversary, experts discovered that one of the most recognizable portraits of William Shakespeare is a fake. This means that we no longer have a good idea of what Shakespeare looked like. \\"It's very possible that many pictures of Shakespeare might be unreliable because many of them are copies of this one,\\" said an expert from Britain's National Portrait Gallery. The discovery comes after four months of testing using X-rays, ultraviolet light, microphotography and paint samples. The experts from the gallery say the image --commonly known as the \\"Flower portrait\\"-- was actually painted in the 1800s, about two centuries after Shakespeare's death. The art experts who work at the gallery say they also used modern chemistry technology to check the paint on the picture. These checks found traces of paint dating from about 1814. Shakespeare died in 1616, and the date that appears on the portrait is 1609. \\"We now think the portrait dates back to around 1818 to 1840. This was when there was a renewed interest in Shakespeare's plays,\\" Tarnya Cooper, the gallery's curator , told the Associated President. The fake picture has often been used as a cover for collections of his plays. It is called the Flower portrait because one of its owners, Desmond Flower, gave it to the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"There have always been questions about the painting,\\" said David Howells, curator for the Royal Shakespeare Company. \\"Now we know the truth, we can put the image in its proper place in the history of Shakespearean portraiture.\\" Two other images of Shakespeare, are also being studied as part of the investigation and the results will come out later this month. _ Question: What makes the birthday of Shakespeare dramatic this year? Options: A: It was found that he painted a portrait in 1814 instead of in 1609. B: The Flower portrait has been found to be a fake.

Answer:","completion":"Sydney decided to paint Alex's nails a shade of pink during their girl's day primarily because she wanted Alex to look good and foster a stronger bond between them through this shared activity. A girl's day usually entails spending quality time together, engaging in activities commonly enjoyed by female friends or family members. By painting Alex's nails, Sydney created an opportunity to not only help her friend look good, but also express her creative side and potentially discover new nail-shades that might suit Alex. This activity allowed them to share their personal preferences in colors and styles, leading to a deeper understanding of each other's tastes. Painting Alex's nails also demonstrated a sense of camaraderie, as it is an activity that they can enjoy together in a relaxed and comfortable environment. Additionally, the process of applying nail polish requires patience and attention, symbolizing the care and commitment Sydney has towards her friend. In this context, it is evident that Sydney painted Alex's nails to enhance her appearance, complementing their girl's day experience. Together, they likely shared laughs, stories, and strengthened the bond of friendship that they share. This nurturing and caring behavior exhibited by Sydney serves as a testament to the close relationship between the two friends and showcases the positive impact they have on each other's lives.

Any successful business depends on a sound marketing strategy that makes the community aware of the great services you will offer. Before you begin advertising, try taking some time and thinking about the information you want to convey. Consider the following: Think about how you will describe the particular service you plan to offer. How is it different/better than what is already out there? What ages do you serve? What will your hours be? Think about the price you will charge, based on your previous market research, so that you can be competitive with other child-care businesses in the area. Think about the advantages your location offers (great parking, safe, convenient, etc.). If you have staff, think about how to market them as well. What qualifications/certifications/specialities do they bring to your business? You should begin advertising about three months before your child-care business is set to open. If you have the funds, newspaper, radio, and television ads will probably give you the greatest exposure, but these advertising formats do not come cheaply. Consider some of the following, less expensive options as well, even if you can afford more conventional advertising: Word of mouth. Posting fliers/posters in public spaces in your community (be sure to get permission from the owner of the property/building you plan to put your fliers on first, though!). Distributing brochures/business cards at libraries, church meetings, PTA meetings, neighborhood get-togethers, etc. Placing an ad in the classified section of a local paper. You will also need to decide what, if any, your daily activities will be. Some child-care business offer little structure—they provide supervision and make toys/games/food available for the children to use, but have no set routine or schedule. Others take a more planned approach, with time set aside for playing, learning, napping, etc., based on the ages of the children being cared for. Take some time and think about what you will offer the children for whom you will be caring, and what sort of schedule you will offer. If you are unsure of how to begin, try asking parents in your area what they would like a child-care facility to offer or perhaps how they structure their child's time at home. Summary:","completion":"To create a sound marketing strategy for your child-care business, it is essential to consider the following key points: 1. Clarify the unique services you offer, how they differ from existing options, the specific ages you serve, your operational hours, and the prices you intend to charge based on market research. 2. Highlight any advantages your location offers, like easy parking, convenience, and safety, and also showcase any special qualifications or certifications your staff possess. 3. Begin your advertising efforts approximately three months before your business opens and consider utilizing various channels like newspaper, radio, television, as well as cost-effective methods like word of mouth, fliers, brochures, business cards, and local newspapers' classified sections. 4. Engage with parents in your area to understand their preferences and requirements to help you develop a structured daily routine for the children under your care. This schedule should balance playtime, learning, napping, and other age-appropriate activities. Keeping these factors in mind will help you create an impactful marketing campaign that raises awareness about your child-care business in your community, ultimately guiding you on the path to success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Toyota's headquarters is located in Toyota City, Aichi Prefecture, in Japan. 2. The city in which Toyota's headquarters is located is named Toyota City, after the company itself. 3. Toyota's offices are not in a skyscraper. The main headquarters of Toyota is located in a 4-story building. 4. The Toyota Technical Center is taller than its headquarters. The Technical Center is a 14-story building which is significantly higher than the 4-story building that houses the main headquarters. 5. In terms of storeys, the Toyota Technical Center is taller by 10 floors. This height disparity would obviously be quite substantial, though the specific measurements in feet or meters would depend on the actual construction specifics of each building. 6. The Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha plant, which is Toyota's second plant engaging in mass production, are next to one another. 7. The Honsha plant, located adjacent to the Toyota Technical Center, used to be called the Koromo plant. 8. The buildings, namely the Toyota Technical Center and the Honsha (formerly Koromo) plant, are not far from the headquarters. They are described as being in a location near the headquarters, implying close proximity. 9. The Toyota headquarters is not usually described as impressive. It is said to be more modest and functional. 10. Vinod Jacob from \\"The Hindu\\" described the main headquarters building as \\"modest,\\" indicating it does not flaunt excessive grandeur or luxury while still being well-suited to its purpose. 11. Toyota has a hard time keeping foreign workers at their headquarters due to the lack of amenities in Toyota City. Akio Toyoda, the company's head in 2013, reported on this, implying the city might not offer the sort of facilities, attractions, or cosmopolitan lifestyle that might appeal to overseas employees. 12. As it stands, Toyota is the world's market leader in sales of hybrid electric vehicles, meaning no other car companies sell more hybrid vehicles than Toyota. Its successful hybrid car models like the Prius have achieved impressive sales milestones, racking up millions of units sold worldwide."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Proclus Lycaeus, also known as \\"the Successor,\\" was a prominent ancient philosopher who belonged to the Western philosophy tradition and played a significant role in the development of Neoplatonism. Born in Constantinople on February 8, 412 AD, Proclus went on to leave a lasting impact on the world of philosophy. Influenced by great philosophers such as Plotinus, Aristotle, Plato, Plutarch, and Syrianus, Proclus embarked on a journey to understand and expand upon their ideas. His work primarily focused on Neoplatonism, a school of thought that blended Plato's philosophies with religious and mystical elements, emphasizing the hierarchical structure of reality and the role of the One as the source of all existence. Throughout his life, Proclus studied under various philosophers and scholars, eventually settling in Athens, the heart of ancient philosophy and learning. While in Athens, he became the head of the Platonic Academy, an influential institution founded by Plato himself. Proclus's teachings and work, in turn, influenced a myriad of future philosophers and scholars such as Damascius, Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, Pseudo-Dionysius, Ammonius Hermiae, Marinus, Marsilio Ficino, and St. Thomas. His ideas resonated through the ages, impacting medieval Christian thought and the development of Western philosophy. Proclus passed away in Athens on April 17, 485 AD, leaving behind a rich legacy of philosophical contributions that have influenced thinkers across various eras and traditions. His dedication to exploring and expanding upon the ideas of those who inspired him cemented his reputation as \\"the Successor\\" in the world of ancient philosophy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. I am facing a new situation today: David is a doctor who works for the public health department. After analyzing health data for his city, he found twenty percent of the population have myopia. He categorized them as group A. Another eighty percent didn't have myopia. He put them in group B. He now needs to devise a plan on how to tackle myopia in his city. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B?

Add 1/2 cup of 7 Up to an almost full vase of cold water, insert your flowers, this will preserve the flowers. The reason why adding 1/2 cup of 7 Up to an almost full vase of cold water is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning is that 7 Up contains sugar and a little bit of citric acid. The sugar provides the cut flowers with some nutrition, helping them to stay fresh for a longer time, while the citric acid helps to lower the pH of the water, which can prevent the growth of harmful bacteria and improve the flowers' water uptake. On the other hand, buttermilk is not an ideal solution for preserving cut flowers. Buttermilk contains lactic acid, which doesn't provide the appropriate pH for cut flowers and may lead to bacterial growth in the water, ultimately shortening the flowers' lifespan."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Answer this question: what is the abbreviation for an element called??","completion":"An abbreviation for an element is commonly referred to as an element symbol or chemical symbol. Element symbols are composed of one or two letters from the Latin alphabet, and they are an abbreviated representation of an element's name. They are used universally in various fields such as chemistry, physics, and engineering, as a means to easily identify and communicate different elements, their properties, and interactions. The chemical symbols for elements are standardized by IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry), which is the globally recognized authority that ensures the consistency and accuracy of chemical nomenclature, symbols, and units. The first letter of an element symbol is always capitalized, while the second letter, if present, is lowercase. This standardization allows scientists and researchers from all over the world to effectively communicate and understand the specific elements being referred to, regardless of their languages or backgrounds. For example, some common element symbols and their corresponding elemental names are as follows: 1. H = Hydrogen 2. O = Oxygen 3. Na = Sodium 4. Cl = Chlorine 5. Au = Gold (from Latin 'Aurum') 6. Ag = Silver (from Latin 'Argentum') Many chemical symbols are derived from the English element names, but some are based on their Latin, Greek, or German names, which originated from the historical context in which they were discovered or their properties and characteristics. In chemical formulas, these symbols are conveniently used to represent elements involved in chemical reactions and to show the composition of compounds and molecules. The symbols are combined with numbers, called subscripts, which indicate the relative ratio of atoms of different elements in a compound. For instance, the chemical formula for water is H2O, which means it consists of two hydrogen (H) atoms and one oxygen (O) atom. In conclusion, the abbreviation for an element is called an element symbol or chemical symbol and plays a critical role in conveying information accurately and efficiently within the scientific community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Terrified of water and screaming at the sound of rain, they were just some of the thousands of children whose lives were devastated by the Boxing Day tsunami. Crammed into tents, many were mute and in shock after losing their entire families and seeing their villages flattened and flooded. For Nizma Scoffield there was only one option, to set up an orphanage to give as many children as possible, marooned by the tsunami and without any relatives, a home. Nizma Scoffield (right) has helped raise 100 orphans who lost all their families after the Boxing Day tsunami in Indonesia 10 years ago, including Nina (left) who was just 10 when she lost her mother to the devastation The home runs off donations of around £600 a month - which provides food, shelter and tuition for the","completion":"children - and has since evolved into a thriving community and safe haven for these young survivors. Nizma Scoffield, driven by her compassion and determination, took on the monumental task of not only providing these children with a roof over their heads but also working tirelessly to help them heal from the unspeakable trauma they had experienced. In the immediate aftermath of the tsunami, which claimed the lives of more than 230,000 people across 14 countries, aid organizations from around the world arrived to provide relief in the form of food, water, and medical supplies. However, with countless children left orphaned, it was clear that longer-term solutions were needed to care for and support these young victims. This is where Nizma's vision for her orphanage took root. Initially, the orphanage was set up in a temporary location, providing basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter for the children. As the number of orphans grew, Nizma searched for ways to secure permanent land and facilities to ensure their long-term care and education. This was no easy task, as funding and resources were scarce in the wake of the disaster. However, thanks to the generosity of donors and the unwavering support of volunteers and community members, the orphanage was eventually established in a permanent location. Today, the orphanage has become a vital sanctuary for these children, offering much more than just their basic needs. Along with providing housing, food, and clothing, the orphanage emphasizes education and personal development, ensuring that the children have the tools and resources they need to overcome their pasts and eventually lead successful, fulfilled lives. Through the ongoing support of the staff and volunteers, the children have been nurtured and guided back to a sense of normalcy despite the trauma. Many have even gained the courage to face their fears of water and rain, taking part in swimming lessons and activities that promote both mental and physical healing. Alongside their formal education, the children at the orphanage also receive psychological support to help them cope with their grief and loss. The team of dedicated caregivers and therapists work closely with the children to address the emotional scars left by the tsunami, using various therapeutic techniques and activities that encourage self-expression and emotional release. Moreover, the orphanage also strives to help the children maintain a connection to their cultural heritage and traditions. By cultivating a sense of community and preserving their shared history, the orphans are able to develop a sense of identity and belonging, which is essential for their emotional healing and self-esteem. Over the past ten years, Nizma Scoffield's orphanage has saved the lives and restored hope to over 100 children who lost everything in the Boxing Day tsunami. Thanks to her unwavering commitment and the dedication of her team, these children have been given a second chance at life and the opportunity to grow into strong, resilient adults. As the orphanage continues to thrive and fulfill its mission, it stands as a testament to the power of human compassion and the importance of providing care, support, and hope to those who have lost so much. Through the efforts of Nizma Scoffield and her team, the orphans can now face their futures with strength, confidence, and optimism, knowing that they have a loving and supportive community to guide them every step of the way."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Isbell was born in Green Hill, Alabama, two miles from the Alabama/Tennessee state line, the son of interior designer mother Angela Hill Barnett and house painter Mike Isbell. Isbell's mother was only 17 years old (and his father 19 years old) when he was born and is the subject of a song, \\"Children of Children\\". Isbell's parents divorced, and he has two much younger half-siblings, Chantry Barnett and Emily Isbell. Isbell grew up in rural North Alabama. Jason Isbell released his first solo album, Sirens of the Ditch, on July 10, 2007. In 2012, Isbell supported singer-songwriter Ryan Adams on his tour. Both played solo acoustic sets. On June 11, 2013, Isbell released his fourth solo album, Southeastern. Produced by Dave Cobb and featuring accompanying vocals by Kim Richey and Isbell's wife, Amanda Shires, Southeastern received overwhelmingly positive critical reviews, earning a score of 87 on Metacritic. Southeastern led to Isbell's clean sweep of the 2014 Americana Music Awards. Southeastern won Album of the Year, Isbell was named Artist of the Year, and the song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was named Song of the Year. NPR rock critic Ken Tucker listed Southeastern at No. 1 on his top ten albums of 2013. Isbell's record received praise by artists like Bruce Springsteen and John Prine. Isbell's music video for the song \\"Traveling Alone\\" features the Jackson House, a historic home in Moulton, Alabama. In 2014, his song \\"Cover Me Up\\" was used as the weather for the Welcome to Night Vale episode \\"Visitor\\". Isbell's fifth solo record, Something More Than Free, was released on July 17, 2015, on Southeastern Records. Dave Cobb produced, continuing the partnership created with Isbell on Southeastern. They recorded the album at Nashville's Sound Emporium studio with a full band. During the summer of 2015, Isbell was on a North American tour to promote the album, with four consecutive sold-out nights at the Ryman Auditorium in Nashville at the end of October. In April 2016, Isbell appeared on the BBC live-music show Later With Jools Holland, singing \\"The Life You Chose\\", one of the tracks from Something More Than Free. Isbell said that compared to Southeastern, Something More Than Free has a feeling of celebration, which reflects his upcoming fatherhood and a forward-facing momentum. One track on the record, \\"To a Band I Loved\\", is a love-letter to the band Centro-Matic, a now defunct band from Denton, Texas, Isbell played with back in his Drive-By Truckers days. Something More Than Free debuted at number 1 on Billboard Magazine's rock, folk and country record charts. Although Isbell had had critical success in the Americana genre, this was the first time he received such high ranking across genres. The album was well received, winning two Grammy awards for Best Americana Album and Best American Roots Song (\\"24 Frames\\"). On May 11, 2016, Isbell, a four-time winner, was nominated for three more Americana Music Honors & Awards: Album of the Year (Something More Than Free), Song of the Year (\\"24 Frames\\"), and Artist of the Year.

The plant roots begin to grow - With better growing conditions due to less stormy weather, plant roots might have a higher chance of growing and penetrating the rock. 3. Break apart the rock - As more roots grow and penetrate the rock, the rock will be broken apart more effectively. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - This process would still occur as plants do this naturally, regardless of weather conditions. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - As more roots grow, rocks are broken into more pieces due to the combination of root growth and plant acids dissolving the rock. 6. Erosion starts to occur - Although less stormy weather may reduce the overall rate of erosion from weather-related factors, the rock is still being broken down through the biological processes outlined above. As we analyze the relationship between less stormy weather and the process of roots breaking rocks, it seems that less stormy weather indirectly impacts a step of the process. The more favorable growing conditions provided by less stormy weather can lead to more significant root growth, indirectly leading to more effective rock breakdown and erosion. Therefore, the supposed perturbation is: - indirectly impacting a step of the process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Brett Morse, 28, has competed at two Commonwealth Games, two World Championships and the London 2012 Olympics. The Penarth product is aiming to regain his British title this weekend in Birmingham. The national championships acts as a trial for the World Championships, which will be held in London on 4-13 August. In the winter, Morse has also been moonlighting as a model to help him fund his athletics adventure. Injury and loss of form meant Morse lost his British Athletics financial support in November 2014 and he has had to look at other methods of funding. After someone spotted a picture Morse had posted on social media, an unlikely call came to help continue his sporting dream. \\"It's crazy and if someone had told me I would be modelling five years ago I would have laughed,\\" said Morse. \\"I didn't care about my appearance. \\"I had a photo shoot before the last Commonwealth Games and posted some pictures of that. \\"An agency rang me to see if I would be interested in doing it as a job. \\"I thought it was a joke at first and they were winding me up a bit. \\"I read the contract and there were no crazy clauses. \\"The next thing I know I was the face of a 'River Island' campaign a week later. \\"It's been cool. It's a crazy world completely different to anything I have thought about doing in the past. \\"I have met some good people and got to travel. Most of the shoots have been in the UK but I had five days in Madrid. \\"I am modelling clothes for different brands and I have been put up for some television adverts.\\" \\"It is very different to discus throwing! \\"Modelling is not as organised and I could get a call now saying I need to be there tomorrow whereas athletics is not like that. \\"Sometimes it's nice to take your mind of athletics and it opens different doors.\\" Morse admitted his new career has received mixed reviews among his family and friends. \\"There has been a lot of banter,\\" said Morse. \\"There have been a lot of old pictures emerging of me on social media of when I was young with three middle teeth and I was out of shape. \\"They find it hilarious, especially my sister, but that's what family and friends are for and I would be doing the same to them.\\" The serious side is that the modelling has helped Morse continue his athletics dream alongside his part-time work in a gym in Penarth. \\"I was funded as an athlete but that stopped in 2014,\\" he said. \\"There are no excuses and I understand performance targets have to be hit, which I didn't. \\"I have had to fund myself although I do have some support from Sport Wales and Welsh Athletics. \\"That is not enough to live on and I have been a normal person as well as trying to be a full-time professional athlete. \\"I worked full-time for a great company for two years and this modelling thing came along. \\"I was able to pack that in and give athletics one last shot. \\"I am not a full-time athlete but I have that mindset.\\" Morse will swap the photo shoot for the discus cage on Saturday in Birmingham as he looks to regain his British title and at least throw an A standard ahead of the Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast next April. Morse will compete in the first event on the two-day competition on Saturday, 1 July. \\"My aim to to regain the title I lost last year because that was hard to take,\\" said Morse. \\"If I replicate my training performances in competition I will win. \\"We will see how this weekend goes. If I can throw a season's best by a couple of metres I will be on track. \\"I would love to go to London and compete in a World Championships. \\"The Commonwealth Games has been more my focus because there is something special about representing Wales. \\"It has the world number three [Fedrick Dacres] from Jamaica, so it's going to be a high-class competition and I am looking for a medal. \\"If I don't throw a Commonwealth Games A standard in the next month I will be surprised.\\" Morse's efforts could eventually be superseded by his younger brother Jay, who does not turn 16 until July but tops the Great Britain Under-17 discus rankings and lies second in the shot putt. The pair competed against each other in the recent Welsh Athletics Championships. \\"He is very talented,\\" said Morse snr. \\"I believe he can throw a lot further than I could. \\"His physical attributes are better and he is mentally much stronger than I was at that age. \\"He is very driven and already talking about going to university in America.\\"","completion":"Brett Morse is a 28-year-old athlete who has been in big competitions like the Commonwealth Games and the Olympics. He is a discus thrower who wants to win a British title in a contest this weekend and maybe get into the big World Championships in August. A few years ago, Brett lost the money he got for being an athlete, so he had to find another way to pay for his training. He posted a picture of himself online and got a call from a modeling agency. Now, he works as a model for clothing brands and TV adverts to help pay for his athletic career.

Question: Millions of people die of hunger in southern Africa every year, but when Zambia was offered thousands of tons of free maize by the US, the government politely said no. \\"We don't know whether the food is safe,\\" said Zambia's commerce, Trade and Industry Minister Dipak Patel. His worries are shared by countries around the world that are in two minds about America's genetically modified(GM,)crops.Just last week, EU member nations were discussing whether or not to import GM sweet corn from the US. Ever since people started farming, they have tried to crossbreed plants to make them stronger or better tasting. At one time, only related plants could be crossed with each other. But when GM techniques were developed in the 1970s, scientists were able to put a single gene from a living creature into an unrelated creature. This means they can make crops more productive and resistant to disease by adding genes from other species.They can also create food with special characteristics, such as \\"golden rice\\", which is enriched with vitamin A. But many people believe GM foods are a health risk. At the moment, the official argument is that GM foods \\"are not likely to present risks for human health\\". But there are still many questions to be answered as the foods are produced in different ways. Some experts believe the genetic material added to plants can transfer to humans and give damage to our bodies. Further harm could be caused by the genes from GM plants crossbreeding with naturally produced crops. People in China are also getting worried about GM foods. More than 70 percent of the country's soybean oil is produced from imported GM soybeans. Meanwhile, an investigation last November found that 12 of 60 famous foods sold across the country were GM products. The government has begun to introduce a marking system for GM goods so that people can choose whether or not to eat them. Which is the best title for the passage?

When these tiny plants fall to the ground, they take root and become new plants. This process is an example of Available choices: (1). sexual reproduction (2). asexual reproduction (3). evolution (4). extinction","completion":"To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the given information and understand the differences between the available choices. 1. Sexual reproduction involves the combination of genetic material from two parent organisms to create offspring. This requires male and female components (usually sperm and egg) to fuse and create a new organism. 2. Asexual reproduction refers to the process where a single organism creates offspring identical to itself without any fusion of gametes. This can happen through several mechanisms, such as budding, fragmentation, or binary fission. 3. Evolution is the gradual change in the inherited traits of a species over time, driven by natural selection and other factors. This process results in the formation of new species or changes to existing ones. 4. Extinction refers to the disappearance of a species when the last of its individuals dies out, usually due to environmental pressures or competition with other species. Now let's analyze the given information: A plant produces tiny plants around the edges of its leaves, and when these tiny plants fall to the ground, they take root and become new plants. This suggests that there is no involvement or combination of genetic material from two parent organisms, meaning it is not sexual reproduction. Furthermore, there's no indication of gradual change over time or extinction of a species. Based on this, the correct answer is (2). asexual reproduction, as the given process involves production of new offspring from a single parent organism without the fusion of gametes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I think he said so because probably he got some help from music. Music has some strange abilities. Medical scientists have found that a person that feels stressed can actually listen to some kind of music and become well. The researchers said that since stress comes as a result of life events such as starting a new family, starting a new business, and starting a new job, one can actually listen to good music and feel good because good music touches the human mind in a positive way. Music helps you to forget the life events that make you worried and remember the important events that once happened in your life. Depression is a disease cause by stress, smoking, social problems and so on. Depression is also caused by problems such as failure in business. Depression may bring us weakness, headache, and loss of concentration. Good music makes one remember happy moments or good days. If you play music about love, it makes you feel like falling in love again though you may have had several upset experiences. And such good feeling make you healthy.

The premise states that \\"Two women have a seat in a busy metropolitan area.\\" The term \\"metropolitan area\\" is another phrase commonly used to describe a densely populated urban locality or a city and its surrounding regions that form a functional economic and social unit. In this case, it refers to a bustling urban environment where there might be consistent movement, interactions, and activities related to city living. Now, let's look at the hypothesis: \\"Two women sit in a busy city.\\" The hypothesis highlights that there are two women seated in a location that is characterized as a \\"busy city.\\" The term \\"busy city\\" paints a picture of an urban center where activities typically associated with urban life are ongoing. Considering that cities are metropolitan areas, this hypothesis supports the premise.

I heard that Ash was tested for a breast cancer gene, so Ash reduced their risk by getting a mastectomy. And I was wondering Why did Ash do this?","completion":"Ash decided to undergo a mastectomy after being tested for the breast cancer gene to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. Here is a step-by-step justification for Ash's decision: 1. Ash got tested for the breast cancer gene: Undergoing genetic testing can reveal whether a person has certain gene mutations that increase their risk of developing breast cancer. The most common genes associated with breast cancer risk are BRCA1 and BRCA2. 2. Positive test results: If Ash tested positive for a breast cancer gene mutation, it means they have a higher risk of developing breast cancer compared to the general population. Depending on the specific mutation, the risk could be significantly higher. 3. Weighing the options: After receiving the test results, Ash likely consulted with healthcare professionals to discuss their options to minimize their risk. This might include increased cancer screening, lifestyle changes, medications, or preventive surgery such as a mastectomy. 4. Decision to undergo a mastectomy: A mastectomy is a surgical procedure to remove one or both breasts, usually as a preventative measure for individuals at high risk of developing breast cancer. By removing breast tissue, the procedure significantly reduces the risk of developing breast cancer in the future. 5. Assessing the benefits and risks: Ash probably considered the potential benefits of a mastectomy, such as reduced cancer risk and possibly decreased anxiety about developing cancer. They would also have considered the risks and potential complications of the surgery, as well as its emotional impact. 6. Making an informed decision: After considering all the available information and discussing it with healthcare professionals, Ash decided to undergo a mastectomy to reduce their risk of developing breast cancer. This choice demonstrates that Ash prioritized their long-term health and wanted to take proactive measures to protect themselves. In summary, Ash underwent a mastectomy as a preventive measure after testing positive for a breast cancer gene mutation. By doing so, they significantly reduced their risk of developing breast cancer in the future. This decision was likely based on careful consideration of all available options and consultation with healthcare professionals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In a story first reported in the New York Times, it was revealed that The Franciscan Order drew up an agreement acknowledging the boy's paternity and agreeing to pay child support in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality.

Your CAT score is like getting points in a game. The higher points, the better you play. The percentile is like ranking in a race.

To do that, you need to play, or study, harder, practice more, and learn new tricks to solve the questions better and faster. 2. The second question is about what points (overall score) someone got to be ranked in the 95 percentile in the 2014 CAT race. So, these two questions are not the same.

Mamming as it's known is aimed at both women and men and involves resting your bust on random objects. It's the brainchild of Michelle Jaret and Michelle Lamont who wanted to inspire women to take action and get a mammogram early if they suspect a problem. Scroll down for video. Breast internet craze yet? Mamming is aimed at both women and men and involves resting your bust on random objects. Popular: The idea began in New York thanks to Michelle Lamont and Michelle Jaret but is now sweeping the internet. Objective: The creators hope the craze will become as big as planking or owling. Aged just 25, Michelle Lamont is a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease. Now ad agency executive Michelle, from New York, has seen her idea go global as more and more people take to the internet to post their 'mamming' poses. She said: ‘Overall the response has been very positive, although there have been some people wondering how a campaign like this is going to “cure” breast cancer. Clean act: The idea is to keep things 'PG' and not bare too much flesh. Chest file it: The photographs are all sent to thisismamming.com which urges people to 'embrace the awkwardness' The creators wanted to break through the clutter of Breast Awareness Month. ‘When I was sick, I asked my doctors about a cure - one actually told me that the best cure we have is prevention. ‘Prevention is screening like mammograms and self-exams and they are the best tool we have to catch cancer early, and catching it early is how we beat it. ‘We would love to see mamming become as big on the web as planking and owling. Part of the reason that we love mamming as a vehicle for spreading awareness is because it taps into an existing trend that is really fun and relevant to everyone. The creators of mamming say that it taps into an existing trend - and is great fun. The creator of the mamming initiative (not pictured) was a breast cancer survivor and she knows early detection is vital to fight the killer disease. Bra-vo: This mamming participant has decided to post a rather fruity picture. Mam's the word: The photographs are a way of women showing solidarity with those having to have mammograms. ‘Our goal was to create something fun that would break through the clutter of breast cancer awareness month. We've seen breast cancer awareness campaigns that use humour and sexuality, and ones that don't mention mammograms or breasts at all. ‘We wanted to do something that focused on the woman as being responsible for her breasts and her health. Overall, we hope that mamming reminds women to get screened, and maybe makes them feel a little less awkward about putting their boobs in the mammogram machine. ‘We hope people will keep it PG, but the only real rule is to make your mam awesome. We love seeing people get really creative.’ To post your own mamming pose visit: www.thisismamming.com.

This information is essential to understanding whether there may still be a chance for the album to be considered for an award in the future. Step 2: Understand the eligibility period for Grammy Awards To be eligible for a Grammy Award, the music must have been released between specific dates. According to The Recording Academy, the typical eligibility period is from October 1 to September 30 of the following year. Step 3: Determine if Now That's What I Call Music! 59 was eligible for any Grammy Awards Since the album was released on August 5, 2016, it would have been eligible for the 59th Annual Grammy Awards (2017), as it falls within the eligibility period of October 1, 2015, to September 30, 2016. Step 4: Check if Now That's What I Call Music! 59 has already been nominated or won a Grammy Award There is no record of Now That's What I Call Music! 59 being nominated or winning a Grammy Award at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards or any subsequent ceremonies. Step 5: Analyze the likelihood of winning a Grammy in the future As a compilation album, Now That's What I Call Music! 59 has already been eligible for the Grammy Awards during its eligibility period but did not receive a nomination or win. Grammy Awards are awarded to new music released within specific eligibility periods, meaning an album released in 2016 would not be considered for future ceremonies. Based on this analysis, we cannot draw the conclusion that Now That's What I Call Music! 59 will win a Grammy in the future since its eligibility period has already passed without a nomination or win."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A small group of Sonderkommandos, prisoners assigned to dispose of the bodies of other dead prisoners, are plotting an insurrection that, they hope, will destroy at least one of the camp's four crematoria and gas chambers. They are receiving firearms from Polish citizens in the nearby village and gunpowder from the UNIO munitions factory; the female prisoners who work in the UNIO are smuggling the powder to the menâs camp amid the bodies of their dead workers. When the women's activity is eventually discovered by the Germans they are savagely tortured, but they don't reveal the plot. Meanwhile, a Hungarian-Jewish doctor, MiklÃ³s Nyiszli (Allan Corduner), who works for the Nazi scientist Josef Mengele in an experimental medical lab, has received permission from Mengele himself to visit his wife and daughter in the womenâs labor camp. Nyiszli is concerned about the safety of his family and believes that Mengeleâs orders will keep them from the gas chambers.

Donald's Dilemma starts with Daisy narrating her problem to an unseen psychologist through flashback scenes. Her problem started on a spring day when she was out on a date with Donald and a flower pot fell on his head. He regained consciousness soon enough but with some marked differences. His singing voice was improved to the degree in which it sounds identical to Frank Sinatra. However, Donald had no memory of who Daisy was. He became a well-known crooner and his rendition of \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\" from Pinocchio (which had been released seven years earlier) became a hit, which gave him a large number of fans. Daisy's loss resulted in a number of psychological symptoms - she suffered from anorexia, insomnia and self-described insanity. An often censored scene features her losing her will to live and pointing a gun at her head, while in front of a table of other different suicidal methods, including a noose, a grenade, a bomb, a knife, and poison. She decided that she would see Donald once again, at any cost, but failed to do so. That's when she decided to go to the psychologist - and the flashback meets the actual time of the cartoon. At the end of the cartoon, the psychologist determines that Donald would regain his memory of Daisy if another flower pot (with the same flower from the first pot, which Daisy kept as the only thing she had to remember Donald) would fall on his head. But he warns that his improved voice may be lost along with his singing career. He offers Daisy a dilemma. Either the world has its singer but Daisy loses him or Daisy regains Donald but the world loses him. Posed with the question \\"her or the world\\", Daisy answers with a resounding and possessive scream - \\"Me! Me! Me! MEEE!!\\".

Voters in Pennsylvania head to the polls Tuesday in a special congressional election with national implications for President Donald Trump and opposition Democrats. The election is taking place in a congressional district that Trump won by 19 points in 2016, but where Democrats now hope for an upset that could be a preview of the midterm congressional elections in November. The race pits Democrat Conor Lamb against Republican Rick Saccone. Saccone got some high-profile help on Saturday when Trump spoke on his behalf at a rally in Moon Township, Pennsylvania. \\"We need him. We need Republicans. We need the votes. Otherwise, they are going to take away your tax cuts. They are going to take away your Second Amendment rights,\\" Trump warned the crowd. Though Trump easily won the district in 2016, Lamb appears to be competitive in part because he is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat who personally opposes abortion and any new gun control measures. Lamb is hoping to pull off an upset with help from former Vice President Joe Biden. \\"Passion and commitment rules in politics. Passion and commitment generates grass-roots support,\\" Biden told a recent Lamb rally. Republicans have poured money into the race, including millions of dollars in television advertisements in the final days before the election. Trump is trying to help Republicans avoid another setback on the way to the November midterm elections, where Democrats are favored to make gains. In making his pitch to voters this election year, the president remains focused on his tax cut bill, new tariffs on steel and aluminum, and a diplomatic opening to North Korea. But Trump remains stuck at about 40 percent approval in the polls, historically low for a second-year president, and a potential drag for Republican candidates in November. \\"He's doing nothing to expand his base,\\" said Jim Kessler of Third Way, a centrist Democrat advocacy group. \\"And also, political damage is kind of like sunburn.

It's not like in the picture that i was expecting, there's a groove at the butt where the pinky sits. It's not tight enough to clasp the opening around the handle, there's a gap where dirt can get in overtime of use....but the shipping was fast and well packed by amazon. Answer:","completion":"The tone of this product review is largely negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects of the product, including the grip's quality and design when compared to their expectations and previous experiences with similar products. They mention that the grip does not fit tightly around the handle, which could allow dirt to accumulate over time. However, there is a positive aspect in the review when the user praises the fast shipping and good packaging done by Amazon. But overall, the review leans more towards a negative tone due to the grip-related issues mentioned."},{"prompt":"Options: +because he lived nearby +because he had an attractive shadow +because he was friendly +not enough information Given those answer options, answer the question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why did the author befriend Barend? A:","completion":"because he had an attractive shadow"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can I reach 5'8' or 5'9'?\\" \\"I am 16 years old and my height is 5'6' can I gow to 5'9'?\\" Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Yes, both questions are essentially asking the same thing. Both individuals are in their mid-to-late teenage years, with a current height of 5'6\\" and are inquiring about the possibility of reaching a height of 5'8\\" or 5'9\\". However, some key differences between the two questions are the age of the individuals and the way they are phrased. In the first question, the individual is a 17-year-old male who wishes to know if they can reach a height of 5'8\\" or 5'9\\". The second question, on the other hand, is posed by a 16-year-old individual who has not specified their gender and is asking if they can \\"gow\\" (which seems to be a typo for \\"grow\\") to 5'9\\". Although these differences exist in the questions, the core concern remains the same, which is the potential for growth in height during their teenage years. To address the question, it is still possible for both individuals to grow taller, as many people continue to grow in height until they are about 18-21 years old. However, it is important to note that height is largely determined by genetics, and there are no guarantees that they will achieve their desired height. Various factors can influence an individual's height, including: 1. Genetics: The genetic makeup inherited from one's parents is a key determinant of how tall a person is likely to become. If the majority of the family members are tall, then the likelihood of reaching a taller height could be higher. 2. Nutrition: A well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, and minerals is vital for growth. Proper nutrition during childhood and teenage years can significantly impact one's height. 3. Physical activity: Engaging in regular physical activities can help promote healthier bone growth and overall muscle development. Sports and exercises that focus on stretching, jumping, and resistance training can potentially enhance growth. 4. Hormones: Growth hormones play an essential role in determining an individual's height. Any imbalances or deficiencies in these hormones can impact growth, and in some cases, medical intervention may be needed. 5. Sleep: Adequate sleep is necessary for overall growth and development. Human growth hormones are released during sleep, so it's crucial to maintain a healthy sleep schedule. It's essential to remember that everyone grows at different rates, and there can be growth spurts even in later teenage years. While it may be possible for both the 17-year-old male and the 16-year-old individual to grow taller, ultimately, factors such as genetics, nutrition, and overall health will determine their final height. It is important to focus on maintaining a healthy lifestyle to ensure the best outcome and accept oneself for who they are, regardless of height."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What type of details about roy conrad can be gathered from the following bio?

On his journey he combines forces with a troll-turned-human, a fighter who's even gayer than he is and - last but not least - a luscious lady who doesn't really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras. Together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil Munkar where they'll participate in a warriors' tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements. Munkar is bald guy with half a spider's web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous.

The monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing, but it's undeniable entertainment if you're in an undemanding mood. I presume this isn't a favorite amongst feminists, as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat umdiscriminating. Most of the gals exclusively serve as eye-candy in the harem. They're allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud, but strictly forbidden to open their mouths.

Q:Information: - Flint corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"indurata\\"; also known as Indian corn or sometimes calico corn) is a variant of maize, the same species as common corn. Because each kernel has a hard outer layer to protect the soft endosperm, it is likened to being hard as flint; hence the name. - The Andropogoneae, sometimes called the sorghum tribe, are a large tribe of grasses (family Poaceae) with roughly 1,200 species in 90 genera, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical areas. They include such important crops as maize (corn), sugarcane, and sorghum. All species in this tribe use C carbon fixation, which makes them competitive under warm, high-light conditions. - Forage is plant material (mainly plant leaves and stems) eaten by grazing livestock. Historically, the term \\"forage\\" has meant only plants eaten by the animals directly as pasture, crop residue, or immature cereal crops, but it is also used more loosely to include similar plants cut for fodder and carried to the animals, especially as hay or silage. The term forage fish refers to small schooling fish that are preyed on by larger aquatic animals. - Dent corn also known as yellow dent corn, Reid's yellow dent corn, white dent corn, or field corn, is a variety of maize or corn with a high soft starch content. It received its name because of the small indentation (\\"dent\\") at the crown of each kernel on a ripe ear of corn. It is a variety developed by northern Illinois farmer James L. Reid. Reid and his father, Robert Reid, moved from Brown County, Ohio to Tazewell County, Illinois in 1846 bringing with them a red corn variety known as \\"Johnny Hopkins\\", and crossed it with varieties of flint corn and floury corn. Most of today's hybrid corn varieties and cultivars are derived from it. This variety won a prize at the 1893 World's Fair. - Panicoideae is the second - largest subfamily of the grasses with over 3,500 species , mainly distributed in warm temperate and tropical regions . It comprises some important agricultural crops , including sugarcane , maize ( or corn ) , sorghum , and switchgrass . C4 photosynthesis evolved independently a number of times in the subfamily , which presumably had a C3 ancestor . - Maize (; \\"Zea mays\\" subsp. \\"mays\\", from after Taíno \\"mahiz\\"), also known as corn, is a large grain plant first domesticated by indigenous peoples in Mexico about 10,000 years ago. The six major types of corn are dent corn, flint corn, pod corn, popcorn, flour corn, and sweet corn. - Sorghum is a genus of plants in the grass family. Seventeen of the twenty-five species are native to Australia, with the range of some extending to Africa, Asia, Mesoamerica, and certain islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. - Indigenous peoples, also known as first peoples, aboriginal peoples, native peoples, or autochthonous peoples, are ethnic groups who are descended from and identify with the original inhabitants of a given region, in contrast to groups that have settled, occupied or colonized the area more recently. Groups are usually described as indigenous when they maintain traditions or other aspects of an early culture that is associated with a given region. Not all indigenous peoples share such characteristics. Indigenous peoples may be settled in a given locale/region or exhibit a nomadic lifestyle across a large territory, but they are generally historically associated with a specific territory on which they depend. Indigenous societies are found in every inhabited climate zone and continent of the world. - Sugarcane, or sugar cane, are several species of tall perennial true grasses of the genus \\"Saccharum\\", tribe Andropogoneae, native to the warm temperate to tropical regions of South Asia and Melanesia, and used for sugar production. It has stout, jointed, fibrous stalks that are rich in the sugar sucrose, which accumulates in the stalk internodes. The plant is tall. All sugar cane species interbreed and the major commercial cultivars are complex hybrids. Sugarcane belongs to the grass family Poaceae, an economically important seed plant family that includes maize, wheat, rice, and sorghum, and many forage crops. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico. Covering almost two million square kilometers (over 760,000 sq mi), Mexico is the sixth largest country in the Americas by total area and the 13th largest independent nation in the world. With an estimated population of over 120 million, it is the eleventh most populous country and the most populous Spanish-speaking country in the world while being the second most populous country in Latin America. Mexico is a federation comprising 31 states and a federal district that is also its capital and most populous city. Other metropolises include Guadalajara, Monterrey, Puebla, Toluca, Tijuana and León. - Flour corn (\\"Zea mays\\" var. \\"amylacea\\") is a variety of corn with a soft starchy endosperm and a thin pericarp. It is primarily used to make corn flour. - Popcorn is a type of corn that expands from the kernel and puffs up when heated. Popcorn is able to pop like amaranth grain, sorghum, quinoa, and millet. When heated, pressure builds within the kernel, and a small explosion (or \\"pop\\") is the end result. Some strains of corn are now cultivated specifically as popping corns. - Sucrose is a common, naturally occurring saccharide found in many plants and plant parts. Saccharose is an obsolete name for sugars in general, especially sucrose. The molecule is a disaccharide combination of the monosaccharides glucose and fructose with the formula CHO. - Saccharum is a genus of tall perennial plants of the broomsedge tribe within the grass family. - Sweet corn (\\"Zea mays\\" convar. \\"saccharata\\" var. \\"rugosa\\"; also called sugar corn and pole corn) is a variety of maize with a high sugar content. Sweet corn is the result of a naturally occurring recessive mutation in the genes which control conversion of sugar to starch inside the endosperm of the corn kernel. Unlike field corn varieties, which are harvested when the kernels are dry and mature (dent stage), sweet corn is picked when immature (milk stage) and prepared and eaten as a vegetable, rather than a grain. Since the process of maturation involves converting sugar to starch, sweet corn stores poorly and must be eaten fresh, canned, or frozen, before the kernels become tough and starchy. History. Sweet corn occurs as a spontaneous mutation in field corn and was grown by several Native American tribes. The Iroquois gave the first recorded sweet corn (called 'Papoon') to European settlers in 1779. It soon became a popular food in southern and central regions of the United States. Open pollinated cultivars of white sweet corn started to become widely available in the United States in the 19th century. Two of the most enduring cultivars, still available today, are 'Country Gentleman' (a Shoepeg corn with small kernels in irregular rows) and 'Stowell's Evergreen'.

Russia wants the ability to censor the internet - but the U.S. plans to stonewall the plans at a U.N. conference later this year. Russia says it wants wants the right to block access where it is used for 'interfering in the internal affairs, or undermining the sovereignty,. national security, territorial integrity and public safety of other. states, or to divulge information of a sensitive nature'. The member nations of the United Nations will gather this December to create a treaty for the World Conference on International Telecommunications - and Russia has already made it clear which way it wants the internet to develop. Russian President Vladimir Putin has long called for a centralised control of the internet. Internet block: President Vladimir Putin, right, pictured taking part in a wreath laying ceremony this morning, wants centralised control of the web. The U.S. delegation has vowed to block any proposals from Russia and other countries that they. believe threaten the internet's current governing structure or give. tacit approval to online censorship. But those assurances have failed to ease fears that bureaucratic tinkering with the treaty could damage the world's most powerful engine for exchanging information, creating jobs and even launching revolutions. Examples of where the internet has acted as a voice for change include when social networks played a key role in the Arab Spring uprisings that last year upended regimes in Egypt and Tunisia. The wording of Russia's provision for the treaty allow a country to repress political opposition while citing a U.N. treaty as the basis for doing so. The provision also appears to contradict Article 19 of the U.N. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which says people shall have the right to access information 'through any media and regardless of frontiers.' An amended treaty would be binding on the United States if it is ratified by the Senate. But approval is not automatic. The treaty is sure to be scrutinised by lawmakers wary of its potential impact. The U.N.'s International Telecommunication Union, which oversees the treaty, does not operate like the U.N. Security Council, where the United States has the power to veto resolutions to which it objects. The ITU works on a consensus basis. Proposals can be stopped from serious consideration if enough countries voice their objections. A global concern: Protesters from the Anonymous India group in Mumbai of hackers wear Guy Fawkes masks as they protest against laws they say gives the government control over internet usage. More than 190 nations will attend the Dubai conference and the U.S. delegation is seeking support for its positions at the preparatory meetings that will continue until the conference convenes. 'It is important that when we have values, as we do in the area of free speech and the free flow of information, that we do everything that we can to articulate and sustain those values,' Philip Verveer, deputy assistant secretary of state and U.S. coordinator for international communications and information policy, said in an interview. The drafting and debating of proposals in preparation for the Dubai conference have taken place largely behind closed doors. Public interest groups have criticised the process and said it runs counter to development of sound public policy. In response to calls for transparency, two research fellows at George Mason University's Mercatus Center launched the website WCITLeaks.org earlier this month as a way to make documents that have been leaked to them by anonymous sources available publicly. The negotiations have sparked rumors that the U.N. and the ITU are plotting to take control of the Internet from the loose coalition of nongovernmental organizations that establishes Internet policies, standards and rules, they said. Tents and protesters during a sit-in against the delay of the Egyptian presidential results and the military rulers, today: Protesting would be much harder with a censored web. The ITU's secretary general, Hamadoun Toure, has called the takeover rumor 'ridiculous.' The ITU said the preparatory process is open to all member states as well as hundreds of private sector and academic organizations. The member states, not the ITU, determine the rules of participation and are free to share documents and information as they see fit, the agency said in an emailed statement. Several. lawmakers questioned Verveer, who also testified, and McDowell about. the relationship between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Toure, the. ITU's secretary general. Their. fear is that Putin, who long has pushed for centralised control of the. Internet, will use his allegedly close ties to Toure to accomplish that. goal. Toure, a native of. Mali, received advanced degrees in electronics and telecommunications. from universities in Moscow and Leningrad. 'Is. this relationship a concern?' asked Republican Rep. Greg Walden, the. subcommittee's chairman. 'What steps are we taking to be able to. counterbalance that relationship?' Verveer told Walden he has no doubts about Toure's honesty and fairness. But. McDowell struck a more ominous tone. Putin's 'designs' need to be taken. very seriously, he said, and urged proponents of Internet freedom to be. on guard for 'camouflaged subterfuge' that could threaten the. Internet's future. The treaty, known formally as the International Telecommunications Regulations, was developed in 1988 to deal with global telephone and telegraph systems that were often state-run. The conference in Dubai, which is being held by the ITU, will be the first time in 20 years that the treaty is being opened for revisions. Independent organizations, including the Internet Society, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers and the Worldwide Web Consortium, for years have served as the Internet's governing bodies. They handle core tasks like network and domain name administration and make decisions based on input from the public and private sectors. This system allows the Internet to evolve organically and rapidly to changes in technology, business practices and consumer behavior, according to open Internet advocates. Yet countries still grappling with how communications have been transformed by the Internet view the ITU and the treaty as the best avenues for plugging themselves into the global information economy. For developing nations that don't have an effective broadband infrastructure, bureaucratic and regulatory measures can allow them to benefit financially from the traffic that crosses their borders. But treaties are static instruments that often are unable to adapt and adjust to the fast pace of Internet innovation, said Sally Shipman Wentworth, senior manager for public policy at the nonprofit Internet Society. 'Further, we do not believe that we should simply take the 1988 regulatory model that applied to the old telephone system and apply it to the Internet,' she said. A proposal offered by a European association of telecommunications network operators would put pressure on content providers such as Google, Facebook and Netflix to offset the costs of delivering Internet traffic to end-users. Traffic increasingly includes bandwidth-hungry video, and the proposal from the European Telecommunications Network Operators' Association essentially argues that the investment needed to expand and improve the transfer of data should be borne by the operators and the content providers. Verveer called the proposal unworkable. and said it would have unintended consequences, such as blocking. Harvard, MIT and other universities from putting courses online at no. cost to users in places where access to education is already limited. 'If. it became necessary to pay in order to make these courses available,. they would predictably become less available, which would be very. unfortunate,' he said. The. threat to Internet freedom won't come in the form of a 'full-frontal. assault,' Roger McDowell, a Republican member of the Federal. Communications Commission, said at a congressional hearing last month,. 'but through insidious and seemingly innocuous expansions of. intergovernmental powers.' His warning resonated with members of the House Energy and Commerce communications and technology subcommittee.

His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \\"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ... Bass singer Jim Wetherington, known universally as the Big Chief, maintained a steady bottom, ceaselessly jiggling first his left leg, then his right, with the material of the pants leg ballooning out and shimmering. \\"He went about as far as you could go in gospel music,\\" said Jake Hess. \\"The women would jump up, just like they do for the pop shows.\\" Preachers frequently objected to the lewd movements ... but audiences reacted with screams and swoons. As a teenager, Presley's musical interests were wide-ranging, and he was deeply informed about both white and African-American musical idioms. Though he never had any formal training, he was blessed with a remarkable memory, and his musical knowledge was already considerable by the time he made his first professional recordings aged 19 in 1954. When Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller met him two years later, they were astonished at his encyclopedic understanding of the blues, and, as Stoller put it, \\"He certainly knew a lot more than we did about country music and gospel music.\\" At a press conference the following year, he proudly declared, \\"I know practically every religious song that's ever been written.\\" answer the following question: What is the full name of the band that preachers frequently objected?

However, their daring performance style didn't sit well with the preachers due to what they perceived as lewd movements. Despite the criticism, the Statesmen Quartet's influence certainly had a profound effect on young Elvis Presley, sowing seeds for his future stage act and contributing to his broad understanding of various musical idioms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The competitors in a race try to complete a given task in the shortest amount of time. Typically this involves traversing some distance, but it can be any other task involving speed to reach a specific goal. - An economy car is an automobile that is designed for low cost purchase and operation. Typical economy cars are small (compact or subcompact), lightweight, and inexpensive to buy. Economy car designers are forced by stringent design constraints to be inventive. Many innovations in automobile design were originally developed for economy cars, such as the Ford Model T and the Austin Mini. Gordon Murray, the Formula 1 and Mclaren F1 designer, said when designing his new Murray T.25 city car: \\"I would say that building a car to sell for six thousand pounds and designing that for a high volume production, where you have all the quality issues under control is a hundred times more difficult than designing a Mclaren F1, or even a racing car. It is certainly the biggest challenge I've ever had from a design point of view.\\" The alternative approach other than innovating to build a low cost car, is build a stripped down no frills version of a conventional car. - Walter Elias \\"Walt\\" Disney (December 5, 1901December 15, 1966) was an American entrepreneur, animator, voice actor and film producer.

Here is a detailed answer on how to break down the process of translation: 1. Analyzing the structure and content of the sentence: The given sentence is organized with the conjunction \\"but\\" at the beginning, followed by the main subject-verb-object structure that contains a dependent clause introduced by the word \\"that.\\" The sentence talks about the accumulation of results and the capacity of human beings to reach the truth. 2. Understanding the meaning and specifics of each word and phrase: - But: The sentence starts with a conjunction, which implies a contrast or contradiction to a previous statement or idea. In Russian, the word \\"но\\" serves the same function. - The sum: It refers to the collective total or accumulation of something; in this case, it is about the results achieved. The translation in Russian would be \\"сумма.\\" - Of the results achieved: This phrase describes the outcomes or consequences that have been attained through some effort or work. The appropriate translation in Russian would be \\"достигнутых результатов.\\" - Confirms: To assert or establish something as true or valid. The Russian translation would be \\"подтверждает.\\" - In principle: It means essentially or fundamentally. The equivalent expression in Russian would be \\"в принципе.\\" - The human being: It refers to any individual of the Homo sapiens species. The Russian translation is \\"человеческое существо.\\" - Can arrive at: It means to reach, achieve, or attain something. The verb phrase in Russian would be \\"может прийти к.\\" - The truth: It signifies an objective reality or fact. In Russian, the translation for truth would be \\"истине.\\" 3. Combining the translated words into a coherent Russian sentence structure: Forming a coherent and grammatically correct sentence from the translated words and phrases, we get: \\"Но сумма достигнутых результатов подтверждает, что в принципе человеческое существо может прийти к истине.\\" 4.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ugandans cast votes in presidential elections after lengthy delays Related: Ugandan elections: what you need to know After delays blamed on slow delivery of voting materials, Ugandans have begun casting their ballots in presidential elections. Five hours after voting was scheduled to start, some polling stations in the capital, Kampala,had still not received any voting papers. People had formed long lines and ballot boxes had arrived by mid-morning, but by noon there were still no ballots. President Yoweri Museveni faces a strong challenge from Kizza Besigye, who has called Museveni a dictator and said he doubted voting would be free or fair. Many people complained of an apparent shutdown of social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. Godfrey Mutabazi, head of the Uganda Communications Commission, said the network failure was probably caused by an ongoing operation to contain a security threat. “It’s a security matter and I cannot answer on behalf of security,” he said. Some observers suspected it was to keep people from publicly griping about the late delivery of voting materials. More than 15 million people are registered to vote for members of parliament and the presidency. Some ballot boxes had missing lids. “We are late simply because the lids for ballot boxes are not here. The boxes and the lids should have arrived at the same time,” said Moses Omo, an official presiding over voting at a Catholic church in the central Ugandan district of Wakiso. Many of those waiting said they would not leave without voting. “This is very disappointing, but I am going to stay here under the sun until it is my turn to vote,” said Fred Mubiru, a taxi driver. “Nothing will discourage me.” Although opinion polls had shown Museveni to be ahead of his opponents, analysts expect this election to be his toughest yet, citing the massive crowds Besigye attracted across the country. Museveni, 71, remains popular in some parts of rural Uganda, where he is seen as a father figure and is beloved by those who remember his time as a guerrilla leader fighting a dictatorship. He came to power in 1986 and pulled Uganda out of years of chaos. He is widely credited with restoring peace and presiding over economic growth, and is a key US ally on security matters, especially in Somalia. But his critics worry that he may want to rule for life, and accuse him of using the security forces to intimidate the opposition. Besigye, 59, is running for the fourth time against Museveni. He campaigned on a promise to run a more effective government, vowing to stem official corruption. He said he would continue “the struggle” in other ways if he lost the election, suggesting a protest movement similar to the one that followed the last election in 2011. That movement was violently put down by security forces. The New York-based Human Rights Watch said a weak “human rights situation seriously undermines the prospects of free and fair elections and the ability of Ugandans to exercise fundamental human rights such as free expression, assembly, and association”. The Committee to Protect Journalists has also reported “a worsening pattern of harassment and intimidation of journalists” in Uganda. There has been a heavy security presence in Kampala in the run-up to the polls, with armed police patrolling the streets and armoured vehicles stationed at key junctions. Summary:","completion":"People in Uganda have started voting for a new president after there were some delays. The people who are voting have to choose who they want to be their leader. The current president, Yoweri Museveni, and another man named Kizza Besigye, are both trying to become the president.

Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

Sentence: Bionico is a dessert that requires granola as one of its ingredients. Honey can also be added to it. What data can be extracted from this sentence?","completion":"Several pieces of data can be extracted from the given sentence, providing information about the dessert Bionico and its ingredients. 1. Name of the dessert: Bionico It mentions that the focus is on a particular dessert known as Bionico. 2. Bionico is a dessert The sentence establishes that Bionico belongs to the category of desserts. This means it is a sweet dish typically served at the end of a meal or as a snack. 3. Requirement of granola as an ingredient The sentence states that granola is a required ingredient for making Bionico. Granola is a breakfast food and snack made from rolled oats, nuts, and a sweetener such as honey or sugar, often baked until crisp. This suggests that Bionico includes crunchy and possibly nutritious elements in its composition. 4. Honey as a potential added ingredient The sentence mentions that honey can be added to Bionico, implying that it is an optional ingredient. Some Bionico recipes may include honey, while others may not. Honey is a natural sweetener and has various health benefits, so its addition to the dessert may serve both taste and health purposes. 5. Inclusion of multiple ingredients Bionico is a dessert made with more than one ingredient. It is evident from the mentioned use of granola and optionally honey. The sentence suggests a diverse range of tastes and textures within the dessert. 6. Recipe modification The information allows us to understand that Bionico's recipe can be altered depending on the cook's preferences. The addition of honey or the type of granola used can vary, contributing to the uniqueness of each Bionico dessert created. To summarize, from the given sentence, we can extract data on the dessert's name (Bionico), the fact it's a dessert, granola being a required ingredient, the potential addition of honey, the involvement of multiple ingredients, and the possibility of recipe modification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the first name of the person who documented the poaching of buffalo, deer, elk, and antelope for hides? Answer the above question based on the context below: There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection. This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park.

Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. Youll use fewer resources and save money. Buy only what you need.

For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. A lot of resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances.

Because these items last longer, we don't need to buy new ones very often. So, it's like using fewer toys because your strong, long-lasting toys don't get broken.

Which one of the following options would the answer to this be?","completion":"The British TV series that inspired \\"All in the Family\\" is \\"Till Death Us Do Part.\\" \\"Till Death Us Do Part\\" was a prominent and widely watched program in the UK, which aired on BBC1 from 1965 to 1975. This sitcom was heralded for its raw and controversial approach to dealing with social and political issues of the time, just like its American counterpart later would. The British show was created by Johnny Speight and centered around the character Alf Garnett, an unabashed conservative played by Warren Mitchell. Alf frequently argued with his left-wing son-in-law, Mike, giving the series its central conflict. Much of the political and social commentary from the show came from these two characters’ back-and-forths, with Alf's wife Else and daughter Rita often caught in the middle. \\"All in the Family,\\" the American remake, similarly focuses on the life of Archie Bunker (a character analogous to Alf Garnett), a working-class bigot who constantly battles with his son-in-law, Mike “Meathead” Stivic over themes such as racism, feminism, and other topical issues. The show was broadcast on CBS from 1971 to 1979 and was created by producer Norman Lear. Just like its British predecessor, \\"All in the Family\\" was a groundbreaking show which didn't shy away from addressing pressing societal issues, using humor as a vehicle to present and grapple with these themes. The character of Archie Bunker, played by Carroll O'Connor, became a cultural icon, while the show itself effectively pioneered the genre of the socially-conscious sitcom in American television. It maintained high rankings in the Nielsen ratings, being the number one-rated show for five years, from 1971–1972 to 1975–1976. Despite being borne out of contentious and provocative subject matter, both shows were important for their respective cultures and have left a significant legacy on sitcoms that followed them. They broke away from the perception of sitcoms as purely escapist entertainment and demonstrated the genre’s ability to tackle societal issues head-on, opening the door for many similar shows that came after them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the given context, it is only mentioned that five people died in the accident and the remaining people sustained injuries.

Pick your answer from: - no; - yes; The answer is:","completion":"no. Before dissecting these questions, it is important to understand the context behind them. Both queries revolve around daily activities involving sardine consumption and some form of physical exercise. However, there are differences in the specifics of each scenario posed. The first question, \\"If I ate a can of sardines everyday and ran for an hour, would this make me lose weight fast?\\" addresses the possibility of rapid weight loss from the combination of eating a can of sardines every day and running for an hour daily. This involves a particular amount of time set for running – an hour, which might translate to different distances covered daily depending on the individual's speed. The second question, \\"What would happen if I ate a can of sardines and jogged two miles everyday?\\", on the other hand, queries the potential outcome from consuming a can of sardines each day and jogging a defined distance – two miles. Here, the focus is on a specific distance rather than a set duration for jogging. So while both questions involve the same kind of diet (eating a can of sardines daily) and exercise, they differ in the parameters of the exercise: one defines the exercise by time (an hour) while the other does so by distance (two miles). These differences in the parameters can impact the total caloric burn, intensity of the exercise, and overall exertion on the body, thereby affecting the ultimate outcome in terms of weight loss, body composition, fitness levels, etc. Therefore, these questions cannot be considered identical. Additionally, the first statement is specifically asking about the speed of weight loss as a consequence of these actions, while the second question is more general and open-ended about what could potentially happen, not exclusively pertaining to weight loss nor its speed. In conclusion, these differences make the two questions distinct from each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The Irish traditionally wear something coloured green on this day as the colour is connected with Ireland. Another St Patrick's Day tradition is for the non-Irish to make jokes about the Irish. Usually these jokes will be about Irish stupidity or their famous thirst for alcohol, or their reputation for telling tall(untrue) stories. These characteristics are all part of the famous Irish stereotype that Irishman are hot-tempered drinkers, who love to fight and will do anything to avoid a day's work. The real joke, however, is that this negative Irish stereotype still exists. The stereotype might have had some truth back in the 19th century when Irish was poverty-stricken and starving. Many Irish moved to the United States to escape famine , but there they had to compete, occasionally with their fists, for jobs and housing with other immigrant groups. It was on America's streets that the Irish earned their reputation for street fighting. However, it was far from truth today, with the exception of the drinking perhaps. Today, the Irish are admired for their story telling gifts and musical talents. It is no accident that several of the greatest writers of the 20th century were Irish. Or that many of today's most popular music groups such as singer Enya and rock band U2, are Irish born and growing. Lonely Planet readers even ranked Ireland as the friendliest country in the world.

All day people were uploading selfies of themselves on Twitter from as close as possible to where the hostage siege was taking place. Just to make the photos more authentic some even took them with television cameras in the background. Two onlookers even looked like they were taking a 'celebration selfie' than one at a hostage siege. Others smiled happily as if they were standing in front of Sydney Opera House instead of a chilling hostage crisis that could yet end in tragedy. Scroll down for video. This twitter user gets a television camera crew in the background to make it look more real. The hostage siege has been going since 10am on Monday with as many as 30 people believed to be held against their will by a gunman in a central Sydney cafe. Not that it stopped people taking selfies in the area. However, the thoughtless actions have created a huge backlash on Twitter, with many users berating the people for putting up the tasteless selfies. One person wrote: 'Awful, do they not have any feelings. People are being held hostage and all they can do is take a selfie.' 'I love a selfie, but how is this ok?,' said another. These two onlookers look like they are taking a 'celebration selfie' than one at a hostage siege. This man couldn't contain his happiness at taking a selfie near where the hostage crisis was taking place. These three men also looked pleased to be in Martin Place despite the chilling circumstances. 'Don't go home and hug your loved ones and be grateful that you're not caught up in a hostage nightmare… go to the scene and take a selfie,' one Twitter user wrote. While another sarcastically remarked: 'Just hangin out at a dangerous hostage crisis, think I'll stop and take a selfie, with a smile of course.' It's unlikely the inappropriate pictures will be taken down from these accounts no matter how the hostage crisis ends. This selfie fan couldn't resist taking a picture of himself at the hostage scene. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"People were taking selfies near a hostage situation in Sydney.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: Mary Christine Brockert (March 5, 1956 - December 26, 2010), better known by her stage name Teena Marie, was an American singer-songwriter, and producer. She was known by her childhood nickname Tina before taking the stage name Teena Marie and later acquired the nickname Lady Tee (sometimes spelled Lady T), given to her by her collaborator and friend, Rick James. She was known for her distinctive soulful vocals, which caused many listeners to believe she was African-American. Her success in R&B and soul music, and loyalty to these genres would earn her the title Ivory Queen of Soul. Context: Contacted by Epic Records in the fall of 1982, after expressing dismay over her Motown contract, Teena Marie signed a worldwide deal with the Columbia Records subsidiary that also allowed her to establish her own publishing company, Midnight Magnet. Epic released the concept album Robbery, which featured the hit \\"Fix It\\" (#21 R&B), as well as \\"Shadow Boxing\\" and \\"Casanova Brown.\\" (The latter was one of many tracks Teena Marie would write over the years about her real-life romance with one-time mentor Rick James. The relationship had ended by that point, but the two continued a sometimes tempestuous friendship until James' death, in August 2004.) In 1984, Teena Marie released her biggest-selling album, Starchild. It yielded her biggest hit \\"Lovergirl\\", which peaked at No. 4 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 chart in March 1985 and at No. 9 on the R&B chart. The label also released the moderate R&B hit \\"Out on a Limb\\", which peaked at No. 56 on the R&B chart but didn't break the Hot 100. \\"14k\\" was featured on the soundtrack of the film The Goonies (1985) but was not a hit (only making the U.S. R&B charts at #87). In 1986, Teena Marie released a rock music-influenced concept album titled Emerald City. It was controversial with her established fan base and not as successful as its predecessors. She also recorded the rock-influenced track, \\"Lead Me On\\", co-produced by Giorgio Moroder, for the soundtrack of the box office hit film Top Gun (1986). In 1988, she returned to R&B and funk, releasing the critically acclaimed album Naked to the World. That album contained the hit \\"Ooo La La La\\", which reached the top of Billboard's Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Singles & Tracks chart and was her only No. 1 single on that chart. During her 1988 Naked to the World concert tour, she suffered a fall and was hospitalized for six months. Teena Marie released Ivory in the fall of 1990; it scored no pop hits, but it did experience two R&B hits: \\"Here's Looking at You\\" (#11 R&B) and \\"If I Were a Bell\\" (#8 R&B). Question: Most famous person she worked with?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The most famous person Teena Marie worked with was Rick James. Apart from being her collaborator and friend, Rick James was also her one-time mentor and helped establish her career. Their real-life romantic relationship inspired several songs throughout Teena Marie's career. Even after their relationship ended, they continued to maintain a sometimes tempestuous friendship until Rick James' death in August 2004."},{"prompt":"Information: - Acipenser is a genus of sturgeons. With 17 species, many of which are threatened, it is the largest genus in the order Acipenseriformes. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia. It contains two species, which both are critically endangered: - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean. - Scaphirhynchinae is a subfamily of sturgeon which includes two genera comprising a total of six species .

Please answer the following question: In a race with national implications, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in a very close special congressional election held Tuesday in Pennsylvania. Officially, the race has not been called for Lamb, who holds a lead of 627 votes over Republican candidate Rick Saccone, a strong supporter of President Donald Trump. It’s possible Saccone and his supporters may request a recount, given the close vote. Even though Lamb’s apparent victory is narrow, the Pennsylvania result could broaden implications for Republicans looking to defend their congressional majorities in the House of Representatives and Senate in the November midterm elections. Lamb ran surprisingly strong in a district that Trump carried by nearly 20 points, campaigning as a moderate Democrat. “We fought to find common ground, and we found it, almost everywhere. Democrats, Republicans, independents — each of us, Americans,” Lamb told supporters early Wednesday. Saccone was not ready to concede the race. “We are going to fight all the way to the end. You know I never give up.” The Pennsylvania race follows Democratic victories late last year in Virginia and Alabama, fueled in large part by what some analysts see as an anti-Trump theme that continues to build. “The opposition to Donald Trump is as intense as I have seen since the last year of [Richard] Nixon’s presidency,\\" said University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato via Skype. “It is so intense, it is so hot, that it could result in a much bigger turnover than we think in the midterm elections to the Democrats and away from the Republicans.” Saccone cast himself as the president’s “wingman,” and Trump campaigned on his behalf at a rally last Saturday when Trump urged Republicans to get out and vote. “We want to keep the agenda, the make America great, going. You have got to get him in. This is a very important race,” Trump said. Democrats were thrilled with the result, while some Republicans saw the race as a “wake-up” call for what could be a devastating midterm in November. What is probably true about Rick Saccone? A. He hoped more republicans had come out to vote for him B. not enough information C. He wanted a recount D. He was not ready to concede the race A:","completion":"D.

Dame Jane Morris Goodall (; born Valerie Jane Morris-Goodall, 3 April 1934), formerly Baroness Jane van Lawick-Goodall, is a British primatologist and anthropologist. Goodall had always been passionate about animals and Africa, which brought her to the farm of a friend in the Kenya highlands in 1957. From there, she obtained work as a secretary, and acting on her friend's advice, she telephoned Louis Leakey, the notable Kenyan archaeologist and palaeontologist, with no other thought than to make an appointment to discuss animals. Leakey, believing that the study of existing great apes could provide indications of the behaviour of early hominids, was looking for a chimpanzee researcher, though he kept the idea to himself. Instead, he proposed that Goodall work for him as a secretary. After obtaining approval from his wife Mary Leakey, Louis sent Goodall to Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania, where he laid out his plans. In 1958, Leakey sent Goodall to London to study primate behaviour with Osman Hill and primate anatomy with John Napier. Leakey raised funds, and on 14 July 1960, Goodall went to Gombe Stream National Park, becoming the first of what would come to be called The Trimates. She was accompanied by her mother, whose presence was necessary to satisfy the requirements of David Anstey, chief warden, who was concerned for their safety; Tanzania was \\"Tanganyika\\" at that time and a British protectorate. Leakey arranged funding and in 1962, he sent Goodall, who had no degree, to Cambridge University. She went to Newnham College, and obtained a PhD degree in ethology. She became the eighth person to be allowed to study for a PhD there without first having obtained a BA or BSc.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: This may sound extremely obvious, but it's nonetheless worthwhile to make sure you're already running as fast as you can. This is especially pertinent for PC users, as the Caps Lock button can mean the difference between walking and running. Keeping the Caps Lock button activated should keep you running while you're using the directional keys. For console systems, ensuring you're pushing the control stick as far as it can go will maximize your speed. Again, this may sound painfully obvious, but there are rare cases where a controller may not be working to one's complete satisfaction. While it doesn't necessarily affect your real speed, if you're trying to run somewhere fast, you should pay attention to the smartest way to get there. Running up steep surfaces won't get you somewhere nearly as fast as smooth pavement. Outside of Washington DC, Fallout 3's open world is generally pretty easy to navigate, so try to make the most direct route to wherever you're going. At the same time, you should take care to avoid enemy-heavy areas; if you're trying to move as efficiently as possible, getting into fights will only serve to slow you down. As is true for all Bethesda RPGs, the type of armour you wear will have a notable effect on your movement speed. A light armour, like leather armour, will keep you moving briskly. Better still, you can go without armour completely for maximum speed. Also keep in mind that armour tends to have a big weight associated with it. Not only will wearing a heavy armour slow you down, the weight attached will bog down your weight capacity considerably. On the other hand, some sets of armour like Power Armour come with a Strength bonus, which in turn will help boost your weight capacity. One of the most common speed-related complaints in Fallout 3 is the speed penalty you get from carrying too much equipment. If you're finding your speed bogged down, try dropping or selling some of your supplies. Before too long, you should find your character running at a better rate. Aim to discard junk items and extra sets of armour, as they tend to be the heaviest items in the game. Your character will be slowed down naturally if you have any weapons out. Try to make a habit of holstering your weapons whenever you're not using them. A hefty portion of the game's not going to require constant use of weapons, so while you might want that extra bit of caution, in most cases it's unnecessary. You can holster your weapon by holding the Reload button. Keep in mind that two-handed weapons (e.g. rifles, flamethrowers) will slow you down more than one-handed weapons, like pistols. If you're still worried about downtime while you're drawing a weapon, you can get the Quick Draw perk, which will make the holster/draw process 50% faster.

Question 1: An IP address is a set of numbers that helps identify a device on the internet, kind of like a home address for your computer or phone. Some people might use this information to understand where that device is located, or to make sure it can connect to certain websites. But, it's important to remember we should always respect other people's privacy and not use their IP address in a not-so-nice way. Question 2: People eat insects for many reasons! In some cultures, they see it as a yummy snack, or even a special treat. Insects can also be a good source of protein, which helps us grow strong and healthy. Plus, eating insects might be better for our planet, since raising insects can be more environmentally friendly than other methods of producing food.

After receiving an unexpected phone call that she has won a spot to participate on a television game show, she becomes obsessed with regaining the youthful appearance she possesses in an old photograph. To reach her goal, she goes to a doctor to discuss weight loss. The doctor gives her a prescription for weight-loss amphetamine pills throughout the day and a sedative at night. As the months go by, Sara's tolerance for the pills adjusts and as a result she is no longer able to feel the same high the pills once gave her. When her invitation does not arrive, she increases her dosage from double to triple and, as a result, begins to suffer from amphetamine psychosis. Meanwhile, Sara's son Harry is young and has an adventurous life with his girlfriend Marion Silver and best friend Tyrone C. Love. He and his friends are all heroin addicts, and Harry funds his habit through petty theft, including from his own mother who turns a blind eye. Tyrone decides that to support themselves, they should enter the illegal drug trade around Coney Island. With the promised money, each addict hopes to achieve their dreams. At first, the trio's drug dealing business thrives. However, Tyrone is imprisoned after fleeing the scene of a drug-gang assassination and Harry uses most of their earned money to post bail. After the assassination, the three find it much more difficult to find heroin due to supply being restricted by the Florida-based wholesalers. Eventually, Tyrone hears that the wholesaler is making a shipment, but the price is doubled and the minimum amount is high. Harry suggests that Marion ask for the needed cash from her psychiatrist in exchange for sex, which she does begrudgingly, and at a cost to her relationship with Harry.

Sırbistan şeker rafinelerinin özelleştirilmesinin ardından basın tarafından eleştirilen Kostiç şöyle diyor: \\"Tamamlanan özelleştirmelerin sürekli olarak denetlenmesi iyi bir şey değil. Translate this to English?","completion":"Following the privatization of Serbian sugar refineries, Kostić, who has been criticized by the press, says: \\"The continuous monitoring of completed privatizations is not a good thing.\\" In this statement, Kostić seems to be responding to criticisms from the press about the privatization of Serbia's sugar refineries. These criticisms might be related to concerns about a lack of transparency, the influence of private interests, or the potential negative impact on local economies and communities. However, Kostić argues that constantly monitoring the privatization process after it has been completed is not beneficial. One reason Kostić might believe continuous monitoring is not a good idea could be that it may create an environment of uncertainty for investors, which in turn could hinder the growth and development of privatized industries. Instead, he might prefer a more hands-off approach from the authorities after privatization has taken place, allowing the market and private actors to determine the future course of the industry without undue interference from the public sector. Moreover, Kostić might think that criticisms from the press are exaggerated or unfounded, and that the privatization of sugar refineries has led to positive outcomes, such as increased efficiency, better resource allocation, and a more competitive market. In this context, Kostić may believe that the press should focus more on these positive aspects and devote less attention to scrutinizing the privatization process after it is completed. This could help create a more conducive environment for foreign investment and private sector growth in Serbia. On the other hand, the press and other critics might argue that continuous monitoring is necessary to ensure that privatized industries are operating in a fair and transparent manner, and that they are meeting their obligations to local communities and the environment. In their view, leaving privatized industries entirely to market forces could result in negative consequences, such as job losses, income inequality, and environmental degradation. In summary, Kostić's statement highlights a broader debate about the benefits and drawbacks of privatization, as well as the appropriate level of public oversight and scrutiny following the privatization process. While Kostić believes that continuous monitoring of completed privatizations is not a good idea, others may hold different views about the role of public authorities and the press in ensuring fair and responsible private sector operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What story did Roy begin to tell Alexandria? Movie title: The Fall Movie plot: Los Angeles, 1915: stuntman Roy Walker (Lee Pace) is hospitalized, as he is bedridden and possibly paralyzed after a jump he took in his first film. He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy so that he can attempt suicide; a choice driven by his love leaving him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\". The stories become a collaborative tale to which Alexandria also contributes. Alexandria herself becomes a character: while Roy is the masked bandit, she is his daughter. Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all. The next morning, Roy awakens from his sleep and realizes he is only alive because his neighboring patient is receiving a placebo rather than actual morphine. Alexandria, desperate to help Roy, sneaks out of bed to the pharmacy.... A:","completion":"The story that Roy begins to tell Alexandria in the movie \\"The Fall\\" is about her namesake.

Ai Kago (Jia Hu Ya Yi , Kago Ai), born February 7, 1988 in Yamatotokada, Nara, Japan, is a Japanese singer, actress, author, and former Guinness World Record holder. Kago began her career at the age of 12 as a member of the idol group Morning Musume. In the same year, she became a founding member of Minimoni. Throughout the second half of 2010, Kago became unhappy with the direction of her work. Around the same time, she began dating restaurant owner Haruhiko Ando, who acted as an in-between for her agency and herself. Since beginning a relationship with Ando, Kago cancelled several jobs at the last minute, causing her agency to suspend her activities. Despite this, she participated in a live performance and opened a separate blog without permission. Kago parted ways with R&A Promotions in November 2010 despite her contract ending in March 2013. As a response, in 2011, Kazuyuki Ito, president of Mainstream (an associate of R&A Promotions), declared that the agency planned on suing for 100 million yen in damages for contract violations. During that time, Kago's career was also derailed by her personal life. In September 2011, Ando was arrested for alleged extortion and claiming to have connections with the yakuza. In the same month, Kago was rushed to a nearby hospital after agency officials found her on the floor of her apartment with cuts to her wrists. Her life was reported to be not in danger, though there were speculations that it was a planned suicide. Following the incident, she and Ando registered their marriage, and Kago became pregnant. After spending 2012 out of the public eye with the birth of her daughter, Minami, Kago transferred to a new agency in 2013. Planning to revive her music career, she formed an idol group, which was later named Girls Beat!! The group would be crowd-sourced using lyrics, music, and costume ideas submitted by fans. Remi Kita and Ryona Himeno were recruited as the other two members after passing the auditions. Girls Beat!! released their first single, \\"Sekai Seifuku\\" on July 22, 2014. Their activities were abruptly put on hold when an arrest warrant was put out for Ando in October on suspicions of loaning money at illegal interest rates. Kago later filed for divorce, planning to continue activities once the divorce was finalized. Although Kago was eventually successful in doing so, in August 2015, her contract with her agency expired, though she continued activities with Girls Beat!! in November.

The two accept the assignment because the money is good, even though they disbelieve her story. Late that night, police detective Tom Polhaus (J.

And they delivered a diplomatic bonbon. The three officials told South Korea that Pyongyang is willing to hold a new round of high-level meetings between late October and early November, South Korea's Unification Ministry said in a statement Saturday. \\"Within my memory...there was never ever such a high-level visit. Never,\\" said North Korea analyst Andrei Lankov, from Seoul's Kookmin University. Lankov said two of the three visitors \\"are essentially number two and number three in North Korean official hierarchy.\\" The visit and offer for high-level dialogue come as a surprise for many who believed that the tensions between the two countries would further escalate, particularly due to Kim Jong Un's absence. The three high-ranking North Korean officials, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Yang Gon, and Hwang Pyong So, met with South Korea's National Security Adviser, Kim Kwan-jin, and Unification Minister, Ryoo Kihl-jae, expressing their intentions for resuming inter-Korean talks. In response to the North's offer for high-level meetings, South Korea has cautiously welcomed the proposal and urged Pyongyang to commit to denuclearization before engaging in further talks. \\"We have consistently maintained that the door for dialogue and communications is open… However, the North should show its sincerity in pursuing denuclearization through concrete actions,\\" said South Korean Unification Ministry spokesperson, Lim Byeong Cheol. As the proposed meetings would mark a major shift in diplomatic relations between the two Koreas, regional and global powers are closely monitoring the situation. The United States, which has been involved in previous Six-Party Talks aimed at North Korea's denuclearization, has expressed support for the inter-Korean dialogue while emphasizing the importance of North Korea taking denuclearization seriously. In the meantime, the unprecedented visit has stirred speculations about North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's health and whereabouts. North Korean state media reported that Kim Jong Un had been suffering from \\"discomfort\\" and showed images of him walking with a limp. Analysts are discussing how Kim's health issues and his prolonged absence from public life might impact the current power dynamics within North Korea and potentially affect the planned high-level talks. Should the high-level meetings go ahead as proposed, the topics of discussion are expected to include denuclearization efforts, the reunion of separated families, and the reestablishment of economic cooperation between the two Koreas. Experts have stressed the importance of engaging diplomatically with North Korea, rather than relying exclusively on sanctions and isolation, as this may help create a more conducive environment for advancing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. However, these developments come with cautious optimism. The history of inter-Korean talks has seen numerous setbacks and failed agreements. The most recent high-level talks, held in February 2014, resulted in a planned reunion of separated families but little progress on other pressing issues. Nevertheless, the prospect of renewed inter-Korean dialogue marks a significant step forward and could potentially pave the way for improving relations between the two Koreas and a gradually more stable and peaceful Korean Peninsula."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Diane Blair was one of them. Throughout much of Bill Clinton's eight years in the White House, Blair -- a political science professor and longtime Clinton friend -- exchanged political and humor cartoons with the first lady. Nothing, it seemed, was too small or inconsequential to send back and forth. In May 1996, Hillary Clinton clipped a \\"Mixed Media\\" cartoon and sent it to Blair and her husband, Jim, with a note that read, \\"It is rare that I can send you a comic strip you and Jim haven't seen -- but this one is too good not to share.\\"","completion":"The cartoon, clearly inspired by the current political climate, depicted a satirical view of Washington D.C.

Given the fact that: The surface is heated by the Sun and some of that heat radiates back into the air. This makes the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes. Answer the question: Devon's cat, Fluffy, is looking for a nice warm spot to lay out in the sun. Because of how the sun heats the earth, and how some heat radiates into the air, the cat laying on the ground, rather than high up in a tree branch, would keep the cat cooler or warmer? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Given the fact that the surface is heated by the Sun and some of that heat radiates back into the air, making the temperature higher near the surface than at higher altitudes, Fluffy the cat laying on the ground would likely be warmer than if she were high up in a tree branch. Step 1: Understand the relationship between solar heating and temperature. The Sun heats the Earth's surface, and some of the heat is radiated back into the air. This causes a temperature gradient with height, with higher temperatures near the surface and cooler temperatures at higher altitudes. Step 2: Determine location preferences for the cat. Fluffy is seeking a warm spot to lay in the sun. As the temperature is generally higher near the surface, she would prefer to be closer to the ground for maximum warmth. Step 3: Compare surface temperature to higher altitudes. The temperature near the surface is generally higher than temperatures at higher altitudes. Since Fluffy wants to find a warm spot, being closer to the ground with higher temperatures would be preferred compared to being in a tree branch at a higher altitude where it would be cooler.

Sentence from a movie review: , really stupid Was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review?","completion":"Based on the sentence provided from the movie review, which states \\", really stupid,\\" it can be inferred that the movie was seen negatively by the reviewer. The use of the term \\"really stupid\\" implies a strong disdain or lack of appreciation for the content, plot, or overall quality of the film. When assessing a movie review, it is important to consider the language and tone employed by the reviewer. In this case, the phrase \\"really stupid\\" is an indicator that the reviewer had a negative experience while watching the movie. This perspective could have stemmed from a range of factors, such as poor acting, an uninteresting story, illogical plot developments, or issues with production aspects like visual effects or sound quality. It is crucial, however, to recognize that a single sentence from a movie review might not provide the complete picture of a reviewer's opinions. A longer excerpt or the full review would offer more context to understand whether the negativity expressed in the sentence is pervasive throughout the review or if there are any redeeming qualities mentioned. Additionally, it is always helpful to read multiple reviews from different sources to gain a comprehensive understanding of how a movie is being received by critics and the general public alike. In conclusion, based on the sentence provided, the movie was seen negatively by this particular reviewer. While this may give an indication of the overall sentiment towards the movie, it is essential to examine additional reviews and context to form a well-rounded opinion about the film's reception."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Prevents the marginalisation of non-believers Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"To prevent the marginalisation of non-believers, it is necessary to present evidence that showcases the benefits of avoiding discrimination based on religious beliefs or the absence thereof. Several studies, initiatives, and examples demonstrate that fostering an inclusive environment for both believers and non-believers alike can lead to more harmonious communities and a stronger framework for human rights and equality. 1. Legal Frameworks and Policies: Laws such as the United States' First Amendment and the European Convention on Human Rights protect an individual's freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, which also extends to non-believers. Upholding these laws can reduce instances of discrimination and marginalisation. For example, in the 2014 case of Town of Greece v. Galloway, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to allow non-believers to lead prayers at public meetings as long as a policy of nondiscrimination is followed, demonstrating the voice given to non-believers in the legal process. 2. Human Rights Reports: International human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented instances of discrimination against non-believers around the world. By drawing attention to these cases, these organizations are working towards preventing marginalisation and advocating for equal rights for all, regardless of religious beliefs or lack thereof. 3. Educational Programs: Several studies have shown that education can positively impact tolerance and acceptance of diverse beliefs. Implementing comprehensive religious education programs that include discussions on atheism, agnosticism, and secularism can foster understanding and respect for non-believers by debunking misconceptions and stereotypes. 4. Interfaith and Secular Organizations: Groups such as the Interfaith Youth Core, the Parliament of the World's Religions, and the Secular Student Alliance work to promote cooperation and understanding among people of different faiths or no faith at all. By emphasizing the value of dialogue, these organizations help to reduce the marginalisation of non-believers and create more inclusive environments in schools, workplaces, and communities. 5. Public Opinions and Surveys: Surveys conducted by organizations such as the Pew Research Center show a growing acceptance of non-religious individuals within society. For instance, a 2019 Pew study indicated that 65% of Americans said it was not necessary to believe in God to be moral and have good values, representing a shift in public opinion that can contribute to reducing discrimination against non-believers. 6. Media Representation: Increasing positive media representation of non-believers in literature, film, and television can help to dispel negative stereotypes and validate their experiences as valuable members of society. Examples include popular television series like \\"The Big Bang Theory\\" and \\"House M.D.\\", where non-believing characters are shown as intelligent, empathetic, and well-rounded members of their respective communities. 7. Personal Testimonies: Sharing personal narratives of non-believers on platforms such as blogs, podcasts, and public speaking events can humanize individuals who do not subscribe to religious beliefs and contribute to breaking down barriers between believers and non-believers. These firsthand accounts can assist in fostering empathy and promoting inclusivity among diverse groups. 8. Anti-discrimination Laws: Some countries, such as the United Kingdom, have specific anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on religious beliefs, including lack of religious beliefs. By enforcing these laws, governments can ensure equal treatment for non-believers and, over time, contribute to the normalization and acceptance of non-religious individuals in society. In conclusion, preventing the marginalisation of non-believers is possible through legal frameworks, human rights advocacy, educational initiatives, interfaith and secular organizations, public opinion shifts, media representation, personal testimonies, and anti-discrimination laws. These elements provide evidence that promoting inclusivity for people with different beliefs or no beliefs at all can lead to more harmonious societies and stronger human rights protection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To figure out your skin type, first wash and dry your face and wait an hour. Then, note how dry or oily your skin is. A more detailed guide can be found here. Once you know your skin type, there are a few basic categories into which your skin will likely fall. Most skin will range from ‘oily’ to ‘dry,’ with ‘normal’ between the two. The other two main categories are ‘sensitive’ and ‘mature.’ Moisturizers for dry skin are generally petroleum or oil-based. Oily skin calls for a water-based moisturizer. It should also be noncomedogenic to prevent your pores from clogging. Normal skin also needs a water-based moisturizer, but one which contains some oils, though much less than dry skin needs. Sensitive skin needs a moisturizer with medicinal or soothing properties. Look for moisturizers with chamomile or aloe, but stay away from those with fragrances, dyes, or acids. For older mature skin, you should look for a petroleum-based moisturizer rich in oils. There are many moisturizers on the market designed for mature skin that contain ingredients to help reduce wrinkles as well. Try out body butter for a natural, oil-based option.

Camille Anna Paglia (; born April 2, 1947) is an American academic and social critic. Paglia has been a professor at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, since 1984. Paglia is critical of many aspects of modern culture, and is the author of Sexual Personae: Art and Decadence from Nefertiti to Emily Dickinson (1990) and other books. Paglia was born in Endicott, New York, the eldest child of Pasquale and Lydia Anne (nee Colapietro) Paglia. All four of her grandparents were born in Italy. Her mother immigrated to the United States at five years old from Ceccano, in the province of Frosinone, Lazio, Italy. Additionally, Paglia has stated that her father's side of the family were from the Campanian towns of Avellino, Benevento, and Caserta. Paglia attended primary school in rural Oxford, New York, where her family lived in a working farmhouse. Her father, a veteran of World War II, taught at the Oxford Academy high school, and exposed his young daughter to art through books he brought home about French art history. In 1957, her family moved to Syracuse, New York, so that her father could begin graduate school; he eventually became a professor of Romance languages at Le Moyne College. She attended the Edward Smith Elementary School, T. Aaron Levy Junior High and William Nottingham High School. In 1992 Carmelia Metosh, her Latin teacher for three years, said, \\"She always has been controversial. Whatever statements were being made (in class), she had to challenge them. She made good points then, as she does now.\\" Paglia thanked Metosh in the acknowledgements to Sexual Personae, later describing her as \\"the dragon lady of Latin studies, who breathed fire at principals and school boards\\". She took a variety of names when she was at Spruce Ridge Camp, including Anastasia (her confirmation name, inspired by the film Anastasia starring Ingrid Bergman), Stacy, and Stanley. A crucially significant event for her was when an outhouse exploded after she poured too much lime into the latrine. \\"That symbolized everything I would do with my life and work. Excess and extravagance and explosiveness. I would be someone who would look into the latrine of culture, into pornography and crime and psychopathology... and I would drop the bomb into it\\". For more than a decade, Paglia was the partner of artist Alison Maddex. Paglia legally adopted Maddex's son (who was born in 2002). In 2007 the couple separated but remained \\"harmonious co-parents,\\" in Paglia's words, who lived two miles apart. Paglia has claimed to identify as transgender and stated that she has \\"never identified at all with being a woman\\".

Q: CONTEXT: Historia Es difícil atribuir con precisión una fecha segura a la construcción del castillo de Cuéllar. El recinto amurallado ya figura en documentos de 1264, siendo Alfonso X el Sabio quien concede al concejo de Cuéllar la posibilidad de invertir la recaudación de ciertas multas en el arreglo del mismo. A pesar de ello, en el paño de muralla sobre el que se asienta el castillo se hallaron, tras una restauración, restos de una muralla del siglo XI. También de época anterior, quizá de finales del siglo XII o principios del XIII sea la puerta mudéjar que se localiza en la fachada sur del castillo, por lo que las hipótesis más completas sugieren que el castillo debió surgir a la par que el recinto amurallado. La primera noticia en la que se cita el castillo como tal data de 1306, cuando el 2 de octubre de dicho año Fernando IV otorga desde Burgos un documento similar al de su abuelo Alfonso X el Sabio, concediendo el empleo de la recaudación de las multas en “el refazimiento del castillo”.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Stef is a young girl interested in the geography of the world. For her birthday, she got two different representations of the Earth. Her grandparents gave her a map that uses the Mercator projection and her uncle gave her a globe. She is comparing how certain countries look differently on the two gifts and trying to figure out why that is. She is specifically looking at Norway, a country near the North Pole, and Mexico, a country close to the equator. But I can use this background: The Mercator projection is best within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. Landmasses or countries outside that zone get stretched out of shape. The further the feature is from the equator, the more out of shape it is stretched. For example, if you look at Greenland on a globe, you see it is a relatively small country near the North Pole. Yet, on a Mercator projection, Greenland looks almost as big the United States. Because Greenland is closer to the pole, the continent's shape and size are greatly increased. The United States is closer to its true dimensions. What is an answer for this question: Will Norway be less accurately represented on the globe or the map? The answer is:","completion":"Norway will be less accurately represented on the map using the Mercator projection compared to the globe. This is due to the limitations of the Mercator projection, which inevitably distorts the size, shape, and areas of landmasses as one moves further away from the equator. The Mercator projection is designed to be more effective and accurate within 15 degrees north or south of the equator. As a country's latitude increases, the distortion in size and shape becomes more pronounced. In the case of Norway, it is situated at a high latitude, being close to the North Pole. Therefore, its representation on the Mercator map will be significantly distorted compared to its appearance on the globe. On the other hand, the globe provides a more accurate representation of the Earth's surface, as it maintains the correct proportions, sizes, and shapes of landmasses. It is a three-dimensional model, which eliminates the distortion involved in flat maps, like the Mercator projection. Mexico, being a country close to the equator, would be more accurately represented on both the Mercator map and the globe. However, it is still worth noting that the globe will always provide a more precise representation, as it avoids the inherent distortion problems that arise from transferring a three-dimensional object (Earth) onto a two-dimensional surface (map). In summary, Norway will be less accurately represented on the Mercator map compared to the globe due to the distortions caused by the Mercator projection at higher latitudes. Comparatively, the globe provides the most accurate representation of countries and landmasses, regardless of their location on the Earth since it maintains the correct proportions and sizes of these features without distortion."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Paragraph: \\"New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg recently took aim at the Peach State. Bloomberg was on CNN several weeks ago to discuss a report that named Georgia among the states with the weakest gun laws. \\"\\"Do the states where they have weaker laws have more crime?\\"\\" asked CNN's Kiran Chetry. \\"\\"There's no argument about that,\\"\\" Bloomberg replied. National Rifle Association spokeswoman Rachel Parsons called Bloomberg's claim \\"\\"absolutely ridiculous.\\"\\" \\"\\"If that were the case, Washington, D.C., Chicago and New York would be some of the safest cities in our country, and they are simply not,\\"\\" Parsons said. \\"\\"Yet, they have some of the strictest gun laws in the country.\\"\\" The nation's capital had a higher violent crime rate than any of the 50 states in each of the past three years, according to FBI data. New York was at the other end of the spectrum, the data showed. The Big Apple had the lowest crime rate among the nation's 25 largest cities, the FBI data showed. But Bloomberg answered a question about states, so let's dig into his claim a little deeper. The report, \\"\\"Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,\\"\\" was put together for a group called Mayors Against Illegal Guns and completed in September. Bloomberg, an independent, is co-chair of the coalition. Georgia mayors listed as coalition members include Atlanta's Kasim Reed, East Point's Earnestine Pittman, Roswell's Jere Wood and Savannah's Otis Johnson. Ten states, half of them located in the South, are listed in the report as having weak gun laws. They are Alabama, Alaska, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Mississippi, Nevada, South Carolina, West Virginia and Virginia. Bloomberg, a vocal advocate of gun control, filed lawsuits against eight gun shops in Georgia and in 19 other states in 2006 he argued had relatively lax gun laws. Most of the cases were settled. Others defaulted, and a couple of cases were dismissed. Researchers looked at several topics concerning violence and where the guns came from that were used in the crimes, using data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. In each of the past four years, the report found Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold here that were used in crimes in other states.Per capita, Georgia was 10th on the list. The researchers reached that conclusion by dividing the number of guns sold by 100,000 residents. Mississippi was first.New York ranked next to last on the list, ahead of Hawaii. The report contains a checklist of 10 \\"\\"key gun laws\\"\\" and which states have passed those laws and which ones have not to determine which states have weak gun laws. The laws include whether a state requires background checks for all handgun sales at gun shows, if the state prohibits gun possession by violent misdemeanantsand whether the state requires reporting of lost or stolen guns. Georgia has enacted two of the 10 laws. Georgia requires state inspection of gun dealers. Gun dealers who don’t conduct background checks of prospective gun owners can go to jail. Some groups, such as the National Shooting Sports Foundation, have criticized the findings, saying crime has \\"\\"plummeted\\"\\" in states said in the study to have weaker gun laws. We reviewed two sets of data to see whether Bloomberg is correct about states that have weak gun laws still have more crime. One supported his argument; the other one offered mixed results. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps track of firearm deaths by state. Eight of the 10 states said to have \\"\\"weak\\"\\" gun laws were in the top half of states with firearm deaths, according to the most recent CDC figures. The most recent figures, from 2007, were adjusted for population. The results were similar from 2003 to 2006. Georgia ranked between 14th and 20th during those five years. We also looked at the FBI's Uniform Crime Reports, which show violent crime rates for each state and Washington, D.C. Five of the states said to have \\"\\"weak\\"\\" gun laws were in the top half of states of violent crime in 2009. Georgia ranked 20th. Washington, D.C., was first; its violent crime rate was more than twice any state on the list. The results were similar in 2008 and 2007. The FBI warns against using the data to make comparisons, noting they don't take into account variables that might impact a state's crime rate. Harvard University's Department of Health Policy and Management tracks firearm research, frequently does reports on the subject and is considered experts in this field. We talked to two members of its faculty, Matt Miller and David Hemenway, about Bloomberg's answer to the question during the CNN interview. Both men have done studies on similar subjects and believe there is a correlation between places with more guns and homicide. \\"\\"Where there are more guns, there are more deaths and homicides,\\"\\" Miller said. They said there's less research and data on whether states with weaker gun laws have more crime or states with more guns have higher crime rates. \\"\\"Most crimes don't involve guns,\\"\\" Hemenway said. \\"\\"If there's causation at all, it's not clear.\\"\\" So where does this leave us? The CDC numbers do show states with weaker gun laws tend to have more firearm deaths. The FBI data shows some of those states had more violent crime, but others were in the middle of the pack nationally. There are many types of crime, and not all are committed with firearms.\\" Claim: Georgia and other states with weak gun laws have more crime. Output:","completion":"Part #1: The claim will always have supporting proof in the paragraph, and the paragraph will have a clear point of view supporting the claim. Usage: The report, \\"Trace the Guns: The Link Between Gun Laws and Interstate Gun Trafficking,\\" found that in each of the past four years, Georgia led the nation in the number of guns sold that were used in crimes in other states.

Summarize this article: To effectively treat breast eczema or an outbreak of psoriasis on your breast, you will likely need a prescription strength corticosteroid product. Topical corticosteroid products, including those available over-the-counter, should not be applied to your breast area without first consulting your physician. Psoriasis outbreaks occur anywhere on the body, including the breast tissue. Psoriasis patches appear as thick, silvery, sometimes reddened patches, that are itchy and often painful. If you develop a psoriasis outbreak on your breast area, contact your doctor before you apply any medication. Be sure your doctor intends for you to apply medications you may already have on your breast tissue. Breast eczema outbreaks most often occur in the area of the nipple. The area often appears as an itchy, reddened area, and is sometimes accompanied by crusty formations and drainage from the sores. Due to the similarity in the rash associated with breast eczema and a more serious condition, Paget's disease, a medical examination is warranted. Take care to keep the area dry, and avoid harsh soaps or perfumed products. In addition to topical products, your doctor may prescribe oral medications to help treat any infection that may have started, as well as medications that can help control the itching. Topical products that may be prescribed include corticosteroids that reduce inflammation and promote healing, as well as newer agents, called calcineurin inhibitors. The newer agents are only used in people with severe and repeated flare-ups of eczema. Examples of the newer agents include tacrolimus and pimecrolimus. These agents help your skin to heal, and prevent further flares of eczema or atopic dermatitis. These medications alter the way your immune system works. With outbreaks of both psoriasis and eczema, regardless of where they form on your skin, scratching the areas can lead to complications. Scratching can cause the condition to spread beyond the immediate area, can cause further skin irritation, and possibly lead to infection. Many people scratch at night without realizing it. Try putting band-aids over your fingertips when you sleep, or sleep with socks over your hands to help avoid scratching. Summary:","completion":"To treat breast eczema or psoriasis outbreaks effectively, a prescription strength corticosteroid is often needed. Consult a physician before applying any medication to the breast area, as these conditions can resemble Paget's disease, which requires medical examination. Keep the affected area dry and avoid harsh soaps or perfumes. Doctors may prescribe topical corticosteroids, oral medications, or newer agents such as calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus and pimecrolimus) to treat the infection, control itching, and prevent further flare-ups. Avoid scratching the skin, as it can cause the condition to spread, increase irritation, and potentially lead to infection. To prevent unconscious scratching, place band-aids over fingertips or wear socks on hands during sleep."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Amoore is best known for proposing the stereochemical theory for olfaction, which is a significant contribution to the understanding of how the sense of smell functions. 4. Area of specialization: Amoore's focus on the stereochemical theory for olfaction suggests that he specialized in sensory biochemistry, particularly the study of how living organisms perceive and process sensory information related to smell. 5. The stereochemical theory for olfaction: This theory, proposed by John E. Amoore, postulates that the sense of smell is based on the interaction between molecules in the environment (odour molecules) and specialized olfactory receptors in the nose. According to the theory, the shape and stereochemical properties of the odorant molecules play a crucial role in determining how these molecules are perceived and identified by the olfactory receptors. This idea emphasizes the importance of molecular structure in the way our olfactory system works and has paved the way for further research in this area. In summary, John E. Amoore was a British biochemist who made significant contributions to the field of sensory biochemistry, specifically in the area of olfaction. He is best known for proposing the stereochemical theory for olfaction, which has had a major impact on the understanding of how the sense of smell functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica's lungs were much blacker unlike Laura's because","completion":"Jessica had been smoking avidly for over a decade, while Laura always kept a safe distance from cigarettes and any form of smoke. Growing up, they both faced their unique set of challenges, but they always seemed to pull through together - as best friends often do. However, the stark difference in their lifestyle choices began taking a toll on their relationship. Despite being aware of the health risks associated with smoking, Jessica couldn't find it within herself to quit. Her life had been tumultuous: an abusive father, an absent mother, and barely anyone she could rely on. As a teenager, she fell into the wrong company and picked up smoking as a way to cope. Laura, on the other hand, grew up in a close-knit family. Nurtured and supported, she managed to forge a headstrong personality. She was driven to overcome whatever challenges life threw her way without resorting to unhealthy habits. Laura's perseverance made her the epitome of resilience, and she often encouraged Jessica to put an end to her smoking habit. As the years rolled by, the once inseparable duo began drifting apart. Jessica's chronic smoking not only darkened her lungs but also caused her a persistent cough and shortness of breath. When witnessing Jessica gasping for air after going up just a few steps, Laura felt a pang of helplessness. Laura, now a successful public health advocate, couldn't bear to watch her best friend suffer. Deciding to take matters into her own hands, she approached Jessica with an action plan: a roadmap to quit smoking. Initially hesitant, Jessica humored Laura's best intentions, and they spent hours discussing how they could hold onto their friendship and work together on breaking the chains of addiction. They agreed on a daily dose of nicotine patches, therapy sessions, and healthier ways to alleviate stress. As the weeks turned into months, Jessica started noticing improvements in her health. Just like the color of her skin changed, she hoped her lungs would one day return to a healthier, lighter shade. Jessica's progress was visible, and the ever-increasing distance between the two friends began to close, as they walked together towards a better, healthier life. At times, Jessica stumbled on the journey and was tempted to light a cigarette in moments of weakness. But Laura was always there to catch her, reminding her of the reasons they had embarked on this journey. In the midst of the healing process, Jessica visited a doctor for a check-up. Reviewing her most recent scans, the doctor noticed her lung function had shown some minor improvements. Although her lungs hadn't completely regained their former health, it was a step in the right direction. On hearing the news, Jessica couldn't hold back her tears. Finally, her commitment to live a healthier life seemed to be taking shape, and her friendship with Laura had become stronger than ever. With the years going by, Jessica's lungs gradually began to heal, and the content of their conversations shifted from smoking to their shared dreams, the future, and enjoying life together. Laura didn't save Jessica's life - she offered her the tools to rebuild it on her own. The journey was not an easy one, but Jessica had the unrelenting support and tough love from her best friend, and that's what made all the difference. In the end, Jessica's lungs may not have become as flawless as Laura's, but their relationship proved that, when faced with adversity, the bond of true friendship can conquer even the darkest of challenges. And at the heart of it all, a once inseparable duo learned that the strongest foundation of any friendship is love, support, and the belief that change is indeed possible."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cut a cold cucumber into slices, and then place a slice on each of your closed eyelids. Leave them there for 15-20 minutes before removing the cucumber slices. Rinse your eyelids off afterwards. Put the tea bags in the refrigerator to get them cold, and then place one on each closed eyelid. Take the chamomile tea bags off after 20-25 minutes. The tea bags will tighten up your eyelids, making your eyes look fresh and bright. For this mask, you’ll need 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of aloe vera gel, 2 teaspoons (9.9 ml) of oatmeal, 4 teaspoons (20 ml) of yogurt and 2-4 slices of cucumber. Blend the ingredients together to create a paste, and then leave the mask on your closed eyelids for 10-20 minutes. Rinse the mask off afterwards. You can also split off a piece of an aloe leaf and apply the gel directly to your eyelids. Wait for it to dry for roughly 20 minutes before washing it off. Cold water is great for tightening your skin. Try to rinse your face, especially around your eyes, with cold water frequently. You can use ice cubes to gently rub your eyelids as well. Egg whites are known for improving skin elasticity. Using only the egg whites and not the yolks, dip a cotton ball or Q-tip in the egg white. Once some of the egg white has been absorbed, apply it to your eyelids. You eyes should stay closed the whole time until the egg white has dried and you can rinse it off. Remove any eye makeup beforehand so that this method will work better. If you get egg whites in your eye, rinse your eye out thoroughly with clean water. Because grapes have lots of polyphenols in them that help to reduce inflammation, eating them can help with your droopy eyelids. Eating lots of grapes isn't going to have a huge effect on your asymmetrical eyes, but it can only help. You may have noticed that your eyes feel heavier when you’re tired. Getting a good night’s rest will improve your skin overall, and should help tighten up the skin around your eyes. A solid 8 hours of sleep each night is recommended.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. Question: What did the author probably do with the colomba she made from the Field's recipe?

James Randi began a series of conferences known as \\"The Amazing Meeting\\" - TAM - which quickly became the largest gathering of skeptics in the world, drawing audiences from Asia, Europe, South America, and the UK. It also attracted large percentage of younger folks. Randi has been regularly featured on many podcasts, including The Skeptics Society's official podcast Skepticality and the Center for Inquiry's official podcast Point of Inquiry. From September 2006 onwards, he has occasionally contributed to The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe podcast with a column titled \\"Randi Speaks.\\" In addition, The Amazing Show is a podcast in which Randi shares various anecdotes in an interview format. In 2014 Part2Filmworks released An Honest Liar, a feature film documentary, written by Tyler Measom and Greg O'Toole, and directed and produced by Measom and Justin Weinstein. The film, which was funded through Kickstarter, focuses on Randi's life, his investigations, and his relationship with longtime partner Jose Alvarez, a.k.a. Deyvi Pena. The film was screened at the Tribeca Film Festival, at Toronto's Hot Docs film festival, and at the June 2014 AFI Docs Festival in Silver Spring, Maryland and Washington, D.C., where it won the Audience Award for Best Feature. It has since been captioned in ten different languages, shown worldwide, and was also positively received by critics. The film was featured on the PBS Independent Lens series, shown in the U.S. and Canada, on March 28, 2016. In 2017, he appeared in animated form on Holy Koolaid, in which he discussed the challenge of finding the balance between connecting sincerely with his audience and at the same time tricking/fooling them with an artful ruse and indicated that this is a balance many magicians struggle with. Question: What did the foundation do Answer:","completion":"The James Randi Educational Foundation, also known as JREF, was created by James Randi in 1996 to help people learn about and understand magic tricks, science, and how to be a good thinker. The foundation wanted everyone, especially kids, to know the difference between real science and things that just look like magic or pretend to be true but aren't. They did this by writing about interesting topics in their blog, having meetings where scientists and smart people came to talk, and by making podcasts where they shared stories and information. The foundation worked hard to make sure people knew how to ask good questions and not believe in things that aren't true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks.

So this happened when I was 16 year old. I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting. So the second day, after having roamed all around Noida, we finally returned to our hotel and that guy accompanied me to my room. I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge. Sadly… before we could proceed, rest of our cousins called us to play Antakhshree with them. Never have we met since, but we often exchange messages on Facebook.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Earthquakes seemed to outline a special feature of earth's crust. Earthquakes let scientists know where the crust was moving. This led to the discovery that the Earths crust was broken up into regions, or plates. Earthquakes happen most often along these plate boundaries. This was evidence that continents can move. The movements of the plates are called plate tectonics. The Earths crust is divided into plates. There are about a dozen large plates and several small ones. Each plate is named for the continent or ocean basin it contains. Scientists know he plates are in motion. They now know the direction and speed of this motion . Plates dont move very fast. They move only a few centimeters a year. This is about the same rate fingernails grow. So you might wonder, what could cause this motion? What supplies the energy to cause this change? Question: \\"Why is it likely that scientists only learned about plate boundaries from studying earthquakes?\\" Response: \\"Plates don't move very fast. Sent 13: They move only a few centimeters a year\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The question asks why scientists likely only learned about plate boundaries from studying earthquakes, and the response focuses on the speed of plate movement. A more appropriate answer would be: It is likely that scientists only learned about plate boundaries from studying earthquakes because earthquakes are the most visible and measurable manifestation of the movements and interactions between tectonic plates. Earthquakes frequently occur along plate boundaries, where the Earth's crust is most active and dynamic. When tectonic plates move and interact with each other, they generate tremendous force and stress, resulting in the release of energy in the form of earthquakes. By measuring and studying the location, frequency, and magnitude of earthquakes around the globe, scientists were able to identify patterns and ultimately determine the locations of plate boundaries. In addition to earthquakes, other geological processes and features, such as volcanic activity and mountain formation, also provide evidence of plate boundaries. However, earthquakes have served as a critical source of information for scientists in understanding the complex dynamics of the Earth's crust and the existence of tectonic plates. The study of earthquakes has led to significant advancements in the field of plate tectonics, enhancing our understanding of the Earth's geological processes and the forces that shape our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: Milk Movie plot: As the opening credits roll, old black and white newsreel footage from what looks like the 50s and early 60s flashes by of men being rounded up (and roughed up) by the police. Newspaper headlines break up the footage, announcing police raids of gay bars: \\"Crackdown of Homosexual Bars\\", \\"Men Charged in Taverns\\", etc. The men are all very well-dressed, clean-cut, and incredibly embarrassed, holding their hands over their faces, some with their suit coats over their heads. They are loaded up into paddy wagons as police push and shove them, snickering. Some of the men sit in large rooms, awaiting questioning and photographic, looking like their whole lives have just been destroyed.The narration of this film is carried out by Harvey Milk speaking into a tape recorded in 1978, dictating a letter to be read (or in this case, listened to) only in the event of his assassination. As he narrates, we catch glimpses of Milk in front of various groups, giving speeches, using attention-getting opening lines that vary with every crowd. In front of Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender (LGBT) crowds, he opens with \\"My name is Harvey Milk and I want to recruit you.\\" In front of burly straight union workers, he opts for, \\"My name is Harvey Milk, and sorry I am not what you expected, but I left my high heels at home\\".In narration, Milk explains gay activists are targets for being so visible. There's a sudden newsreel clip of what looks like actual footage of a very young Diane Fienstein making the announcement both Milk and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were assassinated (NOTE: for the unaware, that's California's current Senator Diane Fienstein, who in 1978 was president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, who became Mayor upon Moscone's assassination, and later, of course, United States Senator).Milk, narrating his \\"Only Read If I Am Assassinated Letter\\" frames the rest of the movie, taking the audience to important points chronologically, beginning in 1970 New York.Milk, dapper in a very Sears & Roebuck 70s gray suit...

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar; B. How Rust Can Be Scraped off of Metal; C. How Metals Respond to Electrical Currents; D. How Elements Can Change Phase When Heated;","completion":"The correct answer is A. How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar. Below is an explanation of each title and why option A is the correct choice among the other titles: A. How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar This title is specifically about a chemical change because it involves the reaction between baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO3) and vinegar (acetic acid, CH3COOH). When these two substances react, they undergo a chemical change that produces new substances, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sodium acetate (NaC2H3O2). This reaction is a perfect example of a chemical change, as it results in the formation of entirely new compounds. B. How Rust Can Be Scraped off of Metal Although rust is a product of a chemical change (oxidation of iron in the presence of moisture), this title specifically addresses the physical removal of rust from the metal surface. The act of scraping rust off of metal is a mechanical or physical process, not a chemical one. Therefore, this title is not specifically about a chemical change. C. How Metals Respond to Electrical Currents This title is related to the physical properties of metals and their ability to conduct electricity. The flow of electrical current through metals involves the movement of electrons within the material, but this process doesn't involve a chemical change in the metal itself. This title does not address a chemical change and is strictly about the physical properties of metals in response to electrical currents. D. How Elements Can Change Phase When Heated This title refers to phase transitions, such as when a solid turns into a liquid (melting) or a liquid into a gas (evaporation). These phase changes happen when heat is applied, raising the temperature of an element or compound to its melting or boiling point. However, phase changes are physical changes, not chemical ones. The element's or compound's identity remains the same throughout the process, with only the arrangement and motion of its particles changing as it transitions between solid, liquid, and gas phases. In conclusion, out of the four given titles, A. How Baking Soda Reacts With Vinegar is the one that is specifically about a chemical change, as it involves a reaction between two substances that results in the formation of new chemical compounds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: John is an amateur astronomer. Last week he was observing the sky with his telescope. First he pointed his telescope at planet Mars. He noted it as case A. Then he pointed his telescope to planet Jupiter, which is farther form the Sun than Mars is. He noted it as case C. Finally, he pointed the telescope to a faraway planet called WASP-17b. He noted that as case B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which case would see faster movement, case A or case C? Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: Answer:","completion":"To answer the question of which case would see faster movement, either case A (observing Mars) or case C (observing Jupiter), we need to consider the information provided in the hint: 1. A planet's year (sidereal period) depends on its distance from its star. 2. The farther a planet is from its star, the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. 3. As a planet approaches periastron (closest approach to its star), its speed increases; as it reaches apastron (farthest separation from the star), its speed decreases. Considering the above points, since Mars is closer to the Sun than Jupiter, it will have a shorter sidereal period and will be more affected by the Sun's gravity. Consequently, Mars will generally have a faster orbital speed than Jupiter. Therefore, in the given cases, case A (observing Mars) would see faster movement compared to case C (observing Jupiter)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Women today have several options for menstrual hygiene, so choose what works best for your lifestyle. Tampons are the most common menstrual hygiene product for women in America because they are convenient and simple to use. A tampon is made of absorbent cotton and is worn inside the vagina to absorb menstrual fluid as it leaves the cervix. They are available in a variety of absorbencies including light, regular, heavy, and super to coincide with the days of your flow. Tampons are disposable and are thrown away after use, and must be changed at least every eight hours. Never wear a tampon longer than eight hours or wear one that is more absorbent than you need, as this can lead to a rare but serious condition called Toxic Shock Syndrome. Disposable pads (also called sanitary towels or sanitary napkins) fit inside the underwear and come in various lengths and absorbencies. They are made of an absorbent material called cellulose and must be thrown away after use. Some women use them as back-up protection with tampons, and other women prefer pads because they are uncomfortable with inserting something in their vagina. Because they have a leak-proof plastic backing, disposable pads can trap smells more than most other hygiene options. Some women chose to purchase or make pads made of absorbent materials like cotton, Zorb, or microfiber. Cloth pads do not contain the same chemicals as disposable pads and do not have the same smell that many women notice when blood is absorbed by a disposable pad. They do require regular laundering and can be slightly bulkier than disposable pads. Menstrual cups are very popular in Europe and have recently begun gaining popularity among American women. Some menstrual cups like Softcup are disposable and inserted like a diaphragm. Reusable menstrual cups like the DivaCup or Lunette are made of medical-grade silicon and are inserted into the vagina and worn against the opening of the cervix. In both cases, the muscles of the vagina wall hold the cup in place. They can be worn for 12 hours, including while in the water or while sleeping. Because they are worn internally, they can help reduce the smell of menstrual blood during your period. The user removes the cup every four to 12 hours, pours the collected blood into the toilet or sink, and washes the cup before reinserting. Wearing a tampon for an extended time can lead to leaks, and wearing a pad for too long can lead to odors. During your heavy days, you may need to change it every hour or two. On light days, don't go more than three to four hours without changing it during the day. Again, never leave a tampon in for more than eight hours, even for overnight wear, and never wear a tampon that is a higher absorbency than you need to reduce your risk of TSS. Your period will most likely be regular and predictable, but sometimes \\"breakthrough bleeding\\" can occur between periods, or your period can be early. It's best to be prepared with the right supplies at all times. Keep a tampon or pad with you in your purse, locker, and/or car for emergencies. Keep a supply of tampons or pads in your bathroom so that you won't have to run to the store when your period starts. Don't be afraid to ask a female friend for a tampon or pad if you need one. Even a stranger in the bathroom will likely be willing to help you out if you are in need. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article talks about different ways women can take care of themselves during their period.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt. In its richness of sculpture it is one of the masterpieces of Gothic architecture in England. The interior of the cathedral is remarkable for the harmony of its style, which is Lancet-Gothic, and the dim lighting of the nave only adds to its impressiveness.

During his service, which included working as an information systems technician on the USS Enterprise, he received multiple awards such as the National Defense Service Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, and the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. It is important to note that Syed Raheel Farook was falsely identified as the gunman by some media outlets due to the striking similarity in their names.

Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: The carbohydrate binding profile of the red algal lectin KAA-2 from Kappaphycus alvarezii was evaluated by a centrifugal ultrafiltration-HPLC method using pyridylaminated oligosaccharides. KAA-2 bound exclusively to high mannose type N-glycans, but not to other glycans such as complex type, hybrid type, or the pentasaccharide core of N-glycans. This lectin exhibited a preference for an exposed a1-3 Man on a D2 arm in a similar manner to Eucheuma serra agglutinin (ESA-2), which shows various biological activities, such as anti-HIV and anti-carcinogenic activity. We tested the anti-influenza virus activity of KAA-2 against various strains including the recent pandemic H1N1-2009 influenza virus. KAA-2 inhibited infection of various influenza strains with EC 50 s of low nanomolar levels. Immunofluorescence microscopy using an anti-influenza antibody demonstrated that the antiviral activity of KAA-2 was exerted by interference with virus entry into host cells. This mechanism was further confirmed by the evidence of direct binding of KAA-2 to a viral envelope protein, hemagglutinin (HA), using an ELISA assay. These results indicate that this lectin would be useful as a novel antiviral reagent for the prevention of infection.

Later in town Sheriff Paul Shields and his new deputy Donny Saunders from New York speak to farmer Ron who insists one of his valuable horses has been stolen, though without evidence of theft it is assumed the horse merely escaped through an open gate. Paul then leaves to pick up his son Adam from his wife Susan who no longer lives with him after the accidental death of their other son, Tim. That night Adam sees a creature in the back yard and when Paul investigates he hears but does not see a large creature in the trees. The next morning Paul finds large footprints in the snow around his house that appear to come from an animal with hooves that walks on two legs. Donny informs him the footprints are around everybody's houses in the entire town. Paul and Donny follow the footprints into the woods where they also find large claw marks on the trees where the footprints disappear. After hearing from Park rangers that no known animal with hooves could walk such a distance on two legs Paul assumes the whole thing is a prank. Paul later hears from the town priest that his dog and a lot of other animals have gone missing. Paul then goes to a local store where Ron's daughter Clair and several hunters confront him with their fears about old Indian stories of creatures living in the woods, though Paul dismisses this. Earl, another hunter informs Paul that even though it is hunting season all the deer and other forest animals have all disappeared, meaning a large new predator may be in the area.","completion":"The article does not provide the information about the first names of Tim's parents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Students will be heading back to class next week for the first time since their Oklahoma elementary school was destroyed by an EF5 tornado – killing seven pupils. Plaza Towers has now been rebuilt following the tornado that flattened Moore on 20 May 2013, causing an estimated 2billion in property damage. The elementary school, which cost 12million to refurbish, has installed seven benches to represent the children who lost their lives. Scroll down for video. Construction continues on the exterior of the new Plaza Towers elementary school in Moore, Oklahoma. The school was destroyed by an EF5 tornado on 20 May 2013, killing seven students. A tree which was ravaged by the tornado, and at one time showed signs of revival, was named the 'Hope Tree' by fourth grade teacher Kimberly Martinez. Officials from the elementary school and Moore Public Schools led a media tour of the new building on Tuesday. Michelle McNear, assistant superintendent for elementary education and instruction for Moore Public Schools said: ‘I don't want to be ... a district that is remembered by May 20. ‘We want to be remembered as a district and a community as how we worked through it and the way we handled things.’ A memorial dedicated to the pupils who were killed is expected to be completed later this year. Pre-K teacher Erika Rowell points out the steel-beam reinforced wall in her classroom at the new Plaza Towers. The four rooms in this quad and the hallway are a FEMA-approved safe area. A container full of helmets to protect the pupils are shown during the tour of the new school on Tuesday. A brick wall with a panther painted on it, salvaged from the old Plaza Towers elementary school, has been incorporated into the new school. It will include silhouettes of seven children with personal touches such as a soccer ball to represent each child. The silhouettes will not have names, but the families will know which one represents their child based on the personal touches. Moore Public Schools Superintendent Robert Romines said the memorial ‘is very symbolic to the students we lost’. The new brick building includes a designated Federal Emergency Management Agency-approved safe area with four classrooms and a hallway where students can congregate when there's severe weather. The classrooms are equipped with bathrooms, and the hallway has no windows — setups designed to prevent storm debris from flying and injuring students. A memorial at the entrance of the school, dedicated to the seven students who were killed, is expected to be completed later this year. This classroom, with a separate bathroom, can be used as a safe room for severe weather or other lockdown situtaitons. The old Plaza Towers did not have a safe room. Students also will be welcomed by a large brick wall with a panther on it. Officials were able to salvage the panther wall from the old Plaza Towers and install it into the new building. Principal Patrick Chase said students chose the name ‘Paws’ for the panther. ‘It's probably my favorite feature of the building,’ said Mr Chase. The first day of school is Aug 19. This is the elementary school before the devastating tornado that flattened Moore in May last year.

I ran home as quickly as possible. Later on, I heard it was a neighbor, an old man who has been living alone at home. He's NOT a sleep walker. He enjoys having a walk at night. So I seldom see him in the neighborhood in the day. It's said that he was a soldier many years ago. He has two children, a son and a daughter. His son has a family in Shanghai. His daughter went abroad, in Sydney. He has been living alone since his wife died several years ago. Without any children living with him, he feels lonely and helpless. I feel sorry for the old man.

Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink. Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim... Guess a valid title for it!

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: Michael lives near a cliff overlooking the sea. Because of this he has an amazing view of the sunset. One day Michael decides to head out to the cliff and notices the sky looks much more red than normal. He also remembers that on the previous day he couldn't see his shadow at all. But I can use this background: When light passes through Earth's atmosphere, photons interact with it through scattering. If the light does not interact with the atmosphere, it is called direct radiation and is what you see if you were to look directly at the Sun. Indirect radiation is light that has been scattered in the atmosphere. For example, on an overcast day when you cannot see your shadow there is no direct radiation reaching you, it has all been scattered. As another example, due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering, shorter (blue) wavelengths scatter more easily than longer (red) wavelengths. This is why the sky looks blue; you are seeing scattered blue light. This is also why sunsets are red. Because the Sun is close to the horizon, the Sun's rays pass through more atmosphere than normal to reach your eye. Much of the blue light has been scattered out, leaving the red light in a sunset.

The first was a short man who was walking along the street, and the second was a little girl who was running as fast as she could. Well, the two bumped into each other and the child fell down. Then a terrible thing happened. The man calmly walked all over the child's body with his heavy boots, and left her screaming on the ground. It was an inhuman thing to do. I ran after the man, caught him and fetched him back. There was already a small crowd around the screaming child. The man was perfectly cool, but he gave me a very evil look, which made me feel sick in my stomach. The child's family then arrived, and also a doctor. The child had been sent to fetch the doctor for a sick neighbor, and was on her way home again. '\\"The child is more frightened than hurt,\\" said the doctor -- and that, you would think, was the end of the story. But, you see, I had taken a violent dislike to the short man. So had the child's family -- that was only natural. But the doctor, who seemed a quiet, kind man, was also looking at our prisoner with murder in his eyes. 'The doctor and I understood each other perfectly. Together we shouted at the man, and told him we would tell this story all over London so that his name would be hated. 'He looked back at us with a proud, black look. \\"Name your price,\\" he said. 'We made him agree to a hundred pounds for the child's family. With another black look, the man led us to that door over there. He took out a key and let himself into the building. _ he came out and handed us ten pounds in gold and a cheque for ninety pounds from Coutts's Bank. The name on the cheque was a well-known one.

A: Answer:","completion":"A: The process by which plants gain energy and produce sugar is called photosynthesis. Step 1: Absorption of sunlight Justification: Sunlight acts as the energy source required for photosynthesis to take place. Step 2: Conversion of light energy Justification: Plants contain chlorophyll, a pigment that absorbs sunlight and converts it into chemical energy stored in molecules called ATP (Adenosine triphosphate) and NADPH (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate). Step 3: Carbon dioxide uptake Justification: Plants gain carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through small openings called stomata on their leaves. This carbon dioxide is essential for the production of sugar. Step 4: Water absorption Justification: Plants absorb water from the soil through their roots, which is then transported to the leaves. Water is required for the production of oxygen, an important byproduct of photosynthesis. Step 5: The Calvin Cycle Justification: The Calvin Cycle is a series of chemical reactions that occur in the chloroplasts of plant cells. During this cycle, the energy stored in ATP and NADPH is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose, the sugar required for energy and growth. Overall, photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose (sugar) for energy and growth, while releasing oxygen as a byproduct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following conclusion? It was founded in the year 2008","completion":"Based on the information provided, it cannot be conclusively determined that Virgin Vodka, Virgin Cola, and Virgin Computers were founded in the year 2008. The quote from Richard Branson does not offer any specific details about the founding dates of these ventures, nor is the year 2008 explicitly mentioned in the context. To draw any conclusions about the founding year of these businesses, additional information and context would be required. To understand Virgin Group's scope and history better, we can explore their diverse portfolio and track record over the years. Virgin Group was initially founded in 1970 as a mail-order record business by Richard Branson and Nik Powell. The company has since expanded into various industries, including travel, telecommunications, music, space, and more. Some key moments in Virgin Group's history include: 1. 1972: The opening of the first Virgin Records store, which was the foundation for Virgin's music business and ultimately grew into the well-known Virgin Megastores. 2. 1984: The launch of Virgin Atlantic Airways, which marked the company's entrance into the aviation industry. 3. 1992: Virgin Records was sold to EMI Group, funding the creation of Virgin Communications and providing capital for other ventures. 4. 1999: Virgin Mobile was established, entering the telecommunications sector. 5. 2004: Virgin Galactic was founded with the goal of offering commercial space travel. As for the specific ventures mentioned in the quote - Virgin Vodka, Virgin Cola, and Virgin Computers - their founding years are as follows: 1. Virgin Cola was launched in 1994, as a direct competitor to other popular soft drink brands like Coca-Cola and Pepsi. However, it was unable to gain significant market share and gradually faded from the market. 2. Virgin Vodka was introduced around the late 1990s, but eventually was discontinued due to poor sales and lack of market impact. 3. Virgin Computers, though mentioned in the quote, does not appear to be a significant product line, and its founding year cannot be confirmed based on the information available. However, it could possibly refer to the 'Virgin PC' initiative that was launched in 1998, which aimed to provide affordable computers to consumers. In conclusion, the given quote from Richard Branson does not provide enough evidence or context to support the claim that Virgin Vodka, Virgin Cola, and Virgin Computers were founded in the year 2008. To draw accurate conclusions about the founding years of these ventures, it's essential to delve into more background information and historical context on the Virgin Group and each respective business."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is \\"If the object is black, meaning it absorbs all the light that hits it, then its thermal light emission is maximized.\\" the correct answer? pick from the following. a). yes b). no","completion":"b). no Electromagnetic fields do not obey the law mentioned in your statement. The statement you provided refers to the thermal radiation emitted by a black object (a black body), which is related to black body radiation and the Stefan-Boltzmann law, not the underlying laws governing electromagnetic fields. The laws that electromagnetic fields obey are known as Maxwell's Equations. These equations mathematically describe the behavior of electromagnetic fields and consist of four fundamental equations: 1. Gauss's Law for Electricity (Electric Flux): This law states that the electric flux through any closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed within that surface. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮E·dA = Q/ε₀ where E is the electric field, dA is the differential area vector, Q is the total charge enclosed, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space. 2. Gauss's Law for Magnetism: This law states that the magnetic flux through any closed surface is always zero, which indicates that the magnetic field lines are continuous, forming loops without beginning or end. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮B·dA = 0 where B is the magnetic field. 3. Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction: This law relates the time-varying magnetic field to the electromotive force (EMF) induced in a closed loop or wire. The EMF is equal to the negative rate of change of the magnetic flux through the loop. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮E·dl = -d(∫B·dA)/dt where E is the electric field, B is the magnetic field, and t is time. 4. Ampère's Law with Maxwell's Addition (Ampère-Maxwell Law): This law states that the magnetic field generated in any closed loop is proportional to the sum of the electric current flowing through the loop and the time-varying electric flux. Mathematically, it can be written as: ∮B·dl = μ₀(I_enc + ε₀ d(∫E·dA)/dt) where B is the magnetic field, I_enc is the enclosed electric current, μ₀ is the permeability of free space, and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space. These four equations form the foundation of classical electromagnetism, governing the behavior of electromagnetic fields in various situations. They demonstrate the relationships between electric and magnetic fields and how they evolve and interact in different scenarios."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Referencing human rights criticisms of his policies, Duterte said that he wasn't afraid to go to jail, and apparently used the anecdote to illustrate that. \\"Jail? Jeez. When I was a teenager, I was in and out of jail,\\" he said , in a mixture of Tagalog and English. \\"One fight there, another here -- at the age of 16, I killed someone. A person, really. During a fight. Stabbing. That was when I was 16 years old, just because we just looked at each other,\\" he added, prompting laughter from the audience. The controversial leader, who was elected largely on a platform of zero-tolerance against the Philippines' drug scourge, suggested that his approach to the war on drugs, mirrored that of his young self. His approach was \\"even more so as president,\\" he said. \\"You f**k with my countrymen, I won't let you off the hook. Never mind about the human rights advocates.\\" Duterte's spokesman Harry Roque told CNN affiliate CNN Philippines in a text: \\"I think it was in jest.

Speaking to the local Filipino community in the Vietnamese city of Da Nang on Thursday, Duterte also threatened to slap a UN rights rapporteur if he met her, and used obscene language to hit back at critics of his deadly drugs crackdown. “When I was a teenager, I would go in and out of jail. I’d have rumbles here, rumbles there,” said Duterte, who is in Da Nang for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (Apec) summit. “At the age of 16, I already killed someone. A real person, a rumble, a stabbing. I was just 16 years old. It was just over a look. How much more now that I am president?” Duterte won last year’s presidential elections after promising to eradicate illegal drugs with an unprecedented crackdown that would see up to 100,000 people killed. Since he took office 16 months ago, police say they have killed 3,967 people. Another 2,290 people were murdered in drug-related crimes, while thousands of other deaths remain unsolved, according to government data. Duterte, 72, remains popular with many Filipinos who believe he is making society safer. But critics at home and abroad say he is orchestrating a campaign of extrajudicial mass murder, carried out by corrupt police and hired vigilantes. He at times denies inciting police or others to kill, but also consistently generates headlines for his abusive language and incendiary comments defending the drug war. Duterte said last year he would be “happy to slaughter” 3 million drug addicts and branded then US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore” for criticising the crackdown. Duterte also said in December last year that he had personally shot dead criminal suspects when he was mayor of southern Davao city to set an example for the police. His then spokesman later sought to clarify the remarks, saying the killings took place during a “legitimate police action”. Esquire magazine quoted Duterte as saying in an interview before he became president that he “maybe” stabbed someone to death when he was 17 years old, in what may be a reference to the incident described in Da Nang. In an election campaign rally, Duterte also said he was expelled from college for shooting a fellow student who was insulting him. The victim reportedly survived. Duterte’s aides have repeatedly told journalists not to believe everything the president says, cautioning that he often jokes or indulges in “hyperbole”. His new spokesman, Harry Roque, indicated that may be the case with his stabbing-to-death claim. “I think it was in jest. The Pres uses colourful language when w Pinoys (Filipinos) overseas,” Roque said in a text message. In Da Nang, Duterte also targeted the United Nations’ special rapporteur on extrajudicial killings, Agnes Callamard, who has been a frequent critic of the drug war. “This rapporteur,” he said, after referring to Callamard by name. “I will slap her in front of you. Why? Because you are insulting me.” Duterte’s latest comments come days before he hosts the US president, Donald Trump, and other leaders for the Association of South-east Asian Nations (Asean) summit. Trump is due to fly into Manila from Vietnam along with other world leaders on Sunday evening before two days of talks. Trump has praised Duterte’s handling of the drug war, telling the Philippine leader in a telephone call in April that he was doing a “great job”. Human rights campaigners have said the summit will be a public relations coup for Duterte, with Trump and other leaders expected to ignore the drug war controversy. “Duterte will enjoy the gift of tacit silence from east Asian leaders on his murderous drug war during the upcoming summit,” Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia director of Human Rights Watch, told AFP. Adding to a sense of confidence ahead of the event, Duterte on Thursday also proposed hosting a global summit on human rights in which all nations would be placed under the microscope. “Let us investigate all violations of human rights committed by all governments,” he said, specifically naming the US, France and Russia. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte recently claimed that he stabbed a person to death when he was a teenager, according to a speech he made to Filipino expatriates in Vietnam's Da Nang city.

Regent will own 75% of the project, while MEVCO will own the remaining 25%. The estimated cost of the project comes in at 250 million. Under the agreement, MEVCO will manage the permitting, estimated at 6 to 9 months, and construction process, arranging the equity as needed for same. Regent will be prepared to give up 50% (total) of its 75% net for the financing, netting a 25% interest following the equity/debt financing. Further terms of the agreement provide that MEVCO will assist Regent in the acquisition of several gas fields in the Four Corners area, San Juan and Rio Ariba Counties of New Mexico, totaling an estimated 90+ Bcf and 20 MMcf/d current production. This production will be sufficient to power 100 MW of the power plant, with the remaining supply to be aggregated from other San Juan producers. MEVCO Managing Director Phillip Gennarelli noted, \\"We are pleased to be involved in this project with Regent. The addition of more producing properties in the area that we bring Regent, coupled with Regent's Horseshoe Gallup holdings, which are in direct proximity with the existing Four Corners Power Plant and the route of the recently announced Sonoran Pipeline venture of Calpine and Kinder Morgan, will provide an unequaled opportunity for both companies.\\" Regent President John Ehrman said, \\"The additional production from producing properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing, currently producing some 1.5 million per month in net operating income, coupled with the additional income through power generation helps Regent to maximize the location of our holdings in relation to the proximity of the existing power plant and transmission lines to key electricity markets in Los Angeles and other western markets. It is a good use of our surface lease, not related to the current proved mineral reserves of the lease.\\" The producing oil and properties which MEVCO is assisting Regent in purchasing are in Regent's core area of the Four Corners region near Farmington, NM. Regent will be required to finance the acquisition of the oil and gas proven producing properties under consideration. Recently, Regent announced that it was in the process of purchasing the interests of all remaining working interest owners in the field, a transaction that is expected to be consummated by the end of the third quarter 2001, giving Regent 100% ownership of the current minerals on the lease.","completion":"Subject Line: \\"Regent Energy Partners with Millennium Energy Ventures to Develop a 500 MW Power Plant in San Juan County, NM\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It was 3:12 a.m. when nine-year-old Glenn Kreamer awoke to the smell of burning. Except for the crackling of flames somewhere below there was not a sound in the two-storey house at Baldwin, Long Island. With his father away on night duty at a local factory, Glenn was worried about the safety of his mother, his sister Karen, 14 and his 12-year-old brother Todd. He ran downstairs through the smoke-filled house to push and pull at Karen and Todd until they sat up. Then he helped each one through the house to the safety of the garden. There, his sister and brother, taking short and quick breaths and coughing, collapsed on the lawn. The nine-year-old raced back into the house and upstairs to his mother's room. He found it impossible to wake her up. Mrs. Kreamer, a victim of the smoke, was unconscious, and there was nobody to help Glenn carry her to the garden. But the boy remained calm and , as a fireman said later, \\"acted with all the self-control of a trained adult.\\" On the bedroom telephone, luckily still working, Glenn called his father and, leaving Mr. Kreamer to telephone the fire brigade and ambulance service, got on with the task of saving his mother. First he filled a bucket with water from the bathroom and threw water over his mother and her bed. Then, with a wet cloth around his head he went back to the garden. He could hear the fire engine coming up, but how would the firemen find his mother in the smoke-filled house where flames had almost swallowed up the ground floor? Grasping firmly a ball of string from the garage, Glenn raced back into the house and dashed upstairs to his mother's room. Tying one end of the string to her hand, he ran back, laying out the string as he went, through the hall and back out into the garden. Minutes later he was telling fire chief John Coughlan: \\"The string will lead you to my mother.\\" Mrs. Kreamer was carried to safety as the flames were breaking through her bedroom floor.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The next generation of smart phone could combine the date from its gyroscopes with a built-in compass to allow you to track your indoor movements even without GPS. Research described it in the international Journal of Innovative Computing and Applications by Shahid Ayub of Lancaster University, and his colleagues there and at HW Communications, suggests that the embedded inertial sensors in many smart phones have added the facility to be used for localization and tracking applications. The primary benefit of using smart phones is that no additional infrastructure would need to be installed for monitoring personnel movements in a wide variety of situations not least staff, equipment and inventory movements in warehouse facilities, shopping malls and factories. In contrast, other technology being proposed would require new equipment,such as RFID technologies. However, smart phones do not yet have the ability to pinpoint their location without recourse to the GPS system, which is not accessible indoors and has the added disadvantage of using up battery power very quickly even if it could be used. Inertial navigation only provides the necessary information to a specified starting point the team says. This is useful for anyone with a non-GPS smart phone who wishes to track the route they take when walking or jogging if they specify their starting point. The team suggests that pedestrians indoors could be positioned using a combination of the smart phone accelerometer and an built-in digital compass, something that will become available in future smart phones. They have now investigated the potential of three different smart phone placement modes: idle, hand held and listening, which could be used with pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) techniques to allow users to record the path they follow or for various kinds of workplace or other monitoring requirements. \\"The technique could be used in underground tube stations, airports , train stations where there is no infrastructure installed for tracking or...

Article: You can't always know when there'll be a heavy rain or when to take an umbrella with you. But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post with its own \\"umbrella\\". The designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \\"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\\" he said. The Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man. While there are no plans to take the Lampbrella into production , Belyaev says he recently introduced his creation to one Moscow company, and insists his creation could be on any street where a lot of people walk but there are no canopies to provide cover.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Equifax breach that exposed sensitive data for as many as 143 million US consumers was accomplished by exploiting a Web application vulnerability that had been patched more than two months earlier, officials with the credit reporting service said Thursday. \\"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to determine what information was accessed and who has been impacted,\\" company officials wrote in an update posted online . \\"We know that criminals exploited a US website application vulnerability. The vulnerability was Apache Struts CVE-2017-5638. We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation, and have shared indicators of compromise with law enforcement.\\" The flaw in the Apache Struts framework was fixed on March 6. Three days later, the bug was already under mass attack by hackers who were exploiting the flaw to install rogue applications on Web servers. Five days after that, the exploits showed few signs of letting up . Equifax has said the breach on its site occurred in mid-May, more than two months after the flaw came to light and a patch was available. Thursday's disclosure strongly suggests that Equifax failed to update its Web applications, despite demonstrable proof that the bug gave real-world attackers an easy way to take control of sensitive sites. An Equifax representative didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment on this possibility. As Ars warned in March, patching the security hole was labor intensive and difficult, in part because it involved downloading an updated version of Struts and then using it to rebuild all apps that used older, buggy Struts versions. Some websites may depend on dozens or even hundreds of such apps, which may be scattered across dozens of servers on multiple continents. Once rebuilt, the apps must be extensively tested before going into production to ensure they don't break key functions on the site. Equifax's update confirms a report published last week by a firm called Baird Equity Research. It provided no source for the claim that Equifax was breached through an unidentified Apache Struts vulnerability. Two days later, the Apache Software Foundation issued a statement saying it didn't know one way or the other if a Struts vulnerability was involved. CVE-2017-5638 is separate from CVE-2017-9805, an Apache Struts vulnerability that was patched last week. Apache Struts is a framework for developing Java-based apps that run both front-end and back-end Web servers. It is relied on heavily by banks, government agencies, large Internet companies, and Fortune 500 companies. Experian, one of the three big credit reporting services, and annualcreditreport.com, which provides free credit reports, both reportedly rely on Apache Struts as well. Up to now, Equifax has said only that criminals exploited an unspecified application vulnerability on its US site to gain access to certain files. Now, we know that the flaw was in Apache Struts and had been fixed months before the breach occurred. ||||| Capping a week of incompetence, failures, and general shady behavior in responding to its massive data breach, Equifax has confirmed that attackers entered its system in mid-May through a web-application vulnerability that had a patch available in March. In other words, the credit-reporting giant had more than two months to take precautions that would have defended the personal data of 143 million people from being exposed. It didn't. As the security community processes the news and scrutinizes Equifax's cybersecurity posture, numerous doubts have surfaced about the organization's competence as a data steward. The company took six weeks to notify the public after finding out about the breach. Even then, the site that Equifax set up in response to address questions and offer free credit monitoring was itself riddled with vulnerabilities. And as security journalist Brian Krebs first reported, a web portal for handling credit-report disputes from customers in Argentina used the embarrassingly inadequate credentials of \\"admin/admin.\\" Equifax took the platform down on Tuesday. But observers say the ongoing discoveries increasingly paint a picture of negligence—especially in Equifax's failure to protect itself against a known flaw with a ready fix. A 'Relatively Easy' Hack The vulnerability that attackers exploited to access Equifax's system was in the Apache Struts web-application software, a widely used enterprise platform. The Apache Software Foundation said in a statement on Saturday (when rumors swirled that the March Struts bug might be to blame) that, though it was sorry if attackers exploited a bug in its software to breach Equifax, it always recommends that users regularly patch and update their Apache Struts platforms. \\"Most breaches we become aware of are caused by failure to update software components that are known to be vulnerable for months or even years,\\" René Gielen, the vice president of Apache Struts, wrote. In this case, Equifax had ample opportunity to update. \\"This vulnerability was disclosed back in March. There were clear and simple instructions of how to remedy the situation. The responsibility is then on companies to have procedures in place to follow such advice promptly,\\" says Bas van Schaik, a product manager and researcher at Semmle, an analytics security firm. \\"The fact that Equifax was subsequently attacked in May means that Equifax did not follow that advice. Had they done so this breach would not have occurred.\\" Penetration testers and other security researchers say that it would have been simple for an attacker to exploit the flaw and get into the system. \\"Once they identified Equifax's systems as vulnerable, actually exploiting the vulnerability to gain access to the Equifax servers and network will unfortunately have been relatively easy,\\" says van Schaik, who recently discovered and disclosed a different Apache Struts bug. \\"It's hard to say how difficult it will have been for the attackers to get their hands on customer data once they found their way into Equifax's servers and network. But the timeline suggests that time was on the attackers' side.\\" After exploiting the vulnerability to gain a foothold, the attackers may have found scores of unprotected data immediately or may have worked over time—between mid-May and the end of July—to gain more and more access to Equifax's systems. \\"Generally when you successfully exploit a web-application bug like this you will become the system user who owns the web server process,\\" says Alex McGeorge, the head of threat intelligence at the security firm Immunity. \\"Security best practices dictate that this user have as little privilege as possible on the server itself, since security vulnerabilities in web applications and web servers are so commonly exploited.\\" In practice, though, McGeorge says that hackers could have found credentials or other information in plaintext right away if Equifax didn't have proper protections in place. Mounting Concerns The company's attempts at damage control have been boilerplate at best. \\"Equifax has been intensely investigating the scope of the intrusion with the assistance of a leading, independent cybersecurity firm to determine what information was accessed and who has been impacted,\\" the company said in a statement Wednesday. \\"We continue to work with law enforcement as part of our criminal investigation.\\" Lawmakers are planning two hearings to scrutinize the situation, though, and have requested detailed information about the breach from Equifax. Dozens of people whose personal data was exposed have already filed lawsuits against the company. Peter Kaplan, the acting director of public affairs at the Federal Trade Commission, told WIRED in a statement that \\"the FTC typically does not comment on ongoing investigations. However, in light of the intense public interest and the potential impact of this matter, I can confirm that FTC staff is investigating the Equifax data breach.\\" And politicians have additionally called on federal watchdog and protection agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to initiate their own investigations. Equifax will suffer scrutiny and losses because of the breach, but the real victims are the individuals whose data was potentially compromised. And Equifax has particular responsibility to protect its consumer data, since much of it doesn't even come from customers who directly choose to do business with the firm, but surfaces instead from credit check requests for anyone living and working in the US. \\"I am concerned,\\" Immunity's McGeorge says. \\"This is a thing that you use whether you realize it or not, because all commerce data goes through them. You do have a stake in this.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A big company called Equifax, which has a lot of very important information about people in the US, let some bad people steal that information because they didn't fix a security problem on their website.

His defense attorneys on Thursday filed a notice in U.S. District Court indicating his intent to make the move. The death penalty case is set to be tried Nov. 7. But prosecutors also have the same right, and it’s unlikely that they would agree to forgo a jury trial. In capital cases, 12 jurors are chosen in a question-and-answer process that can last weeks. If they unanimously decide that a defendant is guilty, the jurors also determine whether he should be executed. A judge must adopt any death verdict. The 22-year-old Roof would face execution if convicted in the June 17 killings of nine black worshippers at Emanuel AME Church. “The defendant hereby states that he is willing to waive jury, and to be tried and sentenced by the court,” Roof’s lead attorney, David Bruck, wrote in Thursday’s filing. “However, counsel for the government has informed defense counsel that the government will not consent to waive jury at either stage of this case.” The defense filing amounts to a procedural formality. After setting a trial date earlier this week, presiding Judge Richard Gergel issued orders laying out the dates when opposing attorneys must file certain motions. Whether Roof planned to waive his jury right was first on that list. The deadline for the paperwork was Friday, and prosecutors must respond by June 21. The government’s stance on the issue could not immediately be confirmed. Assistant U.S. Attorney Jay Richardson, the lead prosecutor, declined to comment, and a spokeswoman for his office could not be reached. The authorities said Roof, an Eastover resident, posted an online manifesto about his beliefs of white supremacy before traveling to Charleston and killing the parishioners because they were black. He was indicted on 33 federal charges, including hate crimes, but allegations that he used a gun to violate the churchgoers’ free exercise of religion qualify him for the ultimate punishment. The slayings garnered considerable attention worldwide. Such pretrial publicity and the case’s racial implications are commonly cited as reasons for federal defendants to waive their right to a jury trial. Federal court rules, though, state that the government must consent and that the judge must approve. “The number of people who waive a right to a jury in a capital case is extremely small because it takes 12 jurors to agree,” said Charlie Condon, a former state attorney general. “But (Roof’s lawyers) probably think the judge would be more favorable than the 12 jurors.” Reach Andrew Knapp at 843-937-5414 or twitter.com/offlede. ||||| CLOSE Dylann Roof doesn't want a jury to decide his fate. The Charleston church shooting suspect's lawyers filed a request in federal court asking for a judge to hear the case without a jury when his trial begins in November. Dylann Roof (Photo: AP) Dylann Roof, the suspect charged with fatally shooting nine people at a historic black church in Charleston, S.C., last June, is seeking to waive his right to a jury trial, according to court papers. Lawyers for Roof, 22, of Columbia, S.C., indicated the suspect's intent in a notice they filed Thursday in U.S. District Court. The move would leave Roof's future up to a judge. \\"Pursuant to this order, the defendant hereby states that he is willing to waive jury, and to be tried and sentenced by the court,\\" read the notice filed by Roof lawyers David Bruck, based in Lexington, Va., and Michael O'Connell, based in Mount Pleasant, S.C. The notice also indicated, though, that a lawyer for the federal government has informed Roof's lawyers that that \\"the government will not consent to waive jury at either stage of this case.\\" Roof's trial is set to begin Nov. 7. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty. On June 17, 2015, Roof staged a massacre at the Mother Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church during a Bible study session. Among those who died were Pastor Clementa Pinckney. It is the oldest AME church in the South and was cofounded by slave revolt organizer Denmark Vesey.

When Lukather's record company, Bop City Records, approached him about recording a Christmas album, he responded with a quip about his suitability for the project. The company wanted him to do the record knowing he would approach the project with a unique angle and produce something different from the typical Christmas album. Lukather recruited keyboardist Jeff Babko and guitarist Larry Carlton, who Lukather had worked with previously, to help arrange the songs. The project was a challenge to Lukather, who had to be creative to turn the traditionally simple songs into something interesting for listeners without altering the fundamental structures.

Bookkeeper Answer:","completion":"Title: The Redemption of Harold Stone Plot Summary: Harold Stone, a middle-aged bookkeeper at a prestigious law firm, finds himself entangled in a dangerous web of corruption and deceit when he uncovers an illegal money laundering scheme involving the firm's partners. As he weighs his loyalty to the firm against doing the right thing, he must embrace his inner courage and embark on a life-altering journey of redemption, justice, and self-discovery. Plot: Harold Stone is a quiet, reserved bookkeeper who has consistently maintained the financial records of the highly respected law firm, Anderson and Goldstein, for the past 20 years. His life is predictable, monotonous, and unassuming - much like his personality. One day, while going through the company's books, Harold stumbles upon discrepancies in the firm's accounts. While making sense of these irregularities, Harold discovers that the firm's managing partners, Robert Anderson and Elliot Goldstein, have devised an illegal money laundering operation to pay off judges and manipulate trials in their favor. Unsure of how to handle this devastating discovery, Harold seeks advice from his hot-shot lawyer friend, Frankie Silverman, who asks him to gather more evidence to enable them to take down the partners. Aided by a fearless ex-investigative journalist turned firm secretary, Samantha, Harold risks everything to retrieve an encrypted flash drive containing indisputable evidence of the conspiracy. As they dig deeper, Harold and Samantha uncover extensive layers of corruption that extend beyond Anderson and Goldstein, implicating prominent government officials, wealthy businessmen, and even the police. They also discover that their every move is being closely surveilled by an unknown figure. They soon realize that upending the firm's balance of power might be fraught with more danger than they anticipated. Meanwhile, Harold's personal life is in turmoil. His wife, Laura, cannot understand why he has changed and begins to suspect that Harold is having an affair with Samantha. Harold's teenage son, Kevin, experiences a troubling legal situation of his own when the school bully falsely accuses him of assault. As Harold's whole life starts to fall apart, he begins to question whether he has made the wrong choice by pursuing justice. As the film reaches its climax, Harold and Samantha are faced with numerous trials that test their resilience, trust, and loyalty. With the clock ticking, they are ultimately forced to confront the true extent of their determination to fight for justice. Will Harold's newfound bravery and sense of morality triumph over the darkness within the firm and his own life? The Redemption of Harold Stone is a gripping drama and thriller that explores the themes of betrayal, redemption, and the fight for justice against impossible odds. In a world of corruption and deceit, the film teaches us that courage and truth can triumph, and that change can come from the most unlikely of places."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Who will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm? Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. The answer is:","completion":"Kenny will ultimately cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near their farm. The given paragraph states that Bobby has recently received a large order of potatoes, which led him to increase the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny, on the other hand, grows tomatoes that are not in season right now, so his usage of fertilizer is currently low. In addition, the paragraph mentions that there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. The hint provided explains that rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, causing runoff to carry it away and end up in bodies of water, such as ponds and oceans. Nitrogen, a component of fertilizer, results in uncontrolled algae growth when present in high amounts in bodies of water. Algae consume carbon dioxide in the water, and after they die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers consume all the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone – an area in a body of water with little to no oxygen, inhibiting the growth of life. Since Bobby is using a higher amount of fertilizer and there has been heavy rainfall in the area, it is highly likely that more nitrogen from his farm will reach the nearby ponds. Consequently, this will contribute to a higher level of oxygen being used up by algae growth and decomposers, potentially leading to dead zones. In contrast, Kenny's currently low usage of fertilizer indicates that he will cause less oxygen to be used up in the ponds near his farm, as there is less nitrogen being introduced into the water through runoff."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from the following. [1]. yes [2]. it is not possible to tell [3]. no And the answer is:","completion":"[3]. no The hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. The premise states that The New Yorker began offering something, with Brown generating buzz for it in order to increase circulation. The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Brown decided not to create any buzz for the offering. These two statements directly contradict each other. As a result, the hypothesis cannot be supported by the premise provided. The premise does not offer enough information to be clear on the context or subject of the buzz Brown is creating; however, it does establish that Brown is actively and intentionally generating buzz for some purpose related to The New Yorker. The hypothesis suggests an opposite course of action, creating a clear contradiction and preventing the hypothesis from being entailed by the premise. To further strengthen this point of view, let's examine some key aspects of the premise and hypothesis: 1. The premise specifically mentions that Brown generated buzz to increase circulation. This detail strengthens the connection between Brown's actions and their intended purpose, further distancing the premise from the hypothesis, which proposes that Brown did not create any buzz at all. 2. The contrast between the two statements serves as evidence that the hypothesis does not simply suggest an alternative course of action or a possible outcome but instead directly contradicts the information provided in the premise. This reinforces the conclusion that the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. 3. Finally, it's important to consider that the premise and hypothesis focus on distinctly different actions for Brown. If the hypothesis were to suggest a different approach to boost circulation without contradicting Brown's initial buzz creation as mentioned in the premise, it might be possible to argue that the hypothesis is entailed or at least supported by the information provided. However, in its current form, the hypothesis directly negates the premise, making it impossible to be entailed by it. In conclusion, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise because it directly contradicts the information provided. Instead of presenting a connected or supportive idea, the hypothesis challenges and negates the core component of the premise, namely Brown's intentional and successful generation of buzz to fuel circulation for The New Yorker."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A demo tape known as Music Meant to Be Heard was shared among fans, and the songs included many spoken-word samples from interviews Moore recorded during his cross-country travels. Most of these songs were later released in 1999 on a limited-edition CD called This is a Recording. In 1998, Moore released his first solo album, Dead Air For Radios, under the name Chroma Key on his self-created record label, Fight Evil Records. Mark Zonder and Joey Vera of Fates Warning served as his support musicians for that record. The album featured a dark, ambient sound, closer to Peter Gabriel and Tori Amos than the complex and intricate Dream Theater style. In hindsight, Dream Theater fans noticed that Moore had subtly explored this style of composition in \\"Space-Dye Vest.\\" In 2000, Moore moved to Los Angeles, California, where he recorded the digitally-themed You Go Now. The line-up for that record was Moore, David Iscove (guitars) and Steve Tushar (loops, programming). During his westcoast stay, Moore earned a BFA at California Institute of the Arts, where he created a little-known documentary called Octember Revolution, which depicted a Southern California gated community intervention. He then moved to Costa Rica, where he worked for Radio For Peace International, producing a bi-weekly activist radio program. In fact, some of Moore's work on Radio for Peace International was later released in an internet-only album called Memory Hole 1. In 2004, Moore scoured public domain films looking for one that exuded a certain mood, intending to write a pseudo-soundtrack to it. The film he chose was Age 13, an educational film from the 1950s, originally for use in schools. He took the existing film, slowed it to half speed, and let it dictate the moods, textures, and even running times of the songs he wrote to it.

The longer you plan on staying in europe, the more money you will need to save. Employ the following money-saving techniques : Cut back on unnecessary spending.","completion":"The first step in affording a trip to Europe is to set a realistic budget. This should include costs such as flights, accommodation, food and beverages, transportation, sightseeing, shopping, and any other miscellaneous expenses. Once you have a clear picture of how much your trip will cost, you can create a savings plan in order to meet your financial goals. 1. Cut back on unnecessary spending: Reevaluate your current spending habits and identify areas where you can cut back or eliminate costs. This may include reducing or cancelling subscriptions, dining out less often, or rethinking your entertainment choices. Additionally, evaluate your utilities and consider options like bundling services or changing providers to save on recurring monthly expenses. 2. Create a separate savings account: Set up a separate bank account specifically for your trip savings, and automate your savings by having a portion of your paycheck automatically deposited into this account. This will ensure that you consistently save money and avoid the temptation to spend it on other things. 3. Allocate windfalls and bonuses: Whenever you receive a tax refund, bonus, or any other windfall, allocate a portion or all of it towards your trip fund. By using these unexpected funds proactively, you can reach your savings goal more quickly. 4. Shop smarter: Be mindful of your spending on day-to-day items. Use coupons, compare prices, and buy generic brands when possible to save on groceries, clothing, and other everyday purchases. You can then allocate the money saved in these areas to your Europe fund. 5. Downsize or sell items: If you have unnecessary items around your home that you no longer need, consider selling them online or through a garage sale. This not only allows you to declutter but also contributes to the funds you're saving for your trip. 6.

Math Problem Solve 26*g - 20*g + 452 = -20*g - 458 for g.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step like we're explaining to a five-year-old. We have the equation: 26*g - 20*g + 452 = -20*g - 458. First, we need to simplify the equation by combining like terms. On the left side of the equation, we have 26*g and -20*g. Since they both have a 'g', we can add them together: (26*g) - (20*g) = 6*g Now, our equation looks like this: 6*g + 452 = -20*g - 458. Next, we want to move all the 'g' terms on one side, and the numbers on the other side. To do that, we'll add 20*g to both sides of the equation: (6*g) + (20*g) = 6*g + 20*g + 452 - 20*g. This simplifies to: 26*g + 452 = -458. Now, we want to move the number '452' to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 452 from both sides: 26*g = -458 - 452. This simplifies to: 26*g = -910. Finally, we want to find the value of 'g'. To find that, we need to divide by '26'. So, g = (-910) / 26. When we divide -910 by 26, we get: g = -35. So, the answer to the math problem is g = -35."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: One day a poor student walked in a town.

He and Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet founded America's first school for the deaf. When Laurent Clerc was one year old, he fell into a fire. As a result, he lost both his hearing and his sense of smell. At the age of 12, Laurent entered the Royal Institution for the Deaf in Paris. After he graduated, the school asked him to stay on as an assistant teacher. Meanwhile, in America, Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet was studying to be a minister when he met a young deaf girl, Alice Cogswell. He was upset to learn that there were no schools for the deaf in America. Therefore, in 1815, Gallaudet sailed to London to seek ideas on how to teach deaf people. However, he was unable to get help. He met a French educator of the deaf who invited him to Paris to learn at the Royal Institution for the Deaf. Gallaudet went to the Royal Institution for the Deaf, where Clerc became his Sign Language teacher. The two worked and studied well together. When the time came for Gallaudet to return to America, he asked Clerc to come with him. The two men set sail on June 18, 1816. The voyage across the Atlantic Ocean took 52 days; however, Clerc and Gallaudet put the time to good use. They discussed the school for the deaf which they planned to open. On the long trip, they had many conversations about education and deafness. The year after they arrived, they founded a school for the deaf in Harford, Connecticut.

There are two lakes in southern Indiana that are popular places for families of nearby cities to visit for picnics and parties. Lake Mahoe is right next to a large farm that grows all kinds of crops for the town. The owner of the farm also rents out his barn regularly so people can use it for celebrations. Lake Tresco is located near a school and children will often come play at it during recess. Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells.

Story Continued Below Returning to the first issue that helped him vanquish more than a dozen Republican rivals in the 2016 campaign, the president emphasized the need to build a border wall, lest his supporters forget about reports of another caravan of 4,000 Central American migrants traveling from Honduras with hopes of entering the U.S. Trump, flirting with conspiracy theories about the possibility that the migrants are being paid off, said money was being “passed through” those very people. \\"Now we're starting to find out — and I won't say it 100 percent, I'll put it a little tiny question mark on the end, but we're not going to get it, but we have the fake news back there, fake news — a lot of money has been passing through people to try to get to the border by Election Day, because they think that is a negative for us,” the president told the crowd. “Number one, they are being stopped and number two, regardless, that's our issue.\\" Morning Score newsletter Your guide to the permanent campaign — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.), a frequent ally, posted on Twitter on Wednesday that supposedly depicted migrants in Honduras “giving cash” to migrants in the Central American country as they set of for the U.S. Going even further, Gaetz called for an investigation to examine whether “US-backed NGOs” or the financier George Soros, a frequent subject of conservative conspiracy theories, were behind the alleged payments. Trump himself tweeted out the video on Thursday. Regardless of what was actually being passed out in the video, where men are shown handing something to women waiting in line, there was evidence that the video was actually shot in Guatemala, not Honduras. In an apparent correction of the location, Gaetz tweeted on Thursday: “Because a Honduran government official sent me this video, I believed it came from Honduras.” It is not known when the video was shot. At the rally, the president added that Democrats figured “everybody coming in” was going to vote for their candidates — though he did not mention that only legal citizens can participate in elections, and that attaining nationality and registering to vote is a process that can’t be completed before Nov. 6. White House aides and allies said the president has been smarting over the uptick in border crossings and the group heading toward the U.S.-Mexican border. On Trump’s way to the Montana rally, scenes of the caravan played on a loop on Fox News, to which TVs aboard Air Force One were tuned. Presidential aides said that polling they’d reviewed internally showed the migrant issue rising in importance with midterm voters, and that they expected Trump to continue to focus on immigration policies. Trump praised Mexico during the rally for its help with the caravan before it even gets to Mexico, but the country's ambassador said that Mexico does not have a deal with the U.S. to stop the migrants. \\"We work very closely with the United States government in addressing our shared objectives regarding regional migration,\\" Mexican Ambassador to the United States Geronimo Gutierrez told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \\"Cuomo Prime Time. According to a New York Times report , the group of migrants, estimated to be as large as 4,000 people, is making the journey to America for a number of reasons, including fleeing gang violence in their neighborhoods and others who simply want a more stable life for their children. Immigration was just one of the themes Trump touched on during his roughly hour-long rally, which was billed as an event to boost the candidacy of Montana State Auditor Matt Rosendale, who is seeking to oust Sen. Jon Tester in what was originally expected to be one of the toughest seats for Democrats to defend. In his usual loose and off-script style, the president mentioned everything from Hillary Clinton’s emails and the 2012 attack Benghazi, Libya, to the manufacturing of F35s, the treatment of Kavanaugh and just why Montana is called Big Sky country. Amid one riff, Trump explicitly praised Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte’s body slamming of Guardian reporter Ben Jacobs during his special election campaign last year. “Any guy who can do a body slam is my guy,” Trump said, while praising the Montana Republican. “I think it might help him, and it did,” he added of the effect the episode had on the race. Republicans have said Senate Democrats’ treatment of Kavanaugh amid allegations of sexual assault jolted their base in the past couple of weeks and has forced candidates like Sen. Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.) to go on the defensive. Trump has said the handling of his Supreme Court pick’s nomination made Democrats unworthy of holding on to power, but on Thursday he also brought up the treatment of former White House physician Ronny Jackson, saying the two episodes were virtually identical. Jackson was nominated to be Veterans Affairs secretary, but withdrew from consideration and resigned from his job after reports alleged that he drank on the job, over-prescribed medicine to employees and created a hostile work environment. The allegations against Jackson were primarily publicized by Tester, a fact that Trump hasn’t forgotten. “He never had a problem in his whole life — a little bit like Justice Kavanaugh. Really a fine, high-quality, handsome guy,” Trump said of Jackson. “He was going to be my choice, and he was attacked so viciously and so violently by Jon Tester.” ||||| President Donald Trump arrives as the sun sets to speak at a campaign rally at Minuteman Aviation Hangar, Thursday, Oct. 18, 2018, in Missoula, Mont. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press) President Donald Trump arrives as the sun sets to speak at a campaign rally at Minuteman Aviation Hangar, Thursday, Oct. 18, 2018, in Missoula, Mont. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster) (Associated Press) MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) — President Donald Trump suggested without evidence Thursday that Democrats or their allies are supporting a \\"caravan\\" of Central American migrants who are traveling north aiming to enter the United States. Addressing thousands of supporters at a campaign rally in Montana, Trump said immigration is now one of the leading issues in the 2018 midterms, and he accused Democrats of supporting the migrants because they \\"figure everybody coming in is going to vote Democrat.\\" The comments mark the injection of one of Trump's signature 2016 campaign themes back into national conversation as he looks to boost Republican turnout to maintain their congressional majorities in 2018. Trump was in Montana to boost GOP Senate candidate Matt Rosendale, who is running against Democratic Sen. Jon Tester — a lawmaker the president says has been a \\"disaster for Montana.\\" The president blames Tester for the backlash against former White House doctor Adm. Ronny Jackson, whom the president had tapped to serve as Veterans Affairs secretary. Jackson was forced to withdraw after facing ethics allegations, including claims that he got drunk and wrecked a government vehicle at a Secret Service going-away party. Tester had released a list of allegations against Jackson that was compiled by the Democratic staff of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee. \\"He was attacked so viciously, so violently by Jon Tester,\\" Trump claimed Thursday. \\"That's really why I'm here.\\" Trump also heaped praise on Republican Rep. Greg Gianforte, who pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault after attacking a reporter in 2017. \\"Any guy that can do a body slam, he's my kind of guy,\\" Trump said. \\"He's a great guy, tough cookie.\\" Gianforte is being challenged in November's election by former state legislator Kathleen Williams. Trump brought up Tester's opposition to the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, who was accused of decades-old sexual assault. Kavanaugh denied the allegations. Trump accused Democrats of engaging in a \\"heartless\\" campaign to sink Kavanaugh's confirmation, saying voters will \\"remember\\" how he was treated at the polls. \\"This will be an election of Kavanaugh, the caravan, law and order, and common sense,\\" Trump said. Throughout his 73-minute rally, Trump was cheered when he called for building a wall along the nation's southern border. The crowd booed when he spoke of his Democratic opposition to his policies. Earlier in the day, Trump threatened to close the U.S.-Mexico border if authorities there fail to stop about 3,000 Hondurans, who are in a migrant caravan passing through Guatemala trying to reach the United States. Mexico's government says migrants with proper documents can enter Mexico and those who don't either have to apply for refugee status or face deportation. \\"A lot of money's been passing through people to come up and try to get to the border by Election Day because they think that's a negative for us,\\" Trump said. \\"No. 1, they're being stopped, and No. 2, regardless, that's our issue.\\" He added: \\"They wanted that caravan and there are those that say that caravan didn't just happen. It didn't just happen.\\" Trump appeared to be referring to an unfounded allegation promoted by ally Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida. The Republican lawmaker tweeted a video on Wednesday of men handing out money to people standing in line. He claimed the video showed people being paid in Honduras to join a caravan and \\"storm the border @ election time.\\" Trump on Thursday tweeted the same video, writing, \\"Can you believe this, and what Democrats are allowing to be done to our Country?\\" After questions about the video's origin, Gaetz posted a correction later Thursday on Twitter, saying, \\"This video was provided to me by a Honduran government official. Thus, I believed it to be from Honduras.\\" Neither Republican provided evidence of his claim that the people were being paid to join a caravan. Montana marks Trump's first stop on a three-day trip out West that will take him to the border state of Arizona, where the politics of immigration are fraught, and to Nevada. Trump is boosting Republican Senate candidates as the GOP looks to maintain or expand their majority and to support vulnerable House candidates running on his ticket. |||||","completion":"President Donald Trump talked about a group of Central American migrants trying to reach the U.S. at a rally in Montana.

It is mid-afternoon on a sunny day in July, and Mark and Jeffrey are deciding which car they want to take to go to the movies. Which car, Mark's or Jeffrey's, will be hotter on the inside? A:","completion":"On a sunny day in July, the interior of a car can heat up significantly due to solar radiation entering through the windows and being absorbed by the surfaces inside the car. The trapped heat increases the temperature in the car, making it hotter than the outside air. Between Mark's car with a dark interior and Jeffrey's car with a lighter colored interior, Mark's car will likely be hotter on the inside. Darker colors absorb more sunlight and convert it into heat, causing the temperature inside the car to rise more rapidly than lighter colored interiors, which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat.

It's called the SeaOrbiter, and it just last week passed its funding goal on the crowdfunding site KissKissBankBank—Roguerie raised 70% of the money himself, and went to the public for the final 30% of the roughly 48 million total cost. The wind- and solar-powered vessel is designed to roam the water 24/7, searching for new life forms, lost civilizations, and more, News.com.au reports. The vessel will be 190 feet tall, with roughly 102 of those feet under water. It will have space for 22 permanent residents, including pressurized quarters for deep-sea divers (or \\"Aquanauts\\"), so they can come and go without worrying about decompression. Sub-aquatic bees will swarm around the ship gathering data, while remote-operated vehicles plumb the ocean's deepest depths. There's even a pressurized space simulator for astronaut training. Construction will begin in the spring, Core77 reports, and its initial explorations will be in the Mediterranean.

News article: The long, draining Republican primary season may finally have reached a turning point Tuesday, as Mitt Romney swept three contests in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia, potentially dealing a decisive blow to his most dogged foe, Rick Santorum. Wisconsin is the marquee prize, and the triumph most likely to push the GOP nomination fight toward conclusion. Romney and Santorum campaigned heavily there and the super PACs supporting them spent substantial sums on the air. With 13 percent of precincts reporting, Romney had 44 percent of the vote to Santorum’s 38 percent. Text Size - + reset Romney’s victories in Maryland and the nation’s capital were more imposing: Romney had 48 percent of the Maryland vote with 23 percent of precincts reporting and 69 percent of the D.C. vote with 28 percent of precincts in. But it was in Wisconsin where Santorum once again tried to derail Romney by drawing conservative, blue-collar voters to his cause. And as in the Michigan, Ohio and Illinois primaries, Santorum’s effort fell short. Romney’s trifecta will increase the pressure on Santorum, as well as on Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul, to clear the way for a Romney nomination and allow the GOP to focus on challenging President Barack Obama. In remarks to his Wisconsin election-night party, Romney made yet another attempt to put the primary behind him and turn his focus to Obama, ridiculing the president as “a little bit out of touch” and denouncing what he called Obama’s vision of a “government-centered society.” Ticking off the states set to vote three weeks from now on April 24, Romney cast Tuesday’s results as the almost-final word on the Republican presidential nomination. “We have a sacred duty to restore the promise of America. And we will do it. We will do it because we believe in America. Join me in the next step toward that destination of Nov. 6, when across America we can give a sigh of relief,” Romney said. “Join me and take another step every day until Nov. 6.” (Also on POLITICO: GOP delegate tracker) That pivot toward the fall comes after a run of top GOP establishment endorsements for the former Massachusetts governor. Having struggled throughout the 2012 race to lure heavyweight national Republicans to his team, Romney recently won the backing of House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Of Romney’s opponents, Santorum is the one who continues to deliver the feistiest message against his party’s front-runner. The former Pennsylvania senator has vowed to stay in the race regardless of the Wisconsin results. He plans to take the fight to his home state of Pennsylvania, which votes April 24, and into a series of conservative-leaning states in May. ||||| Results From Wisconsin, Maryland and D.C. Results, updates and analysis from the Republican contests in Wisconsin, Maryland and D.C. ||||| Story highlights NEW : Santorum says he'll continue fight in home state, Pennsylvania, on April 24 : Santorum says he'll continue fight in home state, Pennsylvania, on April 24 Romney: \\"We won a great victory tonight \\" Romney more than halfway to 1,144 delegates he needs for nomination, CNN estimates Mitt Romney won all three of Tuesday's Republican presidential primaries, putting more distance between himself and his closest contender, Rick Santorum, who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of Pennsylvania and beyond. Romney's wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates. Yet Santorum indicated Tuesday night he would compete in the April 24 primaries in five states, including Pennsylvania, where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of May primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters. Romney, in a speech to supporters in Milwaukee, made no mention of his GOP rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with President Barack Obama. \\"This has really been quite a night. We won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America,\\" Romney said. He continued his criticism of Obama's economic polices and what he repeatedly called Obama's plan for a \\"government centered society.\\" \\"There is a basic choice that we're going to face: The president has pledged to transform America, and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises.\\" The former Massachusetts governor is expected to take the majority of Wisconsin's 42 delegates and Maryland's 37 delegates, with some designated solely for the winner and the rest to be awarded proportionally. He will take all 16 delegates at stake in the District of Columbia. JUST WATCHED Ehrlich: Romney is strong Replay More Videos ...

That's more than twice the 264 delegates Santorum is estimated to hold. Gingrich and Paul trailed well back. With 93% of the vote reported in Wisconsin, Romney had 42% and Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, had 38%. U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas had 12%, and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had 6%. In Maryland, with 75% of the vote reported, Romney had 49%. Santorum had 29%, Gingrich had 11% and Paul had 10%. In the District of Columbia, with 99% of the vote reported, Romney had 70%. Paul had 12% and Gingrich had 11%. Santorum was not on the D.C. ballot. Pre-primary polls appeared to show Wisconsin's contest was the only one Tuesday that Santorum had a chance to win. And analysts said Wisconsin might be Santorum's final chance to slow Romney's march toward the GOP nomination. But Santorum told supporters in Mars, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that the race was essentially at halftime, with only roughly half the available delegates awarded. \\"Pennsylvania and half the other people in this country have yet to be heard, and we're going to go out and campaign here and across this nation to make sure that their voices are heard in the next few months,\\" Santorum said. Santorum, who has touted himself as a more conservative candidate than Romney, also warned supporters that the Republican Party often has fielded moderate Republicans against incumbent Democratic presidents, only to see the moderate Republican lose. He appeared to raise Ronald Reagan, a conservative who defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, as an example for a way forward. \\"If we're going to win this race, we can't have little differences between our nominee and President Obama. We have to have clear, contrasting colors,\\" Santorum said. \\"... Time and time again, the Republican establishment and aristocracy have shoved down the throats of the Republican Party and people across this country moderate Republicans because, of course, we have to win by getting people in the middle. There's one person who understood we don't win by moving to the middle. We win by getting people to the middle to move to us and move this country forward.\\" President Barack Obama, meanwhile, clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday with primary wins in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, CNN projected. Unlike the Republicans, Obama faces no serious opposition in his race. According to CNN's delegate estimate, the president had 2,735 of the 2,778 delegates needed to secure his party's nod before Tuesday's contest. He is expected to win most or all of the 119 delegates at stake in Maryland and D.C., as well as the 100 delegates at stake in Wisconsin. On the Republican side, since Romney's double-digit victory in Illinois two weeks ago -- followed by a wave of some of the Republican Party's major names and elder statesmen endorsing him and urging a quick conclusion to the divisive nomination battle -- the conversation seems to have changed: the GOP front-runner increasingly being called the inevitable nominee.

About 60% of respondents said the Romney endorsements were a factor in their votes, and 33% called them an \\"important\\" factor. Most of those voters broke for Romney. CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley reported that Romney's campaign was prepared to spend \\"a lot of money and a lot of candidate time in Pennsylvania,\\" where polls show Santorum's once-large lead has shrunk. Santorum's campaign points toward May, which looks friendlier for him. He could be the favorite in primaries in North Carolina and West Virginia on May 8, Nebraska on May 15, Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22 and Texas a week later. But it could be too little, too late by May. Sen. Hillary Clinton won most of the final contests against Sen. Barack Obama in the marathon 2008 Democratic presidential nomination battle. But in the end, it didn't matter. And Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor and former George W. Bush White House spokesman, said that while he believed that Santorum earned the right to fight through Pennsylvania, the race was all but over. \\"I think the writing is on the wall. Does Rick Satorum want to read it is the question,\\" Fleischer said. Romney and Obama on Tuesday seemed to be turning their attention to November's general election, with Romney blasting the president during a campaign stop in Wisconsin and Obama mentioning Romney in a speech for the first time this year. Speaking at a restaurant in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Romney suggested Obama wants to duck responsibility \\"for what's happened in this country,\\" saying the president should get full credit or blame for \\"what's happened in this economy, and what's happened to gasoline prices under his watch.\\" \\"It is time to have somebody who will take responsibility, and if I am president, I will not only get things right again, I will take full responsibility for my errors and make sure that people understand we have a president in the White House again where the buck will stop at his desk,\\" Romney said, while standing with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a prominent Wisconsinite who endorsed Romney. Later Tuesday, Obama mentioned Romney while slamming a House-passed budget proposal that Ryan drew up and Romney embraced. Obama, speaking at a media luncheon in Washington, said the plan, which would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs, was \\"thinly veiled Social Darwinism\\" and \\"antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who's willing to work for it.\\" \\"One of my political opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency,\\" Obama said. \\"He said that he's very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don't often hear when it comes to describing a budget.\\" While Romney is far ahead of Santorum, Gingrich and Paul in the hunt for delegates, exit polls have indicated Romney still has a problem locking in the conservative base of the party. That continues to fuel Santorum's campaign, in which he continually depicts himself as the lone true conservative going up against the Republican establishment and liberal media bias. As in previous contests, Wisconsin's early exit polls showed Romney doing better among higher-earners and Santorum better with lower-income voters. Among exit-poll takers making 100,000 to 200,000 annually, Romney led 55%-30%, with Santorum winning the under-30,000 voters, 44%-34%. The Wisconsin exit polls showed Santorum is more popular in rural areas and Romney in urban areas in Wisconsin. According to the exit polls, Santorum was winning the rural vote, 37%-27%, and Romney was winning big-city voters, 43%-23%. About 24% of the vote in Wisconsin came from urban areas and 22% from rural areas, according to the exit polls. The rest is suburban. Wisconsin's primary was open to any registered voter in the state, regardless of party. Exit polls showed that 58% described themselves as Republicans, 30% said they were independent and 12% said they were Democrats. Santorum was doing best among self-described Democrats with 32% of their vote, while Romney had 22% and Paul had 16%. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Mitt Romney achieved a significant milestone in the Republican primary season by winning three contests in Wisconsin, Maryland, and the District of Columbia, potentially dealing a decisive blow to his main challenger, Rick Santorum.

The association of the stylized eye with mirrors was so strong that in the Teotihuacan art , human eyes were often used as a substitute for the face of a mirror .","completion":"Yes, these two sentences do have the same overall meaning. However, the way the subject is presented and the structure of the sentences is slightly different, and the focus shifts slightly. The first sentence emphasizes the \\"association of the human eye with mirrors.\\" This suggests that the common iconography or symbol of the human eye had such a strong correlation with mirrors that the artists of Teotihuacan would stylize eyes in their artwork to represent the mirror. The use of eyes, therefore, could be perceived as a symbol or metaphor for mirrors. The word ‘substitute’ indicates that in place of illustrating a mirror directly, artists would depict an eye. The same basic idea is communicated by the second sentence, but the stress is slightly different. This sentence emphasizes the \\"association of the stylized eye with mirrors.\\" Here, it is the stylized eye specifically (not necessarily the human eye in general) that is strongly associated with mirrors. In other words, it suggests that eyes sketched or depicted in a particular stylized form were associated with mirrors. Similar to the first sentence, the artists of Teotihuacan often used human eyes to symbolize the face of a mirror. Thus, both sentences are dealing with the same concept of symbology in Teotihuacan art and the use of the eye as a metaphor for the mirror.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are presented with the quiz \\"what may compete for territory, water, food, or mates?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"animals may compete for territory, water, food, or mates\\" and \\"pigs are very intelligent animals\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"what may compete for territory, water, food, or mates?\\" would be 'animals', particularly focusing on the example of 'pigs' as intelligent animals. Animals in the natural world face constant competition for resources such as territory, water, food, and mates. This is a fundamental aspect of life that drives the process of natural selection and evolution. Competition among animals ensures that only the fittest and most capable individuals pass on their genetic traits to future generations. Territoriality plays a significant role in animal life, and animals often compete for spacious and resource-rich territories to live and breed in. This competition is especially fierce among animals that employ resource-defense polygyny, where a male will defend a territory rich in resources that will attract potential mates. A prominent example is the red deer, in which males compete for territories with the best vegetation and access to breeding sites to attract females. Much like territory, competition for water is inevitable among animals, primarily in arid and drought-prone regions. Access to clean and abundant water supplies is crucial to an animal's survival and reproductive success. Thus, animals often engage in aggressive behavior and indicators of dominance, such as posturing or vocalizations, to warn off competitors and claim water resources for themselves and their kin. Food is a primary driving force for competition among animals. Predators compete for prey in what's referred to as intraguild predation, where species on similar trophic levels hunt the same preferred prey species. A classic example is the African savannah, where lions, hyenas, and African wild dogs all compete for the same prey, like zebra, wildebeest, and antelope. Lastly, competition for mates is a crucial element of an animal's reproductive success. Sexual selection is a significant evolutionary force that shapes animals' behavior, morphology, and physiology. In many species, the competition for mates is highly intense, particularly in species with a high operational sex ratio. A well-documented example of this competition is found in elephant seals, where an alpha male, also known as a 'beachmaster,' defends his territory and harem of females from competing males seeking to mate with them. In conclusion, animals, including highly intelligent species like pigs, compete for vital resources such as territory, water, food, or mates to ensure their survival and reproductive success. This competition is an essential driving force in the natural world, influencing the process of evolution and natural selection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Part of the Lesser Antilles, it is located north/northeast of the island of Saint Vincent, northwest of Barbados and south of Martinique. It covers a land area of 617 km (238.23 sq mi) and reported a population of 165,595 in the 2010 census. Its capital is Castries. The French were the island's first European settlers. They signed a treaty with the native Carib Indians in 1660. England took control of the island from 1663 to 1667. In ensuing years, it was at war with France 14 times, and rule of the island changed frequently (it was seven times each ruled by the French and British). In 1814, the British took definitive control of the island. Because it switched so often between British and French control, Saint Lucia was also known as the \\"Helen of the West Indies\\". Representative government came about in 1840 (with universal suffrage from 1953). From 1958 to 1962, the island was a member of the Federation of the West Indies. On 22 February 1979, Saint Lucia became an independent state of the Commonwealth of Nations associated with the United Kingdom. Saint Lucia is a mixed jurisdiction, meaning that it has a legal system based in part on both the civil law and English common law.

Imagine you have some candies and you need to decide how many you're going to give to your friend. So, right now we have this little equation that looks like a tricky puzzle: -9*h + 137 = 38. We're trying to find out how much h equals to, right? To do that, let's first try to get anything that's added or subtracted with h alone. So, let's get rid of that 137 from the left side. The opposite of adding is subtracting, so we'll subtract 137 from both sides. That will leave us with: -9*h = 38 - 137. Now, your job is to subtract 38 from 137. If you're having trouble with it, imagine you have 137 candies and you're giving away 38. How many would you have left? You're right, you'd have 99 left, but it's going to be -99 because in this puzzle when we did 38 minus 137, the answer is negative. So now we have: -9*h = -99. Now, we just have to figure out what h is and that's easy! Right now, h is being multiplied by -9 and we want to get h alone, so we'll do the opposite of multiplying, which is dividing. We're going to divide both sides of the equation by -9, like this: -9*h/-9 = -99/-9. If you have -99 candies and share them equally 9 friends, how many would each friend get? You're right, they would get 11! So, h = 11. Nice job figuring that out!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Movie title: Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths Movie plot: In an alternate universe where the roles of the heroes and villains are reversed from their counterparts in the mainstream DC Universe, heroic analogues of Lex Luthor and the Joker (called the Jester) are stealing a device called the \\"Quantum Trigger\\" from the headquarters of the Crime Syndicate. When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members (Ultraman, Superwoman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick and Owlman) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic Justice League by activating a dimensional travel device. Luthor locates a police station but is mistaken for the evil Luthor. The Justice League is summoned and Superman's x-ray vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at Stryker's Island. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the Watchtower, where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth. Arriving at the parallel Justice League's base, the heroes attack Syndicate targets. After a successful series of raids in which they capture Ultraman, the League confront United States President Slade Wilson, who releases Ultraman and explains that acceding to the Syndicate's demands saves millions of lives.

A mechanic is believed to have murdered his wife and then killed himself when he was hit by a train. Nigel Maude, 58, died on the tracks near the rural village of Hoghton, Lancashire, on Sunday morning. British Transport Police went to his home nearby to inform his wife of 30 years Judith where they found her body in an upstairs bedroom. Tragedy: Police found the body of Judith Maude in the upstairs bedroom of their home in Hoghton, Lancashire. Investigation: Nigel Maude died after throwing himself in front of a train in the village on Sunday morning. Detectives with Lancashire Police have now started a murder investigation but say they are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. Today, neighbours spoke of their shock at the deaths of a 'happy and quiet' couple, who had two daughters and four grandchildren. Mr Maude worked as a mechanic and lived with his wife in a semi-detached home in Charles Crescent in Hoghton. They had lived there since inheriting the property from his parents. Next door neighbour, Celia Livesey: 'They were a devoted couple and all they lived for was their family. They were very quiet and very pleasant. I only really saw them to say hello over the fence. 'They loved their grandchildren, they had four grandchildren, one girl and three boys. 'The first time I knew anything was about 8.30pm and saw all the police and the ambulance. 'Judith didn’t work and Nigel worked at Leyland Motors, I don’t think he was retired. I’m just so shocked, I really can’t believe it.' Another neighbour, who asked to remain anonymous, said: 'I knew them both, if you were to say \\"who is a couple who never argued\\" you would say them. 'I had known him since primary school and known Judith since she was 15. I still can’t believe it has happened.' Shock: Neighbours described the Maudes as a 'happy and quiet' couple. 'He served as a mechanic before going to Leyland Motors. I don’t think he has been very well and I think he may have been in hospital but I don’t know why. 'They were together all the time. They liked walking. They have been married 30-odd years. 'You couldn’t ask for a nicer couple and couldn’t find a bad word to say about him. He was a Preston North End supporter. 'He couldn’t fall out with anyone if he tried. He was a real family man, he was devoted to his grandchildren.' Another neighbour said: 'We think the police came to the house to tell Judith and nobody came to the door. The door was open and they came in and found Judith upstairs. 'The way it’s looking is that he has killed her and then killed himself. The kept themselves to themselves, but they always had their grandchildren with them.' Discovery: Officers from British Transport Police had gone to inform Judith Maude of her husband's death after he was hit by a train. A Lancashire Police spokesman said: 'A murder investigation has been launched after the body of a woman was found at an address in Hoghton on Sunday, August 11. 'Around 8.35pm police were called to an address on Charles Crescent where the body of a woman aged in her 50s was found in an upstairs bedroom. A post mortem examination will take place later today to establish the cause of her death. 'The house remains sealed off whilst an investigation takes place. 'The woman’s death is believed to be linked to an earlier incident that took place at 10.55am near to Chapel Lane, Hoghton, where the body of a 58 year old man was found on the track having been hit by a train. His death is not being treated as suspicious.'

Write a summary based on this article: Facing slipping poll numbers, an angry Newt Gingrich lashed out at his Republican presidential rivals Monday, calling their criticism of him \\"reprehensible\\" and helpful only to President Obama 's reelection.Voters in Iowa have been swamped by nonstop television attack ads, robocalls and mailers from the campaigns and independent supporters of candidates Mitt Romney , Ron Paul and Rick Perry . Among the claims in the ads: that Gingrich is a serial hypocrite and flip-flopper on issues such as a health insurance mandate, and that he made 1.6 million working for Freddie Mac , the mortgage giant blamed by many Republicans for the economic collapse.\\"It's candidly very disappointing to see some of my friends who are running put out so much negative junk,\\" Gingrich told scores of voters gathered at a security firm in Davenport.Though he declined to criticize them by name and said he would continue to run a positive campaign, Gingrich's disdain for his rivals was palpable.\\"I really wish they would have the courage to be positive, and I wish they would have the courage to have a campaign which would match ideas [rather] than see whose consultants can be the nastier,\\" he said.Gingrich spoke as new polls showed him losing ground nationally and in Iowa, where the first nominating contests will take place Jan. 3, as Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, gains ground.Gingrich, a former House speaker who usurped Romney's position as front-runner several weeks ago, said he would hold telephone call-in town halls every day until the Iowa caucuses so voters can ask about the claims being leveled.He also said he would soon launch a 44-stop tour. \\"I will tell you what I stand for, what I'm trying to accomplish and, second, I will answer any question that comes up based on the false and inaccurate advertisements of some of my friends.\\"Gingrich's newly announced moves are meant to prevent him from following the trajectories of Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, Texas Gov. Perry and businessman Herman Cain , candidates who in succession rose abruptly and fell nearly as swiftly. Only Romney and Paul, a congressman from Texas, have had relatively stable, even increasing, support over the last few months.For Gingrich's campaign, the slump is his second in several months. He lost almost all of his aides over the summer when, shortly after he entered the race, he took a two-week Mediterranean cruise with his wife instead of campaigning. He was left in debt and running on fumes.But as many Republican voters lost faith in the other candidates as alternatives to Romney, Gingrich was the most recent beneficiary. Yet the new Iowa polling shows a tight race, with Romney and Paul as front-runners and Gingrich in third.\\"People are starting to remember why they didn't think Gingrich was a strong candidate to start with,\\" said Tim Hagle, a political science professor at the University of Iowa.The allegations against him are clearly on the minds of Iowa voters. During the town hall Monday, one voter asked about the Freddie Mac contract. Republican rivals have accused Gingrich of profiting from his former position as speaker and, in effect, lobbying members of Congress.Gingrich replied that he flubbed his initial response to questions about his work for the organization. \\"What we should have done … is stopped, pulled together everything, and I should have had a much more coherent answer,\\" he said.Gingrich said Freddie Mac hired his firm for six years and that he personally received about 35,000 a year. He said he opposed any federal bailout of the organization.Another person asked about Gingrich's past support of a mandate requiring people to purchase health insurance, a key part of Obama's healthcare law that is opposed by most Republican voters. Gingrich said he supported such a mandate in the early 1990s as an alternative to a healthcare proposal by Hillary Rodham Clinton when she was first lady, and that he later decided a mandate was unacceptable.As Gingrich tries to right himself in Iowa, his campaign also is under siege nationally because of organizational problems.Gingrich conceded that his campaign is struggling to gather enough signatures to get on the ballot in some states, with the next test occurring Thursday in Virginia. In the process, he took a veiled swipe at Romney.\\"We're scrambling. Look, there's no question some candidates have been running for five or six years and have raised millions and millions of dollars and they're better organized than I am,\\" he told reporters after the event. \\"On the other hand ... I'm clearly one of the two front-runners, and we have a lot of popular support. The challenge for us is to get that popular support organized fast enough.\\" ||||| Two weeks before Iowans cast the first votes of the 2012 election cycle, Republicans nationally are sharply divided over whom their party’s presidential nominee should be, with Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich locked in a dead-even race, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll. Gingrich and Romney are each favored by 30 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Running behind them is Rep. Ron Paul (Tex.), whose libertarian philosophy has attracted a strong following. He stands at 15 percent, about double his tally in an early November poll. All other active candidates are in the single digits. The survey shows President Obama receiving his highest approval rating since March, with the exception of a brief rise after the killing of Osama bin Laden. Although most Americans continue to disapprove of the president’s performance on the economy, the number who disapprove of his overall performance has dipped below 50 percent for the first time this fall. Romney has edged higher in the GOP contest, breaking out of the 20s for the first time since July. Gingrich has jumped greatly since early November, in part because of businessman Herman Cain’s decision to suspend his candidacy. Gingrich peaked at an even higher level and started to fade in other national surveys conducted between the Post-ABC polls, suggesting that he may have lost some momentum recently. He was on the defensive in the final debates before the Jan. 3 Iowa caucuses and has come under sharp attack by Romney in a series of media interviews. He also is the target of hundreds of thousands of dollars in negative ads in Iowa from his major rivals and their allies, all of which could be taking a toll. Romney has a 10-point advantage on the key question of who Republicans think is most likely to beat Obama. Romney also leads Gingrich when it comes to dealing with issue No. 1, the economy. Gingrich counters with a big advantage on experience: By about 2 to 1, more see him as having the best résumé for the White House and as being the most qualified to be commander in chief. In other ways, the two are evenly matched. They are tied at 23 percent on which best reflects the core values of the Republican Party. They run about equal on which “is closer to you on issues.” Romney and Gingrich are also tied among those who are the strongest supporters of the tea party movement, and draw almost evenly among men and women and across age groups. But there are differences. Gingrich has a wide advantage — 36 percent to 22 percent — over Romney among those who consider themselves “very conservative.” The former House speaker edges Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, among those without college degrees and among those with annual household incomes under 75,000. Romney has small advantages among those with more formal education and higher incomes. Although a big majority of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents across the country say they support either Romney or Gingrich, only about a third of potential voters say they are firmly committed to any one contender. Many of those voters pick someone other than Romney or Gingrich when asked about the candidates’ attributes and their capacity to handle key issues. This year — perhaps because of the heavy influence of more than a dozen televised candidate debates — national polls have tracked closely with state surveys. That could change soon as campaigning intensifies in Iowa and New Hampshire, where voters are encountering a much heavier volume of television attack ads, direct mail and face-to-face campaigning than voters elsewhere. But the new national survey provides a variety of insight on how Republicans are evaluating their leading candidates. Both Gingrich and Romney can point to their backgrounds as reasons Republicans should back them. More than six in 10 consider Gingrich’s political experience a major reason to support him, and more than seven in 10 say they approve of the work he did as House speaker in the 1990s. But Gingrich’s experience as a private citizen since leaving Congress draws negative responses. His work as a consultant for Freddie Mac has come under blistering attack from his GOP rivals in recent debates and on Iowa airwaves. By 44 percent to 33 percent, Republicans surveyed say they have an unfavorable view of the political work he has done since leaving office. About three in 10 of his supporters have negative views of his activity since leaving the speaker’s office, and among GOP-leaning independents, 53 percent say they view that work unfavorably. Gingrich has responded by saying that he has never lobbied and that most of the money from Freddie Mac went toward overhead and other expenses, not to him directly. On Monday, his campaign began an advertising counteroffensive. Although more Republicans think Gingrich has the best experience to be president, Romney’s work in the private sector and as governor of Massachusetts are viewed positively. More than six in 10 say his business experience is a big reason to support him; a majority have a favorable impression of the work he did buying, restructuring and selling companies while at Bain Capital; and more than two-thirds say they approve of the job he did as governor. Not all about that record in Massachusetts is viewed positively, however. About 28 percent consider his policies on health care — he signed into law a coverage mandate for all Massachusetts residents — a major reason to support his candidacy. But 36 percent say it is a major reason to oppose him. Gingrich’s critics have questioned whether he has the temperament to be president. Romney called him “extremely unreliable” in a Washington Post interview a week ago and “zany” in a New York Times interview the next day. In the Post-ABC News poll, 61 percent say the former speaker has the right personality and temperament to be president — an 11-point increase since June and a shade under the 67 percent who say so about Romney. The other candidates are struggling for national attention. Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Michele Bachmann (Minn.) are at 7 percent in the poll, while former senator Rick Santorum (Pa.) and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. are at 3 percent. Most Republicans say Paul’s views on limited government are a major reason to support him, while many consider his opposition to U.S. military intervention a big reason to oppose his candidacy. Nearly two-thirds say they can rely on Paul to say what he really believes — more than say so about Gingrich or Romney — but a slim majority says he lacks the personality and temperament to be an effective president. Nearly half say that his policies as president probably would be unacceptable to most Americans. Polling manager Peyton M. Craighill and polling analyst Scott Clement contributed to this report. ||||| By Gary Langer Newt Gingrich has relinquished sole front-runner status almost as quickly as he gained it, landing at a dead heat with Mitt Romney in the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll. And as the GOP hopefuls battle it out, ratings of Barack Obama’s prospects have warmed. Americans now divide about evenly on whom they expect to win the 2012 presidential election: Forty-nine percent plump for the eventual Republican nominee, 46 percent for Obama. While still a weak showing given the usual advantages of incumbency, that’s a marked improvement for Obama from October, when 55 percent picked him to lose. In general election match-ups, this poll, produced for ABC by Langer Research Associates, finds that Obama holds significant leads over Gingrich and Ron Paul alike; matched against Romney, though, it’s a dead heat, 47-47 percent, among registered voters. If Paul’s added to the race as an independent (he’s not saying), Obama moves ahead of Romney. Much can change, of course, with the election still more than 10 months away. But as reported separately, Obama’s advance to a 49 percent job approval rating may put him back in the game. GOP – More immediate is the GOP race, whose tumult continues unabated. Gingrich, the latest non-Romney to rush ahead, has 30 percent support for the nomination among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Romney has an identical 30 percent, matching his July high in ABC/Post polls this cycle. Ron Paul has 15 percent, with all others in the single digits. Gingrich is up from 12 percent in an ABC/Post poll in early November, but he’d done better earlier this month, leading in some national polls as well as in an ABC/Post poll in Iowa, with its Jan. 3 caucuses. His rise followed earlier, unsustained moves for Michele Bachmann, Rick Perry and Herman Cain, as strongly conservative Republicans sought an alternative to Romney. Indeed, Gingrich leads Romney by a 14-point margin, 36 percent to 22 percent, among ”veryconservatives.” It’s a serious challenge for Romney; while “very conservatives” make up just more than a quarter of all leaning Republicans nationally, they’re a motivated group who may constitute a greater share of the turnout at caucuses and primaries alike. SATISFIED? – Romney takes strength from the perception he’s best able to beat Obama. Gingrich comes back on experience, and, perhaps surprisingly, with a broad advantage over Romney as better fit to command the armed forces. (Neither has military service.) Gingrich, though, is not well-ranked on honesty and trustworthiness, and both Romney and Gingrich suffer from tepid ratings for saying what they really believe; just 51 and 52 percent, respectively, say this describes them. Bragging rights on that attribute belong to Paul – 65 percent believe they can rely on him to say what he really thinks. Those soft ratings on forthrightness for the two leading candidates may be dampening overall satisfaction with the field. A less-than-ideal 59 percent of leaning Republicans say they’re satisfied with the GOP candidates, and a mere 11 percent are “very” satisfied. In late 2007, by contrast, 69 percent of leaning Republicans were satisfied with their choices – as were, on the other side, 81 percent of leaning Democrats, whose candidate ultimately won. Notably, a broad 64 percent of potential Republican voters say there’s still a chance they could change their minds about which candidate to support – leaving vast room for further movement as the GOP race continues to unfold. And a Romney-Gingrich duel, if that’s how it develops, could be a long one. Asked which of these two comes closest to them on the issues, leaning Republicans divide almost exactly evenly, 46-45 percent. That said, either Romney or Gingrich may suffice in the end: Each is the leading second choice among those who have a different first choice. STRENGTHS and WEAKNESSES – Strong conservatives have an objection to Romney that’s policy-based, and as such may prove hard for him to move. Among all Republicans and Republican-leaning independents, 36 percent view Romney’s record on health care when he was governor of Massachusetts as a major reason to oppose him for the nomination. That’s trouble enough – but among very conservatives, it jumps to 55 percent. Gingrich has his own vulnerability: Republicans by an 11-point margin, 44-33 percent, have an unfavorable impression of his work as a political consultant after he left elective office, with nearly a quarter undecided. Romney, by contrast, gets a favorable rating for his experience as a corporate buyout specialist, a point on which Gingrich has criticized him. Romney and Gingrich alike clear other hurdles. Neither Romney’s Mormon faith, nor Gingrich’s three marriages, appear to be significant negatives to most potential GOP voters. Majorities believe both candidates have the personality and temperament to serve effectively as president (67 and 61 percent, respectively) and think they’d pursue policies most Americans would find acceptable (71 percent for Romney, 66 percent for Gingrich). Paul falters badly on both those scores – just 37 percent in his own party think he’s got the temperament and character to serve effectively, and just 42 percent think his policies would prove acceptable to most of the public. As in Iowa, Paul also loses support for his isolationist views; 45 percent see his opposition to U.S. military intervention as a major negative. ISSUES and ATTRIBUTES – Ranking across all the candidates, 43 percent of leaning Republicans pick Gingrich as having the best experience to be president, his best-rated personal attribute, with a 20-point advantage over Romney. More generally, 73 percent favorably rate Gingrich’s work as House speaker from 1995 to 1999. Gingrich, as noted, also scores as best suited to serve as commander-in-chief of the military, selected by 35 percent, compared with 17 percent for Romney. On the other hand, 38 percent see Romney as best able to beat Obama; 28 percent pick Gingrich on this attribute. Ratings on other attributes are more evenly spaced among the candidates. Romney and Gingrich are even on who best represents core Republican values, and essentially so on understanding “the problems of people like you.” While 22 percent pick Romney as the most honest and trustworthy, that slides to 13 percent for Gingrich. Even among his own supporters, just 37 percent see Gingrich as the most honest and trustworthy of the Republican candidates. Differentiation on handling specific issues is not substantial. Romney’s got a 6-point advantage over Gingrich in being seen as best able to handle the economy, the critical issue to most potential voters; that occurs entirely among independents who lean toward the Republican Party. The two run essentially evenly on the deficit, immigration and health care. In one final issue, Romney leads Gingrich, 26 percent to 15 percent, in trust to handle “social issues such as abortion and gay marriage.” And on this, Romney outpoints Gingrich even among very conservatives, 23 percent versus 12 percent – suggesting that Gingrich’s home in the hearts of strongly conservative leaned Republicans is far from a settled deal. METHODOLOGY – This ABC News/Washington Post poll was conducted by telephone Dec. 15-18, 2011, among a random national sample of 1,005 adults, including landline and cell-phone-only respondents, and 395 leaned Republicans. Results have a margin of sampling error of 3.5 points for the full sample and 6 points for leaned Republicans. The survey was produced for ABC News by Langer Research Associates of New York, N.Y., with sampling, data collection and tabulation by Abt-SRBI of New York, N.Y. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The Republican presidential race in 2011 saw Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney as frontrunners, with each gaining 30% support among Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Gingrich was popular among very conservative Republicans, while Romney was seen as a potential alternative candidate. However, both Gingrich and Romney struggled with being perceived as honest and forthright, dampening overall satisfaction with the GOP candidates. Ron Paul was viewed as more reliable when it came to saying what he really believed. Among other candidates, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and Rep. Michele Bachmann had 7% support, and former senator Rick Santorum and former Utah governor Jon Huntsman Jr. had 3% each. Iowa voters were particularly concerned about the Freddie Mac contract and allegations against Gingrich, accused of profiting from his former position as Speaker and lobbying members of Congress. In response, Gingrich announced plans to hold telephone call-in town halls every day until the Iowa caucuses and launch a 44-stop tour to address these allegations and answer questions. The article goes on to discuss detailed polling results and the presidential race, highlighting both the strengths and weaknesses of Republican frontrunners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Harry Caul (Gene Hackman), a private surveillance expert in San Francisco, has been hired by the Director to follow and record the actions of his wife, Ann (Cindy Williams), and her lover, Marc (Frederic Forrest). Using three separate microphones, Caul and his associates follow the couple around a park. Later, he pieces together a conversation that clearly indicates the two are in a relationship and that they fear being found out by the Director.Caul is a secretive, almost paranoid individual. He alienates his assistant, Stan (John Cazale), because he won't teach him more about audio surveillance, and his girlfriend, Amy (Teri Garr), because he won't share with her details about his career or personal life. He also refuses to hand over the tapes of Ann and Marc to the Director's assistant, Martin (Harrison Ford). The Director had specified that the tapes were to be turned over only to him. Martin protests but Caul keeps the tapes.Caul becomes increasingly concerned that, were he to turn the tapes over to the Director, that some harm would come to Ann and Marc. On the tapes, Marc can be heard to say \\"He'd kill us if he had the chance.\\" When he worked on the East Coast, Caul had participated in a surveillance that led to the deaths of two persons. He worries that this might happen again, and goes to church to confess his sins.After Amy breaks off their relationship, Caul attends a surveillance convention. Martin also attends, and Caul confronts him and orders Martin to stop following him. He learns that Stan has gone to work for Moran (Alan Garfield), a Detroit-based surveillance expert looking to expand to the West Coast. Moran demonstrates to convention goers a new remote audio system that turns any telephone into a live microphone. Although Caul persuades Stan not to work for Moran after the convention is over, Moran is effusive in his praise for Caul. Lonely and enjoying the positive attention, Caul lets his guard down and takes Moran, Stan and several others back to his workroom for a post-convention...

Specify the size according to the project you're working on, whether it's a small card or a poster. Set the colors you're going to be using on your document or paper. Click on the foreground color picker on your tools panel. Select from: A). The palette containing the various colors that will be used in your graph will be provided. Clicking on these colors is the last step here. B). A window will appear with a list of colors to use on the blank canvas that you'll be using. Make sure you don't click on the daylight fades color picker because it will not take you black. C). A box will appear or your color picker set then the cmyk settings as indicated on the illustration. Next create a new layer and fill it with newly set color. D). Choose how far back from the bottom of the settings on your screen you want to set the colors. Click either on the button labeled \\" 50s \\" or \\" 70s \\". Answer:","completion":"C). A box will appear or your color picker set then the cmyk settings as indicated on the illustration. Next create a new layer and fill it with newly set color. After you have selected your desired color, now it's time to create a new layer that will hold the aged paper effect. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this: 1. Click on the \\"New Layer\\" icon at the bottom of the Layers panel or use the keyboard shortcut \\"Shift + Ctrl + N\\" (or \\"Shift + Command + N\\" on a Mac). This will create a new empty layer on top of your background. 2. Fill this new layer with the color you have just selected. To do this, first make sure that your new layer is selected in the Layers panel, then go to Edit > Fill or use the keyboard shortcut \\"Shift + F5\\". In the Fill dialog box that appears, choose \\"Foreground Color\\" from the Contents dropdown menu, then click OK. Your layer will now be filled with your chosen color. 3. Now you need to find a suitable texture to give your paper an aged appearance. You can either use a pre-existing texture or create your own. A great resource for finding free paper textures is TextureKing (https://www.textureking.com) or Lost and Taken (http://lostandtaken.com). Download a texture that appeals to you and open it in Photoshop. 4. Copy the texture by going to Edit > Copy or using the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + C\\" (or \\"Command + C\\" on a Mac). 5. Return to your project file and paste the texture by going to Edit > Paste or using the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + V\\" (or \\"Command + V\\" on a Mac). This will create a new layer with the texture just above the colored layer. 6. Adjust the size of the texture layer, so it covers the entirety of your document. To do this, go to Edit > Free Transform or use the keyboard shortcut \\"Ctrl + T\\" (or \\"Command + T\\" on a Mac), then drag the corners of the texture to fit it onto your document. When you're done, press Enter to confirm the change. 7. Now we need to blend the texture layer with the colored layer to create the aged paper effect. Select the texture layer in the Layers panel, then set the blending mode to \\"Multiply\\" from the dropdown menu at the top of the panel. This will immediately make your texture layer appear as if it is blended with the colored layer beneath it. 8. You can further adjust the intensity of the effect by altering the opacity of the texture layer. To do this, simply click and drag the \\"Opacity\\" slider in the Layers panel until you achieve the desired look. 9. Next, consider adding some subtle stains and marks to your aged paper using brushes. A great resource for downloading free Photoshop brushes is Brusheezy (https://www.brusheezy.com). Create a new layer above the texture layer, set its blending mode to \\"Multiply\\", and paint random stains and marks using an appropriate brush and a dark brown color. Lower the opacity of this layer to make the imperfections subtle. 10. Finally, save your project file and export the finished aged paper image as a JPEG, PNG, or any other desired format. Now you have successfully aged your paper in Photoshop using a combination of color fills, textures, and brushes. You can use this technique on any project where you want to add a vintage or old-world feel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You may itch inside your ear or along the outside. However, a slight itch doesn't automatically mean you have an outer ear infection. Any kind of drainage from the ear can indicate an ear infection. However, look for drainage with color--yellow or green. Also, if the drainage smells bad, that could also indicate an ear infection. If you have pain in your ear, it could indicate an ear infection. If you press on your ear and the pain worsens, that's even more likely to be an indicator of an ear infection. In severe cases, pain may begin spreading across your face, which means you need to get to a doctor immediately, as the infection is spreading. Look at your ear closely in a mirror. If you can see some redness, that may also indicate an ear infection. Hearing loss is a more advanced symptom of ear infections, so if you begin to notice your hearing going in an ear along with other symptoms, that is definitely a reason to see a doctor.

I sat on a bench in a sort of waiting room. I wanted to call it a green room; it wasn't a place where the patients would wait to be called by the doctor; it was a place where the relatives would wait while the patient was in their room. It had a coffee bar, and comfortable couches, with trendy, muted colors on the walls and floor. Everything was clean and modern without being cold, a homogenized balancing act designed to keep everyone calm during their stressful time. It was a green room; patients were \\"guests\\"; their families were \\"guests\\" as well. Here was where the families would sit and be feted while they waited to be called out to perform, to smile and encourage or to don faces of appropriate mournfulness. The old ones would put on smiles, the young ones would look sad. I think I went there because it seemed to me that it was the place richest in emotional impact. It reeked of spent emotions, and the emotions were made all the stronger, here in the green room, by the efforts at suppression--the muted walls and gourmet coffees and scones, the overstuffed loveseats and couches, as if those in grief should not be permitted to sit on benches or folding chairs.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It is a novel that is probably more talked about than read. People think: \\"It's such a big book! It has such a serious theme!\\" The feeling that they are going to be taught a long, hard lesson often puts readers off. But really, War and Peace (1869), which tells the stories of five upper-class families in Russia at the time of the 1812 French invasion, is not to be missed. Reading this novel is one of those once-in-a-lifetime experiences, like climbing the Great Wall: You will regret it if you do not try. Earlier this month, USA Today reported that a six-episode War and Peace miniseries produced by the BBC would air next year. With a complex plot and so many characters, readers unfamiliar with the work might be most interested in the characters from the financially-troubled Rostov family of Moscow. Count Rostov has four teenage children. Natasha is in love with Boris Drubetskoy, who is about to become an army officer. Nikolai Ilyich loves the poor Sonya, a ward of the family, but his family is not happy with their relationship. The proud Vera is about to start a happy marriage with a German-Russian officer. The youngest Rostov is the 9-year-old Petya, who, like his brother Nikolai, has his heart set on fighting for his country. The lives of all are about to be changed by the upcoming great war that involves many other major characters of War and Peace, such as Prince Andrei, who goes into a military career partly in order to get away from his unhappy marriage to the socialite Lise. The novel has a great reputation among many kinds of writers and millions of readers. US writer Ernest Hemingway wrote: \\"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did.\\" A comment by the great 20th-century Russian short-story writer Isaak Babel shows the rich sense of history that Tolstoy's work conveys. \\"If the world itself could write, it would write like Tolstoy,\\" Babel commented.

In a political or socio-economic context, a \\"union\\" usually refers to a group of countries that are joined together because they share common goals or policies. For instance, the European Union is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located in Europe. So, this phrase could be referring to a situation where these member countries have left a previous union and joined a new one, or perhaps they maintain their membership in both unions at the same time. Whatever the case, the key point suggested by the sentence is that the countries are experienced in managing relationships and cooperation within a union framework, which could potentially ease their integration into a new group or organization. This experience could be particularly valuable in case of dealing with political alignment, economic policies, trade agreements or any other elements that often come into play within a union of nations.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer this question, let's follow step-by-step reasoning. Step 1: Understand the concept of gravitational force Gravitational force is a force of attraction between two objects due to their mass. This force is governed by the law of universal gravitation, which states that the force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 2: Analyze the given situation Mona is holding two pieces of fruit. When she moves them farther away from each other, the distance between them increases. Step 3: Apply the concept of gravitational force to the situation As the distance between the two fruits increases, the gravitational force between them will follow the inverse square law. This means that when the distance between them doubles, the gravitational force will reduce to a quarter of its original value; if the distance triples, the gravitational force will be reduced to a ninth of its original value, and so on. Step 4: Determine the answer to the question Based on the inverse square law, when Mona moves the two pieces of fruit farther away from each other, the gravitational force between them decreases. So, the answer to this question is: The gravitational force between the two fruits decreases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces, which left robbers free to prey on travelers. This is implicitly illustrated in novels by the terror that night travel inspired in the main characters. The shōen system enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite; the economic surplus can be linked to the cultural developments of the Heian period and the \\"pursuit of arts\\". The major Buddhist temples in Heian-kyō and Nara also made use of the shōen. The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater \\"organizational dynamism\\". Question: Why were travelers often robbed under Fujiwara rule?","completion":"Travelers were often robbed under the Fujiwara rule due to several interconnected factors that collectively weakened the governance, security, and overall stability of the Heian period in Japan. Some of these factors were the Fujiwara rulers' failure to maintain adequate police forces, the shōen system that enabled the accumulation of wealth by an aristocratic elite, and the influence of Buddhist temples and their affiliated networks. 1. Insufficient police forces: The Fujiwara rulers did not provide enough investment or resources in maintaining a strong and effective police force. Their focus on consolidating and maintaining power in the regency system led to a lack of prioritization when it came to public safety and order. This, in turn, resulted in a weakened and underfunded police system that struggled to protect travelers from robbers. 2. The shōen system: A prominent social and economic structure of the Heian period was the shōen system, in which land holdings were organized, governed, and often exempted from taxes. The system enabled the aristocracy to accumulate vast wealth and resources, further entrenching social inequality and alienating the impoverished population. Consequently, many individuals resorted to robbery and crime, particularly targeting travelers, as a means of survival. 3. Cultural developments and the focus on arts: As the aristocratic elite accumulated wealth, there was more focus on ostentatious displays of culture, arts, and refined living within the Heian court. This pursuit of cultural development led to a lack of attention on strengthening the rule of law, social stability, and public security, which indirectly contributed to the increase in crime and robberies targeting travelers during this period. 4. Influence of major Buddhist temples: Some major Buddhist temples in Heian-kyō and Nara, which were integral cultural and religious institutions, also utilized the shōen system to accumulate wealth and resources. They established branches in rural areas and integrated certain Shinto shrines within their networks, creating an \\"organizational dynamism\\" that fueled the expansion of religious influence. While this expansion had its cultural benefits, it also contributed to the decentralization of power and the decline of state authority, which further weakened the security for travelers who were vulnerable to robberies. In conclusion, travelers were often robbed under Fujiwara rule due to a combination of factors, such as the lack of adequate police forces, the wealth disparity created by the shōen system, the focus on cultural developments and arts, and the diminishing central authority fueled by the growing influence of Buddhist temples. All these factors contributed to an environment where crime could thrive, and travelers, unfortunately, bore the brunt of this insecurity."},{"prompt":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population? , can you please find it? In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \\"Black Prince\\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \\"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area. Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \\"earth energy\\". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their \\"own spiritual ancestors\\" and because the sites were once...

Introduction The term \\"middle class\\" describes the social stratum that falls between the working class and the upper class, usually characterized by moderate income and social standing. But how can you tell where exactly you fall in this broad category? It may not come down to just your income, but also your lifestyle, taste, and style. The possessions we accumulate over time often reveal a lot about our socio-economic status. In this article, we present a list of everyday items that could reveal just how middle class you are. Tally up your possessions and see how many you own! 1. Branded Coffee Machines Having a branded coffee machine, such as a Nespresso or Keurig, in your kitchen is a sure sign of middle-class status. Not only do these machines brew a premium cup of coffee, but they also reflect an investment in convenience and style. 2. Smart Home Devices The use of smart home devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home, or Apple HomePod is becoming increasingly popular among the middle class. These gadgets offer a touch of modern luxury and convenience, making everyday tasks easier and more enjoyable. 3. High-End Kitchenware Owning high-end kitchenware and appliances, such as a KitchenAid mixer or a Vitamix blender, suggests that you not only take your cooking seriously but also have the means to invest in top-notch equipment. 4. Subscription Boxes Subscription boxes, such as meal delivery services (e.g., Blue Apron, Hello Fresh), wine club memberships, or wellness boxes, reflect both a taste for curated experiences and the disposable income to enjoy them. 5. Smart Thermostats The eco-conscious middle class is investing in smart thermostats like Nest or Ecobee to save energy and money. These devices allow you to control your home's temperature from your smartphone and learn your habits to help save energy. 6. Designer Handbags and Accessories Owning a designer handbag or accessory isn't just about looking good; it's also about signalling your social status. Brands like Michael Kors, Coach, and Kate Spade are often considered synonymous with the middle-class lifestyle. 7. Organic and Artisanal Food Products A well-stocked pantry with organic, non-GMO, or artisanal food brands suggests a prioritization of health, taste, and quality, which is often indicative of a middle-class mindset. 8. High-Quality Bedding Investing in high-quality bedding from brands like Brooklinen, Parachute, or Boll & Branch is another possession that signifies middle-class status. It shows you value comfort and are willing to pay for it. 9. Fitness and Outdoor Gear Owning premium-brand fitness equipment or outdoor gear suggests you have both the means and the inclination to keep fit and enjoy nature. Items like Fitbits, bicycles from top brands, or high-quality camping gear are often emblematic of middle-class life. 10. Your Vehicle While owning a car isn't exclusive to the middle class, the type of car you own can reveal much about your socio-economic status. Cars like Honda, Toyota, and Volkswagen are considered reliable, practical, and well-suited for middle-class individuals and families. Conclusion Your possessions can say a lot about your socio-economic status and values. While this list offers just a snapshot of the items and brands commonly associated with middle-class lifestyles, it's essential to remember that social classes can't be solely defined by material possessions.

The butterfly life cycle primarily depends on factors such as environmental conditions, availability of food, and the specific species of the butterfly. These factors collectively influence the number of eggs being laid and the subsequent hatching of caterpillars. In detail, the butterfly's life cycle involves four distinct stages, starting with the egg stage. Female butterflies lay their eggs on host plants that caterpillars can feed on after hatching. The choice of host plant is critical since caterpillars have highly specific diets. The availability of suitable host plants is thus an essential factor for egg-laying and caterpillar survival. The second stage involves hatching of eggs and the emergence of caterpillars (larvae). Environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and the presence of predators can affect the egg's survival and the caterpillar's hatching rate. Moreover, given their tiny and delicate nature, butterfly eggs are also vulnerable to parasitism by other insects like wasps. Once hatched, caterpillars undergo the larval stage, during which they grow and feed. As the caterpillars grow, they molt (lose their skin) several times to accommodate their increasing size. In this stage, the caterpillar's diet, environmental factors, and predation play a vital role in their development. Next is the pupal stage or the chrysalis when the caterpillar initiates metamorphosis - a remarkable transformation into a butterfly. Hormonal changes cause the caterpillar's body to break down and reorganize, giving rise to the adult butterfly. This stage is also vulnerable to external factors such as temperature and predators like birds or insects. Finally, the adult butterfly emerges out of the chrysalis and flies away. It then seeks a mate and reproduces, starting the cycle anew. In conclusion, the factors influencing the butterfly life cycle and the number of eggs hatching into caterpillars are primarily related to butterflies' biology, environmental conditions, and the availability of resources. Human activities like attending more AA meetings do not have a direct impact on this natural process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mysterio refused to take off his LWO colors and was attacked by the nWo as a result. This led to a match at SuperBrawl IX where Mysterio and tag partner Konnan lost a \\"Hair vs. Mask match\\" against Kevin Nash and Scott Hall, forcing Mysterio to remove his mask. After the match, he phoned his uncle to tell him the news. Mysterio has publicly expressed his disappointment over being unmasked: Mysterio later became a \\"giant killer\\" by defeating large opponents such as Kevin Nash, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Scott Norton. He faced Nash at Uncensored in a match where Lex Luger interfered and helped Nash in winning the match. Although he participated in several notable matches with some of the heavyweight top card wrestlers, it was made very clear to him that he would never receive a push to become a main eventer. This was due to Eric Bischoff utilizing cruiserweights as alternative, mid-card entertainment as opposed to the more conventional style that led WCW programming. The next night on the March 15 Nitro, he defeated Billy Kidman to win his fifth Cruiserweight Championship. On the March 22 Spring Breakout episode of Nitro, Mysterio got his first shot at the WCW World Heavyweight Championship against champion Ric Flair when the names of (allegedly) nearly everyone in the company were put into a hat and a lottery was held. El Dandy was the lottery winner, but he was injured, and Mysterio took the shot instead. The match ended with a disqualification win for Flair, even though Arn Anderson's interference on Flair's behalf should have theoretically disqualified Flair. The following week, Mysterio and Kidman teamed with each other and defeated Flair's Four Horsemen stablemates Chris Benoit and Dean Malenko to win the WCW World Tag Team Championship, making Mysterio a double champion.

Product review: If you consider its date, it seems Malicious can be taken as a kind of farewell to the common themes of 60s and 70s Italian cinema: wearing them out by taking them to sardonic extremes. In that sense, this film succeeds. I recommend it. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"The review in question can be said to depict the product, the film Malicious, in a predominantly flattering light. The reviewer approaches the film from a perspective that acknowledges and appreciates its place within the context of 60s and 70s Italian cinema. By recognizing the film as a farewell to the common themes of that era, the reviewer suggests that Malicious effectively represents a turning point in Italian cinema, marking an end to a previously established style and opening the door to new forms and themes. Moreover, the reviewer praises the film for \\"wearing out\\" these common themes by taking them to \\"sardonic extremes.\\" This observation demonstrates the reviewer's appreciation for both the film's critical approach to the conventional themes of Italian cinema and its creative, if not provocative, execution. The use of the term \\"sardonic\\" suggests that the film employs irony and wit in its treatment of these themes, further highlighting the reviewer's favorable view of the film's tone and direction. In addition to this contextual appreciation, the reviewer directly recommends the film to potential viewers. This recommendation makes it clear that the reviewer believes Malicious to be an enjoyable or valuable viewing experience, further emphasizing the positive light in which the product is depicted. It is important to note, however, that the review is not entirely void of criticism. By stating that Malicious can be seen as a \\"farewell\\" to the common themes of 60s and 70s Italian cinema, the reviewer implies that the film may not be wholly original or groundbreaking. That being said, their emphasis on the film's function as a marker of change and their ultimate recommendation suggests that any critique is mild and overshadowed by the flattering aspects of the review. In conclusion, this review of Malicious primarily depicts the film in a flattering light. By positioning the film as a turning point in Italian cinema and praising its sardonic approach to the common themes of 60s and 70s Italian cinema, the reviewer demonstrates a nuanced appreciation for the product. This appreciation, coupled with the direct recommendation to potential viewers, creates an overall positive image of the film. While the review does contain a hint of criticism, it is ultimately outweighed by the positive aspects, and the product is portrayed to be both valuable and enjoyable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I haven't seen an official statement from anyone at the White House -- and we probably won't. Keep in mind, anti-discrimination language was supposed to be included in the health insurance reform bill, but the LGBT provisions got stripped out: Baldwin had sought and secured four pro-gay provisions in the original House version of health care reform, including a prohibition on discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in health care. But neither the Senate bill nor President Obama’s proposal late last month included those provisions. Baldwin had held out hope, as late as Thursday morning, that at least two of the provisions might be added back under whatever legislative package the House and Senate would eventually vote on. But by Thursday afternoon, when the text of that final package was posted on the Internet, that hope was quashed. Richard Socarides, who advised President Bill Clinton on gay rights issues, said that while the memorandum on its own did not grant any new rights, it did “draw attention to the very real and tragic situations many gays and lesbians face when a partner is hospitalized.” Ordering the Department of Health and Human Services to find a better way to handle such situations, Mr. Socarides said, is “the kind of thing the gay community was hoping Obama would do right after he was inaugurated.” So, this is finally a good move by the President and partially makes up for what was lost in the health care bill. Because Obama actually took some pro-LGBT action, there's been a lot of hyperventilating about it from the usual suspects. As always, Richard Socarides provides some perspective We did hope that Obama would have taken some action after the inauguration on the low-hanging fruit. And, let's be honest, this wasn't a heavy lift. The President didn't expend any political capital on it. But, there are some issues coming up, including ENDA and DADT, that will require his direct engagement. He promised.It just makes me realize how far we have to go to achieve equality when something as basic as hospital visits is treated as an earth-shattering development.The two-page memo is here: ||||| Good move by President Obama: Respecting the Rights of Hospital Patients to Receive Visitors and to Designate Surrogate Decision Makers for Medical Emergencies There are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital. In these hours of need and moments of pain and anxiety, all of us would hope to have a hand to hold, a shoulder on which to lean — a loved one to be there for us, as we would be there for them. Yet every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindnesses and caring of a loved one at their sides — whether in a sudden medical emergency or a rolonged hospital stay. Often, a widow or widower with no children is denied the support and comfort of a good friend. Members of religious orders are sometimes unable to choose someone other than an immediate family member to visit them and make medical decisions on their behalf. Also uniquely affected are gay and lesbian Americans who are often barred from the bedsides of the partners with whom they may have spent decades of their lives — unable to be there for the person they love, and unable to act as a legal surrogate if their partner is incapacitated. *** Many States have taken steps to try to put an end to these problems. North Carolina recently amended its Patients’ Bill of Rights to give each patient “the right to designate visitors who shall receive the same visitation privileges as the patient’s immediate family members, regardless of whether the visitors are legally related to the patient” — a right that applies in every hospital in the State. Delaware, Nebraska, and Minnesota have adopted similar laws. My Administration can expand on these important steps to ensure that patients can receive compassionate care and equal treatment during their hospital stays. By this memorandum, I request that you take the following steps… ||||| OVERDUE PROGRESS ON HOSPITAL VISITATION RIGHTS.... The Obama administration has taken some important steps over the last year on gay rights, but arguably none is more important than the change announced last night. President Obama on Thursday ordered his health secretary to issue new rules aimed at granting hospital visiting rights to same-sex partners. The White House announced the rule changes, which will also make it easier for gay men and lesbians to make medical decisions on behalf of their partners, in a memorandum released Thursday night. In it, the president said the new rules would affect any hospital that participates in Medicare or Medicaid, the government programs to cover the elderly and the poor. \\"Every day, all across America, patients are denied the kindness and caring of a loved one at their sides,\\" Mr. Obama said in the memorandum, adding that the rules could also help widows and widowers who rely on friends and members of religious orders who care for one another. But he says gay men and lesbians are \\"uniquely affected\\" because they are often barred from visiting partners with whom they have spent decades. Because nearly every American hospital receives at least some federal funding, the policy change is expected to have a significant national impact. It will not be immediate -- HHS will begin a rule-making process -- but the shift is expected to take effect later this year. The change was reportedly inspired, at least in part, by the ordeal a Florida family endured in 2007. Lisa Pond was stricken with a fatal brain aneurysm, and partner of 18 years, Janice Langbehn, and their four adopted children, were prohibited from seeing her. Langbehn had power of attorney for Pond, but officials still refused. Pond died before her loved ones were even allowed into her hospital room. Last night, President Obama called Langbehn to tell her about his administration's new policy. \\"I was so humbled that he would know Lisa's name and know our story,\\" Langbehn told the NYT. \\"He apologized for how we were treated. For the last three years, that's what I've been asking the hospital to do. Even now, three years later, they still refuse to apologize to the children and I for the fact that Lisa died alone.\\" A spokesperson for the Family Research Council, a leading anti-gay religious right group, characterized the policy shift as \\"pandering,\\" and whined, \\"The memorandum undermines the definition of marriage.\\" This is the same Family Research Council that recently labeled Obama \\"our first gay president.\\" Whatever. The far-right can pout and send ugly fundraising letters about this, but decent people will still be able to consider this development for what it is: another breakthrough for decency, compassion, and common sense. ||||| There are few moments in our lives that call for greater compassion and companionship than when a loved one is admitted to the hospital.

Kenneth went to the store to buy a cage for William's new pet rabbit.","completion":"Kenneth woke up one Sunday morning with the exciting task ahead of him: to buy a cage for William’s new pet rabbit. It was a sunny day, with a gentle breeze whispering through the leaves of the trees lining their neighborhood. William had always wanted a pet rabbit, and he was finally getting one after his excellent progress report card. Kenneth, as the doting older brother, volunteered to go to the pet store and select a cage that would provide the perfect home for the new furry friend. The pet store was located in the shopping district downtown, where all the specialty stores were arranged alongside each other. Kenneth put on a comfortable pair of sneakers and his blue cap, grabbed his wallet, and walked out the door. He sauntered down the sidewalk, occasionally pausing to marvel at the vibrant-colored flowers and green foliage that decorated the landscape. It was a perfect day to be outdoors. As Kenneth approached the shopping district, he overheard the hustle and bustle of people walking there; the weekend was always a busy time for these stores. After crossing a few blocks, he arrived at \\"Happy Tails Pet Supplies,\\" a popular store with a reputation for quality products and excellent customer service. Kenneth took a deep breath and entered the store, excited to make a well-informed decision. Upon entering the store, Kenneth was met with a melodic playlist of pet-themed songs that evoked the happy nature of owning a furry companion. Various pet supplies, including toys, food, and grooming products, covered the shelves, and just beyond was an impressive display of cages and enclosures for different types of small animals. He wandered through the aisles, taking a moment to glance at the colorful fish swimming gracefully in their tanks, and smiled while observing the playful antics of the puppies waiting for their forever homes. Finally, he arrived at the rabbit cage section. The store had a wide variety of cages, ranging in sizes and designs, with various accessories to enhance the rabbit's quality of life. Kenneth ran his fingers through the metallic bars, mentally assessing each option. Were they sturdy enough to keep the rabbit secure? Was there plenty of ventilation? What about ease of cleaning? Before he could finalize his decision, Kenneth decided to consult with a store associate. He found Ms. Kathy, who was deftly restocking the birdseed section with a meticulous attention to detail. With a genuine smile, she listened to Kenneth's requirements, offering her expertise and suggestions. They discussed different types of bedding, the importance of providing a hideout, and the necessity of having ample space for the rabbit to stretch and exercise. With Ms. Kathy's help, Kenneth finally decided on a spacious cage with a removable base for easy cleaning. It had a cute little hideout and enough room for a food bowl, water bottle, and a litter pan. He also picked up some bedding made from recycled paper, as it was eco-friendly and had excellent odor control. Kenneth happily paid for the cage and supplies at the register, thanking Ms. Kathy for her assistance and advice. He left the store, carrying the rabbit’s new home with pride, eager to show William and set up the new pet rabbit’s living space. Their family had made a careful decision together, and they all knew this rabbit would be a beloved addition to their home. As Kenneth walked back, he couldn’t help but reflect on the day's events. He had spent a lovely day outdoors, fueled by the spirit of brotherhood, learned about caring for rabbits, and met some wonderful people at the pet store. Feeling a warmth in his heart, he knew he had played an important role in bringing a new source of joy and love to their family. Overall, he couldn't have asked for a better day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. There's a lot riding on the Nokia Lumia 900. While Windows Phones until now have generally been capable if not outstanding devices, the Lumia 900 brings Microsoft's mobile platform to a new level. Not only does it add a super-fast LTE connection from AT&T, but it'll also serve as a flagship device for Nokia and Microsoft, at least until Windows Phone 8 devices come later in the year. I've been using the Lumia 900 for the past week, and it's a great smartphone. It's also an excellent example of just how far the Windows Phone platform has come since its debut a year and a half ago. Good Windows Phone apps used to be in extremely short supply, but I was pleasantly surprised to see many of the same apps that I use regularly on iOS in the Windows Phone Marketplace. Foursquare? Check. eBay? Check. Spotify? It's there. Readability? Yep. Kindle? Got it. Pulse? Totally. There's even Foodspotting, yo. Still, there's no Instagram, Pinterest, Flipboard or Hulu Plus. So the Marketplace -- recently clocked at 65,000 apps to the iPhone's 600,000 -- certainly has some catching up to do. But if you're not already locked into another platform, it's reassuring to know Windows Phone has the essentials covered. Metro stretches out. Most of those apps look gorgeous on the Lumia 900â€²s 4.3-inch OLED screen. Indeed, the increasing sizes on today's smartphones are perfect for Windows Phone's Metro interface. Its design favors big fonts and splash layouts that stretch to the screen's edges and beyond. Windows Phone works best when it's got lots of real estate to work with. For example, Foursquare makes the multiple menus in the app feel like one giant poster. My friends, activity and checkins are all partitioned into pretty columns. The iOS and Android versions look claustrophobic by comparison (see below). The seamless Metro-inspired design isn't automatic, however, and your mileage will vary from app to app. Most apps from indie developers are pretty blah. The design occasionally trips itself up. Metro presents its iconography as if it were as familiar as street signs, showing symbols with no labels. It's pretty easy to pick the wrong function, especially if it's your first time launching the app. When navigating, you should proceed with caution, especially in social apps. Shares and check-ins can happen before you know what you're doing. Begging to be touched. Pretty design is one thing, but usability is another. Windows Phone begs to be touched, swiped and pinched, even more than iOS or Android. The big layouts practically beg you to see what's on the next screen. Here's where the Lumia 900â€²s 1.4GHz Qualcomm processor shines. It's only a single-core design (Microsoft doesn't yet allow multi-core chips on Windows Phones), but it was more than enough to keep up as I pushed and pulled menus with my fingers. The whole interface feels alive as you touch it. Besides the great UI, Nokia offers up some special apps to Lumia owners. Probably most useful is Nokia Drive, a free turn-by-turn navigation service that works with Nokia Maps (not Bing Maps, which are also pretty). Nokia has also created dynamic Metro apps for CNN and ESPN that look fantastic, especially when it comes to video.The CNN app highlights one of Windows Phone's differentiators: live tiles. The photo from the most recent top story in the app is highlighted on the app's icon on your home screen. That's great, but there's no headline or even a slug to help guide the user. What, for example, is this picture of Barack Obama supposed to signify? Nuts & bolts. Back to the hardware. This is a really well-made phone; even though the screen is 0.8 inches larger than an iPhone's, it doesn't feel large in your hand. That's partly thanks to the polycarbonate casing, which is smooth but provides an excellent grip. Nokia offers bumpers that can better protect it, but it's pretty durable. I don't know why you'd want to cover it up. The camera is 8 megapixels, and to my eye the quality is on par with the iPhone 4S, though it records at \\"only\\" 720p resolution. The Lumia 900â€²s screen shows off AMOLED's strengths -- bright colors and true blacks that make icons and artwork pop. The screen also uses anti-reflection optics to reduce its reflectance. The upshot: a screen that's much easier to see in bright sunlight. You can see just how much in the gallery below. Finally, there's that LTE connection. I managed to get download speeds up to 28.4 megabits per second here in the Flatiron district of New York City. That's pretty amazing, especially when you consider our office Wi-Fi typically got about 9 Mbps. Puttering along at AT&T's \\"4G\\" HSPA+ speeds, my iPhone 4S maxed out at 1.9 Mbps. Lumia rises. The Nokia Lumia 900, which will be in stores April 8 for the tidy sum of 99.99 (with contract), is by far the best Windows Phone ever made. Not only does it have a great screen for Metro apps, it has the hardware to really deliver on the experience they promise. This is the device that Microsoft needs to show off how good Windows Phone can be. Sure, you don't get Instagram (yet), but the world of possibility it opens is unlike anything else out there.

What is the best way to: Clean an egg shell","completion":"The best way to clean an eggshell is through a careful and thorough process that removes any dirt, debris, bacteria, or potential contaminants without compromising the shell's integrity or its aesthetic appeal. Here is a detailed, step-by-step guide to cleaning an eggshell effectively: 1. Gather your materials: Before you begin, gather the necessary supplies, such as a soft toothbrush or sponge, a mild dish soap, a small container or bowl, white vinegar, baking soda, water, and some paper towels or a clean cloth. 2. Prepare the eggshell: If the egg is still intact, use a sharp knife or needle to carefully poke holes in each end of the shell. Gently blow the contents out into a separate container, keeping the shell intact. Dispose of the egg contents or save them for another use. Rinse the inside of the eggshell with warm water to remove any remaining yolk or egg whites. 3. Prepare the cleaning solution: Fill your small container or bowl with warm water and add a few drops of mild dish soap. Mix the solution gently until the soap is fully dissolved. Alternatively, you can create a cleaning solution using equal parts water and white vinegar for a more natural approach. 4. Apply the cleaning solution: Dip your soft toothbrush or sponge into the soapy water, and gently scrub the outside of the eggshell. Be sure to work in circular motions using a light touch to avoid damaging or cracking the shell. Continually rinse the eggshell under running water while you clean, so that you can see the progress you are making. Don't forget to lightly clean the inside of the eggshell as well. 5. Remove stains and spots: If the eggshell has stubborn stains or spots, create a paste by mixing a small amount of baking soda with water. Apply the paste to the affected areas with the toothbrush or sponge, then gently scrub to remove the stains. Rinse the eggshell thoroughly to ensure all the baking soda residue is gone. 6. Sanitize the eggshell: To kill any remaining bacteria, you can sanitize the eggshell by soaking it in a solution of equal parts water and white vinegar for 15-20 minutes. Alternatively, you can place the eggshell on a microwave-safe plate and heat it in the microwave for about 20-30 seconds (monitor constantly to avoid any damage to the eggshell). 7. Rinse and dry: Once the eggshell is clean and sanitized, rinse it thoroughly under running water to remove any remaining soap, vinegar, or baking soda. Gently shake off any excess water, and then pat the eggshell dry using a clean cloth or paper towel. Be sure to carefully hold the eggshell so as not to damage it. 8. Allow the eggshell to air dry: Place the cleaned and dried eggshell on a drying rack or prop it up on a paper towel, allowing air to circulate around it. Allow the eggshell to air dry completely before handling or using it in any craft projects or other applications. By following these steps, you can effectively clean and sanitize eggshells while preserving their natural beauty and integrity."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Justification: The liver and lungs have separate but interconnected roles in the body. The liver's primary function is to filter blood, detoxify chemicals, and metabolize drugs, while the lungs are mainly responsible for oxygen exchange. The scenario described suggests that the liver is not able to filter properly, which could lead to a buildup of toxins in the body. While this does not directly impact the lung's ability to expand and take in oxygen, it can indirectly affect lung efficiency. For example, if the circulation of the blood is compromised due to the liver not properly filtering, it could affect how efficiently the lungs are receiving blood for oxygen exchange. The reduced efficiency can put more pressure on the lungs to continue expanding and working harder to meet the body's oxygen needs. Thus, the liver's failure to filter can be regarded as indirectly impacting a step of the lung's process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They are frequently ranked as one of the greatest metal bands of all time. Despite an innovative and pioneering body of work in the latter half of the 1970s, the band struggled with indifferent record production, repeated changes of drummer, and lack of major commercial success or attention until 1980, when they adopted a more simplified sound on the album British Steel, which helped shoot them to rock superstar status. Judas Priest were formed in 1969 in industrial West Bromwich, in the Black Country, by vocalist Al Atkins and bassist Brian \\"Bruno\\" Stapenhill, with John Perry on guitar and John \\"Fezza\\" Partridge on drums. Perry soon died in a road accident, and amongst the replacements the band auditioned were future Judas Priest guitarist Kenny \\"K. K.\\" Downing; at the time, they turned him down in favour of 17-year-old multi-instrumentalist Ernest Chataway, who had played with Birmingham band Black Sabbath when they were still called Earth. Stapenhill came up with the name Judas Priest from Bob Dylan's song \\"The Ballad of Frankie Lee and Judas Priest\\" on the album John Wesley Harding. No member of that early lineup lasted long enough to play on the band's recordings, though several songs co-written by Atkins appeared on their first two albums. The band gained a three-album recording contract with the label Immediate in late 1969 after a gig in Walsall, but the label went out of business before an album could be recorded, and the band split in 1970. Late in the year, Atkins found a heavy rock band rehearsing without a singer called Freight, made up of K. K. Downing on guitar, his childhood friend Ian \\"Skull\\" Hill on bass, and drummer John Ellis. He joined them, and they took on Atkins' defunct band's name. Their first gig was on 6 March 1971. Ellis quit later that year and was replaced with Alan Moore. Early shows included Hendrix and Quatermass covers, and in 1972 the set list included the originals \\"Never Satisfied\\", \\"Winter\\", and the show-closer \\"Caviar and Meths\\". Moore left and was replaced with Christopher Louis \\"Congo\\" Campbell, and the band joined Black Sabbath guitarist Tony Iommi's management agency Iommi Management Agency. Atkins continued to write material for the band--including \\"Whiskey Woman\\", which became the base for the Judas Priest staple \\"Victim of Changes\\"--but as finances were tight and he had a family to support, he played his last gigs with the band in December 1972. Campbell left soon afterwards, and the band enlisted two members of the band Hiroshima: drummer John Hinch and vocalist Rob Halford, the brother of Hill's girlfriend. Judas Priest made their first tour of continental Europe in early 1974 and returned to England that April to sign a recording deal with the label Gull. Gull suggested adding a fifth member to fill out the band's sound; they took on as a second lead guitarist Glenn Tipton, whose group The Flying Hat Band were also managed by Iommi's agency. Where was the band formed?","completion":"Judas Priest was formed in West Bromwich, an industrial town in the Black Country, England, in 1969.

Set specific, achievable goals: Begin by setting clear and realistic goals for both your academics and your exercise routine. For example, you can aim for a certain grade in each subject or commit to exercising for a specific amount of time each day. Be mindful not to set highly stringent expectations that might lead to burnout or an unhealthy obsession. 2. Prioritize self-care: Finding balance in life is key to success in any area. Prioritize self-care by nurturing your physical, emotional, and mental health. This includes getting enough sleep, maintaining a balanced diet, and engaging in relaxing activities to de-stress. 3. Develop a daily routine: Creating a structured daily routine can help you stay focused and organized. Allot specific time slots for studying, exercise, meals, and relaxation. Stick to this routine as closely as possible, but remember to be flexible when unexpected obstacles arise. 4. Limit distractions: In order to fully concentrate on your school and exercise goals, try to minimize distractions. This may involve muting your phone, using website blockers while studying, and choosing an exercise environment free of disruptive elements. 5. Find a support system: While you mentioned not wanting to talk to your friends or family about your struggles, having a support system is essential to help you stay motivated and navigate challenging situations. Consider reaching out to a trusted friend or a professional counselor to discuss your feelings and receive constructive advice. 6. Break tasks into smaller steps: Instead of being overwhelmed by large tasks, break them into smaller, manageable steps. This can make your goals seem more achievable and help prevent procrastination. 7. Reward yourself: Celebrate your progress along the way. Reward yourself when you meet specific milestones or overcome obstacles, whether it's finishing a difficult assignment or completing a challenging workout session. 8. Track your progress: Keep track of your accomplishments and improvements, both academically and physically. This can serve as a motivator and a reminder of the progress you've made towards your goals. 9. Reflect and adjust: Remember that achieving your goals may require some trial and error. Reflect on your experiences, identify areas where you might need to make changes, and adjust your strategies accordingly. 10. Develop a growth mindset: Embrace a growth mindset, believing that you can improve and learn through effort and persistence. View challenges as opportunities for growth and remember that every experience, whether positive or negative, contributes to your personal development. By implementing these strategies, you can focus on your school and exercise goals while building resilience against life's challenges. Remember, seeking validation through external factors can be temporary and it's vital to cultivate self-love and self-acceptance for true, long-lasting satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whining about how we were the ' oppressors of society', and other such drivel Because I had the cheek to try and give her a tiny bit of dignity by covering her up with a blanket. She didn't want that. We made it to the ambulance without any hassle and started to do the necessary checks we do on every patient. Blood pressure etc etc when out of the blue she decided that she wanted to release her rather large breasts.

These so-called green schools use less energy, cost less to run and are good for students. The newly renovated Sidwell Friends Middle School in the District has been awarded the highest rating by the U.S. Green Building Council for having a positive impact on the environment-a rare honor. Soon the school will treat and re-use its wastewater, saving hundreds of thousands of gallons of water per year. The recycled water from sinks and toilets, which can't be used for drinking, will be color1ed blue, \\"so we know it's recycled, just in case it gets into the water fountains -not that it would,\\" joked Emily Bernstein, 14, a Sidwell student and building tour guide. Water fountains will still use fresh city water. Sidwell students are studying the building itself in science classes to help them learn first-hand the positive impact of green buildings. It's affecting how they view the world around them. \\"If you see a [building] being torn down, you think, 'They're going to fill up a whole landfill with that,'\\" said Matthew Malone, 13. In Prince George's County, Suitland Elementary has been so successful that another green school is being planned, in Laurel, for the 2008-09 school year. At Suitland, a garden courtyard collects and uses rainwater; the roof is angled away from the sun to keep it cool; and skylights and tall windows let in lots of natural light. \\"You don't have to switch on the light switch all the time,\\" said Rupert McCave, the county official guiding these projects. Green schools tend to be sunnier and more _ than older buildings. In fact, a study done inprefix = st1 /Washingtonstate showed that students at green schools performed better and were absent less.

Article: There are only 24 hours in a day,but people can use the time wisely. In other words,effective time management is important if you want to succeed. Knowing the importance of daily matters is the first step towards good time management. Write down the things that you want to do and organize them according to their level of importance. The important thing should be done first. If there are too many things that have to be done in one day, then you have to give up doing something that is less important on your list. Besides this,you need to spend a specific amount of time doing all the activities you have written down and make sure you finish them on time. People often slow down in their work even though they know that time will never wait for them. Make sure you keep to your plan and finish the tasks one by one. Do not try to do too many things at once. Also,you can group similar activities together and do them one by one. For example, you can group all the tasks you need to do in the office together and do them while you're in office. Do all the tasks that have to be done in one place first, and then move to the next place to do the other tasks. \\"The bad news is that time flies.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I rented this movie simply because Rosario Dawson was in it. I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats. Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes, but because it was a real film. No Hollywood BS, no explosions, no corny one liners; film. It drew you in slowly, reeling you toward a tragically human fate. Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken. They like movies; mindless entertainment for entertainment's sake alone. Michael Bay's Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience. No need to think people, just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain. We'll even place advertisements throughout the movie, to keep you buying our products. And don't forget the explosions, we all love explosions. Here we make the distinction, art can be entertaining, but it's also thought provoking and moves you in hidden ways. Entertainment is rarely artful and even then only arbitrarily. Movie are entertainment. Descent is a film. Film is art. If you still house a soul within your walking meat-sack apparatus, this rape scene is every bit as powerful as \\"Irreversable\\". The distinction here is that \\"Irreversable\\" was a violent rape scene involving two people whose paths have unfortunately crossed at the wrong time and hell ensued. \\"Descent\\" is about date rape. No less disgusting. No less depraved. Just different. This is about trust violation, soul desecration and the scars that run deep. Had the character \\"Maya\\" been consenting it would have been a hot sex scene. But seeing as she was desperate to escape, the scene is sickening. \\"Jared\\" is a sick and manipulative serial rapist, and it's wholly unsettling because it so closely resembles a passionate love affair. How could \\"Maya\\" ever be close to anyone again when even in the midst of raping her \\"Jared's\\" slick lover boy facade only ever hints at slipping? She is ruined. The film as a whole is beautiful. The camera work and lighting at times removes the surroundings and focuses everything on \\"Maya\\" and the silent inner workings of her mind. All this accomplished by Rosario with facial expression and gesture. The soundtrack was excellent, a blend of everything. My particularly favorite scene being a synchronism of all these film aspects working together; \\"Maya\\" dancing in a sea of writhing bodies, something inside her awakening, becoming aware, all set to a beautifully sad Jeff Buckley tune. I don't think I've really spoiled anything here but I'm stopping before I do. Bottom line, I think this was the best film of 2007, hands down. Unfortunately it seems that everyone is so jaded these days that if you don't hack and slash, gang rape, or nuke anything then people just can't be bothered. Death isn't the worst thing that can happen to you. It's only the last thing that will happen in this existence. The worst things that happen never leave you. They are always in your thoughts. When you shower; when you brush your teeth; when you buy a Christmas present, when you tie your shoe; they haunt you. They haunt you until that last thing releases you. Treat yourself.

Summarize this article: and there is no specific protocol Because LeBron only had his arm around Kate for a second however, and it was a relaxed Advertisement Basketball player LeBron James may have scored a slam dunk for his photo album, but he put himself in danger of being struck off the royal Christmas card list by putting his arm around the Duchess of Cambridge. Prince William and Kate posed with the star Cleveland Cavaliers player in New York yesterday after a game with the Brooklyn Nets, where they were presented with a shirt for Prince George. But as the camera flashes went off, Mr James put his arm around the Duchess' shoulder - a breach in etiquette, even though he is known as King James. The eyebrow-raising moment followed the royal couple meeting pop royalty Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z - and Prince William visiting the White House for a meeting with President Barack Obama. Scroll down for video Hoops! NBA star LeBron James breaches royal etiquette by putting his arm around the Duchess of Cambridge In good spirits: The Duchess promptly burst into a fit of giggles, before brushing her hair back from her face as she attempted to regain her posture Sweaty: Mr James appears to be in need of another visit to the shower room - but the royals don't seem to mind as they joke about their respective shoe sizes Royalty meets pop: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and Beyoncé and Jay-Z, came face-to-face at a Brooklyn Nets game last night Etiquette expert William Hanson told MailOnline that although the Duchess is unlikely to give Mr James the cold shoulder, he still should have kept his arm away from her. He said: 'Although I am sure the Duchess of Cambridge won’t have worried about it, Mr James should not have put his arm around her. 'Americans are much more tactile than we Brits and this is another example of an American being too touchy feely with British royalty. You’d have thought they’d have learned by now.' The 6ft 8in basketball star also appeared alongside the royals in a sweaty top, which some may regard as bad form. Mr Hanson added: 'A shower would have been preferable but he had just finished a game – so even more reason for him not have opened his pits by lifting his arm and placing it around Her Royal Highness!' However, because LeBron put his arm around Kate for only a second as they posed for a photograph, no offense was intended, none taken and that it was a very relaxed occasion. Americans took to Twitter to voice their opinions about the faux pas, with some coming to Mr James' defence, saying that he was just being friendly. Felica Devers wrote: 'Americans hug, love it or leave it.' Jorden Curren quipped that the basketball player was 'showing some alpha male presence' in front of the prince. And Jeff Todd from Denver disputed whether royal etiquette transfers to a basketball game. He tweeted: 'If you invite me to Buckingham [Palace], I'll follow your rules of etiquette. If you are at a basketball game, I'll use mine.' New Yorker Crystal Hoff, meanwhile, wasn't quite so forgiving. She tweeted: 'Who does LeBron James think he is putting his arm around Kate Middleton?' HOW TO GREET A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL FAMILY The Buckingham Palace website says: 'There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms. 'For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way. 'On presentation to The Queen, the correct formal address is \\"Your Majesty\\" and subsequently \\"Ma'am\\". 'For male members of the Royal Family the same rules apply, with the title used in the first instance being \\"Your Royal Highness\\" and subsequently \\"Sir\\". 'For other female members of the Royal Family the first address is conventionally \\"Your Royal Highness\\" followed by \\"Ma'am\\" in later conversation.' Mr Hanson explained that as an American citizen LeBron James, when greeting the Duke or Duchess of Cambridge would not have to bow 'as he is not one of their subjects'. But he added: 'Many Americans, and other non-Brits, do like to still bow or curtsy out of respect for the institution or the people, but it is personal choice.' 'The ideal royal bow is from the neck, not the waist. Ideal curtsy is just one foot behind the other to perform a small bob, dipping the head at the same time, hands by the side - no need to pull out the skirt!' Eyebrows were also raised in 2009 when centuries-long protocol was broken by Michelle Obama putting her arm around the Queen at a Buckingham Palace G20 reception. Finding herself next to Mrs Obama, the Queen remarked on their height difference. As she did so, her hand edged towards the small of Mrs Obama's back. Mrs Obama responded - and even rubbed the Queen's shoulder - before both women moved gently apart after about ten seconds. The sight of the Queen publicly hugging another woman astonished other guests. An onlooker said: 'It was a pretty simultaneous gesture. We couldn't believe what we were seeing.' 'A mutual and spontaneous display of affection and appreciation,' was how a Buckingham Palace spokesman hastened to describe it. But the protocol concerning the sovereign has been set in stone for generations. 'Whatever you do,' courtiers are apt to warn, 'don't touch the Queen.' There was furore in 1992 when the then Australian prime minister, Paul Keating, put his arm round the Queen's waist at Canberra's Parliament House, and found himself lampooned as 'the Lizard of Oz' for his faux-pas. And everyone remembers the expression of frozen distaste on the Queen's face at the opening of the Millennium Dome when Tony Blair seized hold of the royal hand and shook it up and down during the singing of Auld Lang Syne. A royal source, however, denied that royal protocol exists. He said: 'When members of the royal family meet people they want them to feel as comfortable as possible. There's no such thing as royal protocol.' But despite this the Buckingham Palace website offers instructions for greeting members of the royal family. It says: 'There are no obligatory codes of behaviour when meeting The Queen or a member of the Royal Family, but many people wish to observe the traditional forms. 'For men this is a neck bow (from the head only) whilst women do a small curtsy. Other people prefer simply to shake hands in the usual way.' During his backstage meeting with the royal couple, James presented them with cup cakes from his hometown, Akron, Ohio. Hen then asked William what size shoes he wore, to which the Prince replied, 'Half the size of yours,' while pointing at the star's huge feet. The Duchess promptly burst into a fit of giggles, before brushing her hair back from her face as she attempted to regain her posture. Earlier on Monday, the athlete had told ESPN it was an honor to play for royalty. 'It's a huge honor,' he said. 'The stuff that you read about, people like them are only in books growing up.' 'To hear that they're coming to town to see me play and they want to see me do what I do best, it's a huge honor,' the athlete continued. LeBron James may not carry an official title, but he's certainly sporting royalty in America. James has over 16million Twitter followers and the star, who earns over 70million a year, was named by Forbes magazine as the 'Most Valuable Athlete Brand', voted the most popular athlete in America in a recent poll and has appeared on the cover of Vogue. He is married to his high school sweetheart, Savannah Brinson, with whom he has two sons and a daughter. Mr James warmed up for the game wearing an 'I Can't Breathe' message in protest of a grand jury ruling not to indict an officer for the chokehold that killed black father-of-six Eric Garner, a New Yorker. Prince William and Kate posed with the star Cleveland Cavaliers player in New York yesterday LeBron James towers over Wills and Kate as he hands them their basketball tops Not the done thing: An etiquette expert said that the basketball player was being too touchy feely British royalty meets basketball royalty: James asked William what size shoes he wore, to which the Prince replied, 'Half the size of yours,' while pointing at the star's huge feet (pictured) Earlier that day, Prince William joked with Barack Obama during his first visit to the White House's Oval Office, where he held talks with the president before giving a speech at a World Bank anti-corruption conference. He then flew back to New York to be reunited with his pregnant wife, and together the couple attended a reception at the British Consul General's residence to recognize the work of The Tusk Trust and other partners of William's charity United for Wildlife. During the event, Kate spoke with US Secretary of State – and potential presidential candidate - Hillary Clinton about the benefits of singing to babies and her visit earlier in the day to a children's center in Harlem.

To the British, though, merely touching the Duchess of Cambridge represents a serious breach in etiquette. Someone get some smelling salts! While U.S. headlines cooed over the adorable mini-jersey James presented to Prince William and Kate, who were in New York as part of their three-day visit, British tabloids led with the fact that star basketball player inadvertently violated royal protocol. While the website of the Monarchy stipulates that “there are no obligatory codes of behavior” for meeting a member of the royal family, the more understood protocol is, well, don’t touch or speak to a royal unless you’re touched or spoken to first. First Lady Michelle Obama broke this unofficial rule in 2009 when she put her arm around Queen Elizabeth II. The media went wild, but the Queen was cool with it, though, because Obama’s arms are amazing.

May attended Caerleon Endowed Junior School in Newport. He spent his teenage years in South Yorkshire where he attended Oakwood Comprehensive School in Rotherham and was a choirboy at Whiston Parish Church. He was also at school with Life on Mars and Ashes to Ashes actor Dean Andrews. Beginning in October 2009, May presented a 6-part TV series showing favourite toys of the past era and whether they can be applied in the modern day. The toys featured were Airfix, Plasticine, Meccano, Scalextric, Lego and Hornby. In each show, May attempts to take each toy to its limits, also fulfilling several of his boyhood dreams in the process. In August 2009, May built a full-sized house out of Lego at Denbies Wine Estate in Surrey. Plans for Legoland to move it to their theme park fell through in September 2009 because costs to deconstruct, move and then rebuild were too high and despite a final Facebook appeal for someone to take it, it was demolished on 22 September, with the plastic bricks planned to be donated to charity. Also for the series, he recreated the banked track at Brooklands using Scalextric track, and an attempt at the world's longest working model railway along the Tarka Trail between Barnstaple and Bideford in North Devon, although the attempt was foiled due to parts of the track being stolen and vandals placing coins on the track, causing a short circuit. In December 2012 aired a special Christmas Episode called Flight Club, where James and his team built a huge toy glider that flew 22 miles (35 km) from Devon to the island of Lundy. In 2013, May created a life size, fully functional motorcycle and sidecar made entirely out of the construction toy Meccano. Joined by Oz Clark, he then completed a full lap of the Isle of Man TT Course, a full 37 3/4 mile long circuit. Did he actually drive the motorcycle ?","completion":"Yes, James May actually drove the motorcycle made out of Meccano, a construction toy.

Context: Early in his career Richard Grenville had some minor posts in the royal household. On the death of his father in 1523 he completed his father's term as Sheriff of Cornwall, a post he also held in 1526-7, 1544-5. In between he was Sheriff of Devon in 1532-3. He was Justice of the Peace for Cornwall from 1524 till his death and also in Devon, at Exeter from 1535 to 1547. Further afield he was Marshal of Calais, a post that required his residence there, from October 1535 to October 1540. In 1544 Grenville accompanied the King to France as a commander in the English army. He was active in his Christian faith and openly favoured ‘God's word'. In the Prayer Book Rebellion of 1549 Grenville was called upon against the western rebels, and with a company of friends and followers he defended Trematon Castle. When they were unsuccessful in defending the castle, he and his wife were held in custody in Launceston prison. Grenville contracted the illness probably while in gaol and died from it on 18 March 1550. He was buried at Kilkhampton five days later. Question: How many years were between were between when Richard Grenville's father died and when Richard himslef fied? Answer:","completion":"Richard Grenville's father died in 1523 and Richard himself died on March 18, 1550. To calculate the number of years between the two events, subtract the earlier year (1523) from the later year (1550). The difference is 27 years.

During their visit, Barbara sees a man sobbing and mummering \\"I'm sorry,\\" when out of nowhere, Barbara is attacked by a zombie. Her brother comes to defend her, but is killed. Barbara runs for help and finds a seemingly abandoned farmhouse. Then, Ben (Tony Todd) shows up to the house with a crow bar, saying there are these creatures everywhere. The two proceed to clear the house of zombies and begin barricading the doors and windows.However, they discover that they aren't alone in the house. Married couple Harry and Helen Cooper (Tom Towles and McKee Anderson), their daughter Sarah (Heather Mazur) , and teenage couple Tom Landry and Judy Rose Larson (William Butler and Katie Finneran) are all survivors who had been hiding in the cellar. What follows are the attempts by the survivors to defend the house under siege from the undead. The group is left divided over what their next course of action should be. Harry believes everyone should retreat to the cellar and barricade the door to wait for the authorities. Ben thinks the cellar is a \\"death trap\\" and that they would be better served fortifying the house, which at least has alternate escape routes, and Barbara suggests that they should all leave the house on foot while they still can after she notices that the zombies are very slow and that they can just \\"walk right past them\\". An argument between Ben and Harry leaves the Coopers in the basement tending to their daughter, who was bitten by a zombie and is near death, and the remaining members of the group upstairs to continue their work reinforcing the doors and windows.

Answer the question...a solid homogeneous mixture of 2 or more metals??","completion":"A solid homogeneous mixture of two or more metals is called an alloy. Alloys are materials that possess the characteristic metallic properties of the metals they are composed of, but they generally exhibit improved physical and mechanical properties compared to their individual constituent metals. Alloys are created by heating the metals to their melting points and then combining them in specific proportions, resulting in a uniform mixture at the atomic level. This process ensures that the elements are evenly distributed throughout the solid and that the composition is consistent throughout the material. The proportion of elements in an alloy can be manipulated to achieve specific desired behaviors, such as increased strength, improved corrosion resistance, or enhanced electrical conductivity. Some common examples of alloys include: 1. Steel: Steel is an alloy of iron and carbon, with small amounts of other elements such as manganese, silicon, and sulfur. It is one of the most widely used materials globally due to its high strength, durability, and affordability. Different types of steel may be created by adjusting the carbon content and incorporating additional elements to achieve desired properties. 2. Brass: This is an alloy made primarily of copper and zinc, having a distinct yellow-gold color. Brass has excellent corrosion resistance, and its mechanical properties make it suitable for various applications, such as in musical instruments, decorative items, and gears. 3. Bronze: Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin, sometimes containing other elements like aluminum, silicon, or phosphorus. With a history dating back to the Bronze Age, this material has been used for thousands of years for applications such as weaponry, sculpture, and architectural elements due to its toughness, corrosion resistance, and ease of casting. 4. Aluminum alloys: These are lightweight alloys containing aluminum as the principal element, with other elements like copper, magnesium, manganese, or zinc. Their high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance make them popular in automotive, aerospace, and general engineering applications. 5. Solder: This alloy is composed mostly of tin, with lead, silver, or other elements. Solder is designed to have a low melting point, making it ideal for connecting electrical components by creating a low-resistance metallic bond between them. 6. Stainless steel: As an alloy of iron and chromium, stainless steel exhibits high corrosion resistance, and it can be further reinforced by incorporating other elements such as nickel, molybdenum, and carbon. This material is widely used in the food industry, sanitary applications, and medical instruments due to its non-corrosive properties. The development of alloys has opened up an extensive range of possibilities in materials science, enabling the creation of materials with tailored mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. By understanding and manipulating the atomic interactions between different metallic elements, researchers and engineers can continuously develop new alloys with improved performance and novel applications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Few Contingency Plans if Court Rejects Individual Mandate If the court invalidates the insurance requirement, the White House and a divided Congress would be left to pick up the pieces. Their first steps toward finding alternatives to reduce the number of uninsured in the country — nearly 50 million, or one in six Americans — would depend heavily on how far the Supreme Court goes, and on the balance of power in Washington after the November elections. Lower courts that have ruled against the insurance mandate have adopted a spectrum of positions. Judge Roger Vinson of Federal District Court in Pensacola, Fla., who first ruled in the case now before the Supreme Court, invalidated the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, writing that the insurance mandate could not be legally separated from the rest of the expansive law. He stayed that judgment until the law could be reviewed by higher courts. The Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta upheld Judge Vinson’s invalidation of the insurance mandate. But it significantly scaled back the impact by concluding that only the mandate itself would die. The Obama administration will argue on Wednesday for a middle ground that is driven by economic assumptions as well as legal analysis. If the mandate falls, the Justice Department has said, two politically popular provisions must die naturally with it — those that prohibit insurers from declining coverage or charging higher premiums because of pre-existing medical conditions. The economic argument is that it would be unreasonable to expect health insurers to cover the sickest Americans if the healthiest ones are not required to pay for coverage and broaden the actuarial pool. “If you are told that you can buy insurance anytime, you would wait until you got sick and buy it en route to the hospital,” said Neal K. Katyal, the former acting solicitor general, who argued the health care case before the 11th Circuit. But there also is a clear political component to linking the insurance mandate to the insurance regulations. A poll taken this month by The New York Times and CBS News found that while more Americans disapprove than approve of the law’s insurance requirement, the abolition of pre-existing condition exclusions is wildly popular, with 85 percent saying they supported it. The health care law began requiring that insurers cover children regardless of their health in September 2010, but the ban would not apply to adults until 2014. In court on Wednesday, the challengers to the law will argue that the entire act must fall along with the mandate. The court has appointed an outside lawyer, H. Bartow Farr III, to argue the 11th Circuit’s position, that the mandate could fall alone. White House officials said that they remain confident that the Supreme Court will uphold the law, and that they have done no planning for the possibility of its full or partial demise. Congressional leaders in both parties also said there had been no significant contingency planning. “I think the law is going to be found constitutional, and if not we’ll have to deal with it then,” said Representative Henry A. Waxman, a California Democrat. Representative Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, said his party would continue to press for repeal of the law and substantial changes to government insurance programs. So long as the court does not invalidate the entire law, many other components — and the taxes to pay for them — could remain in place even if the mandate and related insurance regulations are struck down. They include a vast expansion of Medicaid eligibility and the establishment of health insurance exchanges, offering subsidized coverage to those with low incomes, both scheduled to start in 2014. Other provisions that might survive include increased prescription drug benefits for Medicare recipients, requirements that insurers cover preventive services like cancer screening, incentives for doctors to adopt electronic records, and grant programs aimed at disease prevention and restructuring the medical payment system. Some health care experts have suggested that there might be ways to replace the insurance mandate by using market incentives to encourage the uninsured to gain coverage. The government could, for instance, give consumers limited enrollment periods to buy insurance so they could not wait until they were ill. Or it could tell them that if they did not buy a policy during a defined period they also would not be eligible for benefits, like subsidized coverage. But supporters of the health care law contend that such measures would insure only a fraction of the 30 million estimated to gain coverage with the mandate in place. “There are alternatives to the mandate, but none of them are considered as effective,” said Neera Tanden, a former Obama aide who now heads the Center for American Progress. Drew Altman, the president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health care research group, said that without the mandate the number of uninsured and the premiums paid for coverage would almost certainly rise. He said that the partisan divide in Washington, where Republicans have vowed to repeal the health care act, makes it difficult to imagine Congress seeking any kind of repair. “States may be forced to stitch together a variety of imperfect state-specific approaches if the mandate falls,” Dr. Altman said. “It is useful to remember that we have averaged 19 years between national health reform debates, and only passed national health reform legislation once.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"If the court rejects the individual mandate, Congress and the White House would need to find alternative ways to reduce the number of uninsured people in the U.S. Potential options include limited enrollment periods, market incentives, and exclusion from government benefits for those who don't purchase insurance within specified time frames, though experts argue these alternatives may not be as effective in insuring as many people as the mandate."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

What happens next in this paragraph? How to find the surface area of cylinders Visualize the top and bottom of a cylinder. A can of soup is the shape of a cylinder. If you think about it, the can has a top and a bottom that are the same.","completion":"In this paragraph, we are learning about finding the surface area of a cylinder with the given context. Having visualized the top and bottom of a cylinder and understanding that a can of soup is an example of a cylindrical shape, the next steps would detail the process of finding the surface area of a cylinder. Here is how the paragraph would continue. To find the surface area of a cylinder, we need to consider three parts: the top, the bottom, and the lateral surface (the side). The top and bottom of the cylinder, being identical, are circles with the same radius. The lateral surface, on the other hand, is the curved part connecting the top and bottom and can be \\"unrolled\\" to form a rectangle. 1. Calculate the area of the top and bottom circles: For the two identical circles, you can find the area of each using the formula A = πr², where A is the area, and r is the radius of the circle. Since there are two circles, you will multiply the resulting area by 2. 2. Calculate the area of the lateral surface: To find the area of the lateral surface, you need to determine the length and width of the rectangle obtained by unrolling it. The width of the rectangle is equal to the height (h) of the cylinder, and the length is equivalent to the circumference of the circular base, which can be calculated using the formula C = 2πr, where C is the circumference and r is the radius. Now that we have the length and width of the rectangle, we can find the area using the formula A = length × width, which in this case becomes A = h × 2πr. 3. Combine the areas: Finally, to find the total surface area of the cylinder, simply add the areas of the top and bottom circles and the lateral surface together. Surface area = 2(πr²) + h × 2πr. In conclusion, the formula to find the surface area of a cylinder is Surface area = 2(πr²) + 2πrh. With this formula, you can calculate the surface area of any cylindrical object, such as the can of soup mentioned earlier. Always ensure to have accurate measurements of the radius and height to obtain an accurate result."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Goal: To scrub a pan, Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Available choices: (A). put hot water and dish soap in it and use a metal scratcher to scratch off food, then rinse.; (B). put hot water and dish soap in it and use a paper towel to scratch off food, then rinse.;...I think the answer is","completion":"(A). The task of scrubbing a pan is typically done to remove leftover food particles and restore the surface to its clean and usable condition. Depending on the type of pan and the material it's made from, different techniques and tools may be used to achieve the best results. In this case, we have two options to consider, and we'll elaborate on both to show why option (A) is a more reasonable method to accomplish this goal. Option (A) involves using hot water and dish soap in conjunction with a metal scratcher. Hot water is effective in loosening and removing greasy buildup and food particles which are stuck to the pan. Adding dish soap to it maximizes its cleaning power, allowing the solution to dissolve leftover oils and help lift and remove food residues. Using a metal scratcher offers a solid and robust scrubbing surface that exerts more pressure than a paper towel would, therefore, effectively removing stubborn particles from the pan. Metal scratchers are designed to withstand intensive use without disintegrating, and they won’t scratch most pots and pans if used properly, especially those made from hard materials such as cast iron or stainless steel. Lastly, rinsing helps to wash away all the dislodged particles and soap to leave the pan clean, clear, and ready for another use. On the other hand, option (B) uses a paper towel instead of a metal scratcher. While paper towels can be useful for cleaning up spills or wiping away loose debris, their effectiveness for dislodging stuck food particles is limited. Paper towels typically do not provide enough abrasive action for serious scrubbing and they tend to disintegrate when wet, making them less effective in removing stubborn residues. So, based on the comparison, option (A) seems more reasonable to accomplish this goal because it uses appropriate tools and methods for a deep and thorough cleaning of the pan. Nonetheless, remember that not all pans should be scrubbed with metal scratchers as it may ruin the surface of non-stick, ceramic, or Teflon-coated pans. In those cases, a non-abrasive sponge or a soft brush would be a more suitable choice to prevent damage to the special coating that allows the pan to have its non-stick properties. And as with all cleaning actions, do refer to the manufacturer's instructions for proper cleaning of specific types of pans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Many essentially identical characters were encoded multiple times at different code points to preserve distinctions used by legacy encodings and therefore, allow conversion from those encodings to Unicode (and back) without losing any information. For example, the \\"fullwidth forms\\" section of code points encompasses a full Latin alphabet that is separate from the main Latin alphabet section because in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean (CJK) fonts, these Latin characters are rendered at the same width as CJK ideographs, rather than at half the width.

Article: A Korean wave is sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshipping South Korean actors Kim Soo Hyun and Lee Min Ho as demigods . Chinese netizens have always been divided over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China. And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. Top South Korean actors Jun Ji-hyun and Kim Soo Hyun recently earned a popularity rating of 24.8 percent in their country, considered strong by Nielsen Korea. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero in You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements: a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs portray the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people are still fascinated by Cinderella-type stories. The growing wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their search for a better life might have prompted many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV dramas portray. In fact, South Korean TV dramas are tailored to meet the market's demands. In contrast, Chinese TV screens are flooded by knock-off or poorly made soap operas. There are too many Chinese TV dramas that are either of the stereotyped war theme or just blindly copy foreign programs.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Exercise can help relieve menstrual symptoms in general, include cramping. Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Endorphins also help counteract the prostaglandins in your body that cause contractions and pain. Because of this, physical activity may help relieve cramps. Try different kinds of aerobic exercise, such as walking, running, cycling, swimming, kayaking, hiking, or a class at the gym. Stretching helps relax your muscles and alleviate cramps. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched far apart. Stretch forward to catch your toes or ankle. Breathe in while keeping your back straight. After a few breaths, lean forward towards the floor. You can try other simple stretches as well to stretch out your back or abdomen, depending on which areas hurt the most. Some women experience relief from menstrual cramping with orgasm. The reason behind this is not well understood, but may have something to do with endorphins released during sexual arousal. Much like with exercise, the endorphins released during orgasm can help relieve the menstrual cramps and inflammation. Similar to aerobic exercise and stretching, yoga helps relax the body and reduce aches and pains in the lower back, legs, and abdomen. When you begin to feel menstrual cramps, you can try various yoga poses to help you with your pain. Before you start, get in some comfortable clothes and put on soothing music. You can do the head-to-knee forward bend. Sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Pull one of your legs in and bend it 90 degrees so that the sole of your foot rests against the inside of your thigh. Inhale and grab your shin, ankle, or foot. Stretch the torso over your leg towards the foot. Exhale and bend down from the groin. Lengthen and stretch your back instead of rounding it. Breathe as you hold the pose, extending through the heel and pressing your sitting bones towards the floor. Hold for 1-3 minutes, then switch sides. You can also try the noose pose. Get into a full squat with your feet together. Lower down until your buttocks are towards your heels. Inhale, then move your knees to the left as you turn your torso to the right. As you exhale, wrap the left arm back behind you and around your knees and legs. Inhale and reach the right arm around to clasp your hands. Exhale as you gaze over the right shoulder. Hold for 30-60 seconds as you breathe. Switch sides. You can also attempt camel pose. Get on your knees, hip-width apart. Make sure your shins and feet are pressed firmly into the floor. Rest your palms on the top of your buttocks with the fingers pointing down. Inhale. Lift your chest and move your shoulders down towards the ribs. Exhale, then push your hips forward as you arch back. To stabilize yourself, rest your hands on your heels. Lift the chest. Breathe steadily for 30-60 seconds.

Question: Who plays the girlfriend Jolene? Title: Electra Glide in Blue Movie plot: John Wintergreen (Robert Blake) is a motorcycle cop who patrols the rural Arizona highways with his partner Zipper (Billy \\"Green\\" Bush). Wintergreen is an experienced patrolman looking to be transferred to homicide. When he is informed by Crazy Willie (Elisha Cook, Jr.) of an apparent suicide via shotgun, Wintergreen believes the case is actually a murder. Detective Harve Poole (Mitchell Ryan) agrees it is a homicide, after a .22 bullet is found in the man's skull during the autopsy, as well hearing about a possible missing 5,000 from the man's home, and arranges for Wintergreen to be transferred to homicide to help with the case. Wintergreen gets his wish, but his joy is short-lived. He begins increasingly to identify with the hippies whom the other officers, including Detective Poole, are endlessly harassing. The final straw comes when Poole discovers that Wintergreen has been sleeping with his girlfriend Jolene (Jeannine Riley). The hostile workplace politics cause him to be quickly demoted back to traffic enforcement. Despite being demoted, Wintergreen is able to solve the murder. The killer turns out to be Willie, who confesses while Wintergreen goads him into talking about it. Wintergreen surmises Willie did it because he was jealous of the old man he killed, who frequently had young people over to his house to buy drugs. Shortly after, it is discovered that Zipper stole the 5,000, which he used to buy a fully dressed Electra Glide motorcycle. Wintergreen is forced to shoot Zipper after he becomes distressed and belligerent, and shoots an innocent bystander while brandishing a gun. As the film ends, Wintergreen is alone and back on his old beat, when he runs into a hippie that Zipper was needlessly harassing near the beginning of the film. Wintergreen lets him off with a warning but the hippie forgets his driver's license, and Wintergreen drives up behind his van to return it to him. The hippie's passenger points a shotgun out the back window and shoots Wintergreen, killing him.

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: Why didn't the patient get proper treatment? Options: A. because the nurse was off duty B. because the surgeon was on vacation C. not enough information D. because junior nurses were in charge. A:","completion":"A. because the nurse was off duty"},{"prompt":"Q:Given the below context: Elgar's recordings were released on 78-rpm discs by both HMV and RCA Victor. After World War II, the 1932 recording of the Violin Concerto with the teenage Menuhin as soloist remained available on 78 and later on LP, but the other recordings were out of the catalogues for some years. When they were reissued by EMI on LP in the 1970s, they caused surprise to many by their fast tempi, in contrast to the slower speeds adopted by many conductors in the years since Elgar's death. The recordings were reissued on CD in the 1990s.In November 1931, Elgar was filmed by Pathé for a newsreel depicting a recording session of Pomp and Circumstance March No. 1 at the opening of EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London. It is believed to be the only surviving sound film of Elgar, who makes a brief remark before conducting the London Symphony Orchestra, asking the musicians to \\"play this tune as though you've never heard it before.\\" A memorial plaque to Elgar at Abbey Road was unveiled on 24 June 1993.A late piece of Elgar's, the Nursery Suite, was an early example of a studio premiere: its first performance was in the Abbey Road studios. For this work, dedicated to the wife and daughters of the Duke of York, Elgar once again drew on his youthful sketch-books. In his final years, Elgar experienced a musical revival. The BBC organised a festival of his works to celebrate his seventy-fifth birthday, in 1932. He flew to Paris in 1933 to conduct the Violin Concerto for Menuhin. While in France, he visited his fellow composer Frederick Delius at his house at Grez-sur-Loing. He was sought out by younger musicians such as Adrian Boult, Malcolm Sargent and John Barbirolli, who championed his music when it was out of fashion. He began work on an opera, The Spanish Lady, and accepted a commission from the BBC to compose a Third Symphony. His final illness, however, prevented their completion.

Poor Dickey had a very serious illness, and now he was hardly able to move any part of his body except his hands. Joan knew he would never get any better, but he was always happy and always thinking about other people instead of about himself.

Usage: A list containing dictionaries: [{'first': 1, 'second': 3}, {'first': 2, 'second': 4}] Explanation: In this example, the list contains two dictionaries.

Usage: [{'first': -37, 'second': 16}, {'first': -6, 'second': 35}, {'first': 23, 'second': 22}, {'first': 94, 'second': 1}] Explanation: We sort the given list of dictionaries based on the values of the 'first' key, in ascending order. Negative numbers come before positive numbers. Part #3: Sorting the list of dictionaries by the 'second' key when the 'first' keys are equal. Usage: [{'first': 5, 'second': 2}, {'first': 5, 'second': 4}] -> [{'first': 5, 'second': 2}, {'first': 5, 'second': 4}] Explanation: If two dictionaries have the same 'first' value, we sort them by their 'second' key. In this example, the 'first' keys are equal, so we order them based on the values of the 'second' key. Part #4: Combining both sorting requirements. Usage: [{'first': -6, 'second': 20}, {'first': -6, 'second': 35}, {'first': 23, 'second': 22}, {'first': 94, 'second': 1}] Explanation: Applying both sorting conditions, first sort by the 'first' key, and then by the 'second' key if the 'first' values are equal. In this example, we have two dictionaries with the same 'first' key value, so we sort them by their 'second' key. The other dictionaries are already sorted by their 'first' key. Final Solution: [{'first': -37, 'second': 16}, {'first': -6, 'second': 35}, {'first': 23, 'second': 22}, {'first': 94, 'second': 1}]"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary's (Elle Fanning) seemingly dull Christmas is suddenly filled with excitement and adventure following the arrival of her Uncle Albert, who gives her a Nutcracker as a gift. Later that night, Mary dreams that the Nutcracker – called N.C. – comes to life and takes her on a wondrous journey. They discover that the Nazi-like Rat King has usurped the Nutcracker's kingdom. When Mary and N.C. go to the top of the Christmas tree, they meet a fairy and, as she begins to sing, N.C. looks at his hand, as it begins to turn human. Worried about this he runs into the sleigh, but leaves his human hand revealed, and Mary sees this. Mary, seeing this, goes to N.C. and rubs his hand as we see that he is in fact a human crying with tears of joy that he is human again. The snow fairy begins to sing and toys appear and begin to ice skate around the tree. N.C. takes Mary to the top to show her his city. The two come up with a plan to shut down the smoke factory. Suddenly N.C. is starting to turn back in to a doll. Then the tree is shaking and Mary falls off, only to awake to being in her room. Mary tries to tell her parents about it but they think she is not telling the truth. Later on in the movie N.C appears to have been killed, but Mary's tears and declaration of love restore him to life and transform him into a prince, his true form. The rats are all defeated and overthrown, but now Mary must reluctantly awaken from her dream. Before she is fully awake, N.C. promises that they will meet again.

A:","completion":"The best answer for the question \\"How can Earth's crust shatter glass windows for miles?\\" would be \\"rock faulting.\\" During the process of rock faulting, tectonic plates that make up Earth's crust shift, resulting in the release of energy. This energy often takes the form of seismic waves, which travel through the Earth and cause the ground to shake. These movements, which we know as earthquakes, can vary in intensity and duration, but the strongest ones can cause significant damage to structures, including shattering glass windows miles away from the epicenter. The other options provided are not appropriate answers for the following reasons: - It can't: This statement is incorrect, as seismic waves from earthquakes can indeed cause glass to shatter at considerable distances. - It gets heated up: While heat can cause glass breakage, it is not relevant to the specific phenomenon of glass windows shattering due to Earth's crust movements. - Erosion: Erosion is a geologic process that affects landforms and topography, but it is not responsible for earthquake-related glass breakage. - Melting: Melting is a process involving the transition of a solid substance to a liquid state. This process also does not have a direct connection to glass windows shattering as a result of Earth's crust movement. - Bottom of feet: This phrase is nonsensical in the context of the question. - Heat energy: Although heat energy refers to the energy possessed by an object or substance due to its temperature, it does not specifically explain how Earth's crust can cause glass windows to shatter miles away. - Having no movement: This option contradicts the nature of earthquakes and seismic waves, which are triggered by the movement of tectonic plates.

In the video, a naked man is seen with a scantily clad woman in what is said to be a hotel room. The two proceed to engage in oral sex.

(AP) — An Arkansas judge resigned Monday after new allegations surfaced that he used his authority for the last 30 years to sexually prey on young men charged with crimes who needed financial help or who were afraid of losing their children or jobs. Part-time Cross County District Judge Joe Boeckmann resigned after a state judicial commission presented him with new allegations, including one case when a man said he was taken to a courtroom, told to strip naked and photographed in handcuffs. Allegations were made public last year that Boeckmann had engaged in inappropriate sexual relationships including photographing and paddling defendants in exchange for lighter sentences. Documents detailing the new allegations were provided to The Associated Press by the commission under an open records request. \\"He's a criminal predator who used his judicial power to feed his corrupt desires. Every minute he served as a judge was an insult to the Arkansas Judiciary,\\" said David Sachar, executive director of the Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission, which had been investigating to determine if the judge should be sanctioned or kicked off the bench. The former judge has not been charged with a crime. Sachar said Monday that he turned parts of the information over to the Arkansas State Police, a special state prosecutor and federal authorities. He said since part of the allegations stretched to when Boeckmann was a private attorney and a deputy prosecutor, the commission will contact the Arkansas Judiciary's Committee on Professional Conduct to investigate— including allegations from at least one witness that Boeckmann tried to pay him not to speak with investigators. Boeckmann had previously denied the allegations against him. But in his resignation letter dated Monday, he agreed never to work in public service again. \\"I further promise to never seek employment as a local, county or state employee or public servant in the State of Arkansas.\\" he wrote. Jeff Rosenzweig, Boeckmann's attorney, said he will not make any further comments. The documents show that investigators found thousands of photos on Boeckmann's home computers of naked and semi-naked men, many of whom were identified by the commission as former defendants whose cases had gone before Boeckmann both as a judge and as a deputy prosecutor. Sachar wrote in a May 3 letter that Boeckmann still had the opportunity to resign before those allegations were added to the complaint. Sachar also wrote that the commission planned to file a subpoena asking Boeckmann to turn over a paddle used to spank several of the young men and seen in many of the photographs. Sachar said investigators also found hundreds of checks written from the judge's personal and professional accounts paying defense attorneys and court fines for defendants. He said the commission is considering whether to turn those records over to the Internal Revenue Service or the Arkansas Department of Finance and Administration. The panel alleges Boeckmann showed preferential treatment to white men and allowed sentencing not recorded on court dockets, including performing the task of picking up trash at his home. He's accused of coercing some of the men into sexual acts ranging from spanking to masturbating on camera in return for paying their attorney fees or forgiving their fines. One man, whose name was withheld, said Boeckmann handled his case involving a child custody allegation. The man told the commission that Boeckmann drove him to the Cross County Courthouse, took him into a courtroom and told him to strip naked. The judge then handcuffed him and took pictures of him naked in various positions, the man said. The commission launched a more than yearlong investigation after an Arkansas Department of Human Services investigator lodged a complaint that the judge had not recused himself from a case involving a woman who is related to a man with whom Boeckmann allegedly had a long-term intimate relationship. The commission previously admonished Boeckmann for not recusing himself from hearing cases involving people he had a personal relationship with. The Arkansas Supreme Court appointed a special judge in November to hear Boeckmann's cases in the Wynne division of Cross County, about 100 miles northeast of Arkansas, during the investigation. ||||| A Cross County judge accused by a state panel of abuse of authority and engaging in sexual relationships with male defendants has resigned from his post, effective immediately. In a statement Monday, the state Judicial Discipline and Disability Commission announced the resignation of part-time District Judge Joseph Boeckmann Jr. of Wynne, marking the end of the panel's investigation. “I further promise to never seek employment as a local, county or state employee or public servant in the State of Arkansas,” his resignation letter read. Boeckmann sent the letter to the commission’s executive director, David Sachar, about 10:57 a.m. Monday morning. That letter, which did not include a detailed explanation behind his departure, was also copied to Gov. Asa Hutchinson. Had Boeckmann not resigned Monday, Sachar said, the commission would have filed an amended complaint to include more specific conduct and additional alleged victims. Among the additional evidence the commission said it had recently obtained were images of young men, many naked, “in various poses inside the judge’s home and outside in his yard.” About 1,050 photos had been taken from the judge's computer, and the panel anticipated \\"receiving in excess of 3,400 more photographs very soon,\\" Sachar wrote in a letter dated Friday to the judge’s attorney, Jeff Rosenzweig. “We identified many of the young men as those that your client [Boeckmann] had in front of him as defendants in Cross County District Court,\\" Sachar said. Sachar called the discovery \\"a turning point\\" in the investigation. Friday's letter to Rosenzweig included an opportunity for Boeckmann to resign after the latest accusations, providing a response deadline of noon Monday. “The lengthy, detailed analysis of some of the evidence that came out last week made a difference,\\" he said. \\"I also think there’s certain witnesses out there that came forward that were key.” The commission's executive director said his office received a call Friday from Rosenzweig indicating that a letter dated Monday would be sent. In November, the commission filed its initial complaint, which included allegations that the judge had broken 14 judicial ethics rules by offering young white men lenient rulings in court if they agreed to perform sexual favors. Boeckmann, represented by Rosenzweig, denied the allegations in December. The commission added allegations in January that included the judge asking a teenager about being “paddled” and offering a defendant 300 if he posed nude, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette previously reported. At least 12 alleged victims had been named, Sachar said, estimating that there were \\"several dozen more, if not 100 or more.\\" As part of its case, the state panel also filed a motion for evidence of past conduct, with the commission concluding that there was a pattern of alleged misconduct dating back to the 1970s. No criminal charges have been filed against Boeckmann, and Sachar declined to comment on the possibility of such charges at a later date. He added that the commission's findings have been turned over to prosecutors for review. An attempt to reach Rosenzweig for comment on behalf of the judge was not successful Monday afternoon. Read Tuesday's Arkansas Democrat-Gazette for full details. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Former Arkansas district Judge Joe Boeckmann has resigned after allegations that he used his judicial authority for the past three decades to sexually exploit young men. Boeckmann is accused of preying on men charged with crimes who needed financial help or were afraid of losing their children or jobs.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Animals and some bacteria and fungi carry out lactic acid fermentation. Lactic acid is a waste product of this process. Our muscles perform lactic acid fermentation during strenuous exercise, since oxygen cannot be delivered to the muscles quickly enough. The buildup of lactic acid is believed to make your muscles sore after exercise. Bacteria that produce lactic acid are used to make cheese and yogurt. The lactic acid causes the proteins in milk to thicken. Lactic acid also causes tooth decay, because bacteria use the sugars in your mouth for energy. Now, I have a new situation: A group of students in biology class studied fermentation. Team A studied alcoholic fermentation, while team B learned more about lactic fermentation. They later organised a trivia contest between teams. Answer this question please: Which team studied less about bacteria?","completion":"Team A studied less about bacteria since they focused on alcoholic fermentation. Alcoholic fermentation, also known as ethanol fermentation, is a process carried out primarily by yeasts and some other microorganisms, mostly involving the conversion of sugars to ethanol, carbon dioxide, and a small energy output. This type of fermentation is commonly used in the production of alcoholic beverages like beer, wine, and spirits; and also in the production of bread, which uses the carbon dioxide released in the process to make the dough rise. On the other hand, team B studied lactic acid fermentation, which is more closely associated with bacteria. Lactic acid fermentation is a process in which bacteria, and sometimes fungi or animal cells, convert glucose or other sugar molecules into lactic acid. In the case of bacteria, this process is used by various species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) like Lactobacillus, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, etc., which have diverse applications in food production (such as cheese, yogurt, pickles, and sauerkraut) as well as in the human body, where some LAB species are part of our gut microbiome. Since team B's study topic of lactic acid fermentation involves a more in-depth exploration of bacteria and their roles in various processes, it is safe to say that team A, which focused on alcoholic fermentation, studied less about bacteria in comparison."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the song that peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100?, using the article: In July, two singles were issued on the Brother imprint: \\"Heroes and Villains\\" and \\"Gettin' Hungry\\". The former peaked at number 12 on the Billboard Hot 100. The latter was not credited to the Beach Boys, but instead to Brian Wilson and Mike Love. On September 18, 1967, Smiley Smile was released in the US. The LP peaked at number 41 on the Billboard charts, making it their worst-selling album to that date. It spent most of its 21-week chart time bubbling under 100 and 197. When released in the UK in November, it performed better, reaching number 9 of the UK Albums Chart.Critics and fans were generally underwhelmed by the album and controversy involving whether the band was to be taken as a serious rock group ensued. A review in Hit Parader praised the album for \\"probably [having] more a cappella harmony than on any album since the fall of the singing-group era in the late 1950s\\", but that they \\"still like Pet Sounds better\\". NME wrote of the album: \\"By the standards which this group has set itself, it's more than a grade disappointing.\\" Hi Fidelity said: \\"... they are making the psychedelic route ... perhaps in the unforgettable city of Fresno. Until they reach the San Francisco Bay Bridge or return to the shores of Malibu ... their work can only receive partial approval.\\" Rolling Stone referred to it as a \\"disaster\\" and an \\"abortive attempt to match the talents of Lennon and McCartney.\\" On December 14, 1967, the magazine's editor and co-founder Jann Wenner printed an influential article that denounced Wilson's \\"genius\\" label, which he called a \\"promotional shuck\\", and the Beach Boys themselves, which he called \\"one prominent example of a group that has gotten hung up on trying to catch The Beatles\\". He wrote that \\"for some reason, [Smiley Smile] just doesn't make it ... [the songs] just don't move you. Other than displaying Brian Wilson's virtuosity for production, they are pointless.\\"The Milwaukee Sentinel praised the LP as \\"probably the most valuable contribution to rock since the Beatles Revolver\\" and..., what would be the answer ?

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Available options: i. no ii. yes","completion":"Although both questions focus on the possibility of dinosaurs still existing today, they approach the topic from different angles and are thus not identical (i. no). To provide you with a better understanding, I will elaborate on both questions separately. 1. Are dinosaurs still alive in the African jungle today? Dinosaurs were a group of reptiles that dominated the Earth during the Mesozoic Era, around 66 million years ago. The majority of the dinosaur species went extinct due to various factors, such as volcanic eruptions, climate change, and an asteroid impact near the Yucatan Peninsula. While Africa is home to dense jungles, these environments cannot support the existence of prehistoric creatures such as dinosaurs. The flora and fauna of Africa have evolved over millions of years, and any remaining organisms from the time of the dinosaurs have adapted accordingly. None of the known species of dinosaurs exist in Africa today. In addition, archeological evidence, along with comprehensive study and research by scientists and paleontologists, has been unable to uncover any dinosaur populations still alive in Africa. Instead, they have discovered fossilized remains and signs of these ancient creatures' past existence. 2. Is it possible that dinosaurs are still alive, but humans don't know? The possibility of dinosaurs still existing somewhere on Earth while remaining undiscovered by humans is highly unlikely. Over the past centuries, scientists, researchers, and explorers have extensively studied the Earth's ecosystems, topography, and natural history. They've cataloged thousands of flora and fauna species, along with the remains of dinosaurs in various continents like Asia, North America, and Africa. It is important to note that the Earth has undergone significant ecological and geological changes since the time dinosaurs roamed the planet. These shifts would have disrupted the habitats and environmental resources necessary for dinosaurs to survive. Although some far-reaching corners of the Earth remain unexplored, the chances of finding undiscovered, live dinosaur populations seem extremely improbable considering the considerable advancements in scientific research and knowledge that humanity has achieved. However, it is important to point out that some ancient species, such as crocodiles and horseshoe crabs, have survived through the millennia and are considered \\"living fossils.\\" In this sense, although not dinosaurs themselves, these creatures may provide a glimpse into Earth's deep past. In conclusion, while the questions are related in exploring the hypothetical existence of dinosaurs in modern times, they are not the same. The first question is specific to the African jungle, whereas the second question refers to the potential existence of dinosaurs anywhere in the world, unknown to humans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At first I was going to say giving them daily chores, but the “reward” part of that has actually not been realized yet (what with all the eye rolling and such). So I will have to go with family dinners at the table. Sometimes, “dinner” is fast food, sometimes it is a meal I slaved over for hours - that part doesn’t seem to matter. Whether we are talking about our day, learning manners, having serious discussions, or laughing until we spit our drinks - it is where grow. There have been horrible nights at the table, where we shared bad news. There have been fabulous nights where we celebrated successes and talked about exciting things to come. There have been nights where the kids can see that Mom and Dad are “at odds” and nights where they see us push that aside and joke with each other for the sake of saving the evening. When they were little, we did “About Your Day” - one funny thing, one sad thing, one new thing you learned. Now, they are all teenagers, and the conversations just seem to flow, with never enough time to fit it all in before someone has to rush off to work, to study, or to get ready for bed because we are eating “after practice”. My twins will be Seniors next year, and I know that our table will look a little different from now on. But when I look at that worn oak (outdated) table, that needs refinishing in the worst way - I am grateful for the evenings there, where my kiddos learned to be a family.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"In order to answer these questions, I will first break each one down individually and provide information on the most important metrics for e-commerce companies and the most important features an e-commerce platform should have. I will then compare the meanings of the two questions and conclude whether they have the same meaning or not. 1. What are the most important metrics for e-commerce companies? Step 1: Identify key performance indicators (KPIs) related to e-commerce companies. These KPIs provide insight into the success of various aspects of the business, such as sales performance, customer engagement, and user experience. Some of the most important metrics for e-commerce companies include: a. Conversion rate: The percentage of visitors who complete a purchase. This metric helps assess the effectiveness of the user journey and sales funnel. b. Average order value (AOV): The average amount spent on each order. This metric helps determine pricing strategies and product offerings. c. Customer lifetime value (CLV): The estimated revenue a customer will generate during their lifetime as a customer. This metric helps guide customer acquisition and retention strategies. d. Shopping cart abandonment rate: The percentage of visitors who add items to their cart but do not complete the purchase. This metric helps identify areas for improvement in the checkout process. e. Bounce rate: The percentage of visitors who leave the website after viewing just one page. This metric helps assess the quality of website content and user experience. f. Traffic source: The various channels through which customers find and visit the website (e.g., organic search, social media, email marketing). This metric helps determine the effectiveness of marketing and advertising campaigns. 2. What are the most important features an E-commerce platform should have? Step 1: Identify key components and features that contribute to the effectiveness and functionality of an e-commerce platform. Some of the most important features that an e-commerce platform should have include: a. User-friendly design: An easy-to-navigate interface that simplifies the shopping experience for customers. b. Mobile responsiveness: The ability to adapt to different screen sizes and devices for a seamless browsing and shopping experience. c. Secure payment processing: A reliable and secure payment processing system that protects customer data and transactions. d. Inventory management: A robust system that tracks inventory levels, sales, and order fulfilment. e. Shipping and order tracking: Integrated shipping options and tracking capabilities to streamline order fulfilment and improve customer satisfaction. f. Marketing tools: Built-in features to support promotional campaigns, such as email marketing, retargeting, and search engine optimization (SEO). 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Step 1: Analyze the differences in context and information provided by each question. The first question is asking about the most important metrics that e-commerce companies should track in order to measure their success and performance. These metrics pertain to the performance of the business as a whole. The second question is asking about specific features that an e-commerce platform should have in order to provide the optimal user experience and support the overall business operations. These features pertain to the technical aspects of the platform. Conclusion: While these questions are both related to e-commerce, they do not have the same meaning. The first question focuses on the performance metrics that can help companies assess their success, while the second question focuses on the desirable features in an e-commerce platform that would support business operations and customer experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The sport of curling originated in Scotland during the late medieval period. It has been an integral part of Scottish culture since then, particularly in the Scottish Lowlands. The sport's origins are attributed to the 16th century when it was played on frozen ponds and lochs during winter. Early games of curling, also known as \\"the roaring game\\" because of the sound the stone makes while sliding across the ice, involved stones with flattened bottoms and crude, natural handles. These stones varied greatly in size, with some of them even weighing up to 40 kilograms. The sport was typically played when farmers and villagers had more free time during the cold winter months. The first written evidence of curling dates back to 1541, where a Scottish notary recorded a challenge between a monk at Paisley Abbey and a relative of the abbott, based on an old legal document. When Scottish immigrants settled in other countries, they took the sport with them. That's why countries that have been heavily influenced by Scottish immigration such as Canada, the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have curling clubs and take an active part in the sport today. In Scotland, the first curling clubs began to form in the early 18th century, which led to the standardisation of the stone's size and weight, eventually leading to the formation of the Grand Caledonian Curling Club, now known as the Royal Caledonian Curling Club, which remains the governing body for curling in Scotland. They first penned the official rules for the sport in 1838. The game continued to evolve and become more sophisticated. The introduction of refrigerated ice rinks meant the game no longer had to be reliant on cold winters, and this led to a boom in the sport's popularity. Interestingly, curling was part of the inaugural Winter Olympic Games in Chamonix, France, in 1924. However, it was dropped from the main program after that and only showcased as a demonstration sport for several decades. Curling regained full medal status at the 1998 Winter Olympics held in Nagano, Japan, and has been a popular mainstay at the Winter Olympics ever since. Today, the biggest force in curling is Canada, where the sport is immensely popular. Curling competitions, particularly the \\"Brier\\" and the women's \\"Tournament of Hearts\\", are some of Canada's most-watched sporting events. However, its Scottish origins will forever be etched in the history of the sport."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Subtract the numbers inside the parentheses: 31 * g = 372 Step 3: Solve for the variable 'g'. Since we have \\"31 * g\\", we can isolate 'g' by dividing both sides of the equation by 31: g = 372 / 31 Step 4: Simplify the expression on the right side.

In fact, they move much more quickly than they should according to their size and the laws of physics. Scientists do not completely understand why the speed of these stars is so high. But many believe the reason is that much of the universe is made of something called \\"dark matter\\". Groups of stars called galaxies, such as the Milky Way, might even be made up of 90 percent dark matter. How much something weighs depends on where it is. The same object weighs only half as much on Mars as it does on Earth and almost three times as much on Jupiter. So scientists prefer to talk about the mass of something rather than how much it weighs, because mass does not change. They can work out the mass of galaxies by measuring the distance between them and the speed they move at. Recently, Jorge Penarrubia, a senior academic at Edinburgh University, UK, and his team discovered something interesting: The mass of the Milky Way is only half as much as the mass of another nearby galaxy, Andromeda. This seems strange, and dark matter may explain why. Finding out more about dark matter could help us understand how the universe began, but this is not easy. Lots of scientists with different types of expert knowledge are working on the problem. We can't see dark matter, it's very difficult to measure and we can't find out its mass. Unlike stars, dark matter doesn't produce or reflect light. But we can make a good guess that it is there because of the way things move and the way light bends. Experts now think dark matter may be very different from the matter that we find on Earth. There may also be five times as much dark matter in the universe as ordinary matter.

Becca is quickly befriended by many students at her new high school, including Jennifer (Anneliese van der Pol) but she is intrigued by the mysterious and aloof Edward Sullen (Matt Lanter), who perplexes her during their time in the biology class, despite thinking she smells of tuna.Later, Becca is nearly struck by a van in the school parking lot. Edward inexplicably moves from several feet away and stops the vehicle by thrusting another student in its path without any harm to himself or Becca (the other student is very badly injured). He later refuses to explain this act to Becca and warns her against befriending him. After much research, she tells Edward that she knows what he is, but reaches the wrong conclusion that he is a Jonas Brother.

Article: Almost nothing we do in this world is done in isolation*. At work or at play, you'll find yourself in groups, working with other people: your team at work, a meeting with fellow workers, your family, a holiday with friends, a group of students working together, a group of neighbors wanting to make changes. It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure. Lastly, and probably most importantly, good leaders need to be sensitive*, confident and be able to get on well with different kinds of people.

Around Christmas last year, we were heading to Grandma's house. The drive was an hour long, so we had plenty of time to chat. We were waiting to get onto the freeway when my daughter Hayley noticed a homeless man, no sign in hand. \\"Mom, is that man homeless?\\" I told her I believed he was. We got onto the freeway and drove away. But the chatting had stopped. Hayley was quiet all the way there. We spent a few hours at Grandma's then packed up to head home. As we drove back, Hayley rustled around in her seat, trying to reach something on the floor of the car. I asked her to sit still, worried her seatbelt would slip from the booster seat. She mumbled something and sat back. \\"Mom, will the homeless man still be outside tonight?\\" I told her I was not sure, maybe. It was a freezing night, and I started to think of the man now too, and how cold he must be. All of a sudden, as we got onto the freeway exit, Haley shrieked : \\"There he is! There he is!\\" and started rolling down her window. \\"Mom, I found these gloves and scarf back here. Can I give them to him? Can I?\\" she asked. I pulled over to the edge of the road, and beckoned the man to come over. Haley smiled at him and handed him her gift. I looked in the front passenger seat, loaded with leftovers from Grandma's house, and handed those out to him as well. The man thanked us, he clutched my hand in his and I could feel the bitter cold of them. We wished him a safe night and continued on our journey to our warm home. \\"Haley, that was very sweet of you!\\" I told her. \\"Well, they were your gloves and scarf, Mom, but his hands looked colder, and he has to keep looking for his house!\\" We had talked about homelessness before , and I could hear myself telling her: \\"Someone who has lost their home.\\" She had taken my words literally and thought the man's home was like a lost puppy.

Patricia never saw snow at Christmas.. (2). Victoria never saw snow at Christmas..","completion":"Patricia lived in Arizona and Victoria lived in Canada, so Patricia never saw snow at Christmas. This difference in their Christmas experiences can be attributed to the distinct climates and geographical locations of Arizona and Canada. Arizona, a state located in the southwestern region of the United States, is known for its desert climate. Most parts of the state experience mild temperatures and very little precipitation during the winter months. Due to its low elevation, Arizona rarely sees snowfall, which results in a warmer and drier Christmas season. While some areas of Arizona, such as Flagstaff or the White Mountains, do experience snowfall during the winter, the majority of the state remains snow-free, including metropolitan regions such as Phoenix and Tucson. Consequently, Patricia, who lives in Arizona, would not experience a white Christmas with snowfall, unlike her friend Victoria, who lives in Canada. Canada, situated in North America, is the second-largest country in the world in terms of land area. It boasts a diverse range of climates due to its sheer size and geographical position, from temperate rainforests on the west coast to subarctic and arctic tundras in the north. However, a significant portion of Canada experiences heavy snowfall during the winter months, as most of the country lies in the northern latitudes and has a continental climate. This results in cold winters with ample snowfall, often lasting from November to March, or even longer in some regions. Consequently, Christmas in Canada is often associated with picturesque snow-covered landscapes and winter sports such as skiing, snowboarding, and ice skating. In conclusion, Patricia, living in Arizona, never saw snow at Christmas due to the state's desert climate and infrequent snowfall. On the other hand, Victoria, living in Canada, was more likely to experience snowy Christmases due to the country's cold, continental climate and high probability of snowfall during the winter months. This highlights the variations in weather patterns and climate experienced by individuals living in different locations across the globe, which impacts their lifestyle, cultural practices, and holiday traditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the action takes place at an MGM-like studio in the early 1950s, that would make it “Quo Vadis” (1951), to which “Hail, Caesar” bears plot similarities. But the film’s subtitle belongs to the silent version of “Ben-Hur” (1925), which was remade by MGM in 1959, with yet another version due this summer — and there’s a line of dialogue referring to the films’ famous chariot race. Baird Whitlock (George Clooney), The fatuous star of “Hail, Caesar!” who’s kidnapped by Communists and converted to their cause, appears to be the Coens’ joke at the expense of the right-leaning stars of both “Quo Vadis” and the 1959 “Ben-Hur.” The former starred Robert Taylor, who testified on Hollywood’s alleged infiltration by Communists before the House Un-American Activities Committee. And liberal-turned-conservative Charlton Heston won a Best Actor Oscar for “Ben-Hur.’’ Baird is also linked to Clark Gable by way of gossip about a gay affair early in his career cited as an explanation for why Gable supposedly had George Cukor, who was gay, fired as director of “Gone With the Wind.” Burt Gurney (Channing Tatum), the singing and dancing star of a homoerotic musical number spoofing the campy naval subtext of both “On the Town’’ (1949) and “Anchors Aweigh’’ (1945) is clearly based on Gene Kelly, who in real life was straight. That Burt is eventually revealed as a Communist agent is another inside joke: Along with other liberal Hollywood stars, including Danny Kaye, Kelly went to Washington as a member of the Committee for the First Amendment to protest the Hollywood blacklist. Despite an FBI file that linked him to organizations identified as Communist fronts, Kelly was never blacklisted. But his then-wife, Betsy Blair, was, until Kelly used his clout with MGM to get her cast in “Marty” (1955). DeeAnna Moran (Scarlett Johansson) is not only based on MGM’s synchronized swimming superstar Esther Williams, but “Hail, Caesar!” contains a scaled-down re-creation of one of Williams’ most famous numbers, which Busby Berkeley directed for “Million Dollar Mermaid” (1952) and which included a 115-foot dive that broke Williams’ neck. But DeeAnna’s scandal — a plot to secretly adopt the child she had while unmarried — belongs to Loretta Young. Her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, revealed in a memoir she was conceived as the result of an affair between her mother and Clark Gable, but members of her family recently said that Young claimed before her death that it was actually date rape. Hobie Doyle (Alden Ehrenreich): The singing cowboy who’s thrust into a drawing-room comedy and set up by the studio on a date with a Carmen Miranda-like singer-comedienne seems to be an amalgam of MGM’s Howard Keel, Warners’ Dick Foran and RKO’s James Ellison and Tim Holt. Ellison, a sidekick in the early episodes of the Hopalong Cassidy western series, sang briefly during the finale of Berkeley’s “The Gang’s All Here,” which starred Miranda. Laurence Laurentz (Ralph Fiennes): Hobie’s flamboyant, exasperated director seems partially a nod to MGM mainstay Vincente Minnelli, father of Liza, who directed his then-wife Judy Garland in “Meet Me in St. Louis” (1944). But the ’30s-style black-and-white comedy Laurentz is directing (whose leading lady resembles Deborah Kerr) seems much more like a mashup of Minnelli and Cukor, who directed Kelly’s last MGM musical, “Les Girls’’ (1957). Though, the director’s gay gossip about Clooney’s character points straight to Cukor, film historians believe he was actually replaced on “Gone With the Wind’’ because producer David O. Selznick was unhappy with his focus on the female stars, and because the film was far behind schedule. Cukor also has an unusual link to one to one of the other models for Clooney’s character — a building on the former MGM lot that was named for Robert Taylor was renamed for Cukor by current owner Sony because of Taylor’s support for the blacklist. Cukor directed Taylor and Greta Garbo in “Camille’’ (1936), which was edited by longtime MGM editor Margaret Booth — the inspiration for Frances McDormand’s briefly-seen character in “Hail, Caesar!” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the movie \\"Hail, Caesar!\\", which contains many references to the Golden Age of Hollywood and to some scandals of that time.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: Coming up with a plan to pare back the federal revenue-collection system can be a tricky task, however. Putting forward a realistic proposal requires making some uncomfortable, possibly politically damaging choices that opponents can try to exploit. It's not surprising, then, that only four of the 15 current candidates have advanced anything more than a basic outline of how they'd reform the tax code. And even those four plans leave a lot to the imagination. Here's a closer look at what the candidates are selling. His plan One of the former Florida governor's favourite lines on the campaign trail is that he'll be the president whose tax reform boosts annual US economic growth to 4%, from its current sub-2% levels. (We're still waiting for a savvy competitor do him one better and tout a 5% plan.) Mr Bush wants to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, with a top rate dropping from 39.6% to 28%. He'd eliminate the estate tax and double the standard deduction (used by those who don't itemise their tax deductions), which would effectively increase the number of Americans in lower incomes paying no federal income taxes whatsoever. Several popular deductions, for home mortgage interest and medical expenses, would be capped, and filers would no longer be able to deduct state and local taxes. The \\"carried interest\\" deduction, much loved by billionaire hedge-fund managers, would be eliminated. The alternate minimum tax, which applies to wealthier earners who take sizeable deductions, would be out. Older workers who reach full retirement age would not be required to pay Social Security payroll taxes. US corporations would also get in on the fun, with their tax rate dropping from 35% to 20%. Overseas earnings wouldn't be taxed, but Mr Bush would exact a one-time levy of up to 8.75% on existing deferred foreign income. What's the catch? Getting rid of the state and local tax write-off will hurt residents of high-tax places like New York and California, but Mr Bush seems to have little sympathy for the plight of those in big-government states. His plan Despite a lot of talk about unveiling a groundbreaking new tax plan, the unconventional candidate's proposal is quite traditional by Republican standards. The New York billionaire would reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to four, with a top rate of 25%. Individual filers earning under 25,000 [Â£16,000] would pay no income taxes - although, in a bit of Trumpian dramatic flair, they'd have to file a piece of paper that tells the IRS, \\"I win\\". The corporate tax rate would drop from 35% to 15%, and capital gains would move from 23.8% to 20% (or lower based on income levels). Some loopholes would be closed, including the \\"carried interest\\" break. The end result, however, is that the extremely wealthy would likely end up paying less. The 2.1 trillion [Â£1.39 trillion] in overseas cash reserves of US companies would be subject a one-time 10% tax, at which point they could bring the money back into the US. Foreign earnings would continue to be taxed, and Mr Trump would end the ability to defer those tax payments. Trump also would do away with the estate tax and the alternate minimum tax. If all of this looks a bit familiar, that's because it's basically a more aggressive version of Mr Bush's tax plan. \\"It almost looks as if Trump simply looked at Bush's plan, then slashed all the rates a little further - or, you know, classed it up a bit,\\" quips Slate's Jordan Weissmann. What's the catch? Increasing the number of Americans who pay no income taxes - \\"takers\\" not \\"makers\\", as former Republican vice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan once said - may rub some conservatives the wrong way. His plan If Mr Trump's tax plan is well within the bounds of Republican orthodoxy, the Florida senator's proposal - which he devised in 2014 along with Utah Senator Mike Lee - actually is a bit of an outlier. Mr Rubio's top tax rate drops only to 35% for individual income over 75,000 - which could actually increase the marginal tax rate for some middle-class filers. Income below that would be taxed at 15%. The per-child tax credit would be raised from 1,000 to 2,500, with the existing phase-out for high earners ended. Taxpayers would no longer choose between taking a standard deduction or itemising their taxes - they'd receive a 2,000 personal credit, and every filer would be allowed to take deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable contributions. All other itemised deductions would be eliminated, as would the alternate minimum tax. The Florida senator would cut the corporate tax rate to 25% and, like Mr Bush, he'd end the tax on overseas earnings after exacting a 6% repatriation tax. He'd also cut the tax on capital gains to zero - which neither Mr Trump nor Mr Bush suggests. What's the catch? If Mr Rubio keeps rising in the polls, those attack adverts targeting his 35% top rate will practically write themselves. His plan \\"Hey, I'm Rand Paul, and I'm trying to kill the tax code.\\" Thus begins the memorable YouTube video in which the Kentucky senator sets about destroying 70,000 pages of tax rules, regulations and related legal opinions with fire, a woodchipper and finally a chainsaw - all set to Jimmy Hendrix's electric guitar rendition of the US national anthem. Mr Paul was trying to draw attention to his plan to replace the existing tax structure with a 14.5% flat tax on all personal income and 14.5% value-added tax. He'd do away with other corporate, personal, payroll, excise and estate taxes entirely and exempt the first 50,000 of all earned income. The senator would keep a few of those prized loopholes for middle-class Americans, however, such as deductions for home mortgage interest and charitable donations, earned-income and child credits, and tax-exemption for work-provided health plan premium payments. \\"I'm telling you, this is erotic, it is so good,\\" said conservative gadfly Glenn Beck. According to the conservative Tax Foundation policy organisation, roughly 3 trillion in taxes would be cut over 10 years, which Mr Paul says he will balance out through spending cuts and increased revenue from the economic growth his plan would generate. What's the catch? Critics will argue that a flat tax with plenty of choice loopholes isn't much of a flat tax at all. What about the other eleventy-billion candidates running for the Republican nomination, you ask. Don't they have plans, too? Sure. Kind of. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie spelled out his tax plan in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece. He'd cut the corporate tax rate to 25%, set a top personal rate of 28%, reduce the number of brackets to three and do away with all itemised deductions except mortgage interest and charitable donations. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has repeatedly asserted that a progressive income tax structure - which, by the way, the US has used for over 100 years - is socialism. He recommends a 10% flat tax he says is drawn from the biblical concept of tithing. Former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee has endorsed the FairTax plan, which replaces all income and corporate taxes with a 23% federal sales tax. Every taxpayer would receive a monthly \\"prebate\\" cheque covering the taxes assessed on basic necessities. Senator Ted Cruz wants to \\"abolish the IRS\\" by implementing what he calls a simple flat tax, although the details of such a plan still solely reside in the Texan's head. What's the catch? Plans that are unrealistic, unworkable or totally off-the-wall can often look good when they're reduced to one or two-sentence soundbites. Candidates in (and out of) the Republican presidential field","completion":"Tax reform is a complex and contentious issue in American politics, and only a few of the current Republican presidential candidates have put forward concrete proposals for reforming the tax code. These candidates include Jeb Bush, Donald Trump, Marco Rubio, and Rand Paul. Jeb Bush's plan aims to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, decrease the top rate from 39.6% to 28%, eliminate the estate tax, and double the standard deduction. He also proposes capping several popular deductions, eliminating the \\"carried interest\\" deduction, and abolishing the alternate minimum tax. For corporations, the tax rate would drop from 35% to 20%. Donald Trump's proposal largely mirrors Bush's, but with slightly more aggressive rate cuts. He would reduce the number of tax brackets to four, with a top rate of 25%, lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, and cut capital gains rates from 23.8% to 20%. Trump would also eliminate the estate tax, alternate minimum tax, and close some loopholes, including the \\"carried interest\\" break. Marco Rubio has devised a plan to drop the top tax rate to 35% for individual income over 75,000, while income below that would be taxed at 15%. Additionally, he wants to raise the per-child tax credit from 1,000 to 2,500 and effectively simplify deductions. Rubio also proposes cutting the corporate tax rate to 25% and eliminating the tax on overseas earnings. Lastly, Rand Paul proposes a 14.5% flat tax on all personal income, paired with a 14.5% value-added tax. He plans to do away with other corporate, personal, payroll, excise, and estate taxes entirely while keeping certain deductions. According to the conservative Tax Foundation, these changes would cut roughly 3 trillion in taxes over 10 years. Each of these candidates' plans presents potential economic and political challenges. Critics argue that these proposals may disproportionately benefit the wealthy, create unforeseen budget shortfalls, or lead to further complications in the tax code. The success of these tax reform proposals will likely depend on the candidates' ability to navigate these challenges and build consensus among political opponents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: The most important step in sobering up after drinking is to stop drinking. The moment you feel like you've had enough, or too much, stop drinking anything with alcohol in it. This will allow your body to process what you've already consumed and start the process of sobering up. Don't try to taper off your drinking or switch to less alcoholic drinks. Stop entirely if you are too drunk. Don't let anyone pressure you into drinking more than you are comfortable with. If you feel like you need to vomit, don't fight the urge. Throwing up is your body's natural response to alcohol poisoning. Vomiting can also help remove whatever alcohol is left unprocessed in your stomach and can help you to recover more quickly. If you feel the urge to vomit, allow yourself to do so. If you are able to do so, eating something after heavy drinking can help you to sober up. Eating while drinking is always a good idea and can help your body process the alcohol at a slower pace. Having a meal or something to eat will help keep your head a bit more clear than if you had gone without eating. It's unclear which foods are best. Try eating whatever you are in the mood for. Eating anything at all will help you to sober up faster. Drinking water after drinking alcohol can help lessen the inebriating effects of alcohol and help you to sober up. Drinking more water will have an effect on how much alcohol is present in your bloodstream and may help you to process alcohol faster by increasing the amount you urinate. Never neglect drinking water when you are trying to sober up. It's a good idea to try and drink a glass of water for every alcoholic drink you consume. Alcohol has a dehydrating effect on the body. Drinking water will help you stay hydrated. Moving can help give you something to focus on and help you process the alcohol slightly faster than normal. By getting in some physical activity, you will increase the amount you are perspiring, which can remove some alcohol from your system. Try to do some simple exercise or activity that keeps you moving in order to stay focused and sober up. You might try dancing to help you sober up. Going for a brisk walk can help you stay focused while you sober up. There isn't a surefire way to sober up faster than your body is able to process the alcohol you've consumed. The only proven way to sober up is to wait for your body to fully remove the alcohol from your bloodstream. Although you can take steps to help the process, you will still need to wait around one hour for every drink you've had before you reach sobriety again. Don't attempt to drive before you are fully sober again. Each drink takes about one hour to be processed. Summary:","completion":"If you drink too much, the best way to sober up is to stop drinking. When you stop, your body can work to get rid of the alcohol. If you feel sick, it's okay to throw up because it can help you feel better. Eating and drinking water can also help you sober up. Moving around, like dancing or walking, can help too. But remember, it takes time for your body to clear out the alcohol, about one hour for each drink.

On Snapchat, someone blocked me, but still shows up in my added me section, but Snapchat still won't allow me to add them. What’s going on?","completion":"No, these two questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different situations and concerns on Snapchat. Let’s discuss each question in detail. Question 1: On Snapchat, if I remove someone as a friend, can they still see the last message I sent them? This question focuses on understanding the visibility of sent messages after unfriending someone on Snapchat. The answer depends on the specific circumstances. If you sent the message while you were friends with the recipient and they have already opened it, then they can still see the message even if you remove them as a friend. This is because, once a message is opened in a chat, it remains visible for a short while (unless saved in chat) before disappearing automatically. However, if you send a message to someone, then remove them as a friend before they open the message, the message will disappear from their chat. In this situation, the recipient will not be able to view the last message you sent after you remove them from your friends list. Question 2: On Snapchat, someone blocked me, but still shows up in my added me section, but Snapchat still won't allow me to add them. What’s going on? This question is about a user being blocked on Snapchat and tries to understand the reason behind the situation where the blocker still appears in the \\"added me\\" section but cannot be added back. When someone blocks you on Snapchat, you typically lose the ability to communicate with them, view their snaps, and access their stories. However, due to some technical glitches or delays in updating Snapchat servers, the blocker's profile may still be visible in your \\"added me\\" section temporarily until it eventually gets removed or updated. Alternatively, if the user has not completely blocked you but rather removed you as a friend, their profile may still be visible in the \\"added me\\" section. In this case, you may be unable to add them back as they might have changed their privacy settings. Their profile may only allow friends to add them or they could have enabled the \\"Quick Add\\" feature, which enables mutual friends to discover and add them. In summary, the two questions are addressing different situations. The first question is related to the visibility of messages after unfriending someone, whereas the second question is about understanding the situation when a user is blocked or removed on Snapchat but still appears in the \\"added me\\" section."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: I used to think of myself as a person learned in books, but my bookshelves told a different story. Apart from a few Indian novels and an Australian book, my literature collection only consisted of British and American titles. Worse still, I couldn't ever found anything in translation. My reading was limited to stories by English-speaking authors. So, at the start of 2012, I set myself the challenge of trying to read a book from every country in a year to find out what I was missing. With no idea where to get those books, I was unlikely to find publications from nearly 200 nations on the shelves of my local bookshop, so I decided to ask the readers all over the world for help. I created a blog called A Year of Reading the World and put out an appeal for suggestions of titles that I could read in English. The response was amazing. People all over the world were getting in touch with me, offering ideas and book lists. Some posted me books from their home countries. In addition, several writers, like Turkmenistan's Ak Welsapar and Panama's Juan David Morgan, sent me unpublished translations of their novels, giving me a rare opportunity to read works unavailable in Britain. Even with such an extraordinary team of bibliophiles behind me, however, sourcing books was no easy task. With translations making up only around 4.5 per cent of literary works published in the UK, getting English versions of stories was tricky. One by one, the books from the countries on the list filled my heart with laughter, love, anger, hope and fear. Lands that had once seemed exotic and remote became close and familiar to me. At its best, I learned, reading makes the world real.

CBC's sports coverage has also attained high viewership in border markets, including its coverage of the NHL's Stanley Cup Playoffs, which was generally considered to be more complete and consistent than coverage by other networks such as NBC. Its coverage of the Olympic Games also found a significant audience in border regions, primarily due to the fact that CBC aired more events live than NBC's coverage, which had been criticized in recent years for tape delaying events to air in primetime, even if the event is being held in a market in the Pacific Time Zone during primetime hours on the East (where it would still be delayed for West coast primetime).

Jenny got human papillomavirus, while her brother Josh got infected with the Epstein–Barr virus. They were both under treatment. Which sibling had a lower risk of developing Hodgkin's lymphoma? Hint: Hepatitis viruses can develop into a chronic viral infection that leads to liver cancer. Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years. Answer:","completion":"Jenny had a lower risk of developing Hodgkin's lymphoma as she got infected with the human papillomavirus, whereas her brother Josh got infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, which is directly linked to Hodgkin's lymphoma."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:Y,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},R={key:0,class:"empty-state"},j=["disabled"],q={key:0},D={key:1};function N(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",R,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
