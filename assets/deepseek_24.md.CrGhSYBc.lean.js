Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Another thing we can see in this animation is that particles are constantly colliding with one another. One assumption that we make when talking about collisions between gas particles is that they are completely elastic collisions. In an elastic collision , momentum is conserved, which means that none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form (such as the emission of light). This makes sense, because if energy were lost in collisions, the speeds of the particles would gradually decrease over time, and eventually everything would condense down into a solid form. I am facing a new situation today: Dan is in his physics lab. He is experimenting with colliding particles. He has two samples of particles, sample A and sample B. Sample A contains gas particles, but sample B does not contain gas particles. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: In which sample the momentum would not be conserved, sample A or sample B? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the key information from the background article. From the background article, we know that: - Gas particles undergo elastic collisions. - Elastic collisions conserve momentum, meaning none of the kinetic energy of the colliding particles is lost in some other form. Step 2: Analyze the new situation. In the new situation, we have: - Sample A contains gas particles. - Sample B does not contain gas particles. Step 3: Apply the knowledge from the background article to the new situation. - Sample A has gas particles, and we know from the article that gas particles undergo elastic collisions in which momentum is conserved. - Sample B does not have gas particles, and we don't have information regarding the conservation of momentum for these particles. Since they are not gas particles, we cannot assume they undergo elastic collisions and conserve momentum as gas particles do. Step 4: Answer the question. Based on the information we have, we can conclude that in sample A, the momentum would be conserved due to gas particles undergoing elastic collisions. However, in sample B, we cannot definitively say whether momentum would be conserved or not because it does not contain gas particles, and we do not have information about the behavior of its particles. So, if we have to choose between the two samples, we would say the momentum would more likely not be conserved in sample B, as we don't have information to support the conservation of momentum for non-gas particles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Usage: The producer blends two varieties of tea, one costing Rs 18 per kg and another Rs 20 per kg, in the ratio 5:3. This means the producer mixes 5 parts of the Rs 18 per kg tea with 3 parts of the Rs 20 per kg tea to create the blended mixture. The blended tea is then sold at Rs 21 per kg. Part #2: Calculate the cost of the blended tea. Usage: We can calculate the cost of the blended tea using the cost of each tea and the ratio provided. Cost of blended tea = (5 * Rs 18 + 3 * Rs 20) / (5+3) Cost of blended tea = (90 + 60) / 8 Cost of blended tea = Rs 150 / 8 = Rs 18.75 per kg Part #3: Determine the gain percent. Usage: We can find the gain percent by comparing the selling price (Rs 21 per kg) with the cost of the blended tea (Rs 18.75 per kg). Gain = Selling Price - Cost Price Gain = Rs 21 - Rs 18.75 Gain = Rs 2.25 per kg Gain Percent = (Gain / Cost Price) * 100 Gain Percent = (Rs 2.25 / Rs 18.75) * 100 Gain Percent = 12% Part #4: Match the gain percent with the given options.

Universities Wales - the body representing institutions - said it will create \\"significant challenges\\". 854,572 (52.5%) voters in Wales chose to leave the EU, compared with 772,347 (47.5%) supporting Remain. Ms Button said the decision will not only be \\"hugely negative\\" for students and young people but Wales will also lose out on large amounts of EU funding. \\"Those funds support investment and infrastructure all across Wales, particularly for young people and communities in poverty. \\"This is a catastrophe for our generation,\\" she said. Earlier this month, Universities Wales published an open letter in which it outlined what it sees as the benefits of EU membership. The letter, signed by the chairman of the body, Cardiff University vice chancellor Colin Riordan, said the free movement of students and staff \\"enriches the student experience\\" but also made a contribution to the Welsh economy \\"worth hundreds of millions of pounds\\". It talked about partnerships with other EU researchers driving economic growth and innovation in areas such as healthcare. It also pointed to the economic impact of EU students themselves, claiming it was worth more than Â£70m a year off campus in Wales. Following the Leave vote, the body said there will be a \\"gradual exit process\\", during which time it will have opportunities to seek assurances and influence future policy. It said its first priority is to convince the UK government to allow students from EU countries to continue working and studying at British universities. A statement said: \\" We will also prioritise securing opportunities for our researchers and students to access vital pan-European programmes and build new global networks.\\" It wants to ensure the UK continues to be promoted as \\"a welcoming destination for the brightest and best minds\\". The NUS said students' unions had been fully engaged in the referendum, urging students to register to vote, running registration sessions and debates. But while turnout was higher than in the General Election, it said numbers would have been much greater among students if the UK Government had \\"truly engaged young people\\". \\"We will continue to fight and campaign for 16 and 17-year-olds to be given the vote. \\"We are confident that this will be in place for the next Assembly election, if not sooner,\\" the NUS said. While it expressed dismay that 17 out of 22 Welsh local authorities voted to leave, it called on the UK government to now include students in the exit negotiations. \\"The UK Government has committed to ensuring that the Welsh (government) budget will not suffer following the loss of European funding, and this promise must be kept. \\"But it is essential that students are at the heart of the negotiations. Any future deal will have a simply staggering impact upon us,\\" a statement added. NUS Wales women's officer Rosie Inman expressed concerns over EU-made laws. She said: \\"The European Union has been essential for helping to strengthen, and introduce, vital equality legislation. \\"The UK government cannot start to erode these rights.\\" Summary:","completion":"Beth Button from Universities Wales said that since a lot of people in Wales chose to leave the EU, it might cause some problems. They are worried that young people and communities who don't have a lot of money will lose important funding. They also think leaving the EU could make it difficult for students to study and work in different places, which is a good experience for them. Universities Wales will try to work with other countries and make sure the UK stays a welcoming place for people to come and learn or teach. The NUS wants students to be considered when talking about the changes, and they want young people to be treated fairly with the same rights they had before."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson Conquers the Legend of \\"Hercules\\" with Unyielding Dedication and Intensive Training Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson, a renowned actor, wrestler, and now the embodiment of the mythical hero, Hercules, has shown an unparalleled commitment to his craft that has left audiences awestruck. In the much-anticipated film \\"Hercules,\\" Johnson takes on the role of the legendary demigod, and he does so with a mesmerizing display of sheer dedication and determination to conquer the physical and emotional demands of the character. Taking a closer look at how Johnson prepared for the role, one can see the grueling training regimen and the tremendous effort he put into transforming himself into the mighty Hercules. The actor, known for his incredible physique and larger-than-life presence, faced the challenge head-on by embracing a highly disciplined and intense training plan. This plan involved not only hours of intensive workouts but also an extraordinary diet plan, which saw him consuming seven meals a day to fuel his Herculean transformation. \\"I trained and worked harder than ever for eight months for this role,\\" Johnson shared on his Instagram, shedding light on the commitment and time he devoted to bringing the character of Hercules to life. The training plan incorporated a balance of weightlifting, cardio, and functional workouts, all cleverly designed to sculpt Johnson's physique in a way that would make the Greek hero proud. It is reported that he would start his days at 4 am with an hour of intense cardio, followed by a 90-minute workout session focused on heavy lifting. These sessions would further be complemented by a functional workout in the afternoon, which included combat training, horseback riding, and stunt work. The importance of the diet plan cannot be emphasized enough. Johnson, who typically weighs around 260 pounds, had to add an extra 20-25 pounds of pure muscle in order to embody the colossal, god-like image of Hercules. To achieve this, he followed a nutrient-dense, high-protein diet consisting of 5,500 calories every day. His meals were strategically planned, with protein sources like chicken, fish, and steak, along with a plethora of vegetables and balanced carbohydrates. \\"I was consuming a massive amount of calories per day...but I had to be smart about it,\\" Johnson recalls, reflecting on the meticulous planning involved in ensuring the right balance of food to support his intensive workouts and help build dense muscle. When asked about the most challenging aspect of the role, Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson was quick to mention the emotional demands of embodying the tragic, yet heroic, character of Hercules. \\"His life's journey is truly that of the ultimate anti-hero... going full circle without being fulfilled...yet always seeking redemption,\\" he explained. Thus, Johnson not only had to meet the physical requirements but also delve deep into the psyche of the mythological figure, showing his prowess as an actor who brings depth and complexity to his character portrayals. Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson's portrayal of Hercules serves as a testament to the actor's inexhaustible drive, discipline, and work ethic. He has undoubtedly proven his ability to conquer the most challenging of roles with unwavering commitment, leaving fans in anticipation of the actor's next legendary transformation. As Johnson continues to inspire through his work and dedication to his craft, the legend of Hercules will remain unforgettable thanks to his hard-earned, larger-than-life performance."},{"prompt":"She told her child it was okay he was that way, and that everyone is what? - afraid of - part old - different - good at - smart The best answer is A:","completion":"different"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates - The evaporation causes cooling. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cooling occurs happens, how will it affect MORE body cooling occurring. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If more cooling occurs during the process, the body's response will be adjusted accordingly in an attempt to maintain homeostasis and regulate body temperature. Step-by-step analysis: 1. Body temperature rises. 2. The brain senses the increase in body temperature and initiates the thermoregulation process to maintain a stable internal temperature. 3. The brain instructs blood vessels in the skin to dilate (widen), allowing more blood to flow near the surface of the skin, where it can release heat through radiation. 4. The brain also signals the sweat glands to become active, producing sweat to aid in cooling the body. 5. The sweat, which is primarily composed of water and salts, is released from the pores onto the skin's surface. 6. The moisture on the skin evaporates, converting the liquid into vapor, which removes heat from the body and results in a cooling effect. Perturbation hypothesis: Suppose more cooling occurs. Now, let's consider the impact of more cooling occurring on the process and whether the perturbation has an effect (direct or indirect): 1. If more cooling occurs, the body would respond by adjusting the amount of sweat released and/or the dilation of blood vessels. The main goal is to maintain a stable internal temperature, so if the cooling effect is too strong, the body will try to minimize the cooling process to achieve a balance. 2. As more cooling occurs, the brain senses the change in temperature and may cause blood vessels to constrict (narrow), reducing the blood flow near the skin's surface and decreasing heat loss through radiation. 3. The brain may also reduce the activity of the sweat glands, resulting in less sweat being produced and released from the pores. This would decrease the amount of moisture available for evaporation and, subsequently, the cooling effect of evaporation. 4. With these adjustments, the body will continue to monitor its temperature and make further changes to the thermoregulation process as needed. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of more cooling occurring does have a direct effect on the process. The body's thermoregulation mechanisms, such as blood vessel dilation and sweat gland activation, will adjust to maintain homeostasis and a stable internal temperature."},{"prompt":"Question: What is a place that sells suntan lotion but not food or medicine?

Movie plot: The story is told in flashback by a villager, played by Mervyn Johns, as though to a person visiting after the war. He recounts: one Saturday during the Second World War, a group of seemingly authentic British soldiers arrive in the small, fictitious English village of Bramley End.[1] It is the Whitsun weekend so life is even quieter than usual and there is almost no traffic of any kind. At first they are welcomed by the villagers, until doubts begin to grow about their true purpose and identity. After they are revealed to be German soldiers intended to form the vanguard of an invasion of Britain, they round up the residents and hold them captive in the local church. The vicar is shot after sounding the church bell in alarm. In attempts to reach the outside world, many of the villagers take action. Such plans include writing a message on an egg and giving them to the local paper boy for his mother, but they are crushed when Mrs Fraser's cousin runs over them. Mrs Fraser then puts a note in Cousin Maude's pocket, but she uses it to hold her car window in place; her dog, Edward, then chews it to shreds after it blows onto the back seat. Mrs Collins, the postmistress, manages to kill a German with an axe used for chopping firewood, and tries to telephone elsewhere. The girls on the exchange see her light and decide that she can wait. Mrs Collins waits until she is killed by another German who walks into the shop moments afterwards. The girl at the exchange then picks up the phone, getting no reply. The civilians attempt to escape to warn the local Home Guard, but are betrayed by the village squire, who is revealed to be collaborating with the Germans. Members of the local Home Guard are ambushed and shot by the Germans. They begin to bow in until a young boy, George, succeeds in escaping; despite being shot in the leg, he alerts the army.

Consequently, the most appropriate response would be: B). It is not possible to tell. In order to make an accurate assessment, we would require more context about the subject matter in question. The phrase \\"does it say uh-huh\\" appears to be a casual, informal way of ascertaining whether or not something agrees with or affirms a particular statement. \\"Uh-huh\\" in itself is an informal affirmation, similar to saying \\"yes\\" or \\"I agree\\". However, without the context of what the phrase is referring to, we cannot determine if it is in agreement with \\"Does it say that?\\". To illustrate the point, let's consider two hypothetical examples: Example 1: Person A: \\"Does the book mention anything about taking a break after 90 minutes of intense work?\\" Person B: \\"Does it say uh-huh?\\" In this context, Person B wants to know if the book affirms the idea of taking a break after 90 minutes of intense work. A meaningful evaluation of the hypothesis \\"Does it say that?\\" would be contingent on understanding the book's content in question. Example 2: Person A: \\"Do the cooking instructions suggest that I should let the dough rest for an hour before shaping?\\" Person B: \\"Does it say uh-huh?\\" In this case, Person B is inquiring whether the cooking instructions agree with or mention letting the dough rest for an hour before shaping. Again, the validity of the hypothesis \\"Does it say that?\\" depends on examining the specific cooking instructions. In conclusion, it is not possible to determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"Does it say that?\\" without more context or information regarding the subject matter at hand. Therefore, the appropriate choice, given the available options, is B). It is not possible to tell.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, the only thing we have to fear is fear itself. This famous statement originates from his first inaugural address on March 4, 1933. At the time, the United States was experiencing the Great Depression, a severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. Millions of Americans were out of work, and there was a widespread sense of despair. In this context, Roosevelt's words sought to reassure and inspire the American people, urging them to confront challenges with courage and resilience. The full quote from his speech is: \\"So, first of all, let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself—nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.\\" Roosevelt emphasized that fear could exacerbate problems and hinder progress by causing people to act irrationally or to avoid taking the actions necessary for recovery. By characterizing fear as \\"nameless, unreasoning, and unjustified,\\" he highlighted how, at times, fear could be an irrational and counterproductive response to adversity. Furthermore, the quote suggests that fear has a debilitating effect on human will and motivation, restraining individuals from capitalizing on opportunities for growth and improvement. Roosevelt's message was that overcoming this fear would empower people to take the essential steps towards recovery and progress. Roosevelt's famous line resonated with the American people and continues to be remembered and quoted to this day. The sentiment it expresses remains relevant in various situations that demand resilience, adaptability, and courage. In a broader sense, it encompasses the idea that fear, if left unchecked, can hold us back from realizing our full potential. By confronting and overcoming our fears, we can move forward and make progress in both personal and collective endeavors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"It blocked 34 million of Taliban assets, 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits\\" correctly answer the question \\"How much money was frozen after the President applied the same designation to the Taliban?\\"? a). no. b). yes.","completion":"b). yes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s. - Sir George Henry Martin (3 January 19268 March 2016) was an English record producer, arranger, composer, conductor, audio engineer and musician. He was referred to as the \\"Fifth Beatle\\", including by Paul McCartney, in reference to his extensive involvement on each of the Beatles' original albums. Martin had 30 number-one hit singles in the United Kingdom and 23 number-one hits in the United States. - Brian Samuel Epstein (19 September 1934 27 August 1967) was an English music entrepreneur, best known for managing the Beatles. Epstein first discovered the Beatles in November 1961 during a lunchtime Cavern Club performance. He was instantly impressed and saw great potential in the group. Epstein was rejected by nearly all major recording companies in London, until he secured a meeting with George Martin, head of EMI's Parlophone label. In May 1962, Martin agreed to sign the Beatles, partly because of Epstein's conviction that the group would become internationally famous. - Ferry Cross the Mersey is a 1965 musical film featuring Gerry and the Pacemakers . The film , directed by Jeremy Summers , is one of the more uncommon artifacts of the Mersey scene , shown very rarely on television and never issued on video . It was the first to be shot on location in Liverpool after the city 's emergence into the music mainstream ( which had previously seen only Frankie Vaughan , Russ Hamilton , and Billy Fury as stars ) . For authenticity , many scenes were shot in clubs near the home of Gerry and the Pacemakers ' frontman Gerry Marsden . A scene on a ferry ( the Mountwood ) on the River Mersey showed the docks as a backdrop . Marsden wrote nine new songs for the film which also starred Julie Samuel , Cilla Black singing \`\` Is it Love ? '' , Jimmy Savile , and The Fourmost . Future Doctor Who actress Elisabeth Sladen appeared in the film as an uncredited extra . The song \`\` Ferry Cross the Mersey '' was written by Gerry Marsden as the theme song for the film . As of March 2014 , the film has never seen a commercial release . Neil Aspinall owned the rights to the movie in the past before his death .

It is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order, disorder, and change. Many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare, while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes. Subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure. - The term social order can be used in two senses. In the first sense, it refers to a particular set or system of linked social structures, institutions, relations, customs, values and practices, which conserve, maintain and enforce certain patterns of relating and behaving. Examples are the ancient, the feudal, and the capitalist social order. In the second sense, social order is contrasted to social chaos or disorder, and refers to a stable state of society in which the existing social order is accepted and maintained by its members. The problem of order or Hobbesian problem, which is central to much of sociology, political science and political philosophy, is the question how and why it is that social orders exist at all. - Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930-1970 is a 1982 book by sociologist Doug McAdam (published by the University of Chicago Press). It is responsible for laying the theoretical groundwork for the political process model for sociological theory. - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science. - The United States Constitution is the supreme law of the United States of America. The Constitution, originally comprising seven articles, delineates the national frame of government. Its first three articles entrench the doctrine of the separation of powers, whereby the federal government is divided into three branches: the legislative, consisting of the bicameral Congress; the executive, consisting of the President; and the judicial, consisting of the Supreme Court and other federal courts. Articles Four, Five and Six entrench concepts of federalism, describing the rights and responsibilities of state governments and of the states in relationship to the federal government. Article Seven establishes the procedure subsequently used by the thirteen States to ratify it. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Doug McAdam ( born August 31 , 1951 ) ( Ph.D. 1979 ) is Professor of Sociology at Stanford University . He is the author or co-author of over a dozen books and over fifty articles , and is widely credited as one of the pioneers of the political process model in social movement analysis . He wrote one of the first books on the theory in 1982 when analyzing the U.S. Civil Rights Movement : Political Process and the Development of the Black Insurgency 1930 - 1970 . His other book Freedom Summer won the C. Wright Mills Award in 1990 . He served as the director of the prestigious Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences between 2001 and 2005 . He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003 . - John Hancock (October 8, 1793) was an American merchant, statesman, and prominent Patriot of the American Revolution. He served as president of the Second Continental Congress and was the first and third Governor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. He is remembered for his large and stylish signature on the United States Declaration of Independence, so much so that the term \\"John Hancock\\" has become, in the United States, a synonym for a signature. - Welfare is the provision of a minimal level of well-being and social support for citizens without current means to support basic needs. In most developed countries, welfare is largely provided by the government from tax income, and to a lesser extent by charities, informal social groups, religious groups, and inter-governmental organizations. - Sociological theories are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related. They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to paradigms for analysis and interpretation. Some sociological theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events, while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses. - Stanford University, officially Leland Stanford Junior University, is a private research university in Stanford, California, adjacent to Palo Alto and between San Jose and San Francisco. Its campus is one of the largest in the United States. Stanford also has land and facilities elsewhere. - John Adams (October 30 [O.S. October 19] 1735 July 4, 1826) was an American patriot who served as the second President of the United States (17971801) and the first Vice President (178997). He was a lawyer, diplomat, statesman, political theorist, and, as a Founding Father, a leader of the movement for American independence from Great Britain. He was also a dedicated diarist and correspondent, particularly with his wife and closest advisor Abigail. - The University of Chicago Press is the largest and one of the oldest university presses in the United States. It is operated by the University of Chicago and publishes a wide variety of academic titles, including \\"The Chicago Manual of Style\\", numerous academic journals, and a wide array of advanced monographs in the academic fields. - The American Academy of Arts and Sciences, frequently known as the American Academy, is one of the oldest and most prestigious honorary societies and a leading center for policy research in the United States. Election to the Academy is considered one of the nation's highest honors since its founding during the American Revolution by John Adams, John Hancock, James Bowdoin, and other scholar-patriots who contributed prominently to the establishment of the new nation, its government, and the United States Constitution. - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816.

He initially gained fame and influence as a wealthy merchant. He served in both branches of the Massachusetts General Court from the 1750s to the 1770s. Although he was initially supportive of the royal governors, he opposed British colonial policy and eventually became an influential advocate of independence. He authored a highly political report on the 1770 Boston Massacre that has been described by historian Francis Walett as one of the most influential pieces of writing that shaped public opinion in the colonies.

After the first three possessions of the game ended in punts, the struck first blood, driving all the way to the Lions 2-yard line, but could only muster a 19-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. The Lions countered, driving 71 yards in 11 plays, scoring on a 19-yard touchdown pass from Shaun Hill to Calvin Johnson. After a Patriots punt, another long Lions drive, going 63 yards in 13 plays, ended with running back Maurice Morris punching through a 1-yard touchdown run, increasing the Lions lead to 14-3. The Patriots answered their touchdown with one of their own, marching 83 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 15-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis with 0:45 seconds left in the half.

Four plays later, the Patriots put the game out of reach with a 1-yard touchdown run by Green-Ellis, making the score 45-24. During the extra point and afterwards, the Lions were called for three personal fouls, including one on defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh.

Question: Process: - Water comes into contact with something made of iron - The water combines with carbon dioxide in the air to form carbonic acid - As the acid is formed, the iron starts to dissolve - Some of the water breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen - The free oxygen and dissolved iron bond together - They form iron oxide, which is rust - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose erosion occurs at faster pace happens, how will it affect more acid is formed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you proposed suggests that erosion occurs at a faster pace, which potentially leads to more acid being formed. This scenario can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the rusting process of iron. Here's a detailed explanation: 1. Direct effect: Faster erosion can lead to an increased exposure of iron surfaces. As erosion removes the outer layers of iron, more of the underlying iron will come into direct contact with water and carbon dioxide present in the air. This increased exposure to the reactants will cause more carbonic acid to form. Consequently, an increase in acid production would accelerate the rusting process, as the iron is reacting more rapidly with the water and the oxygen in the air. 2. Indirect effect: Erosion is the natural process of wearing away rocks, soil, and other materials by wind, water, and other natural agents. As erosion hastens and removes more materials, it can lead to more debris, dust, and sediments. This may result in the accumulation of particles on the iron surface, which could serve as catalysts for the reactions involved in the rusting process. Additionally, the increase in sedimentation can provide more opportunities for water to accumulate on the iron surface, creating pockets of moisture that facilitate rust formation. It is essential to note that various factors can influence the erosion process, such as the environment, temperature, and humidity. Therefore, the extent to which the perturbation will affect the rusting process will also depend on these factors. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation, where erosion occurs at a faster pace and potentially leads to more acid being formed, does have both direct and indirect effects on the rusting process of iron. The enhanced exposure to acids and increased accumulation of debris can contribute to the acceleration of rust formation. However, the actual impact of the perturbation can be influenced by the specific environmental conditions and other factors at play."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the positive side, the app features a clean and user-friendly layout, making it easy to navigate. The search function works well, and I appreciate knowing that my searches aren't being logged. In addition, the built-in tracker blocker helps keep my browsing habits more secure from online tracking. However, there are some drawbacks to using this app. Firstly, the browsing speed can sometimes be slower compared to more well-established browsers, which might discourage some users. Additionally, I have noticed that websites can occasionally load incorrectly, requiring a browser refresh or even a switch to another browser to fully access the content. Lastly, while the app's core privacy features are appreciated, the lack of secondary features like a built-in password manager or customizable extensions makes it feel somewhat limited in comparison to other popular browsers.

Does \\"West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere, and during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"In what hemisphere did west Antarctica share during the Cambrian?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"West Antarctica was partially in the Northern Hemisphere during this period large amounts of sandstones, limestones and shales were deposited.\\" does contain the correct answer to the question \\"In what hemisphere did West Antarctica share during the Cambrian?\\" The Cambrian Period (about 541 to 485.4 million years ago) marked a significant event in the history of Earth's evolution, as it was the time when most of the major groups of animals first appeared in the fossil record. This period saw a tremendous diversification of life, often referred to as the \\"Cambrian Explosion\\" of biodiversity. During the Cambrian Period, the configuration of continents was very different from what it is today. It is essential to understand the paleogeography – the ancient arrangement and movement of landmasses and oceans – to appreciate how West Antarctica was situated in the past. The continents were slowly drifting away from an earlier supercontinent called Pannotia that existed during the Neoproterozoic. As they moved, the continents underwent different degrees of separation, ultimately leading to the formation of the continents as we know them today. West Antarctica was located in the lower northern hemisphere during the Cambrian Period. The statement also mentions the deposition of large amounts of sandstones, limestones, and shales during this time. These sedimentary rocks are essential in reconstructing the geological history of the area, as they provide critical information about the depositional environments, paleoclimates, and bio-events of the Cambrian Period. Sandstones and limestones indicate the presence of shallow marine environments, where the accumulation of sand and calcium carbonate occurred. Shales are often formed through fine-grained sediment deposits in relatively deep marine basins. In conclusion, the given statement accurately describes West Antarctica's placement in the Northern Hemisphere during the Cambrian Period, as well as the deposition of various sedimentary rock types. This information is essential for understanding the geological history, paleogeography, and paleoenvironment of West Antarctica. Therefore, the correct answer to the question \\"In what hemisphere did West Antarctica share during the Cambrian?\\" is the Northern Hemisphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Injured: NYPD officer Andrew Dossi (above) was visited by Mayor de Blasio and Commissioner Bill Bratton at St. Barnabas Hospital Monday night after he and his partner were shot by robbers. Not welcome: 'He wasn’t too happy about the Mayor’s visit,' said Joe Dossi, the officer's father, about Mayor Bill de Blasio (above) coming by the hospital. 'He deals with some crappy people every day and getting no support (from Mayor de Blasio), come on,' added the elder Dossi while speaking with the New York Post. 'These are the guys in the trenches dealing with anything and everything.' This is reference to Mayor de Blasio's comments in the wake of a grand jury's decision not to indict the cop that killed Staten Island resident Eric Garner after placing the man in a chokehold for selling loose cigarettes that he worries for his son Dante, who is half-black, and how his interactions with the police will go as the young man grows up. The elder Dossi also said he told Mayor de Blasio that men like his son were 'laying theit lives on the line' when he came into the hospital room Monday night. The man also said he liked Commissioner Bratton, who he saw as 'a real legitimate guy.' Officer Dorsi, an Iraq veteran, was shot in the back and the arm.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Answer:","completion":"The Roman road that began to be constructed in 312 BC and connected Rome to Brindisi in southeast Italy is known as the Via Appia or the Appian Way. This ancient roadway, stretching approximately 350 miles (560 kilometers), is one of the oldest and most significant roads in the Roman Republic and was of strategic importance to the Roman Empire. The Via Appia was named after Appius Claudius Caecus, a Roman censor who initially commissioned the road's construction. Its primary purpose was to facilitate the transportation of troops, goods, and resources between Rome and its vital southeastern territories, which included the regions of Latium, Campania, and Samnium. Beginning at the Porta Capena in Rome, the Via Appia extended south across the Alban Hills and passed through numerous ancient cities such as Aricia, Terracina, Minturnae, and Venusia. From there, it continued through the towns of Tarentum and Uria before reaching its final destination at the bustling port city of Brindisi. This route effectively linked Rome to its key provinces and served as a vital line of communication and commerce for the empire. Throughout its existence, the Via Appia underwent several reconstructions and expansions, reflecting the growing territorial ambitions of the Roman Republic and later the Roman Empire. One such example is the extension of the roadway to the Adriatic Sea by Emperor Trajan in the early 2nd century AD. By this time, the Appian Way had acquired a reputation as a symbol of Rome's military prowess and imperial reach. As well as its significance as a strategic and commercial route, the Via Appia played a vital role in the cultural and political landscape of Rome. Prestigious and wealthy Roman citizens would often possess properties along the roadway, and monuments, tombs, and landmarks were constructed to commemorate significant historical events or the achievements of renowned individuals. The most famous of these is the tomb of the Roman general and statesman, Quintus Fabius Maximus, who was buried along the road in 203 BC. Despite its significance and grand feat of engineering, the eventual decline of the Roman Empire led to a decline in the maintenance and use of the Via Appia. As droves of travelers and merchants sought alternative routes, many sections of the Appian Way were abandoned or fell into disrepair. However, some parts remain surprisingly well-preserved to this day, while others have been incorporated into modern infrastructure, serving as a testament to the Via Appia's historical importance and lasting legacy. In conclusion, the Via Appia, constructed in 312 BC, was a monumental achievement in Roman engineering, connecting Rome to Brindisi in southeast Italy. Serving as a vital strategic, economic, and cultural asset, it played a significant role in the expansion and maintenance of the Roman Empire and shaped the historical landscape of the region for centuries. Today, the remains of the Appian Way offer a fascinating glimpse into the grandeur and ambition of ancient Rome's most important and lasting road."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of −53 °C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

His best-known works include the opera \\"Peter Grimes\\" (1945), the \\"War Requiem\\" (1962) and the orchestral showpiece \\"The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra\\" (1945). - Henry Purcell (or ; c. 10 September 1659 21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century. - Baroque music (or ) is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \\"classical music\\" canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel. What object entity has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'daniel purcell'? Choices: - baroque - baroque music - classical music Answer:","completion":"The object entity that has the relation of 'movement' with the subject 'Daniel Purcell' is \\"Baroque music.\\" Daniel Purcell was an English Baroque composer, and the term 'movement' typically refers to a self-contained part of a larger musical work, such as a symphony or suite. In the context of Baroque music, these movements were often characterized by contrasts in tempo and mood. Baroque music, as a style of Western art music, was composed between approximately 1600 and 1750. It followed the Renaissance music era and preceded the Classical era. Baroque music is known for its intricate melodies, rich harmonies, and elaborate ornamentation. Many of these compositions were built on the principles of tonality and the use of basso continuo, which provided a strong foundation for the melodies and harmonic structures. Several key composers of the Baroque era, in addition to Daniel Purcell, include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry (Daniel's brother or cousin) Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel. These composers contributed immensely to the development and evolution of Baroque music through their innovative compositions and unique styles. The movement-related aspects of their works, such as tempo and pattern variations, allowed for greater emotional depth and expression. In the case of Daniel Purcell and other Baroque composers, their exploration of musical movement within the Baroque genre played an essential role in establishing their lasting impact on the world of classical music."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\".

Hypothesis: If I have another novel to write, I'll write it. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to analyze the statements and their relationship in a logical manner. An entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of the other statement. Premise: I will only write another novel if I have another novel to write. In logical terms, this statement translates to: Writing a novel → Having another novel to write. Here, the act of writing another novel is dependent on having another novel to write. If someone genuinely writes another novel, it necessarily implies that they had another novel to write. Hypothesis: If I have another novel to write, I'll write it. In logical terms, this statement translates to: Having another novel to write → Writing a novel. This time, the implication goes in the opposite direction. If an individual has another novel to write, then they will undoubtedly write it. To check whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to examine whether the premise's truth will guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Although both statements share similar elements (writing a novel and having a novel to write), their implications go in opposing directions. The premise states that the act of writing another novel rests on having another novel to write. Essentially, it implies that without another novel to write, the person would not write a new novel. However, it does not guarantee that they will unconditionally write a novel if they have another one to write. On the other hand, the hypothesis asserts that if the person has another novel to write, they will surely write it. The hypothesis effectively establishes a stronger commitment to writing the novel simply due to its existence. Thus, in conclusion, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. They are related statements with similar conditions, but their implications are different, and the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In case you're using a propane grill, simply turn off the burners directly under the ribs and keep the other burners on low. To ensure even cooking and to retain their tenderness, be sure to place the ribs bone side down on the grill grate. Cover the grill with its lid for optimal heat circulation, which will create a convection-like cooking environment. Throughout the slow cooking process, periodically check the temperature of the grill, maintaining the heat levels by adjusting the grill vents or adding more charcoal as needed. It's crucial to limit the amount of times you lift the lid to avoid losing heat and lengthening the cooking time. For an added depth of flavor, you may consider placing a heat-resistant tray filled with a mixture of water, apple cider, or beer beneath the grilling grate. This will not only introduce moisture into the cooking environment, but it will also catch any dripping fat and prevent flare-ups. As the ribs continue to cook, be sure to baste them with your preferred barbecue sauce or mop sauce every 45-60 minutes, ensuring they stay moist throughout the process. Generally, slow cooking ribs can take anywhere from 4-6 hours, depending on their thickness and the temperature maintained within the grill. To determine whether the ribs are cooked to perfection, use a meat thermometer to check that their internal temperature has reached at least 190°F (88°C). At this point, the meat should be tender and pull away easily from the bone. Once the ribs have reached the desired level of tenderness, remove them from the grill and let them rest for about 10 minutes, allowing the juices to redistribute and the flavors to fully settle. By mastering the skill of slow cooking ribs, you'll be able to treat your family and friends to a mouth-watering, savory dish that is sure to impress at your next barbecue gathering. The key to success is patience, as giving the ribs ample time to cook will result in a tender and flavorful meal. Moreover, utilizing your preferred choice of seasonings, sauces, and wood chips can enhance the overall taste of the ribs, creating a truly memorable culinary experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please capitalize where necessary: packaging is important for creating a brand image in any market where products are competing for a share of the market.","completion":"\\"Packaging is important for creating a brand image in any market where products are competing for a share of the market.\\" The provided sentence is already grammatically correct, including the capitalization. 'Packaging' is properly capitalized as the start of the sentence, and there are no specific names or titles present that would require additional capitalization. As a reminder, here are the general rules for proper capitalization in English: - The first letter of each sentence should be capitalized. - Proper nouns, which are the names of specific people, places, organizations, and sometimes things, should always be capitalized. - The pronoun 'I' is always capitalized. - Abbreviations and acronyms are usually capitalized. - The first letter of each word in a title, except for certain short words, such as articles and short prepositions, is typically capitalized. In this context, the term 'packaging' is not a proper noun needing capitalization. Branding and marketing terms are generally not treated as proper nouns unless they're part of an official title or name. Although 'packaging' is a significant concept in marketing and branding, it is used here in a general sense to indicate the act of designing and producing packages. Likewise, the term 'brand image' is not capitalized as it is a general term used to describe how a brand is perceived by the public. This term can vary greatly from one company or product to another and, therefore, is not considered a specific proper noun. The word 'market' also doesn't require capitalization here. Although it represents a significant business concept, it's used idiomatically in this sentence to refer to the general business environment rather than a specific market or named entity that would require capitalization.

The most powerful woman in the world, according to US Forbes magazine, was in China last week. She came to discuss trade and environmental issues with China's top leaders. Germany's first woman leader is known as a brave and practical statesman . Even since her time at school, she had the habit of getting everything in order. Every day before doing her homework she would clean the desk and think about what to do next. \\"I prefer a long time for full preparations to make my decision. But once I decide, I will stand up for what I believe,\\" Merkel said. Perhaps it was good habits that helped her do well in her studies. At 32, she got a doctorate in physics and then she worked as a researcher. However, the life of a scholar couldn't put off her love of politics. While working in labs, Merkel took time off to read political books and at last joined a political party. \\"Her calmness helped her stand out in the party. She could always find a way out while others felt hopeless,\\" said one of her old friends.

Step 1: Calculate the area of the rectangle. Area of the rectangle = Length * Width = 50 cm * 10 cm = 500 cm² Step 2: Determine the area of the square. Since the area of the square is 5 times the area of the rectangle, the area of the square = 5 * (Area of the rectangle) = 5 * 500 cm² = 2500 cm² Step 3: Find the side length of the square. The area of the square = Side * Side or Side² To find the side length, we need to take the square root of the area. Side = √(Area of the square) = √2500 cm² = 50 cm Step 4: Determine the perimeter of the square. The perimeter of the square is the sum of all its sides, which are equal in length. Perimeter = 4 * Side = 4 * 50 cm = 200 cm Now, let's choose the answer from the options. The correct answer is b) 200 cm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After a few days of feeling terrible his brother comes by to check his temperature noting that it is 100.6°F. But I can use this background: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. What is an answer for this question: Will being sick with a bacterial infection cause a person's body temperature to increase or decrease? A:","completion":"Being sick with a bacterial infection, such as strep throat in James' case, will cause a person's body temperature to increase.

Here is an article: Matthew Staver for The New York Times Linda Vargas works as a volunteer in Denver with Mi Familia Vota, which helps Latinos become citizens and register to vote. DENVER — The nation’s rapidly growing Latino population is one of the most powerful forces working in President Obama’s favor in many of the states that will determine his contest with Mitt Romney. But Latinos are not registering or voting in numbers that fully reflect their potential strength, leaving Hispanic leaders frustrated and Democrats worried as they increase efforts to rally Latino support. Interviews with Latino voters across the country suggested a range of reasons for what has become, over a decade, an entrenched pattern of nonparticipation, ranging from a distrust of government to a fear of what many see as an intimidating effort by law enforcement and political leaders to crack down on immigrants, legal or not. Here in Denver, Ben Monterosso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, or My Family Votes, a national group that helps Latinos become citizens and register to vote, gathered organizers around a table in his office and recited census data demonstrating the lack of Latino participation. “Our potential at the ballot box is not being maximized,” Mr. Monterosso told them. “The untapped potential is there.” More than 21 million Latinos will be eligible to vote this November, clustered in pockets from Colorado to Florida, as well as in less obvious states like Illinois, Iowa, North Carolina and Virginia. Yet just over 10 million of them are registered, and even fewer turn out to vote. In the 2008 presidential election, when a record 10 million Latinos showed up at the polls nationwide, that amounted to just half of the eligible voters. By contrast, 66 percent of eligible whites and 65 percent of eligible blacks voted, according to a study by the Pew Hispanic Center. That disparity is echoed in swing states across the country. In Nevada, 42 percent of eligible Hispanics are registered, while just 35 percent are registered in Virginia, according to Latino Decisions, which studies Latino voting trends. Although Latinos do not turn up at the polls in the same numbers, relative to their population, as other ethnic groups, their overall numbers are growing so rapidly that they are nevertheless on the verge of becoming the powerful force in American politics that officials in both parties have long anticipated — an effect that would only be magnified should they somehow begin to match the voting percentages of other ethnic groups. Mr. Obama’s campaign has seized on that as a central part of his re-election strategy, with an early burst of three Spanish-language television advertisements in four swing states, including Colorado, and voter registration drives in Latino neighborhoods. “Hi, are you registered to vote?” Linda Vargas, 62, called out in English and Spanish to people walking into a public library on the outskirts of Denver as she sat behind a table stacked with voter registration forms. This segment of the American electorate is by any measure sprawling, with near-explosive population growth in places like California and Texas and growing numbers in swing states like Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Nevada and New Mexico. Their presence in such politically important states has only fed the frustration of Latino organizers over their underrepresentation at the polls. Matt A. Barreto, an associate professor of political science at the University of Washington and head of Latino Decisions, said the population growth had produced a higher Latino vote in every presidential election over the last decade, a number that had the effect of masking the political apathy of many Latino voters. “The population growth has driven increases in the Latino vote every year,” he said. “But we still need to confront a registration gap that is quite significant.” Jim Messina, Mr. Obama’s campaign manager, said Latino voters were a critical factor in the president’s re-election hopes. “Look, if we do our job right and have a good ground game, I absolutely believe that Latino voters can be one of the big reasons we win this election,” he said. Officials in Mr. Romney’s campaign argued that he would cut into Mr. Obama’s Latino support by challenging his record on the economy, and how, they said, it had been particularly harmful to Latinos. Last week, the Romney campaign posted a Spanish-language advertisement on its Web site pointing to rising unemployment among Latinos.

Write a summary based on this article: In the strongest sign yet that the AT&T/T-Mobile deal is unraveling, the companies issued a surprise Thanksgiving announcement that they have withdrawn their application to the Federal Communications Commission for approval of the 39 billion wireless mega-marriage. But the companies aren’t throwing in the towel just yet. Text Size - + reset POLITICO 44 Making what critics describe as a shrewd tactical move, the companies said in a statement that they will continue to pursue the sale of T-Mobile’s wireless assets to AT&T by focusing on winning approval from the Department of Justice — either at trial or through settlement. Are they bluffing or simply hedging their bets? Only time will tell. AT&T, which until now has exuded confidence in the deal’s prospects, made its first public concession that its massive campaign to secure approval could end in defeat. It said it’s taking a 4 billion charge to cover a “breakup fee” it negotiated upfront with T-Mobile’s parent company, Deutsche Telekom “in the event the transaction does not receive regulatory approval.” Supporters of the deal said this could open the door for more serious settlement talks. “This is a smart move by AT&T/T-Mobile that will hopefully place emphasis on reaching a settlement that assures the benefits of the deal while addressing the challenges,” Dean Garfield, president and CEO of The Information Technology Industry Council, told POLITICO Thursday. The trade group had backed the deal in the hopes it would spur more wireless broadband. AT&T and Deustche Telekom said in a statement that they took the action after FCC staff said Tuesday that Chairman Julius Genachowski would seek to block the wireless megadeal by designating it for an administrative hearing. Commission staff told reporters Wednesday that they believed the pairing of the nation’s second- and fourth-largest wireless carriers would reduce competition in the wireless market. They also said it wouldn’t produce the benefits for consumers in terms of jobs and expansion of wireless broadband. AT&T and Deutsche Telekom said they electronically withdrew the application with the FCC on Wednesday. The move was the first crack in the veneer of a deal that was announced in March with great fanfare and promise. AT&T set about waging an intensive campaign through advertisements and lobbying to convince the public, state and federal regulators, unions and members of Congress that the pairing with T-Mobile would help fuel the sputtering U.S. economy. The company said the deal would add up to 96,000 jobs to the economy and help fulfill President Barack Obama’s goal of spreading broadband Internet services to all corners of the nation. While lawmakers weighed in on both sides of the deal, the first sign that the Obama administration would fight approval came in August, when the Justice Department filed suit in U.S. District Court to block the transaction. But the companies vowed to fight back while keeping the prospect of a possible settlement open. On Thursday, some of the public interest groups that opposed the deal called on AT&T to back away from the deal entirely. ||||| The withdrawal of the F.C.C. application “is a tacit acknowledgment by AT&T that this story is all but over,” said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “The fat lady hasn’t started singing yet, but she’s holding the mike, and the band is about to play.” The efforts by the Justice Department’s antitrust division and the F.C.C. to block the merger reflect a reinvigoration of federal efforts to rein in excessive business practices after a prolonged period of deregulation that preceded the 2008 financial crisis. President Obama came into office pledging to take a harder look at the antitrust implications of proposed mergers, but the Justice Department was criticized by consumer groups in its first year for appearing hesitant to follow through on that promise. Similarly, the F.C.C. drew rebukes for its approval last year of the merger between Comcast and NBC Universal , which critics claimed would concentrate too much power over both television content and its transmission to consumers. Photo The move this week to conduct a hearing on the cellphone deal was the first time the F.C.C. had done so on a merger since the 2002 proposed alliance between Echostar and Direct TV, which ultimately was scrapped. In the current case, however, AT&T has noted that expansion of the nation’s Internet infrastructure is one of Mr. Obama’s top goals to help rebuild the economy, and the F.C.C. itself has predicted that its recent initiative to expand broadband Internet access to rural areas would create hundreds of thousands of jobs. Consumer groups, which generally have opposed the merger, said this week’s combined actions indicated that the deal was falling apart. Advertisement Continue reading the main story “The chances that AT&T will take over T-Mobile are almost gone,” Gigi B. Sohn, president of the consumer group Public Knowledge, said in a statement. “While you can never count out AT&T entirely, the fact that they pulled their F.C.C. application speaks volumes about the company’s lack of confidence” in getting approval. Deutsche Telekom, based in Germany , said in a statement that the withdrawal “is being undertaken by both companies to consolidate their strength and to focus their continuing efforts on obtaining antitrust clearance for the transaction from the Department of Justice. As soon as practical, Deutsche Telekom and AT&T intend to seek necessary F.C.C. approval.” AT&T issued its own statement saying that the companies were taking this step “to facilitate the consideration of all options at the F.C.C.,” as well as to consider other options. The company said the 4 billion pretax charge, to be taken in the current quarter, reflects a 3 billion cash payment and 1 billion worth of cellular airwaves, or spectrum, that AT&T must pay to T-Mobile’s parent if the merger does not receive regulatory approval.

The commission is not obligated to grant the request, however. It could deny the request, going ahead with its consideration and judicial hearing, or it could grant the request with prejudice, meaning that AT&T could not later refile the application. That would essentially kill the deal. When AT&T agreed to buy T-Mobile USA from Deutsche Telekom in March, the deal looked like a happy ending for T-Mobile, which had been bleeding customers and battling against declining sales. The company has struggled to retain and add new customers as AT&T, Verizon and Sprint have attracted new mobile phone shoppers with popular handsets like the iPhone and the promise of faster networks and data services. Photo Over the last eight quarters, the mobile industry over all has added a net 33 million customers in the United States; T-Mobile has added only 89,000 of those, according to Chetan Sharma, an independent wireless analyst. A dissolution of the merger could leave T-Mobile in a much worse position than it was prior to March, when the acquisition was first announced. Analysts say that since then, the company most likely froze any major negotiations with smartphone and tablet manufactures like Apple to avoid interfering with any deals under way between AT&T and those hardware vendors. Advertisement Continue reading the main story That could severely limit T-Mobile’s ability to lure customers from competitors over the coming quarters if the merger is abandoned. But the spectrum that T-Mobile would receive from AT&T in a breakup could help the company, perhaps making it attractive to another company or investment group looking to get into the cellular and mobile broadband business. Deutsche Telekom has made clear that it no longer wants to be in the mobile phone business in the United States, saying it would stop investing in cellular infrastructure here to concentrate on its European operations. If the merger falls through, the German company may decide to spin off the unit as an independent entity, sell it at a less attractive price to a rival like Sprint Nextel or sell it off in pieces. Possible proceeds from the deal had been earmarked to reduce debt and buy back stock. While there has long been talk about a possible combination of T-Mobile with Sprint, the Justice Department’s opposition to the AT&T combination would seem to indicate problems for Sprint, the No. 3 cellphone carrier. Verizon is currently the largest carrier, but the AT&T purchase of T-Mobile would have vaulted the combined entity into first place. For AT&T, the acquisition of T-Mobile and its wireless spectrum could mean improved service and network quality, crucial for helping the carrier ramp up its rivalry with Verizon. AT&T has been looking for ways to keep an edge over the other carriers since losing its exclusivity as the sole carrier of the iPhone in the United States earlier this year. Analysts expected that acquiring T-Mobile would give AT&T the ability to price its plans and handsets more aggressively, since hardware makers might be willing to offer AT&T a lower rate for large volume purchases of new smartphones and tablet computers. Even if AT&T wins its case with the Justice Department, it must receive F.C.C. approval to be able to take over T-Mobile’s licenses to operate its network on the public airwaves. The decision by the F.C.C. to request a judicial hearing on the merger had already caused Christopher C. King, a telecommunications analyst at Stifel Nicolaus, to put the probability of the deal being completed as low as 10 to 20 percent. “At some point,” Mr. King said, “AT&T is going to have to face the reality that this deal is pretty much dead.” |||||","completion":"AT&T and T-Mobile have withdrawn their application to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for approval of their 39 billion merger deal. However, the companies still plan to pursue the sale of T-Mobile's wireless assets to AT&T by seeking approval from the Department of Justice, either at trial or through settlement. This comes after AT&T made its first public statement about the possibility of the deal not receiving regulatory approval, taking a 4 billion charge to cover a \\"breakup fee\\" it had negotiated with T-Mobile's parent company, Deutsche Telekom. Despite the withdrawal of the FCC application, AT&T and T-Mobile remain focused on obtaining antitrust clearance for the transaction from the Department of Justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Now, I have a new situation: Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure.

William H. Berry was elected in 1906, shortly after the dedication, to the office of State Treasurer on a reform \\"fusion ticket\\". Berry was the only Democrat elected to a statewide office from 1895 to 1934. His successful campaign was deemed by Governor Pennypacker to be \\"one of those freaks of ill fortune\\". Berry began investigating the costs of the capitol project and brought its 13 million pricetag to the attention of the public. Part of the reason for the discrepancy was Pennsylvania's \\"over-elaborate\\" and sometimes \\"unintelligible\\" method of \\"ordering and purchasing supplies, equipment [and] furnishings, commonly called the 'per-foot rule' \\". Because the methods of measuring under the \\"per-foot rule\\" were not rigorously enforced, furnishing could be, intentionally, overpriced by the supplier. For example, a flagpole installed on the capitol roof was priced at 850; Berry estimated the value of the pole to have been only 150. Other expenses included 1,619 for a 125 bootblack stand and 3,257 for a 325 \\"mahogany case in the Senate barber shop\\".Pennypacker tried to demonstrate that costs associated with the capitol were reasonable in comparison with similar notable structures. He pointed out that the United States Capitol cost 18 million, but had \\"fifty-five less [rooms] than the Capitol at Harrisburg.\\" Pennypacker also showed how the New York State Capitol had cost 24 million, and was still unfinished.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the names of the people who are born to the same mother? is inside the article: The film opens as a pregnant woman gives birth to a vampire. A young Brother, Silus, aged 10–13 is told this child, Edgar and he are from the same mother. Throughout this introduction, the mother is in visible emotional distress, reaching out across the room to Silus, trying to touch him. Captioned \\"100 Years Later.\\" Jamestown slum has had a series of attacks on women, who are all found with their throats bitten. Lilly Squires is in charge of the human police investigating these cases. She states that she comes from a workhouse in this same slum, and we establish that she is one of the few cops who care what happens to these people at the bottom of the socioeconomic heap. Lilly finds a small boy who witnesses one attack, and tells her that a Brother was responsible. As the police don't want to panic the city, the string of murders is explained away as being the result of an outbreak of the rampant influenza virus. Silus is detailed by the church cardinals to work with the human police, because the Brothers know that these attacks have been carried out by a Brother; Silus's brother Edgar. Edgar has sent Silus a recording of his last murder, challenging him to find and stop him before he kills again. Edgar provides the location of his next murder. With Silus' help, Lilly puts together a task force to stake out the area Edgar has targeted. However Edgar distracts the cops and attacks Lilly, biting her in the neck. An officer interrupts the attack and Edgar flees. To save Lilly's life, Silus tells her to drink his blood, which she does. Silus then pursues Edgar, managing to shoot him with a tranquilizing dart. Silus later visits Lilly in hospital. We establish that she has no family as they died from influenza. Lilly is having visions from drinking Silus' blood. The newspapers have published a fake story of the death of the killer; a deranged human who believed he was a Brother., can you guess it ?

She walked down the stairs to the kitchen and put a few cookies on a plate. Then she poured a glass of milk. She wondered what Elmo was doing. Was he in the Media Room with Carsie? Their Media Room? Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Back on the ferry<br>Tina had to go back on the ferry. Her vacation was coming to an end. So she was excited about it. When she went home she told her friends about it. They then wanted to go themselves. Hypothesis: Tina went home after her vacation was over.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that \\"Tina went home after her vacation was over\\" from the given context. Extensive evidences lend support to this conclusion. The conclusion revolves around a person named Tina, and her activities are discussed exclusively. The initial phrase introduces us to Tina and her experience of had to go back on the ferry. The term \\"had to go back\\" indicates a return journey from a certain place, which can be perceived as the location of her vacation. The next sentence, \\"Her vacation was coming to an end\\", consolidates the idea that Tina was indeed on vacation and was now wrapping it up. This further bolsters the belief that she had been spending her time at a location that necessitated the ferry ride for her to return home. In addition, the phrase \\"So she was excited about it\\", suggests that the ending of the vacation elicits emotions of elation in Tina. This could be interpreted as her enthusiasm to return home after her vacation. When reading \\"When she went home she told her friends about it\\", it establishes the fact that her vacation has ended, and she indeed returned home. She expresses the details of her vacation to her friends which further confirms the hypothesis. The final sentence, \\"They then wanted to go themselves\\" implies that her friends found her vacation experience appealing, and decided that they might want to go there themselves. This piece of information isn't directly linked to confirming the hypothesis, but it affirms that Tina has indeed completed her vacation and returned home, because she is in a position to share her experiences, which leads to her friends wanting to have similar experiences. Hence, based on the context provided, we can confidently confirm the hypothesis that Tina did return home after her vacation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The fourth season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" saw massive battles, major deaths (Tywin!) and White Walkers, but what can fans expect Sunday as we head into a fifth season of one of the most popular shows in HBO history?

The Chinese put up with a lot living in the world's most populous country: standing on over-crowded trains for 40 hours; sleeping outside hospitals to secure a doctor's appointment; waiting more than a year to earn a driver's license. Add getting a U.S. entry visa to the list. Applicants here have waited as long as 60 days to secure an appointment at one of five U.S. consular locations in China that process visas. There, they're often greeted by long lines, followed by a face-to-face interview that can end badly in a matter of seconds. Now there are only about 100 U.S. visa officers in China, facing considerable challenges during the summer when tourists and students travel the most. \\"It's not easy work,\\" Charles Bennett, minister-counselor for Consular Affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, said to his staff. \\"You're making, in some cases, life-changing decisions many times a day, and that can cause great tiredness.\\" To adapt, US consular services expanded their hours, took on about a dozen additional staff and hope to have another 20 officers by spring. More facilities are also being expanded. Despite the shocking numbers, the embassy remains troubled by charges that it rejects applicants unreasonably and that the process is unfairly burdensome. \\"I'm fed up,\\" said Wendy Liu, 24. The single woman from Beijing said she was recently refused a visa and told to re-apply when her personal life and finances were more stable. \\"I'll go anywhere but the U.S. now,\\" she said. \\"I thought America was supposed to be a country of freedom.\\" To visit the US, Chinese nationals must prove that they have enough money and family or business ties that make it likely they'll return to China. The Department of Homeland Security said it did not keep records on how many Chinese overstay their visas. Student visas can be refused on grounds of national security. Beijing native Tan Ge, 25, believes he was not accepted after he stated his interests in infrared technology and nanoelectronics on his application. He now studies in Canada after being forced to abandon a full scholarship to Arizona State University. By its very nature, the on-the-spot process at the U.S. Embassy can feel unbearable to Chinese applicants, who are asked to take their bank statements, property deeds , marriage licenses and HUKOU, a Chinese household ID. \\"It made me feel very uncomfortable,\\" said Xu Yong, 28, a journalist who needed a business visa last month to cover a conference in New York. \\"They made me feel like someone from a Third World country up to no good.\\" After giving his fingerprints, Xu waited to be called for his interview, sitting in an area that was as quiet as a library. Each passing minute seemed to be as long as a century. After an hour, Xu was called with three other people to a window for their interview. Two were rejected before his turn. Then the American officer, speaking fluent Chinese, reached for Xu's paperwork, asked some simple questions and said, \\"Congratulations.\\" \\"I was so nervous. The first thing I did when I got out was to call my mom and tell her I passed,\\" Xu said. \\"She was the one who warned me it wasn't going to be easy.\\" Answer this series of questions: 1.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Acanthosicyos is a genus of thorny shrubs of the botanical family Cucurbitaceae, subfamily Cucurbitoideae. The genus name derives from the Greek words \\"\\"akantha\\"\\" for thorn and \\"\\"sykios\\"\\" for cucumber or gourd. Endemic to the Namib Desert in Africa, this genus is represented by two known species including \\"Acanthosicyos horridus\\", the nara melon, an important food plant in its native range. Hypothesis: The nara melon not an important food plant in its native range.","completion":"Based on the context provided, it would be incorrect to draw the hypothesis that the nara melon is not an important food plant in its native range. On the contrary, the context explicitly states that \\"Acanthosicyos horridus\\", commonly known as the nara melon, is an important food plant in its native range. To further elaborate, the context provides important information about the Acanthosicyos genus of thorny shrubs, which belong to the Cucurbitaceae family (also known as the gourd family) and are from the subfamily Cucurbitoideae. The genus name, Acanthosicyos, is derived from Greek, where \\"akantha\\" means thorn and \\"sykios\\" refers to cucumber or gourd. This provides a little insight into the plant's appearance and characteristics, particularly its thorny nature and close relationship to cucumbers and gourds. The context also specifies that the Acanthosicyos genus is endemic to the Namib Desert in Africa. Being endemic to a region implies that the genus consists of unique species that can only be found in that particular region and nowhere else. Within this genus, there are two known species, and one of them is Acanthosicyos horridus, or the nara melon. The nara melon is mentioned to be an important food plant within its native range. This statement leads us to conclude that, within the Namib Desert, the nara melon serves as a significant source of nutrition and sustenance for the people, animals, or insects residing or relying on that region's ecosystem. In conclusion, drawing a hypothesis contrary to the context would be inaccurate. As the context explicitly states the importance of the nara melon as a food plant in its native range, it is clear that the nara melon plays a significant role as a food resource within the Namib Desert ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The equation looks like this: -8490 = -10*k - 8520. Now, let's make \\"k\\" the only thing on the right side. First, let's add 8520 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -8520.

Now, to find the value of \\"k\\", we need to get rid of the -10 that's next to it. We can do that by dividing both sides of the equation by -10. When we do that, we get: 30 ÷ (-10) = k.

(CNN) -- The Connecticut Senate on Thursday voted to repeal the death penalty, setting the stage for Connecticut to join several states that have recently abolished capital punishment. In the last five years, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York and Illinois have repealed the death penalty. California voters will decide the issue in November. The bill now goes to the House of Representatives, where it is also expected to pass. Gov. Dannel Malloy, a Democrat, has vowed to sign the measure into law should it reach his desk, his office said. \\"For everyone, it's a vote of conscience,\\" said Senate President Donald Williams Jr., a Democrat who says he's long supported a repeal. \\"We have a majority of legislators in Connecticut in favor of this so that the energies of our criminal justice system can be focused in a more appropriate manner.\\" In 2009, state lawmakers in both houses tried to pass a similar bill, but were ultimately blocked by then-Gov. Jodi Rell, a Republican. Capital punishment has existed in Connecticut since its colonial days. But the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 when a Supreme Court decision required greater consistency in its application. A moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment. Since then, Connecticut juries have handed down 15 death sentences. Of those, only one person has actually been executed, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws. Michael Ross, a convicted serial killer, was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after giving up his appeals. Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. Can you tell me some states which have recently repealed the death penalty? 2. How long has Connecticut had the death penalty? 3. Was the practice ever placed on a moratorium?

She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\".

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Catch: Montana to Dwight Clark wins '82 NFC title game (Originially published by the Daily News on Monday, Jan. 11, 1982; written by Larry Fox) San Francisco - The cast was completed for an all-Cinderella Super Bowl yesterday when the 49ers picked the Cowboys' pockets to come up with a miracle, winning the NFC championship, 28-27 on a six-yard pass from Joe Montana to secondary target Dwight Clark with only 51 seconds left. The victory then was assured two downs later when Lawrence Pillers, cut by the Jets for his failures as a pass rusher, sacked Danny White into the fumble that gonged midnight for America's Team. By coming out on top in this crowd-pleasing melodrama in which the lead changed hands six times, the 49ers earned the right to meet AFC champion Cincinnati in Super Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich. Jan. 24. Bill Walsh, coach of the 49ers who used to work for the Bengals and quit when he was passed over for the head job, said Super Bowl XVI will involve a matchup \\"of two teams that fought their way up from the bottom.\\" At season's start, there were probably no odds that these two perennial also-rans would meet in the Super Bowl. AND WHEN THE Cowboys took a 27-21 lead on Danny White's 21-yard pass to Doug Cosbie with 10:41 remaining, the odds didn't appear to be very good that mistake-plagued San Francisco, a team inexperienced in the pressures of post-season play, would be able to come back. To that point, the 49ers had lost three fumbles, suffered three pass interceptions and incurred two damaging pass interference calls on rookie cornerback Ronnie Lott. Of three Dallas touchdowns and two field goals, only one field goal didn't involve some 49er assistance. But, on the sidelines, the 49ers were confident. After a Dallas punt, they set up at their 11. \\"It was 90 yards,\\" said Walsh, \\"and we knew we couldn't get it in big chunks. We just set about marching down the field. We wanted to methodically pick them apart.\\" \\"It was a long way, but we had to get it a little bit at a time,\\" said Clark, who caught two of Montana's three touchdown passes. Twice early in the drive the 49ers were faced with third-down situations. On the first of these, Montana passed to Freddie Solomon for six yards, maintaining possession with two yards to spare. Dallas handed the first down over on the second, as Bruce Thornton went offsides. At the two-minute warning, the 49ers had moved across the 50 to the Dallas 49 when Solomon dashed 14 yards on an end around. MONTANA PASSED PERFECTLY to Clark for 10 and Solomon for 12 more and a first down at the 13. Now it was time for Solomon again and the one-time college quarterback was wide open in the corner of the end zone when Montana overthrew him. So Lenvil Elliott, the Bengal retread who got the start because of an injury to halfback Ricky Patton, got the call and gained seven on a sweep. That made it third-and-three at the six with 58 seconds left. In came the play from Walsh. Sprint Right Option. It had worked for Montana's first touchdown of the day under similar circumstances in the first half, an eight-yarder. Solomon was the primary target again, only this time the Cowboys, obviously remembering that first touchdown, collapsed their defense on him. Montana admitted he was on the verge of throwing the ball away when he spotted Clark sweeping across the back line of the end zone. He fired the ball high, higher actually than intended, but he explained, \\"This is something we work on from Day One in camp. If he doesn't catch it, nobody does . . . but I have great confidence in Dwight's leaping ability.\\" There were a couple of Cowboy defenders between Solomon, who was the short man, and Clark. They quickly tried to reverse gears, but couldn't get back in time. The ball sailed too high for them, but the 6-4 Clark leaped and made what he described as a \\"double catch,\\" the ball bouncing off one palm before he trapped it with the other hand and pulled it in. \\"I really don't remember which hand it was,\\" he said. ONLY ONE POINT behind with 51 seconds left, the Cowboys were hardly dead yet. In Rafael Septien, they had one of the NFL's best place-kickers and an offense that could get him within range. \\"We just had to tighten up. We knew we had to stop 'em to keep them out of field-goal range,\\" said Fred Dean. \\"We had to stop 'em,\\" said Lott, who was operating under the added burden of those two damaging calls. \\"We sure were under extra pressure because with a kicker like Septien, the goal line is at the 40 or 30-yard line.\\" After Ray Wersching's semi-squib kick, the Cowboys set up at their own 25 when White passed 31 yards to Drew Pearson to the SF 44. One more gain like this and the Cowboys would have moved into Septien's range. \\"If we could have just gotten 15 more yards on the last drive, we could have been in field-goal range and we could have won it,\\" said White, but the could-have-beens never were. THE 49ERS, WHO normally play a three-man front, went to four down linemen for a bigger rush. Pillers, who plays in pass-rush situations out here, was at left tackle with Jim Stuckey his left end. They decided to play one of those little line stunts, shifting rush lanes. Pillers shot between left guard Herb Scott and center Tom Rafferty. Rafferty grabbed him and, Pillers said, \\"actually helped pull me through.\\" White, meanwhile, was looking for Tony Hill and Hill was open. But the ball never got there. Pillers shot over Rafferty and exploded into White for his second sack of the game, knocking the ball free. Stuckey recovered for San Francisco and the Cowboys were finished. The Cowboys were bitter over the sudden end. \\"We were moving the football and we figured to get a field goal,\\" said Tony Dorsett, his left eye still red from an accidental kick that kept him on the sidelines for a while. \\"But then on the next play, they had a great rush and they stripped Danny of the football. I knew we had time to come back. Fifty seconds with our offense, it's not asking a lot to get in field-goal range, but it didn't work because of a turnover. It wasn't a case that we ran out of time.\\" It was ironic the Cowboys would finally be undone by a turnover, because that's what had been keeping them in the game. \\"We overcame a lot of adversity,\\" Walsh said and then in a reference to the turnovers, \\"and some questionable calls.\\" The 49ers took an early lead on the first of Montana's three touchdown passes, the eight-yarder to Solomon. The Cowboys retaliated with a 44-yard field goal by Septien and then took the lead when they converted Mike Hegman's fumble recovery into a 26-yard, White-to-Hill touchdown. THE 49ERS BLEW another scoring chance early in the second quarter on the first of two Everson Walls interceptions, but then went ahead, 14-10, on a 20-yard pass from Montana to Clark. The rangy receiver caught this one on his knees, after faking Dennis Thurman out of the park. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article is about a football game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Dallas Cowboys in 1982. The 49ers won the game 28-27 with a last-minute touchdown pass from Joe Montana to Dwight Clark. This victory allowed the 49ers to advance to the Super Bowl against the Cincinnati Bengals.

Information: - Gampopa \\"the man from Gampo\\" or Sönam Rinchen (10791153), also known by the titles Dakpo Lharjé \\"the physician from Dakpo\\" and Daö Zhönnu, \\"Candraprabhakumara\\" established the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism. - The Tibetan Empire (\\"Great Tibet\\") existed from the 7th to 9th centuries AD when Tibet was unified as a large and powerful empire, and ruled an area considerably larger than the Tibetan Plateau, stretching to parts of East Asia, Central Asia and South Asia. - The Jonang is one of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. Its origins in Tibet can be traced to early 12th century master Yumo Mikyo Dorje, but became much wider known with the help of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, a monk originally trained in the Sakya school. The Jonang school was widely thought to have become extinct in the late 17th century at the hands of the 5th Dalai Lama, who forcibly annexed the Jonang monasteries to his Gelug school, declaring them heretical. - The Nyingma tradition is the oldest of the four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism (the other three being the Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug). \\"Nyingma\\" literally means \\"ancient,\\" and is often referred to as Ngangyur (, \\"school of the ancient translations\\" or \\"old school\\") because it is founded on the first translations of Buddhist scriptures from Sanskrit into Old Tibetan in the eighth century. The Tibetan alphabet and grammar was actually created for this endeavour. - The Kagyu, Kagyü, or Kagyud school, also known as the \\"\\"Oral Lineage\\"\\" or \\"Whispered Transmission\\" school, is today regarded as one of six main schools (\\"chos lugs\\") of Himalayan or Tibetan Buddhism, the other five being the Nyingma, Sakya, Jonang, Gelug and Bon. Along with the Sakya and Gelug schools, the Kagyu tradition is classified as one of the Sarma or \\"New Transmission\\" schools of Vajrayna founded during the second diffusion of Buddhism into Tibet (diffusing the so-called \\"New Tantras\\"). It is a Red Hat sect along with the Nyingma and Sakya. - Classical Tibetan refers to the language of any text written in Tibetic after the Old Tibetan period; though it extends from the 7th century until the modern day, it particularly refers to the language of early canonical texts translated from other languages, especially Sanskrit. The phonology implied by Classical Tibetan orthography is basically identical to the phonology of Old Tibetan, but the grammar varies greatly depending on period and geographic origin of the author. Such variation is an under-researched topic. - Bon or Bön is a Tibetan religion, which self-identifies as being distinct from Tibetan Buddhism, although it shares the same overall teachings and terminology. It arose in the eleventh century and established its scriptures mainly from termas and visions by tertöns such as Loden Nyingpo. Though Bon terma contain myths of Bon existing before the introduction of Buddhism in Tibet, \\"in truth the 'old religion' was a new religion.\\" - The Samye Monastery or Samye Gompa (Chinese:) is the first Buddhist monastery built in Tibet. It was probably first constructed between 775-9 CE under the patronage of King Trisong Detsen of Tibet who sought to revitalize Buddhism, which had declined since its introduction by King Songtsän Gampo in the 7th century. The monastery is in Dranang, Lhoka Prefecture. It was supposedly modeled on the design of Odantapuri in what is now Bihar, India. - Tibetan Buddhism is the body of Buddhist doctrine and institutions characteristic of Tibet, the regions surrounding the Himalayas and much of Central Asia. It derives from the latest stages of Indian Buddhism and preserves \\"the Tantric status quo of eighth-century India.\\" Tibetan Buddhism aspires to Buddhahood or rainbow body. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - In Mahayana Buddhism, bodhisattva is the Sanskrit term for anyone who, motivated by great compassion, has generated bodhicitta, which is a spontaneous wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings. Bodhisattvas are a popular subject in Buddhist art. - Daklha Gampo ( Dwags lha sgam po ) is a Kagyu monastery founded in 1121 CE by Je Gampopa ( 1079 - 1153 ) , the disciple of the famous and much - loved bodhisattva , Jetsun Milarepa ( c. 1052 -- c. 1135 ) It is located in Gyatsa County in the old district of Dakpo in southern Tibet on land sanctified as a geomantic power - place ( ' head of the ogress ' ) by the first Tibetan emperor , Songtsen Gampo ( 605 or 617 ? - 649 ) , and made a repository of terma by Padmasambhava . - In Buddhism, bodhicitta (\\"putixin\\" \\"bodaishin\\" Wylie transliteration: \\"byang chub kyi sems\\" Vietnamese: B- tâm), \\"enlightenment-mind\\", is the mind that strives toward awakening, empathy and compassion for the benefit of all sentient beings. - Songtsen Gampo (569649?/605649?) was the founder of the Tibetan Empire, and is traditionally credited with the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet, influenced by his Nepali and Chinese queens, as well as being the unifier of what were previously several Tibetan kingdoms. He is also regarded as responsible for the creation of Tibetan alphabet and therefore the establishment of Classical Tibetan, the language spoken in his region at the time, as the literary language of Tibet. - Sanskrit (English pronunciation:; written in Devanagari script ; : or ', originally ', \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism and \\"Mahyna\\" Buddhism, a philosophical language in Hinduism, Jainism, Buddhism and Sikhism. It was also a literary language that was in use as a \\"lingua franca\\" in ancient and medieval South Asia. It is a standardised dialect of Old Indo-Aryan, originating as Vedic Sanskrit and tracing its linguistic ancestry back to Proto-Indo-Iranian and Proto-Indo-European. Today it is listed as one of the 22 scheduled languages of India and is an official language of the state of Uttarakhand. As one of the oldest Indo-European languages for which substantial written documentation exists, Sanskrit holds a prominent position in Indo-European studies. - The Tibetan alphabet is an abugida used to write the Tibetic languages such as Tibetan, as well as Dzongkha, Sikkimese, Ladakhi, and sometimes Balti. The printed form of the alphabet is called uchen script while the hand-written cursive form used in everyday writing is called umê script. - The Sakya (\\"pale earth\\") school is one of four major schools of Tibetan Buddhism, the others being the Nyingma, Kagyu, and Gelug. It is one of the Red Hat sects along with the Nyingma and Kagyu. - The Gelug, Gelug-pa, dGe Lugs Pa, dge-lugs-pa or Dgelugspa is the newest of the schools of Tibetan Buddhism. It was founded by Je Tsongkhapa (13571419), a philosopher and Tibetan religious leader. The first monastery he established was named Ganden, and to this day the Ganden Tripa is the nominal head of the school, though its most influential figure is the Dalai Lama. Allying themselves with the Mongols as a powerful patron, the Gelug emerged as the pre-eminent Buddhist school in Tibet since the end of the 16th century. - In Tibetan Buddhism, the Red Hat sect or Red Hat sects, named for the colour of the monks' hats at formal occasions, includes the three oldest of the four main schools of Tibetan Buddhism, namely: - Buddhism (or ) is a religion and dharma that encompasses a variety of traditions, beliefs and spiritual practices largely based on teachings attributed to the Buddha. Buddhism originated in India sometime between the 6th and 4th centuries BCE, from where it spread through much of Asia, whereafter it declined in India during the middle ages. Two major extant branches of Buddhism are generally recognized by scholars: Theravada (Pali: \\"The School of the Elders\\") and Mahayana (Sanskrit: \\"The Great Vehicle\\"). Buddhism is the world's fourth-largest religion, with over 500 million followers or 7% of the global population, known as Buddhists. - Nepal, officially the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, is a landlocked central Himalayan country in South Asia. It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between. Nepal has a diverse geography, including fertile plains, subalpine forested hills, and eight of the world's ten tallest mountains, including Mount Everest, the highest point on Earth. Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language. - Trisong Detsän or Trisong Detsen was the son of Me Agtsom and one of the emperors of Tibet. He ruled from 755 until 797 or 804 CE. Trisong Detsen was the second of the Three Dharma Kings of Tibet, playing a pivotal role in the introduction of Buddhism to Tibet and the establishment of the Nyingma or \\"Ancient\\" school of Tibetan Buddhism. - In Buddhism, buddhahood (, or ) is the condition or rank of a buddha (or , , Pali/Sanskrit for \\"awakened one\\"). - Tibet (Tibetan Pinyin: \\"boe\\", ; /i ts¹/) is a region on the Tibetan Plateau in Asia. It is the traditional homeland of the Tibetan people as well as some other ethnic groups such as Monpa, Qiang, and Lhoba peoples and is now also inhabited by considerable numbers of Han Chinese and Hui people. Tibet is the highest region on Earth, with an average elevation of . The highest elevation in Tibet is Mount Everest, Earth's highest mountain, rising 8,848 m (29,029 ft) above sea level. - Buddhist art is the artistic practices that are influenced by Buddhism. It includes art media which depict Buddhas, bodhisattvas, and other entities; notable Buddhist figures, both historical and mythical; narrative scenes from the lives of all of these; mandalas and other graphic aids to practice; as well as physical objects associated with Buddhist practice, such as vajras, bells, stupas and Buddhist temple architecture. Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world. - Padmasambhava (lit. \\"Lotus-Born\\"), also known as Guru Rinpoche, was an 8th-century Indian Buddhist master. Although there was a historical Padmasambhava, nothing is known of him apart from helping the construction of the first Buddhist monastery in Tibet at Samye, at the behest of Trisong Detsen, and shortly thereafter leaving Tibet due to court intrigues.

Summarize this article: V5C log books record a car's \\"registered keeper\\". However, in some cases they are not being updated for several months after cars are sold, a BBC investigation has found. Some dealers retain the documents to help them qualify for large discounts from car manufacturers. The National Franchised Dealers Association describe the findings as \\"concerning\\" and say bonuses linked to sales might \\"incentivise\\" the activity. The cars affected are \\"pre-registered,\\" excess stock sold cheaply by manufacturers to dealers. They must legally be kept off-road for 90 days before being re-sold. The delays can be even longer if the car was originally registered by a retailer as a business fleet vehicle. However, in some cases the cars are delivered to new buyers immediately, while the vehicles remain registered at a separate address, an investigation by BBC Radio 4's You and Yours has found. Many of the cars are sold on by online car brokers. They commonly disclose the disadvantages in their terms and conditions, explaining that the vehicles will be registered to customers \\"in due course\\". However, many customers fail to read the small print and some suffer the consequences. \\"I couldn't drive the car because it had been declared off-road\\", said buyer Andrew March. \\"The car log book had been withheld so I couldn't re-tax it.\\" After asking repeatedly for his logbook, motorist James Laddie applied to the DVLA for a new one. The three-month delay proved expensive: \\"The council would not transfer our old parking permit to the new car without proof of ownership. The combined cost of parking tickets was about Â£200.\\" Experts stress that there can be potentially more serious consequences of a driver and their car being registered to different addresses. For example, police speed camera fines are sent to the postal address linked via DVLA records to a car's registration plate. One driver who spoke to You and Yours lived in London while his car remained registered for several months in Bolton. Insurance companies also require drivers to disclose both the owner and the registered keeper of a vehicle. Roy Rodger, an expert on insurance law who has trained underwriters, warns that drivers' confusion over withheld log books could lead to costly mistakes. \\"In a situation where a driver misled the insurance company over registration details and a serious accident occurred, the driver could be in a very, very awkward position. \\"They could have to pay the claim out of their own pocket eventually,\\" he said. The Association of British Insurers told You and Yours it was not aware of any cases where this had happened, but added that drivers should inform motor insurers if they are not the registered keeper. The practice of log books being retained by third party suppliers was highlighted in a 2012 court case brought against a competitor by online car broker Richard Sanders, founder of Drive the Deal. The competitor had not adequately warned consumers of the risks involved. Although Mr Sanders won the case, he says the industry has not been fully cleaned up. \\"We decided to start looking at this because we were very concerned indeed about the trouble that some consumers would get themselves into,\\" he said. \\"Unfortunately I think the practice of wrongly registering cars on purpose does continue.\\" The director of the National Franchised Dealers Association, Sue Robinson, says she is very concerned by the findings. \\"As dealers are required to keep vehicles for 90 days to qualify for some bonuses, that could incentivise this type of activity,\\" she said. Autocar editorial director, Jim Holder, says transparency in the car industry has improved but problems remain. \\"This part of the industry is poorly regulated and there are still traders out there who ignore the rules,\\" he said. \\"It's not really a problem that the industry takes seriously and it's really only word of mouth and education that can stop this.\\" You and Yours is on BBC Radio 4 weekdays 12:15-13:00 GMT.

What's the best answer to this question: is it possible to have sympathy pregnancy symptoms? pick from the following. * no * yes...A:","completion":"Yes, it is possible to have sympathy pregnancy symptoms. Couvade syndrome, also known as sympathetic pregnancy, is a phenomenon in which a partner, usually the expectant father, experiences some of the same symptoms and behavior as the pregnant mother. This condition is not officially recognized as a medical diagnosis, but there is evidence that it exists on a psychosocial and physiological level. Sympathy pregnancy symptoms can vary and often align with the symptoms experienced by the pregnant mother. Some common symptoms reported include minor weight gain, alterations in hormone levels, morning nausea, disturbed sleep patterns, and even, in more extreme cases, labor pains, postpartum depression, and nosebleeds. The labor pain symptom is commonly referred to as sympathy pain. It is believed that the underlying cause of Couvade syndrome is a combination of psychological, social, and hormonal factors. Emotional stress and anxiety related to the impending arrival of a new child can result in the non-pregnant partner experiencing physical symptoms. Additionally, some researchers suggest that hormonal changes, particularly increased levels of prolactin, might contribute to the condition. Furthermore, the social and cultural context may contribute to the development of Couvade syndrome. In some societies, the expectation of a strong emotional bond between prospective parents could lead to the manifestation of sympathetic pregnancy symptoms. When the couple is heavily involved in each other's lives and the daily experience of pregnancy, it is not surprising that the partner may develop similar symptoms. In conclusion, it is possible to have sympathy pregnancy symptoms, as seen in Couvade syndrome. This condition is not an officially recognized medical diagnosis, but it is well-documented in various cultures and has been observed by experts in the fields of psychology, sociology, and medicine. The occurrence of sympathetic pregnancy involves a complex interplay of psychological, hormonal, and cultural factors that can lead to the development of shared physical symptoms between expectant parents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While traveling in the Earth's orbit over 240 miles up, American astronaut Karen Nyberg joined Leading Women anchor Becky Anderson for a live interview from the International Space Station (ISS) Friday. When she's not working on scientific experiments, Nyberg can be found tweeting amazing pictures of the planet, chasing floating desserts in space and knitting. Read on for the full interview. CNN: Station, this is CNN. How do you hear me? Karen Nyberg: Good Morning CNN. This is station. I have you loud and clear. CNN: Simeon Birchall, a CNN.com commenter asks is there huge competition for every seat on a shuttle launch? KN: Well I don't know if I'd say competition. Definitely everybody that is in the astronaut office that wants to fly is very eager to do so even if they have gone before. Generally it's kind of going in order of when a class is selected, they start flying people from that class. And then it depends on what roles are needed. If we need to fly somebody that is going to be the commander of the space station, frequently most often that is somebody who has experience flying; if we need somebody who is going to be doing space walks, we need somebody that can do that. Back when we were flying the shuttle, there were a lot more specific tasks doing robotics ops and the space walks. TIMELINE: 50 years of women in space. Now on the space station everybody pretty much has to do everything and so it's a little competitive I guess, but your turn comes along. CNN: @Alizabev asks what type of experiments are you working on? KN: This week we've been doing a lot of experiments on our ocular health. We've noticed some problems over the past several years with many of our astronauts. They come back to Earth after three to six months in space and have long term vision problems, changes in their vision. We are trying to figure out what exactly is causing that. Luca (Parmitano) and I have been involved in numerous tests. We're doing tonometry -- we are looking at the pressure of the eye. We are doing ultrasounds to look at the morphology of the eye, we are doing fundoscopy to take images of the retina, vision tests. We are hoping that we can determine exactly what is causing this and hopefully mitigate the problem, especially if we start longer duration missions going to Mars ... we really need to understand this so we don't degrade the vision of every astronaut that is going into space. CNN: A commenter on CNN.com Marik asks what do you think of the Mars One project which aims to privately settle people on the planet? KN: I think it would be interesting. I think there are a lot of challenges and a lot of things that need to be figured out before that can be a successful mission. Mars is a long ways away and we have a lot to learn ... I don't know how many years from now that will be, but that type of thing may become standard. CNN: Floyd Moore aged 5 and Camper Carl of @AZChallenger both asked the same question: What is it like to sleep in space? And have you ever floated out of your bed? KN: It's actually quite comfortable sleeping in space. We have sleeping bags that we hang from the wall. The first couple weeks when I was here, it was very important to me to feel like I was almost laying on something. I would lay with my legs sideways in the sleeping back so that I felt pressure along my back from one side of the sleeping bag and I felt pressure from my legs on the other side. Now I've become a little more adapted to it and I can just float there. And no, I've never floated out of the bed. I'm usually zipped in pretty well. CNN: @Womenintheair asks: Which female astronauts influenced you? And have you met any of them as an astronaut? KN: Sally Ride was making her first flight into space and she really impacted me. And also just looking back, I did some research on Valentina Tereshkova when I was in high school because she was the first female to fly in space. And I actually did meet her last year for a brief moment before traveling to Baikonur as a back up for one of the missions. It was just (a) fantastic opportunity to get to meet her. I never did meet Sally Ride. I met her sister after her passing but it would have been fantastic to meet her too. But I think those two, the firsts, those names stick in your head and they really become inspirations for you. CNN: @nmedia_s asks do you think there is intelligent life in space -- besides the people at the ISS? KN: I don't know. I don't think I'm smart enough to know. The universe is so big. It's hard to imagine that there isn't something out there that is similar to our solar system and could provide what the Earth provides for us. But certainly we haven't seen that and you know, maybe some day we will. It's hard for me to say whether I truly believe it or not. I think it's possible. I don't believe we've seen anything but it's possible there is life out there somewhere. CNN: @FumaiMartin asks how much physics and chemistry taught in high school helps at the International Space Station? KN: I think any type of scientific class or mathematical class or any class really that you take is helpful even if you don't use the specific fundamentals that you learn in that class. There is something about learning how to learn that I think is very important is a very broad spectrum. And the same for college, a lot of the classes you take you are like, you think to yourself 'I'm never going to use this.' And you know what, sometimes you don't ... But a lot of it you do use. Even though we are working directly with the investigators of the scientific experiments. It's important for us understand what's going on so we can help and maybe we can see things and we can help them with their discoveries. CNN: Greg Wagner on Facebook asks what one place on Earth would you most like to visit with only the knowledge of having seen it from the ISS? KN: Oh wow! You know there are so many beautiful places that I don't even know how I would answer that. I've seen some mountain ranges that are just absolutely incredible ... But at the same time, I've come along some coastlines that look just breathtaking and so I guess I would have a lot of traveling to do if I were to go to every single place that I thought looked like a great place to be. CNN: CNN Mexico commenter Luis Flores Gonzalez asks if you were offered the opportunity to take a one-way trip to the deepest part of the universe, would you accept it? KN: A one-way trip, no. Especially with the current situation I'm in with a young son and a husband at home. I definitely would not want to do a really long, and definitely a one-way trip. It might be a different story if I had family with me but I'd have to say no to that. CNN: @Fadhelindonesia asks when you read my message what continent are you looking at? KN: We just passed over the east coast of South America and we are heading up towards Africa. We should be there in just a couple of minutes. And then we'll head up over Europe and into Asia. CNN: Leading Women co-anchor Kristie Lu Stout tweeted: We hear you're a bit of a DIY design geek. Do you get crafty in space? KN: I have been trying to do a little bit. ... It's amazing. Time goes by so fast and in the weekdays and on the evenings, there's absolutely no time for that. Sundays is really my day and I actually got a few things out the other day and drew up a design on a piece of paper and cut up some old T shirts and have started sewing things together. Not quite sure exactly how it is going to turn out but ... when I find the time to sit there and do that only, hopefully I'll get something done. WATCH THE FULL LIVE STREAM INTERVIEW.

The Manhattan Bridge, Throgs Neck Bridge, Triborough Bridge, and Verrazano-Narrows Bridge are all examples of Structural Expressionism. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): The Queensboro Bridge utilized what type of construction?","completion":"The Queensboro Bridge, also known as the 59th Street Bridge, is an important piece of cantilever architecture in New York City. It spans the East River and connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Queens. The bridge was designed by engineer Gustav Lindenthal and architect Henry Hornbostel and was completed in 1909. The Queensboro Bridge used a type of construction called cantilever construction, which is an architectural technique that involves projecting a structure horizontally into space, supported on only one end. In this case, the bridge's weight is carried by steel cantilevered trusses, which are supported by two large masonry piers. This construction method means the bridge doesn't need any additional support other than the two piers, and the cantilever trusses transfer the weight of the bridge to these piers on either side of the river. This was a common approach for long-span bridges in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Cantilever construction is designed to distribute the weight of a structure evenly, allowing it to carry heavy loads and resist lateral forces. The main feature of cantilever construction is the use of long, steel beams that project outwards from the piers and are anchored by counterweights at each end. These steel beams are then connected to each other at their center points by additional beams, creating a box-like structure that gives the bridge its rigidity and strength. The chief advantage of cantilever construction is that it eliminates the need for compression members, like vertical pillars or suspension cables, in the center of the bridge. This allows for a greater space underneath the bridge, which is useful for the passage of boats and ships. In addition, cantilever construction affords easier access for maintenance work, as there are fewer structural elements in the way. In summary, the Queensboro Bridge utilized cantilever construction, where steel trusses were cantilevered from two main piers to form the bridge's structure. This technique was favorable during the late 19th and early 20th centuries for long-span bridges, providing an efficient way to carry heavy loads and resist lateral forces while allowing for easy maintenance and ample space underneath the bridge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Do you know there is a group called the National Children's Bureau? They are a group of people who care about children, just like you! They work on making sure kids have what they need to grow up happy and healthy. Well, they recently shared some news, and it's important that we talk about it. The National Children's Bureau has found out that thousands of children in England are not getting the education they need. Education is like going to school, where you learn how to read, write, and do fun things like arts and crafts. School is where you get to learn about the world around you and make new friends. So why are many kids not getting the education they need? There could be many reasons. Sometimes, it might be because their family is moving around a lot, and they cannot go to the same school for a long time. Other times, it might be because their parents are busy taking care of other family matters and can't help them get to school. Not getting a proper education could make life harder for these kids when they grow up. They might struggle with finding good jobs, taking care of themselves, and being a part of the community. The National Children's Bureau thinks that this problem is very serious and needs to be fixed. They are telling the people who make decisions, like the government, that they need to do more to help these kids get the education they need. This could mean making sure there are enough schools in every area or finding ways to make school more enjoyable for kids. It might also mean finding better ways to help families when they need it, so that kids don't miss school as often. So kids, whenever you go to school, remember that it's a special place to learn and grow. If you come across friends who are having a hard time or not going to school, let an adult know so that they can help, too.

Article: This is the classic way to wear a fanny pack, though you may be surprised to learn you can create different styles just wearing it in slightly different places near your waist! For instance, try wearing it at your natural waist, which is just above your belly button, where your torso is the smallest. Wearing a fanny pack here helps define the shape of your body. Try wearing it on the front but slightly off-center. You can also place the fanny pack near the top of your pants for a bold approach. This position makes the fanny pack stand out, since it's sitting near your hips, pushing it outward. If you want to show off your fanny pack this way, position it at or just below your belly button. You can wear it in the front of your body right in the middle, slightly off-center, or off one hip. Wear a small bag through your belt loops for a subtle approach. Pull the straps through your belt loops from the front with the pack like a belt buckle. Secure it in the back, and then throw a jacket over your whole outfit. Try wearing your fanny pack turned to the back for a fun surprise. Wear it slung across your backside at your waist. People won't be able to see it in the front, but when you turn around, you'll have a fashionable accessory! While fanny packs are usually worn around the waist, using one as a shoulder bag can be a trendy look. Wear it across your chest with the bag centered in front. Because it fits close to your body, it will keep all your stuff within easy reach. You can even put a fanny pack on over a jacket. The fanny pack can act as a belt, cinching in your clothes to create a more defined silhouette. This is the classic way to wear a fanny pack. Belt a small leather bag into your pants and wear a shirt you tuck in or that falls just at the fanny pack. Then, throw a jacket over it all to complete the look. This look is great for a rock concert or date night, depending on what jacket you choose! You can also try this look with a statement top and no jacket, such as a plunging silk top with billowy arms that falls just over the top of the fanny pack. Pair a stylish bag with your favorite shirt and jeans. Sling the bag over your hips, and you're ready for a walk through the park or a fun day at a festival. Try adding flats for a bit of pizazz or simply stick with sneakers if you need to walk a long way. You could also wear corduroys or sporty pants. In the winter, wearing it over your clothes may still hide your fanny pack so move it so it's on the outside. Try wearing one over a trench coat, for instance, for easy access. Wrap it around your natural waist or just below to help define your silhouette. Pick one that adds a pop of color or try one that blends in with the outfit. You could also put one over a blazer. You may not think a fanny pack goes over a dress, but think again. Many fashion-forward celebrities rock this look. Just pick a stylish bag in a quality material, and you're good to go. For instance, try a leather bag over a maxi dress. Other quality materials include silk and wool. This look works best for casual looks, date night, and semi-formal events, depending on the bag you choose. Skip it for formal events.

What is the answer for the question: What did the company where Edwards resigned in 1995 produce in 1994? from the following article ? Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By...

Help as much as you can. Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: A good joke can be the hardest thing to understand when studying a foreign language. As a recent article in The Guardian newspaper noted, \\"There's more to understanding a joke in a foreign language than understanding vocabulary and grammar.\\" Being able to understand local jokes is often seen as an incredible ice-breaker for a language learner eager to form friendships with native speakers. \\"I always felt that humor was a ceiling that I could never break through,\\" Hannah Ashley, a public relations account manager in London, who once studied Spanish in Madrid. Told The Guardian, \\"I could never speak to people on the same level as I would speak to a native English speaker. I almost came across as quite a boring person because all I could talk about was facts.\\" In fact, most of the time, jokes are only funny for people who share a cultural background or understand humor in the same way. Chinese-American comedian Joe Wong found this out first-hand. He had achieved huge success in the US, but when he returned to China in 2008 for his first live show in Beijing, he discovered that people didn't think his. Chinese jokes were as funny as his English ones. In Australia, meanwhile many foreigners find understanding jokes about sports to be the biggest headache. \\"The hardest jokes are related to rugby because I know nothing about rugby,\\" said Melody Cao, who was once a student in Australia. \\"When I heard jokes I didn't get, I just laughed along.\\" In the other two major English-speaking countries, the sense of humor is also different. British comedian Simon Pegg believes that while Britons use irony-basically, saying something they don't mean to make a joke-every day, people in the US don't see the point of using it so often. \\"British jokes tend to be more subtle and dark, while American jokes are more obvious with their meanings, a bit like Americans themselves,\\" he wrote in The Guardian.","completion":"Which of the following statements best describes the challenges faced by language learners when trying to understand jokes in a foreign language?

I just genuinely do n't want to go back to that church . I could n't get the balls to tell her that ... Question: Why would n't I have the balls to tell her that ?","completion":"There could be several reasons why you wouldn't have the \\"balls\\" to tell her that you don't want to go back to the church. Assuming \\"her\\" is a close person to you, it could involve deep-rooted emotions, social factors, and personal experiences that may be causing hesitation. Let's explore some potential factors that could be contributing to this situation: 1. Fear of confrontation: Many people tend to avoid confrontations, as they can be uncomfortable or distressing. You might be concerned that by telling her your true feelings, it could lead to an argument or strain your relationship with her. This fear of confrontation can sometimes prevent us from expressing our genuine thoughts and feelings. 2. Worries about judgment: Expressing your unwillingness to return to the church might be something you believe could lead to her judging or questioning your actions, beliefs, or values. This concern about facing judgment from others often prevents people from being open about their thoughts and choices. 3. Emotional attachment: If the person you need to talk to is someone with whom you share a close bond or emotional attachment, it might be challenging to express your feelings towards the church. You might be worried about how this could affect your relationship, fearing the possibility of upsetting her or causing emotional pain. 4. Fear of rejection: There's always a possibility that when we express our true thoughts or feelings to someone, they might not agree or understand our perspective. This fear of being rejected or dismissed might be holding you back from telling her about your feelings regarding the church. 5. Social pressure: If the church has played a significant role in your social circle, shared experiences, or relationships, it might be challenging to stand up against that \\"norm.\\" You could be concerned about how this decision will be perceived by your friends, family, and community members, causing additional stress and anxiety. 6. Personal experiences: Your feelings towards the church might have been shaped by personal experiences that you have not yet fully processed or shared. There might be lingering fears or anxieties about revisiting those events or feelings in a conversation with her. 7. Concern for her feelings: It's also possible that you are genuinely concerned about the impact your decision could have on her. Perhaps she deeply cares about the church, has a personal connection to it, or might be hurt by your decision to not return. As a result, you might be hesitant to share your thoughts to avoid hurting her feelings or causing any heartache. To overcome these barriers and gather the courage to express your feelings, you could try speaking to a trusted friend or counselor who can provide guidance and support. Reflecting on the reasons why you don't want to return to the church and practicing healthy communication strategies can also help you build the confidence to share your thoughts with her. Remember, being honest and open about your feelings is an essential aspect of maintaining healthy relationships, overcoming challenges, and growing as an individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the provided information, the father convinced his son that it is possible for him to become a knight one day, despite the challenges stemming from being part of a peasant family. The statement describes a situation where a father is instilling the idea of potential knighthood in his son's mind, and even though the prospect might seem far-fetched due to their lower social standing, the father convinces the son that it is still attainable. This scenario likely takes place in a period where social mobility was considered a significant hurdle, and knights were mostly drawn from higher social classes or nobility. The father believes that they can overcome these societal barriers through determination, perseverance, and hard work. The reference to \\"he\\" in the sentence specifically addresses the son's aspirations and the father's motivation to encourage him to dream big and strive for such an accomplishment.

If the individual is consuming larger quantities of food, particularly those high in carbohydrates and sugars, their blood sugar levels might increase more rapidly and to higher levels. This would require a greater amount of insulin to be released to help the body absorb the excess glucose. In such a case, the overall process of regulating blood sugar levels might be working harder than in someone with a more balanced diet.

By reducing the amount of pollution that enters natural water sources, we can potentially alleviate or reverse some of the negative consequences associated with water pollution. Here's how fewer pollutants pumped into rivers might affect the process: 1. If less pollution enters natural water sources, the water quality will begin to improve over time. Cleaner water will support a diversity of living organisms, including beneficial microbes and aquatic plants that help cleanse the water and maintain its natural state. 2. With improved water quality, plants and animals living in and around these water sources would experience better health. This means that they would live longer and healthier lives, which can positively impact their ability to reproduce effectively. 3. As the health of plants and animals in these ecosystems improves, their populations would start to rebound as well. With more living organisms present in the water, the natural processes that keep the water clean can function more effectively, working together to maintain balance in the ecosystem. 4. The improved water quality, coupled with the increased presence of plants and animals, will help make the water usable again for a variety of purposes, including agriculture, recreation, and possibly even drinking and other household needs. In summary, directly impacting a step of the process by reducing the amount of pollutants pumped into rivers can have a domino effect on subsequent steps, ultimately leading to a healthier and more vibrant aquatic ecosystem. This stands in stark contrast to the original process described, wherein pollution continued to degrade water quality and undermine the health of plants and animals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They asked if we were going to try for our Canine Good Citizenship certificate and I said yes and we were hoping to go further and do therapy work . They also invited us to stick around and watch the Rally class and give it shot . They said Poodles usually need more of a challenge ! Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why would poodles need additional stimulus ?","completion":"Poodles need additional stimulus due to their high level of intelligence, energy, and versatile nature. These traits make them one of the most intelligent dog breeds, alongside their strong instinct to please their human companions, which leads to impressive trainability. However, these wonderful qualities can also mean that poodles require more of a challenge to stay mentally and physically engaged. Let us delve deeper into these qualities. 1. High Intelligence: Poodles are known for their incredible intelligence, consistently ranking as one of the smartest dog breeds according to various sources, such as Dr. Stanley Coren's book \\"The Intelligence of Dogs.\\" Their ability to learn commands, tasks, and behaviors quickly means they can become bored if not provided with adequate mental stimulation. Boredom in intelligent dogs can lead to unwanted behaviors as they seek ways to entertain themselves. 2. Energy Levels: Poodles, particularly the Standard and Miniature varieties, are quite energetic and require regular exercise to maintain their physical health and burn off excess energy. If poodles do not receive enough physical activity, they can become restless and develop problematic behaviors as a result. 3. Versatility: Poodles exhibit a versatile skillset, with a history as water retrieval dogs, circus performers, and even military dogs. This adaptability to various roles underscores their ability to learn and perform different tasks. This also means that they have the capacity to excel in various dog sports and activities, such as obedience, agility, and rally sports, where they can showcase their skills and challenge themselves. 4. Strong Human Connection: Poodles have a strong instinct for pleasing their human companions. This trait lends itself to their superb trainability, as they actively seek out ways to engage with and please their owners. Encouraging this connection through advanced training and activities allows the poodle to strengthen its bond with its owner while also receiving the mental stimulation and challenges it craves. Given these factors, it is not surprising that poodles may need additional stimulus to remain happy, healthy, and well-rounded. Engaging them in advanced training and activities like Rally, Canine Good Citizenship, and therapy work enables poodles to utilize their intelligence and energy to the fullest, maintaining strong connections with their human companions while benefiting from the mental and physical challenges these activities provide."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Question: What \\"bites\\" his penis off?

After swimming together, they go into a cave to get warm and begin kissing. Dawn gets uncomfortable and tries to get them to go back. Tobey then attempts to rape Dawn, who panics and tries to push him off. Tobey becomes aggressive and shakes Dawn, resulting in her smacking her head on the ground. While she is dazed, Tobey takes the opportunity to begin raping her. Dawn fights back and inadvertently bites off his penis with her vagina. A horrified Dawn stumbles away and she flees the scene. After a Promise meeting, she meets her classmate Ryan (Ashley Springer) at a dance; they talk, and he drops her off at her home.

Cynthia's laughter was not out of malice, of course, but rather stemmed from the innocence and unsteady steps of the baby as he navigated through the world with curiosity. Grandmother then gave Katrina a caring look as well, acknowledging her motherly instincts in immediately coming to the aid of the baby. Katrina gently lifted the baby from the floor, checking for any bruises or injuries from the tumble.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Depending on what part of the world you are moving from, Norway could be culturally and climatically very far removed from what you are used to. If you are moving from Northern Europe, the change will less dramatic than if you are moving from Central America or East Asia. The chances are that you have already visited and spent some time in Norway, if you have decided that you want to make the move over there. If you haven't actually been there, it's sensible to try to book yourself a holiday and spent a couple of weeks travelling around the country. Talk to people and try to get a feel for the culture and sensibilities of Norwegian people. One of the biggest adjustments and potential barriers to living in a new country can be the language. If you don't speak Norwegian, you might have a tough time finding work and dealing with the administrative and bureaucratic processes of finding a place to live and register as a resident. Although English is widely spoken in Norway, it's a good idea to try to learn some basic Norwegian before you go. Once you are there be sure to commit enough time to learning the language. Your experiences, relationships and opportunities will likely stay reasonably narrow if you can't operate in the local language. One of the biggest shocks to new arrivals in Norway might be the weather. Parts of Norway are in the Arctic circle, so you should expect plenty of cold, wind and rain. The weather does vary depending on weather you live close to the coast or more inland. As a general rule, the coastal areas will have milder winters, but will experience more wind and rain throughout the year. The average winter temperature of Oslo is around -4 degrees Celsius, or 23 degree Fahrenheit. Winter snow and frosts can occur from October, all the way to April. In the summer months you can expect milder temperatures, and even the occasional heat wave. Norway has very long days in summer that can cause problems to people who have not experienced this before. In the winter, however, the long days are replaced by long nights. The impact of this will depend where you are moving from, but it can cause problems. In the summer in Oslo, it will generally not get any darker than twilight. The further north you go, the longer the days. If you go far enough north you will reach a point where the sun doesn't set. In winter, the daylight in Oslo can be as brief as six hours. In Tromsø, above the Arctic circle, the sun does not rise for six weeks. One of the potential problems with living in Norway, is the relatively high cost of living. Housing costs and eating out can be expensive, and there are relatively high levels of taxation. Be sure to spend some time thinking about housing and other essential costs, as well as how much money you can expect to earn.

General Assembly, where some of the most-controversial speakers spoke last. Here are a few things we learned:. 1. The Syrian government is not backing down. Foreign Minister Walid Moallem took to the lectern to defend his country's handling of the 19-month crisis, which has spiraled into a civil war. He accused \\"some well-known countries\\" of pursuing \\"new colonial policies\\" under the guise of humanitarian efforts, and blamed Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Libya and others for \\"arming, funding, training and harboring armed terrorist groups.\\" International calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down are a \\"blatant interference in the domestic affairs of Syria,\\" the foreign minister said. Approximately 28,000 people have been killed in the conflict, according to the opposition, and hundreds of thousands have been forced from their homes. \\"While my government is working hard to meet the basic needs of citizens who have been forced by the violence of armed groups to flee their homes, some have sought to fabricate a refugee crisis in neighboring countries through inciting armed groups to intimidate Syrian civilians at border areas and forcing them to flee to neighboring countries,\\" said Moallem. U.N. debate this year largely centered around the conflict in Syria. Most of the international community condemns the government there, but can't agree on how to stop the bloodshed. Strong U.N. Security Council action has been blocked by longtime Syria supporters, Russia and China. 2. Cuba slams the U.S. embargo, which has been in place for more than 50 years. Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez railed against his country's northern neighbor, blasting the embargo that was put in place in 1960. Cuba attributes much of its economic woe to the embargo, which it calls \\"the blockade.\\" Rodriguez said the policy has caused \\"invaluable human and economic damage,\\" and accused President Barack Obama of breaking promises he made in 2009. \\"The U.S. policy towards our region, whether under Democrat or Republican governments, is essentially the same. The promises made by the current president ... were not fulfilled,\\" he said, referring to Obama's initial pledge to lower some of the barriers in Cuban-American relations. In 2009, the U.S. Treasury Department lifted some restrictions on the ability of Cuban-Americans to visit relatives in Cuba and send them money, but the United States has kept key components of the embargo in place. The continued imprisonment of U.S. contractor Alan Gross, who was jailed in 2009 on suspicion of espionage, is thought to be the most recent reason why relations are not improving. \\"The United States do not have the slightest moral or political authority to judge Cuba,\\" Rodriguez told delegates. 3. The head of the North Korean delegation says a spark could set off war on the Korean Peninsula. Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kil-yon addressed delegates amid ever-present pressure on his country's nuclear program. He criticized the United States, claiming it wants to occupy the Korean Peninsula and use the region as a \\"stepping stone for realizing its strategy of dominating the whole of Asia.\\" \\"Today, due to the continued U.S. hostile policy towards DPRK, the vicious cycle of confrontation and aggravation of tensions is on ongoing phenomenon on the Korean Peninsula, which has become the world's most dangerous hotspot where a spark of fire could set off a thermonuclear war,\\" Pak said. He recalled the December death of longtime leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Il's son and chosen successor, Kim Jong Un, has taken over as \\"supreme leader,\\" though the level of his influence on policy decisions remains unclear. Pak also made mention of the country's recent rocket launch. In April, North Korea launched a rocket, which failed less than two minutes into the flight. It said the launch was to put a satellite into orbit, but much of the international community saw it as a cover-up for testing ballistic missile technology. The move destroyed a deal reached in February under which Pyongyang agreed to suspend its nuclear activities in exchange for food aid shipments from the United States. \\"The United States took issue with our legitimate and peaceful space launch that followed the universal, international law and forced the U.N. Security Council to adopt an unjust statement,\\" Pak said. North Korea has been virtually isolated from the world by international sanctions over its development of a nuclear program.","completion":"The 67th session of the U.N. General Assembly ended with some controversial statements and highlights from key speakers, including representatives from Syria, Cuba, and North Korea. 1. Syria's Foreign Minister Walid Moallem defended the Syrian government's handling of the ongoing civil war, blaming countries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Libya for supporting terrorist groups. He argued that international calls for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to step down are a \\"blatant interference in the domestic affairs of Syria.\\" The conflict in Syria has been a significant focus of the U.N. debate this year, with most of the international community condemning the government's actions. However, U.N. Security Council actions have been blocked by Russia and China, two longtime Syria supporters. 2. Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez criticized the U.S. embargo, which has been in place since 1960, attributing much of the country's economic turmoil to this policy. Rodriguez accused President Barack Obama of breaking promises he made in 2009, stating that U.S. policy towards Cuba has remained essentially the same under both Democrat and Republican governments. While the U.S. Treasury Department lifted some restrictions on Cuban-Americans in 2009, key components of the embargo remain in place. Rodriguez argued that the United States does not have the moral or political authority to judge Cuba. 3. North Korean Vice Foreign Minister Pak Kil-yon warned that a spark could set off a war on the Korean Peninsula, emphasizing the tension caused by the U.S. hostile policy towards North Korea.

Furyk won the FedEX Cup 10 million prize two years ago and looked to have an incredible opportunity to record a 59 after hitting seven birdies in the first ten holes. He also claimed birdies at the 15th and 17th but bogeys at the 13th, 16th and 18th left him just two shots clear at the top of the leader board. England's Justin Rose shot a 68 to move into second place on six-under-par. The joint overnight leader hit five birdies to remain in contention following his opening round of 66. But World No.1 Rory McIlroy remained in pole position to claim that 10 prize for overall winner of the playoffs after producing his 10th consecutive sub-70 score. McIlroy sank a 25-foot eagle putt on the 16th to ensure he finished with a round of 68 and leave him four shots off the lead at halfway. The Northern Irishman was joined on three-under-par by Americans Robert Garrigus and Zach Johnson after both players hit rounds of 69. Woods and Rose share first round lead. But Tiger Woods, who shot an opening round 66 to share the lead with Rose, struggled to produce a repeat performance. Woods, whose last win came at July's AT & T National, could only manage a 73 to leave him on one-under-par, a setback to his challenge to McIlroy for the playoffs title. Masters champion Bubba Watson moved into contention on five-under-par alongside Bo Van Pelt, with Matt Kuchar and Dustin Johnson a shot further back. Last year's money list winner Luke Donald of England shot a 69 to finish level par at the halfway stage, while his compatriot Lee Westwood was 28th out of 30 on five-over-par following a disappointing round of 73. .

But two parents' decision to let their child relieve himself has caused much attention in China. By now, it seems, the whole Chinese Internet is familiar with what happened on a crowded Hong Kong shopping street. A mother holds a nappy while her two-year-old pees. A passerby took pictures which then were put online. The woman explained that they had found a public toilet but saw there was a long queue, so she had no other choice but to let their child to relieve himself on the street instead.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. Paragraph: Two groups of scientists examined two fires. Group A put a large log on it, and group B made a fire with small twigs. They wanted to see which fire would last longer. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Group B, who made a fire with small twigs, had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. This is because the small twigs provided a greater surface area for the reaction to occur compared to the large log used by Group A. As explained in the background, an increase in surface area leads to an increase in the rate of a reaction. Since the smaller twigs have a larger combined surface area, the reaction happening in the fire will be more intense as it allows for more effective contact and interaction between the wood and the oxygen in the air. Furthermore, the more substantial surface area of the small twigs also means that a larger number of chemical reactions can take place concurrently, resulting in a faster and more intense combustion process. This is why the fire created by Group B using small twigs will burn with a more intense reaction relative to Group A's fire with the large log. It's important to note that the higher intensity of the reaction in Group B's fire with twigs does not mean that their fire will last longer. On the contrary, the more intense and rapid combustion process will likely cause their fire to burn out more quickly when compared to the slower-burning large log used by Group A. However, the question specifically asked about the intensity of the reaction, and in that regard, Group B's fire exhibits a more intense reaction due to the increased surface area provided by the small twigs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: On 10 March 1914, the suffragette Mary Richardson walked into the National Gallery and attacked Velázquez's canvas with a meat cleaver. Her action was ostensibly provoked by the arrest of fellow suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst the previous day, although there had been earlier warnings of a planned suffragette attack on the collection. Richardson left seven slashes on the painting, particularly causing damage to the area between the figure's shoulders. However, all were successfully repaired by the National Gallery's chief restorer Helmut Ruhemann.Richardson was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, the maximum allowed for destruction of an artwork. In a statement to the Women's Social and Political Union shortly afterwards, Richardson explained, \\"I have tried to destroy the picture of the most beautiful woman in mythological history as a protest against the Government for destroying Mrs. Pankhurst, who is the most beautiful character in modern history.\\" She added in a 1952 interview that she didn't like \\"the way men visitors gaped at it all day long\\".The feminist writer Lynda Nead observed, \\"The incident has come to symbolize a particular perception of feminist attitudes towards the female nude; in a sense, it has come to represent a specific stereotypical image of feminism more generally.\\" Contemporary reports of the incident reveal that the picture was not widely seen as mere artwork. Journalists tended to assess the attack in terms of a murder (Richardson was nicknamed \\"Slasher Mary\\"), and used words that conjured wounds inflicted on an actual female body, rather than on a pictorial representation of a female body.

A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. Diego Maradona was delighted to secure his first victory as a World Cup coach, but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe. \\"When you don't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price.

Sunburns, characterized by redness, pain, and sometimes swelling, are typically viewed as an unpleasant experience stemming from excessive exposure to the sun or ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Many people find them uncomfortable and disruptive to their daily life, as they can potentially result in peeling, blistering, and other symptoms. In this context, the author is expressing that they have experienced sunburn on their entire body, which likely has caused a significant amount of discomfort.

This legislation was enacted to provide a comprehensive framework for the protection and conservation of wildlife in India, including endangered and threatened species, as well as their habitats. The Act prohibits hunting, capturing, injuring, or killing wild animals, except under specific circumstances, such as when the animal poses a danger to human life or is severely injured or diseased beyond recovery.

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the process The process describes the stages of human life: from being a fetus in the womb, to eventually dying as an elderly person. Step 2: Understand the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis is that every time someone exhales carbon dioxide, no baby will be born. We need to evaluate if exhaling carbon dioxide affects the birth of babies. Step 3: Examine the relationship between exhaling carbon dioxide and the birth of babies Exhaling carbon dioxide is a byproduct of respiration, which is a natural and essential process for all living organisms, including humans. The birth of babies is a result of reproduction, another natural and essential process in the continuation of the human species. Step 4: Determine if the perturbation affects the process The act of exhaling carbon dioxide does not appear to have a direct impact on the birth of babies. The two processes (respiration and reproduction) occur independently of one another. Step 5: Consider any indirect effects of the perturbation on the process While it is true that the presence of excessive carbon dioxide in the atmosphere can contribute to climate change and other environmental issues, this would not directly prevent a baby from being born. Instead, it might contribute to a range of broader issues that could affect humanity as a whole, including the availability of resources, ecosystems, and general quality of life. However, these indirect effects are more global and long-term, and not directly linked to the act of exhaling carbon dioxide and the birth of an individual baby. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation (every breath I exhale carbon dioxide) does not have a direct effect on the process (fetus to elderly person). Exhaling carbon dioxide is a natural part of human respiration and does not directly impact reproduction or the birth of babies. While there may be indirect effects related to environmental issues, they do not directly prevent a baby from being born."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. Paragraph: Two teams studied two types of animals: team A studied predators, while team B studied grazers. They learned a lot from this experience. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team learned less about wolves? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Team B learned less about wolves. This is because Team A studied predators, which includes wolves as they are an apex predator in many ecosystems.

Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Which continent was inhabited by fewer crocodiles? Hint: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw... Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, it is important to note that Asia was mostly populated by reptiles of all species, while Africa was mostly populated by birds and very few reptiles. Since crocodiles belong to the class of reptiles, we can infer that there were fewer crocodiles in Africa than in Asia. The primary reason behind this outcome is due to the varying ecosystems and habitats on the two continents. In Asia, the climate and environment are more suitable for sustaining a diverse range of reptiles, including crocodiles. The continent is home to numerous tropical and subtropical regions, as well as vast river systems and wetlands that provide adequate living conditions for these animals. On the other hand, Africa is well-known for its rich avian diversity; however, the continent possesses fewer suitable habitats for sustaining a large reptile population. While some African habitats, such as the Nile River, do support crocodile populations, the overall reptile population in Africa is relatively small compared to that of Asia. This is presumably due to factors such as habitat availability, climate, and competition within the respective ecosystems. One example that highlights this conclusion is the distribution of the Nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) in Africa. Although the Nile crocodile is the largest and most widespread crocodile species on the continent, its distribution is limited to specific freshwater habitats that provide the necessary resources for survival, such as lakes, rivers, marshes, and mangrove swamps. In comparison, Asia offers a variety of habitats that support multiple crocodile species, including saltwater crocodiles (Crocodylus porosus), Siamese crocodiles (Crocodylus siamensis), and mugger crocodiles (Crocodylus palustris), among others. In conclusion, while both continents are home to various species of crocodiles, the higher reptile population in Asia indicates that there are fewer crocodiles in Africa overall. This variation in crocodile populations can be attributed to the differences in climate, ecosystems, and the availability of suitable habitats."},{"prompt":"Cerberus just stared at me.

But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: When were people MOST likely to overeat processed food due to a certain quality?

Skill Enhancement: Going back to school allows individuals to acquire new skills and expertise that they may not have had the opportunity to develop in their current jobs, enabling them to adapt to the ever-evolving workforce. This drives individuals to pursue higher education or specialized training, wishing to enhance their problem-solving, critical thinking, communication, and technical skills. Improved skill sets not only increase one's marketability to employers but also contribute to personal growth and self-esteem. 3. Passion and Personal Interests: Some individuals may choose to go back to school to explore new subjects or areas of interest that they are passionate about. These individuals realize that pursuing their passions or deepening their knowledge in their chosen field will lead to a more satisfying life and career. Engaging in higher education for personal interest can lead to a more profound sense of purpose and personal fulfillment, as individuals are driven by the joy of learning rather than external pressure or expectations. 4. Intellectual Curiosity and Lifelong Learning: Humans are innately curious, and for some, the desire to learn and improve oneself fuels the decision to return to school. Lifelong learning is a concept embraced by many, as it promotes continuous personal and professional growth, adaptability, and a well-rounded perspective on life. Seeking higher education to satisfy this curiosity and dedication to expanding one's knowledge contributes to individual betterment and intellectual enrichment. 5. Networking Opportunities: Going back to school brings individuals into contact with a diverse community of peers, professors, and professionals who share similar goals, values, and aspirations. Establishing meaningful connections within this community offers valuable networking opportunities that can further advance one's career and personal development. Additionally, being part of a thriving educational environment fosters a sense of camaraderie, support, and shared motivation that can be instrumental in promoting personal growth. In conclusion, choosing to quit work and go back to school to better oneself is a multifaceted decision driven by various factors, including career advancement, skill enhancement, passion for personal interests, intellectual curiosity, and networking opportunities. A commitment to self-improvement and personal growth drives these individuals to invest in themselves and their future, solidifying the choice to return to higher education as a transformative and life-enriching experience."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A prosecutor in Texas wants Adrian Peterson arrested and his bond revoked after the NFL star allegedly admitted to smoking marijuana while out on bail on a felony child abuse charge. Montgomery County District Attorney Brett Ligon sent a motion to the 9th District Court to set aside the NFL star's bail, saying Peterson told an employee of a company that does drug testing that he \\"smoked a little weed.\\" Peterson posted 15,000 bail on September 12. Ligon said Peterson's reported admission before giving a urine sample on Wednesday amounts to grounds for revocation of the bond. One of Peterson's attorneys, Rusty Hardin, said he had no comment on the latest development in the case, which is tentatively scheduled to go to trial on December 1. OPTIONS: - Adrian Peterson has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - Brett Ligon has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - District Court has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - Ligon has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - Montgomery County has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - NFL has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - Peterson has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - Rusty Hardin has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\" - Texas has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like \\"he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.\\"","completion":"The correct option is \\"Adrian Peterson has said his client never meant to harm the boy and was simply doling out discipline much like 'he experienced as a child growing up in East Texas.'\\" However, this is not quite accurate.

How is \\"Of course,just take it.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Of course, just take it.\\" can be translated as \\"Samozřejmě, klidně to vezmi.\\" Here's a more detailed breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Of course\\" - This can be translated to \\"Samozřejmě\\" in Czech. It carries the same meaning of expressing agreement or an obvious fact in both languages. 2. \\"just\\" - It can be translated as \\"klidně,\\" which adds a sense of assurance and casualness to the sentence, much like \\"just\\" does in English. In this context, it implies that the speaker is okay with the action or does not mind it. 3. \\"take\\" - The verb \\"to take\\" is translated as \\"vzít\\" in Czech. In this case, it has been conjugated to \\"vezmi,\\" which represents the informal imperative (command) form. It implies that the speaker is giving permission or offering something. 4. \\"it\\" - The pronoun \\"it\\" can be translated to \\"to\\" in Czech. Just like in English, \\"to\\" represents something previously mentioned or easily identifiable that someone is referring to.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the name of the album that peaked at number 8 on the charts? is inside the article: A significant stylistic shift in the Kinks' music became evident in late 1965, with the appearance of singles like \\"A Well Respected Man\\" and \\"Dedicated Follower of Fashion\\", as well as the band's third album, The Kink Kontroversy, on which session musician Nicky Hopkins made his first appearance with the group on keyboards. These recordings exemplified the development of Davies' songwriting style, from hard-driving rock numbers toward songs rich in social commentary, observation and idiosyncratic character study, all with a uniquely English flavour.The satirical single \\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was the biggest UK hit of summer 1966, topping the charts and displacing the Beatles' \\"Paperback Writer\\". Before the release of The Kink Kontroversy, Ray Davies suffered a nervous and physical breakdown, caused by the pressures of touring, writing and ongoing legal squabbles. During his months of recuperation, he wrote several new songs and pondered the band's direction. Quaife was involved in an automobile accident, and after his recovery decided to step back from the band for much of 1966. Bassist John Dalton filled in until Quaife returned to the group at the end of the year.\\"Sunny Afternoon\\" was a dry run for the band's next album Face to Face, which displayed Davies' growing ability to craft gentle yet cutting narrative songs about everyday life and people. Hopkins returned for the sessions to play various keyboard instruments, including piano and harpsichord. He played on the band's next two studio albums as well, and was involved on a number of their live BBC recordings before joining the Jeff Beck Group in 1968. Face to Face was released in October 1966 in the UK, where it was well received and peaked at number eight. It was released in the US in December and was tipped as a potential \\"chart winner\\" by Billboard magazine.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin, (26 June 1824 - 17 December 1907) was a Scots-Irish mathematical physicist and engineer who was born in Belfast in 1824. At the University of Glasgow he did important work in the mathematical analysis of electricity and formulation of the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and did much to unify the emerging discipline of physics in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor Hugh Blackburn in his work. Though now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of Walter Crum; but her health broke down on their honeymoon and, over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, George Gabriel Stokes wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of Michael Faraday on the proposed transatlantic telegraph cable. Faraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent - in modern terms, the bandwidth. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month. He expressed his results in terms of the data rate that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential revenue of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis, Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its profitability. Thomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the square of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by Wildman Whitehouse, the electrician of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \\"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible.\\" Thomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular Athenaeum magazine, pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger conductor with a larger cross section of insulation. However, he thought Whitehouse no fool and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had, however, caught the eye of the project's undertakers and in December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company. How did the public react to this letter?","completion":"The public reaction to Thomson's letter in the Athenaeum magazine can be inferred from the fact that it propelled him into the public eye. While previously he was only known within the academic field, his letter contesting Wildman Whitehouse's contention and offering recommendations for the transatlantic cable project garnered attention from the public, as well as the project's undertakers. Thompson's expertise and intervention in the debate played a significant role in shaping public opinion on the issue and eventually led to his election to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company in December 1856. This demonstrates that his ideas and contributions to the project were well-received and seen as valuable by both the general public and professionals involved in the project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money. Question: \\"What was the result of following terrorist money flowing from point A to point B?\\" Answer: \\"CIA found it was hard to attack funds of Al Qaeda\\" Is this answer correct?

Vasco da Gama was born in 1460 or 1469 in Sines, on the southwest coast of Portugal, probably in a house near the church of Nossa Senhora das Salas. Sines, one of the few seaports on the Alentejo coast, consisted of little more than a cluster of whitewashed, red-tiled cottages, occupied chiefly by fisherfolk. Vasco da Gama's father was Estevao da Gama, who had served in the 1460s as a knight of the household of Infante Ferdinand, Duke of Viseu. He rose in the ranks of the military Order of Santiago. From the earlier part of the 15th century, Portuguese expeditions organized by Prince Henry the Navigator had been reaching down the African coastline, principally in search of west African riches (notably, gold). They had greatly extended Portuguese maritime knowledge, but had little profit to show for the effort. After Henry's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing this effort and, in 1469, sold off the neglected African enterprise to a private Lisbon merchant consortium led by Fernao Gomes. Within a few years, Gomes' captains expanded Portuguese knowledge across the Gulf of Guinea, doing business in gold dust, Melegueta pepper, ivory and sub-Saharan slaves. When Gomes' charter came up for renewal in 1474, Prince John (future John II), asked his father Afonso V of Portugal to pass the African charter to him. Upon becoming king in 1481, John II of Portugal set out on many long reforms. To break the monarch's dependence on the feudal nobility, John II needed to build up the royal treasury; he considered royal commerce to be the key to achieving that. Under John II's watch, the gold and slave trade in west Africa was greatly expanded. He was eager to break into the highly profitable spice trade between Europe and Asia, which was conducted chiefly by land. At the time, this was virtually monopolized by the Republic of Venice, who operated overland routes via Levantine and Egyptian ports, through the Red Sea across to the spice markets of India. John II set a new objective for his captains: to find a sea route to Asia by sailing around the African continent. By the time Vasco da Gama was in his 20s, the king's plans were coming to fruition. In 1487, John II dispatched two spies, Pero da Covilha and Afonso de Paiva, overland via Egypt to East Africa and India, to scout the details of the spice markets and trade routes. The breakthrough came soon after, when John II's captain Bartolomeu Dias returned from rounding the Cape of Good Hope in 1488, having explored as far as the Fish River (Rio do Infante) in modern-day South Africa and having verified that the unknown coast stretched away to the northeast. An explorer was needed who could prove the link between the findings of Dias and those of da Covilha and de Paiva, and connect these separate segments into a potentially lucrative trade route across the Indian Ocean. What happened after Henry's death?","completion":"After Henry the Navigator's death in 1460, the Portuguese Crown showed little interest in continuing the African exploration efforts initiated by Henry.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Write an article based on this summary: Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale said her politics were not \\"wildly different\\" from left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who is favourite to win the UK party's contest.","completion":"Title: Kezia Dugdale Supports Jeremy Corbyn, Citing Similar Views Introduction Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale has recently expressed that her political views are not too distinct from those of left-winger Jeremy Corbyn. As Corbyn leads the race in the United Kingdom Labour Party elections, Dugdale's statement highlights a growing connection between the two political leaders, despite their differences in positioning on the political spectrum. Step 1: Provide Background on Kezia Dugdale Kezia Dugdale, a prominent figure in Scottish politics, is currently contending for the leadership of the Scottish Labour Party, an affiliate organization of the UK Labour Party. She has been associated with advocating for social justice and equality and has served as the Labour's finance spokesperson. Step 2: Discuss Jeremy Corbyn and his political views Jeremy Corbyn, a well-known socialist, has been serving as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Islington North since 1983. He is known for his strong anti-austerity stance and advocating for re-nationalization of key industries. His political views lean far-left, and he has gained tremendous support in the current UK Labour leadership contest by attracting a diverse range of supporters from various progressive factions. Step 3: Compare the similarities between Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn Though Kezia Dugdale's politics are not as left-leaning as Corbyn's, the two share common ground when it comes to their core beliefs and values. Both are passionate about social justice, workers' rights, and tackling inequalities. Their combined commitment to these causes helps bridge the gap between their political stances, making their partnership an intriguing development in the Labour party's future. Step 4: Analyze the potential impacts on the Labour party and Scottish Labour As Dugdale and Corbyn align on key issues, their potential partnership could create a strong political alliance within the Labour party. This synergy may attract new supporters and voters, especially in Scotland, where Labour has been struggling for years. Consequently, this partnership could help revive the Scottish Labour Party and generate a fresh wave of enthusiasm among its members. Step 5: Address potential concerns or criticisms Critics may question how effectively Corbyn and Dugdale can navigate the ideological differences between their political preferences. In response, it is important to point out that their mutual focus on social justice, equality, and workers' rights should guide their political decisions and help foster unity among their followers. Conclusion In conclusion, Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale's recent statement of similarity to Jeremy Corbyn highlights the potential for a powerful alliance between the two leaders. By focusing on their shared dedication to social justice and equality, Dugdale and Corbyn may reinvigorate their respective factions within the Labour party and attract widespread support for their progressive vision. Despite the differences in their political leanings, this partnership could provide the much-needed boost to the Scottish Labour Party and possibly reshape the UK's political landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From pizza to pasta, Boston's did it well. That's where the good times end. A few years ago, this place had everything going for it... great food, nice atmosphere, cool staff and they provided a place for me and my friends to play poker tournaments. Then, for some reason the cuntbag that ran the place decided to screw over the company that was hosting the tournament and do poker on their own. The dipshits didn't realize that the 60 - 100 of us that showed up weekly only came because of the company that ran the poker tournaments. And the backlash caused most of us to stop coming there altogether (as many of us went there regularly even on a non poker night). It had been awhile then since I had been here since I was boycotting it. But, some friends and I were starving and everywhere else was packed, so we thought it might still be good. And it kinda was... the food was still tasty. First thing I noticed when I walked in was that they changed the interior - getting rid of some sports memorabilia and some walls. It looked more generic. The place was also kinda deserted for a Friday or Saturday night (can't remember which). It seemed like there were as many servers as patrons. You would think with those odds, we would get amazing service - nope. Our waiter was dirt. He was sweatty and impatient, but he brought us our drinks, took our order and let someone else bring out our food while he spent 40 minutes or so chit chatting about World of Warcraft with his dipshit friend 15 feet away from our table. Meanwhile, we were thirsty as fuck and standing next to our booth staring at him - he occasionally would look over at us, but continue to dismiss us. Nobody else ever came by either. I ended up having to go up and ask for more drinks and was met with scournful and confused looks as though I had done something wrong. WELL FUCK ME, ASSHOLES - I'M SORRY FOR BEING THIRSTY! DIE!!!

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To wash a child's hair, follow these steps in a way that makes sense and is easy for a five-year-old to understand: 1. First, make sure the child is sitting comfortably, either in a bathtub with a bit of water or on a chair near the sink, so it's easy to reach their hair. 2. Wet the child's hair with warm water. You can use a cup, your hands, or a gentle shower spray. Warm water feels nice and helps to open up the hair, so it's easier to clean. 3. Now, pour a little bit of tear-free shampoo (about the size of a quarter) into your hand. Rub your hands together to make the shampoo foamy. It's important to use a tear-free shampoo to avoid hurting the child's eyes if some shampoo gets in them. 4. Gently massage the shampoo onto the child's hair, making sure to cover all areas, especially the scalp. This will help get rid of dirt and oils, making the hair nice and clean. 5. Rinse the shampoo out of the child's hair using warm water. You can use a cup or your hands again to pour water over the hair until all the bubbles are gone. Make sure to tell the child to close their eyes or hold a towel above their eyes to keep shampoo out of them. 6. After all the shampoo is rinsed away, it's time to condition the hair. Apply a small amount of tear-free conditioner evenly onto the hair, focusing on the ends. This step helps to make the hair soft and smooth. 7. Rinse the conditioner out of the hair using warm water, just like with the shampoo. Make sure all the conditioner is removed, so the hair feels nice and clean. 8. Finally, use a soft towel to gently squeeze and pat the hair dry. Be sure not to rub roughly with the towel, as it can cause tangles and damage the hair.

But their former team-mate Graeme Swann says he is 'baffled' by the decision to jettison Pietersen. 'I'll be honest about Kevin Pietersen - myself and several other England players were not exactly members of his fan club during the Textgate scandal of 2012,' Swann wrote in The Sun. 'But I changed my opinion of him once he was reintegrated back into the England team towards the end of that year. 'He made a huge effort to improve his attitude around the dressing room. I saw or heard no issues with him in Australia this winter, his approach was exceptional. 'That's why I was baffled on Tuesday when he was effectively sacked as an England player.' 'Baffled': Graeme Swann says he did not see Pietersen do much wrong Down Under and even Prime Minister David Cameron (right with wife Samatha) had his say on the debate. Prime Minister David Cameron also waded into the row, insisting there is a 'powerful argument' for keeping Pietersen in the side. Speaking. on BBC Radio Lancashire, Cameron said: 'I am an enormous fan of Kevin. Pietersen and I have had some of my most enjoyable times watching him. tonking the ball all over the park. 'His. average is remarkable. It is not often I have a sympathy for Piers. Morgan but I thought he was making quite a powerful argument this. morning on my radio. 'But I will let the England selectors pick the England team, I think I had better stay out of this one.' Hitting out: Matt Prior has blasted accusations from Kevin Pietersen's friend Piers Morgan. Tough time: Prior struggled in Australia and was dropped after the third Test. The. ECB have refused to clarify the details of the fallout from the team meeting because of legal. complications, including confidentially clauses in the Pietersen. settlement. But this version. of events from inside the dressing room tallies with that of the. Pietersen camp, who maintain that their man was the only player prepared. to tell Flower some home truths. It. also brings some context to the explosive tweets on Wednesday by. broadcaster Morgan, KP’s flag-waver-in-chief, who claimed Prior. told his team-mates at the summit that Flower was ‘behaving like a. headmaster’ and that they were playing in a ‘schoolboy environment’. According to Morgan, Prior added: ‘F*** Flower, this is our team.’ Happier times: Pietersen (left) and Prior celebrate Ashes victory Down Under in 2010. Morgan. further tweeted, after challenging Prior to take legal action if the. accusations were incorrect: ‘You stabbed Pietersen in the back, yet you. agreed with him re Flower’s dictator style. Makes you a flaming. hypocrite. ‘For the record, @MattPrior13 (Prior) led the England team meeting after Melbourne Test. And slaughtered Flower.’ Prior. responded: ‘I don’t do this PR, spinning media rubbish, but I refuse to. be attacked by a bloke that knows very little about what goes on in the. England set-up apart from rumour, gossip and hearsay from certain. individuals. ‘I’m not the. kind of person to divulge what is said in team meetings, but all I will. say is that Flower, Cook and the rest of my team-mates know exactly what. I said and the way it was meant.’ Re-integrated: Team-mate Matt Prior posted this picture of Pietersen on Twitter in late 2012 with the caption: '\\"Re-integration complete. Well played\\".' Ironically,. Prior had acted as peacemaker when Pietersen was left out of the. England team in 2012 following a number of issues over his contract. But. the wicketkeeper continued his attack on Morgan by saying: ‘There is no. story here, just an attempt to knock someone who has only ever had the. team’s best interests at heart and tried my best on and off the field to. help the England cricket team. ‘I can hold my head up high in that knowledge!’ Taking a battering: Piers Morgan (right) faces Brett Lee in the nets at the MCG.","completion":"This article is about a disagreement between some cricket players.

News article: \\"If Crisis Or War Comes\\" is an update of the \\"If War Comes\\" booklet last released in the 1980s and first produced during the Second World War. Compiled by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), it details examples of crisis scenarios that could occur in Sweden due to disruptions to IT systems, incidents in the rest of the world, or climate change, explaining how to be best prepared for a possible lack of food, water and communications networks. The reissue comes against a backdrop of increased tension in the Baltic region in recent years, with fears escalating following Russian military action in Georgia and Ukraine. Other Swedish moves to strengthen defence include troops being permanently stationed on the island of Gotland, and a significant increase to Sweden's defence budget. \\"In the event of a societal emergency, help will be provided first to those who need it most. The majority must be prepared to cope on their own for some time,\\" the brochure warns ominously, adding that \\"water, food and warmth\\" as well as an ability to obtain information from authorities are the most important things in such a scenario. The guide provides a checklist of foodstuffs and goods it's useful to have at home just in case, ranging from basic vegetables to long-lasting oat or soy milk, tinned protein like sardines or boiled meat, and items for providing warmth, access to communications, and for storing water. The booklet also has a checklist to help Swedes be better prepared to cope with misleading information and influence operations, noting that \\"the best protection against false information and hostile propaganda is to critically appraise the source\\" by asking questions like \\"is this factual information or opinion?\\" and \\"who has put this out?\\". IN DEPTH: How Sweden is preparing for the election year information war A screenshot from the new booklet. Photo: MSB \\"We all have a responsibility for our country's safety and preparedness, so it's important for everyone to also have knowledge on how we can contribute if something serious occurs,\\" MSB General Director Dan Eliasson said in a statement. \\"Sweden is safer than many other countries but threats exist.\\" It may come as a surprise to learn that everyone living in Sweden has a \\"duty to contribute to total defence,\\" which in practice means anyone aged between 16 and 70 can be asked to assist in various ways in the event of war or threat of war, the booklet explains. That ranges from conscription to the Armed Forces, to civil conscription to government organizations, or being tasked by the Public Employment Agency with performing work deemed to be of particular importance to Sweden’s overall defence.

Tangible information about how to prepare The focus of the information is how people can prepare themselves to manage the supply of water, food, heat and communications when public services are not functioning as normal, regardless of the cause. If we are prepared, both individuals and society as a whole will be better able to withstand severe stresses. Focus areas on the website dinsäkerhet.se The website dinsäkerhet.se offers more information about the areas described in the brochure. The section Crisis and War contains different focus areas covering topics such as disinformation and how to protect yourself. At the end of May, the brochure will be published in easy-to-read Swedish, Swedish and English audio versions, and translations into 13 different languages. The website is also a source of information for those who want to monitor the development and planning of Sweden's total defence. Why is this information coming out now? We live in a time in which the consequences of extreme weather, IT attacks and terror attacks may cause a breakdown in the function of public services. The Swedish Government, which has given MSB this assignment, believes that this information also is important in the light of the deterioration in the security situation in the rest of the world. The Contact Centre is answering questions Although Sweden is safer than many other countries, this content will give rise to questions and some concerns. MSB is therefore providing an opportunity to have questions answered by the Contact Centre. Staff here will answer questions on weekdays from 21 May until 29 June.

Step 1: Combine like terms 76*m + 180 - 365 - 2247 = 0 First, combine the constants 180, -365, and -2247: 180 - 365 = -185 -185 - 2247 = -2432 Now the equation becomes: 76*m - 2432 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term with m To isolate the term with m, move the constant to the other side of the equation by adding 2432 to both sides: 76*m - 2432 + 2432 = 0 + 2432 This simplifies to: 76*m = 2432 Step 3: Solve for m Now, to find the value of m, divide both sides of the equation by 76: 76*m / 76 = 2432 / 76 This calculation results in the value for m: m = 32 So the solution to the given equation, 76*m + 180 - 365 - 2247 = 0, is m = 32."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, the absence of COPD would indirectly impact a step of the process by allowing for better airflow and gas exchange in the lungs, leading to more oxygen entering the bloodstream. COPD can cause inflammation and damage to the lungs' airways and air sacs (alveoli).

Article: Can you believe your eyes? A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: When asked to find the larger circle, _ . - children at 6 got it wrong 79 % of the time with no gray ones around - only adults over 18 got it right 95% of the time with gray ones around - children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around - adults got it right most of the time with gray ones around Answer:","completion":"children at 4 got it right about 79 % of the time with gray ones around"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who did Jean Richard claim had an alliance around 1263?, using the article: Most historians describe the contacts between the Mongol Empire and the Western Europeans as a series of attempts, missed opportunities, and failed negotiations. Christopher Atwood, in the 2004 Encyclopedia of Mongolia and the Mongol Empire, summed up the relations between Western Europe and the Mongols: \\"Despite numerous envoys and the obvious logic of an alliance against mutual enemies, the papacy and the Crusaders never achieved the often-proposed alliance against Islam.\\"A few other historians argue there was an actual alliance, but do not agree on the details: Jean Richard wrote that an alliance began around 1263. Reuven Amitai stated that the closest thing to actual Mongol-Frankish military coordination was when Prince Edward of England attempted to coordinate activities with Abaga in 1271. Amitai also mentioned the other attempts towards cooperation, but said, \\"In none of these episodes, however, can we speak of Mongols and troops from the Frankish West being on the Syrian mainland at the same time.\\" Timothy May described the alliance as having its peak at the Council of Lyon in 1274, but that it began to unravel in 1275 with the death of Bohemond, and May too admitted that the forces never engaged in joint operations. Alain Demurger, in his own book The Last Templar, said that an alliance was not sealed until 1300.There also continues to be debate about whether or not an alliance would have been a wise idea, and whether the Crusaders at that point in history were even relevant to the Persian-Mongol conflict. The 20th-century historian Glenn Burger said, \\"The refusal of the Latin Christian states in the area to follow Hethum's example and adapt to changing conditions by allying themselves with the new Mongol empire must stand as one of the saddest of the many failures of Outremer.\\" This was similar to the view of Steven Runciman, who argued, \\"Had the Mongol alliance been achieved and honestly implemented by the West, the existence of Outremer would almost certainly have been prolonged.

In a letter to his friend and landlord Johann Lorenz Hagenauer (1712–1792), a prominent Salzburg merchant, written after the tour, Leopold quotes the German diplomat Friedrich Melchior, Baron von Grimm, who after hearing the children play had said: \\"Now for once in my life I have seen a miracle: this is the first\\". Leopold believed that it was his duty to proclaim this miracle to the world, otherwise he would be \\"the most ungrateful creature\\". He was said to have described Wolfgang as \\"The miracle which God let be born in Salzburg.\\" Mozart biographer Wolfgang Hildesheimer has suggested that, at least in the case of Wolfgang, this venture was premature: \\"Too soon, [the] father dragged [the] son all over Western Europe for years. This continual change of scene would have worn out even a robust child...\\" However, there is little evidence to suggest that Wolfgang was physically harmed or musically hindered by these childhood exertions; it seems that he felt equal to the challenge from the start.Leopold wanted to begin the tour as soon as possible—the younger the children were, the more spectacular would be the demonstration of their gifts. The route he intended to take included southern Germany, the Austrian Netherlands, Paris, Switzerland and possibly northern Italy. The London leg was only added after urgings during the Paris visit, and the eventual Dutch trip was an unplanned detour. The plan was to take in as many princely European courts as possible, as well as the great cultural capitals—Leopold was relying on his professional musical network and on his more recent social contacts to obtain invitations from the royal courts. Practical assistance came from Hagenauer, whose trading connections in the major cities would supply the Mozarts with what were effectively banking facilities. These would enable them to obtain money en route, while waiting for the proceeds from their performances to accumulate.Wolfgang prepared for the tour by perfecting himself on the violin, which he had learned to play apparently...

Article: A yoga master made a shocking statement that Abraham Lincoln had been a Himalayan yogi in a past life.Lincoln delivered a proclamation setting up Thanksgiving as an American holiday in 1863.Research throws light on a possible Hindu origin for the American celebration of Thanksgiving. \\"The holiday of Thanksgiving has a Hindu origin,\\" says Richard Salva, author of a book on the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln entitled Soul Journey: From Lincoln to Lindbergh which is based on a statement by the great master of yoga, Paramhamsa Yogananda, who declared that Abraham Lincoln had been a Himalayan yogi in a past life, and that he was reborn as the famous pilot, Charles Lindbergh. \\"During my search for signs of a past-life yoga practice,\\" SaIva said, \\"I noticed that President Lincoln repeatedly chose Thursdays as national days of prayer, fasting ,and thanksgiving.This was interesting, because Thursday is considered a holy day -- a day for prayer, fasting, and spiritual reflection -- among Hindus, who call it \\"guru day\\".\\" \\"Lincoln also set aside time on Thursdays to grieve for his son,Willie, who died in Washington.Clearly, Thursdays had a spiritual significance in Lincoln's mind. In his book, Richard Salva presents more than 500 connections between Lincoln, Lindergh, and the ancient spiritual science of yoga. The connections run through every aspect of the human condition and provide convincing evidence that Lincoln had had a Hindu past life. More than one out of every five Americans today believes in reincarnation--yet few are aware of how past-life patterns affect them. Soul Journey tries to fill this gap, by offering a substitute experience of reincarnation. Through clear and persuasive similarities between the lives of Lincoln and Lindbergh, the book discovers how the hidden laws of fate and reincarnation impact the events of his or her daily life. It addresses other issues, such as the secret spiritual history of America's greatest president, including his past life as a Himalayan yogi; the hidden clues that...

Preferred titles are under thirty words. INTRODUCTION Recurrent miscarriage (RM) is diagnosed when a woman has had three or more miscarriages. Increased levels of distress and anxiety are common during the waiting period of any subsequent pregnancies, posing a significant threat to psychological well-being. However, only limited support and therapy are available for these women, and many are left to cope alone. The Positive Reappraisal Coping Intervention (PRCI) is a novel self-administered supportive technique which has been shown to be effective in patients awaiting the outcome of in vitro fertilisation treatment. The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of the PRCI in improving quality of life in the difficult waiting period which women with previous RM endure before an ongoing pregnancy can be confirmed. METHODS AND ANALYSIS A randomised controlled trial (RCT) feasibility study will establish the viability of conducting a multicentre RCT to definitively test the effects of the PRCI on the psychological well-being of women who have experienced RM during the initial waiting period of a subsequent pregnancy. A second component consists of a qualitative process evaluation exploring the initial experience of pregnancy following repeated miscarriages. Participants (n=50) will be randomised into one of two groups. The PRCI intervention group will receive the PRCI card and weekly questionnaires to assess their psychological well-being during the waiting period of their new pregnancy. The non-intervention group will be asked to complete the same weekly questionnaires. The qualitative process analysis will employ semistructured interviews (n=20) to address relevant aspects of the study objectives. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION Ethics approval has been obtained from the National Research Ethics Service Committee South Central-Hampshire A. Participating centres have given National Health Service R&D approval. Study findings will be disseminated through peer reviewed journals, national and international conferences and lay user groups. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER ISRCTN43571276. This study was registered with the ISRCTN 18/02/2014 following adoption onto the United Kingdom Clinical Research Network (UKCRN) portfolio.

She said she was an entrepreneur, not a prostitute. She started going steady with a kid called Keith. He was a fryer in the fish and chip shop. He had a future and a Ford Cortina. She got a job waitressing and she worked all the hours she could. Keith couldn't handle me and Trisha being as close as we were.

A poor farmer and his young son arrive into the settlement where the farmer confronts Luke, a thieving henchman employed by wealthy land baron Richard Barrett. The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

Two related native tribes live thousands of miles away from each other. Ana tribe lives near the South Pole in Antarctica, while Momu tribe lives in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tribe experienced less ozone depletion? Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. A:","completion":"Based on the provided information, the Ana tribe, living near the South Pole in Antarctica, has experienced more ozone depletion compared to the Momu tribe living in Northern Alaska near the North Pole. The primary reason for this is the presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica. The ozone hole is caused by the release of chlorine and bromine gases from anthropogenic sources such as aerosol sprays, coolants, and various other products. These gases are responsible for destroying the ozone layer, which is essential for protecting all life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching the Earth's surface, which can have severe consequences for both human and environmental health. For humans, increased UV radiation exposure leads to a higher incidence of skin cancer and eye cataracts. Additionally, ozone depletion affects the nitrogen cycle, causes the death of plankton, and disrupts oceanic food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be catastrophic for the majority of life on our planet. Although pollutant restrictions have helped slow down the rate of ozone loss, the ozone layer is still at risk. The Ana tribe, living in close proximity to the ozone hole over Antarctica, is likely to experience more significant ozone depletion and its associated negative impacts on health and the environment than the Momu tribe, living far away from the ozone hole in Northern Alaska. In conclusion, the Ana tribe in Antarctica experiences more ozone depletion than the Momu tribe in Northern Alaska due to the presence of the ozone hole over Antarctica and the subsequent destruction of the ozone layer caused by chlorine and bromine gases."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Paragraph: John is a soil scientist. He has been studying the lands near Mississippi delta. He noticed cases of hypoxia in that are. He labeled that study as case A. To compare that to other areas he visited Arizona. There he didn't see any occurrence of hypoxia. He labeled that case as case B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which case would less likely see formation of toxic compounds, case A or case B? Answer:","completion":"Case B would be less likely to see the formation of toxic compounds, as there is no occurrence of hypoxia in the area studied in Arizona."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Eugene Louis Vidal was born in the cadet hospital of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York, the only child of Eugene Luther Vidal (1895-1969) and Nina S. Gore (1903-1978). Vidal was born at the West Point cadet hospital because his first lieutenant father was the first aeronautics instructor of the military academy. The middle name, Louis, was a mistake on the part of his father, \\"who could not remember, for certain, whether his own name was Eugene Louis or Eugene Luther\\". In the memoir Palimpsest (1995), Vidal said, \\"My birth certificate says 'Eugene Louis Vidal': this was changed to Eugene Luther Vidal Jr.; then Gore was added at my christening [in 1939]; then, at fourteen, I got rid of the first two names.\\" Context: In the multi-volume memoir The Diary of Anais Nin (1931-74), Anais Nin said she had a love affair with Vidal, who denied her claim in his memoir Palimpsest (1995). Vidal also said that he had an intermittent romance with the actress Diana Lynn, and alluded to possibly having fathered a daughter. Yet, regarding Nin, in the online article \\"Gore Vidal's Secret, Unpublished Love Letter to Anais Nin\\" (2013), author Kim Krizan said she found an unpublished love letter from Vidal to Nin, which contradicts his denial of a love affair with Nin. Krizan said she found the love letter while researching Mirages, the latest volume of Nin's uncensored diary, to which Krizan wrote the foreword. Moreover, he was briefly engaged to the actress Joanne Woodward before she married the actor Paul Newman; after marrying, they briefly shared a house with Vidal in Los Angeles. In 1950, Gore Vidal met Howard Austen, who became his partner for the next 53 years. He said that the secret to his long relationship with Austen was that they did not have sex with each other, \\"It's easy to sustain a relationship when sex plays no part, and impossible, I have observed, when it does.\\" In Celebrity: The Advocate Interviews (1995), by Judy Wiedner, Vidal said that he refused to call himself \\"gay\\" because he was not an adjective, adding \\"to be categorized is, simply, to be enslaved. Watch out. I have never thought of myself as a victim... . I've said - a thousand times? - in print and on TV, that everyone is bisexual\\". In an interview with Esquire in 1969, Gore said \\"Homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality. Notice I use the word natural, not normal.\\" Commenting his life's work and his life, he described his style as \\"Knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\\" In the course of his life, Vidal lived at various times in Italy and in the United States. In 2003, as his health began to fail with age, he sold his Italian villa La Rondinaia (The Swallow's Nest) on the Amalfi Coast in the province of Salerno and he and Austen returned to Los Angeles. Howard Austen died in November 2003 and in February 2005 his mortal remains were re-buried at Rock Creek Cemetery, in Washington, D.C., in a joint grave plot that Vidal had purchased for himself and Austen. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are a few more interesting points about this article. Eugene Louis Vidal, also known as Gore Vidal, was a famous writer and public intellectual. He was born in a military academy hospital because his father was a teacher there. His middle name, Louis, was actually an accident by his dad. Gore had a complicated love life. He had a rumored love affair with Anais Nin, which he denied, but a later-found love letter suggested there might be some truth to the rumors. He was once engaged to actress Joanne Woodward and later met the love of his life, Howard Austen. They were together for 53 years and had a unique relationship where they didn't have sex with each other. Vidal didn't like to label himself as gay, stating that everyone is bisexual. During his life, he lived in different countries, like Italy and the United States. As his health declined, he moved back to Los Angeles with his partner, Howard, who sadly passed away. Vidal's famous quote about his life and work is \\"Knowing who you are, what you want to say, and not giving a damn.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It does not provide any information about the consistency or frequency of the bronzeman being right or wrong. It simply states that, in this particular case, he was right. Hypothesis: \\"Like always, the bronzeman had been wrong yet again.\\" This statement suggests that the bronzeman is perpetually incorrect (\\"like always\\"), and in the latest instance, he has once again made an error or misjudgment. This hypothesis implies a historical pattern of the bronzeman being consistently wrong. Given that the premise and the hypothesis directly oppose one another, it's not possible to draw the conclusion that the hypothesis is true based on the provided premise.

Question: As more and more books become movie adaptations , I can't help but think how this will affect English classes in America. Thinking back to my years in middle and high school -- ten years ago, I would be rewarded if I had read a number of classics. Today, a majority of those books are now also movies Life of Pi, The Great Gatsby, Much Ado About Nothing and Anna Karenina, to name a few. Even modern books such as The Hunger Games and Harry Potter have been adapted for the big screen. In discussion with my students, I often hear them say they are not going to read books because movies will come out soon, which makes me wonder what effect movie adaptations have on modern-day students. Will the Common Core State Standards (CCSS) encourage them to read books more carefully or to use movies to improve their understanding of the text? The CCSS requires students to provide text-based evidence when reading and discussing a book. By focusing on such evidence, teachers can pull specific details from a book that may have not made the final cut when the book was adapted for the big screen. For instance, after reading and watching The Hunger Games, there were a number of details from the book that were missing from the film -- many people were disappointed with Rue's meek movie role. A student who failed to read The Hunger Games would not quite understand Rue's impact on the games in the same way as someone who had read the book and remembered all the details that went into her death. I am not saying the CCSS will stop students from cutting corners, but I believe if teachers use the support the CCSS provides, it can be a great roadway to ensure all students are digging deep into texts and not just hitting the play button.

Step 2: Consider the factors that could be affected by environmental pollution, such as availability of food, clean air, water, and suitable nesting sites. Step 3: Assess the potential impact of pollution on the health of the birds, which could lead to reduced energy levels or compromised immune systems; these factors could influence their ability to find a mate or reproduce successfully. Step 4: Recognize that pollution could result in loss of habitat due to contamination or destruction, causing the birds to search for alternative locations that might be more difficult to find suitable partners. Step 5: Consider that increased pollution could lead to reduced population sizes, making it less likely for birds to encounter potential mates in their environment. Conclusion: Based on the factors listed above, environmental pollution will likely result in fewer male and female birds mating, as it will negatively impact their health, habitats, and overall reproductive capabilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would test C see higher or lower concentration of the reactants than test D? John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction. Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

In the given scenario, the person is a photographer at a wedding where they come across two well-groomed young men. We can assume the photographer is a woman, based on the mention of the phrase \\"oh mom\\" from the young men. The photographer feels compelled to take a picture of these attractive individuals and, upon doing so, they both react with an expression of mild exasperation or resignation, saying \\"oh mom.\\" The phrase \\"oh mom\\" is a telling clue, indicating the close relationship between the young men and the photographer. It is likely that she is their mother because referring to someone as 'mom' in this context – with the young men showing mild irritation at their mother's insistence to take a picture – allows us to conclude that they have a familial bond. While (2). Complete strangers, (3). Her brothers, and (4). Love interests are potential answers, they don't have a strong basis for being the correct response.

Robert Neville, M.D. is a scientist based in Los Angeles. As he begins to succumb to the plague himself, he injects himself with an experimental vaccine, rendering himself immune. By 1977, Neville believes he is the plague's only immune survivor. Struggling to maintain his sanity, he spends his days patrolling the deserted city of Los Angeles, hunting and killing members of \\"The Family\\", a cult of plague victims who were turned into nocturnal albino mutants. The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body.

Please write a short summary for the following article: U.S. General to Seek Combat Troops if Airstrikes Can’t Stop ISIS Comments by Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel on the United States’ campaign against ISIS were interrupted by anti-war protesters. WASHINGTON — Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told Congress on Tuesday that he would recommend deploying United States combat forces against Islamic extremists in specific operations if the current strategy of airstrikes was not successful, offering a more expansive view of the American role in the ground war than that of President Obama. In testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, he said that while he was confident in the ability of the coalition of American, European and Middle Eastern governments to stop the Islamic State, he could not completely close the door to eventually asking Mr. Obama to commit ground troops to fight the group, known as ISIS or ISIL. “My view at this point is that this coalition is the appropriate way forward. I believe that will prove true,” he said. “But if it fails to be true, and if there are threats to the United States, then I of course would go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces.” With oil revenues, arms and organization, the jihadist group controls vast stretches of Syria and Iraq and aspires to statehood. Any future commitment of American personnel on the ground could put Mr. Obama in a difficult position, as he has repeatedly insisted that no American troops would engage in the battlefield, and Gen. Dempsey sought to explain the apparent contradiction. “His stated policy is that we will not have U.S. forces in ground combat,” General Dempsey said, adding, “He has told me as well to come back to him on a case-by-case basis.” In his speech last week announcing the expanded campaign against Islamic State, Mr. Obama said the military advisers he was sending to Iraq would help Iraqi and Kurdish forces with training, intelligence, and equipment. But he emphatically ruled out front-line fighting. “These American forces will not have a combat mission — we will not get dragged into another ground war in Iraq,” he said. But as General Dempsey made it clear, the reality of the battle might make such a hands-off approach insufficient. When Iraqi or Kurdish forces are trying to dislodge militants from urban areas like Mosul, airstrikes are less effective because they can cause civilian casualties. In those cases, the general said, he might recommend to the president that the United States send Special Operations troops to provide what he called “close combat advising,” essentially working alongside Iraqi commanders in the field and helping them direct troops to targets. In fact, General Dempsey said the commander of the military’s Central Command, Gen. Lloyd Austin, had recommended deploying American spotters for airstrikes for the complex campaign to retake the Mosul Dam from Islamic State. Mr. Obama, however, rejected the proposal. General Dempsey and the secretary of defense, Chuck Hagel, were on Capitol Hill on Tuesday to provide up-to-date information on the administration’s plan for confronting the militant group. They said the plan would include the training and equipping of 5,000 Syrian fighters, the involvement of more than 40 coalition nations, including 30 that have pledged military support, and 1,600 American military personnel who will assist. But members of the committee sounded far from convinced that the plan would succeed. Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he doubted that 5,000 Syrian fighters — who could not be trained for months — would be able to fight off more than 30,000 Islamic State combatants. “To many of us that seems like an inadequate response,” Mr. McCain said. Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who votes with Democrats, said he was concerned about what appeared to be a “whack-a-mole” approach. Mr. Hagel and General Dempsey took pains to portray the military campaign as a broad coalition-led fight. “This is ultimately their fight,” Mr. Hagel said, referring to the Middle Eastern countries that are most immediately threatened by the militant group. They also stressed that this campaign would be nothing like the 2003 invasion of Iraq. “This won’t look like a ‘shock-and-awe campaign’ because that’s not how ISIL is organized,” General Dempsey said. While the two men attempted to play down the scope of the American military’s involvement, General Dempsey did acknowledge the open-ended and unpredictable nature of the fight ahead. “Truly there is no military solution to ISIL,” he said, adding that it could be defeated only with a more comprehensive approach that includes diplomacy. “That may be a tough pill to swallow. But there is no military solution.”","completion":"Gen. Martin E.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: - Spores are dispersed into the air by a mature mushroom - The spores fall to the ground - The spores germinate - The spores begin to grow mycelium - The mycelium begin to sprout a bud The answer is:","completion":"The final step of the process after the mycelium begins to sprout a bud is the formation and maturation of the fruiting body, also known as the development of a new mushroom. To elaborate, the process of mushroom reproduction and growth can be broken down into several steps: 1. Spore dispersal: Mature mushrooms release their spores into the air to increase the chances of reproduction. Depending on the species, this dispersal can be aided by wind currents, rain, or even insects and animals. 2. Spore landing and germination: Once the spores land on a suitable substrate, such as soil, decaying organic matter, or even living host organisms, they begin to germinate. This stage depends on various factors like temperature, humidity, and the presence of a suitable food source. 3. Mycelium growth: The germinated spores give rise to thread-like structures called hyphae, which collectively form the mycelium—the vegetative part of a fungus. The mycelium extracts nutrients from its surroundings and grows, expanding its network. 4. Bud formation: When environmental and nutritional conditions are optimal, certain species of fungi begin to form dense clusters of mycelium called primordia. Primordia develop into small buds, which will eventually develop into mushrooms. The final step – Formation and maturation of the fruiting body: The buds that form on the mycelium undergo a process of cell differentiation, ultimately giving rise to a mature fruiting body—a fully developed mushroom. This fruiting body, which is the reproductive structure of the fungus, usually consists of a cap and a stalk. At maturity, the mushroom's gills, pores, or other spore-producing structures release new spores to continue the reproductive cycle. It is essential to note that the entire process can vary in duration according to the species of mushroom, specific environmental conditions, and other factors. Some mushrooms may develop within a few days, while others might take weeks or even months to complete their life cycle. The process of mushroom growth and development is a fascinating example of the adaptation and resilience of fungi in diverse ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first use of the gas chamber after the moratorium was the gassing of Jesse Bishop in Nevada on October 22, 1979. The first use of the gallows after the moratorium was the hanging of Westley Allan Dodd in Washington on January 5, 1993. The first use of lethal injection was on December 7, 1982, when Charles Brooks, Jr., was executed in Texas. How was Charles Brooks, Jr. executed? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Charles Brooks, Jr. was executed by lethal injection on December 7, 1982, in Texas. This was the first use of lethal injection as a method of execution in the United States. Lethal injection involves administering a series of drugs to the condemned individual, usually through an intravenous line, which ultimately leads to the person's death. The process for Brooks's execution started by securing him to a gurney in the execution chamber, where medical professionals inserted two intravenous (IV) lines into his arms. These IV lines were connected to a series of drugs that would eventually be administered in a specific order. The execution team was located in an adjacent room, where they controlled the flow of the drugs into the IV lines. The lethal injection process typically involves three drugs, although the specific drugs and sequence have changed over the years. At the time of Charles Brooks, Jr.'s execution, the three-drug protocol included sodium thiopental, pancuronium bromide, and potassium chloride. 1. Sodium thiopental: This is a fast-acting barbiturate that is used as an anesthetic. Once administered, sodium thiopental causes the inmate to lose consciousness rapidly. This drug is intended to ensure that the person being executed does not experience pain during the process. 2. Pancuronium bromide: This drug is a paralytic agent that, once introduced into the inmate's system, causes paralysis of the skeletal muscles, including the diaphragm. As a result, the individual is unable to breathe, leading to suffocation. However, since the first drug is supposed to have rendered the person unconscious, they should not experience any distress during this stage. 3. Potassium chloride: This drug is the final component of the lethal injection process. Potassium chloride acts by stopping the heart and inducing cardiac arrest. The rapid influx of potassium causes an imbalance in the electrolyte concentrations within the cells, disrupting the normal functioning of the heart muscle and ultimately resulting in death. After the three drugs were administered to Charles Brooks, Jr., his death was confirmed by medical personnel, marking the end of the first execution by lethal injection in the United States."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Time is shown passing (as the sign outside Scrooge's business grows rusty). It is Christmas Eve, and Scrooge's nephew, Fred, visits the counting house to wish his uncle a merry Christmas. Scrooge believes Fred's marriage is unsuitable, and they argue about it. Fred departs, and two gentlemen arrive seeking donations for the poor. Scrooge denounces such charitable efforts, and the men depart. Scrooge agrees to give his clerk, Bob Cratchit (Richard E.

Scrooge arrives at his home and has visions of Jacob Marley's face appearing in his door knocker and the tiles around his fireplace. Marley's ghost (Bernard Lloyd) appears and convinces Scrooge of his supernatural nature. Marley tells Scrooge that the uncharitable are tormented after death, and he has come to warn Scrooge as well as tell him that Scrooge will be visited by three ghosts over the next three nights. The ghosts will try to convince Scrooge to reform. At midnight, Scrooge is visited by the Ghost of Christmas Past (Joel Grey). They visit Ebenezer Scrooge as a child, who is forced to spend his holidays at school due to his father's rejection. Scrooge's sister, Fran, arrives to tell Scrooge he is welcome at home again. The ghost then takes Scrooge to the business of his mentor, Albert Fezziwig (Ian McNeice). A young Scrooge (Kenny Doughty) is shown enjoying Fezziwig's Christmas party, and his romance with a young girl, Belle (Laura Fraser), is introduced. The ghost then shows Belle breaking off her engagement to Scrooge because Scrooge has become obsessed with money. The ghost takes Scrooge home, and in anger Scrooge snuffs out the spirit's light.

Gateway (GTW:NYSE - news - research) narrowed its loss and beat Wall Street #39;s bottom-line expectations for the quarter ending in September. Which is the best summary of this article?","completion":"The article primarily reports on the financial performance of Gateway, a public limited company listed on NYSE, for the quarter that ended in September. Gateway successfully performed better than expected by Wall Street analysts, as it not only managed to minimize its losses but, impressively, also exceeded the market's projected bottom-line figures for this time period. The company's progress, evidenced by its financial results, is notable since they managed to substantially decrease their losses. Thus, this may be viewed positively by investors and stakeholders who consider such financial reports while taking decisions. Additionally, no other business activities, strategic plans, or market initiatives undertaken by Gateway during this period are mentioned in the article; which suggests the focus is purely on the firm's financial improvement. Therefore, the overall tone of the article appears to be optimistic with regards to Gateway's financial performance and the company's ability to exceed Wall Street's expectations. However, specific financial figures, such as revenue and profit margins, are not disclosed, making it challenging to gauge the exact degree of the company's accomplishment or the real magnitude of the reduction of its losses. In conclusion, this article indicates a positive trend in Gateway's financial health, capable of influencing investor sentiment positively. Given these points, the best summary of this article would be: \\"Tech company Gateway has reportedly decreased its losses and surpassed Wall Street's financial forecasts for the September quarter.

He candied plums, pears, ginger and quince, and he ate fresh apples, oranges and mango. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit have a higher sugar content candied ginger or fresh apples? Answer:","completion":"Candied ginger has a higher sugar content than fresh apples. Candied ginger is made by cooking ginger root in a sugar syrup, which significantly increases its sugar content compared to its fresh form. The process of candying not only sweetens the ginger but also helps preserve it by creating a sugar coating around the root. On the other hand, fresh apples contain natural sugar, but their sugar content is considerably lower than that of candied ginger. Apples also contain fiber and various vitamins and minerals, making them a healthier option than candied ginger when considering overall nutritional value. In summary, candied ginger has a higher sugar content compared to fresh apples due to the additional sugar added during the candying process."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the information you found on Google is correct. Poison dart frogs, belonging to the family Dendrobatidae, are native to Central and South America. To provide a more detailed answer, these colorful and toxic amphibians can be found in various countries across Central and South America, from Nicaragua in the north to Bolivia, Brazil, and even the Guiana Shield in the south. These frogs reside in warm tropical environments, thriving in both humid lowland rainforests and montane cloud forests. The presence of poison dart frogs is more concentrated in countries like Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, where they live under leaf litter, on the forest floor, or even on tree trunks and other vegetation. The name \\"poison dart frog\\" comes from indigenous people's practice of using the frog's toxic secretions to coat blowdarts and hunting weapons. While not all dart frogs are poisonous, the most toxic species, Phyllobates terribilis, has enough venom to kill several adult humans. There are more than 170 described species of poison dart frogs, each with unique appearances, color patterns, and behaviors. The varying levels of toxicity among species can be attributed to differences in diet and habitat.

Q: Water is allowed to flow downhill into a large turbine to harness power. what helps the turbine spin? A: Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's look at the process step-by-step: 1. The first step in harnessing power from water flowing downhill is to build a dam or barrier across a river or a stream. This helps to create a reservoir that stores a large amount of water at a higher elevation. 2. The water from the reservoir is then allowed to flow downhill through a pipe or a channel called a penstock. The flow of water is regulated by controlling the opening of the penstock. 3. As the water flows downhill, it gains kinetic energy because of the gravitational force acting on it. This kinetic energy is what helps the turbine to spin. 4. The flowing water strikes the blades of the turbine, transferring its kinetic energy to the turbine. This turns the blades of the turbine, causing it to rotate. 5. The spinning action of the turbine is then transferred to a generator via a shaft connected to both the turbine and the generator. 6. The generator converts the mechanical energy from the spinning turbine into electrical energy, which can then be used as a power source. So, the answer to the question is: The kinetic energy of the water flowing downhill, obtained due to the gravitational force acting on it, helps the turbine spin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Scroll down for video. Happier now: Rachel was a size 16 before she dropped her body fat and became a body builder. She said: 'Although I was on medication to tackle my under-active thyroid problem it was still difficult for me to regulate my weight and if I was honest I was not following an entirely healthy eating plan. 'I gave up my job at a law firm to be a stay-at-home mum. I suppose because I enjoyed work and missed being busy during the day I was comfort eating. 'I would buy chocolate bars to snack on whilst cooking the family meal. I would wade through packets of biscuits whilst watching daytime TV and drink untold cups of cappuccino. I would always serve a dessert sweet after our family meal. My eating was out of control.' Toned up: Rachel follows a weight regime and strict protein diet to build her lean muscle. Rachel's weight rose to 12 stone and her confidence and relationship with her husband, David suffered. She explained: 'As my weight increased, I didn't seem to care and allowed my weight and clothes size to balloon. Before I knew it, I was fitting into size 16 clothes. I convinced myself that I was fat and happy. 'I thought if I could dress well and keep my hair and make up nice I could get away with being fat. I was totally kidding myself. One day I caught a glimpse of myself under severe lighting in a changing room. I noticed that not only did I have cellulite on my thighs and bottom but also on my upper arms. I was gobsmacked. I was so busy covering up I hadn't noticed what I was covering up. 'How my body looked at this time affected everything. My relationship with my husband suffered. I didn't want him to look at me let alone touch me. I would jump into bed fully clothed from head to toe.' 'People say life begins at 40 but I felt. washed up with my life heading downwards, not beginning. I decided I. needed to do something about it and fast' Before having children, Rachel had been a trained aerobics instructor who had studied nutrition and enjoyed exercising so she was deeply unhappy with her weight gain and lack of fitness. 'I was snappy with everyone, angry that I let myself get into this state,' she said. It was the milestone birthday of 40 that made her realise she had to turn her life back around. 'I didn't want to be fat, frumpy and forty', she said. 'People say life begins at 40 but I felt washed up with my life heading downwards, not beginning. I decided I needed to do something about it and fast.' Rachel began eating more healthily, cutting out sugary, fatty foods and swapping her milky cappuccinos for black coffee. She attended Zumba and Body Pump classes, did some weights at the gym and started running. Her weight soon dropped and she loved the way her body shape was transforming. 'My arms became more shapely. My back and. shoulders were stronger. My legs and bottom toned and I almost carved. myself a six pack,' she recalls. Life begins at 40: As a stay-at-home mother, Rachel said she let herself get out of shape but turning 40 gave her the impetus to change her life. Her husband noticed how her fitness levels had gone 'through the roof' and suggested she run a marathon. But Rachel dismissed this idea as 'everyone runs the marathon'. 'I want to do something extraordinary,' she added. She has now achieved this by becoming a professional bodybuilder, winning accolades for her physique and aiming to qualify for Miss Universe. As previously reported in the MailOnline, it was former glamour model Jodie Marsh who gave her the idea to become a bodybuilder. 'I love showing off my new figure. I don't wear a one piece, I wear a two piece bikini, the smaller the better' She explains: 'In October 2011 I was watching This Morning and I saw Jodie Marsh giving an interview about her bodybuilding. That was my eureka moment - I would become a competitive bodybuilder.' Rachel contacted Jodie's trainer Tim Sharp who devised a weight training and nutrition plan for her to follow. She said: 'I would see Tim once a week and he would send through to my phone my training plan which I would do at my own gym. Tim also sent through my nutrition plan. This included supplements such as protein drinks, glutamine, branch chain aminos and creatine. These were all supplied by LA Muscle who are now my sponsors.' Confident: Rachel used to hide her body away but now she loves to show it off. Under Tim's fitness regime, Rachel dropped body fat and gained lean muscle. She also learnt a choreographed routine in which she forms various poses to music to showcase her muscular figure. She was then ready to enter her first bodybuilding competitions - and hasn't looked back. So far she has been runner up at the National Amateur Body-Builders' Association (NABBA) South East Qualifiers and sixth place at NABBA Britain. She aims to carry on doing well in these competitions so she can go on to represent England in international competitions such as Miss Universe. The body Rachel would hide away two years ago is now one she's proud of. 'I love showing off my new figure. I don't wear a one piece, I wear a two piece bikini, the smaller the better,' she said.

Introduction: The ancient pyramids of Egypt have captured the imaginations of people for centuries. They are among the most iconic and fascinating structures in human history. These colossal architectural masterpieces represent the pinnacle of ancient Egyptian engineering and, even today, the construction methods used to create them remain a subject of considerable debate and wonder. But do you know who designed the first pyramid? Read on and take our quiz to test your knowledge! Step 1: Brief background on the first pyramid Before we reveal the mastermind behind the design of the first pyramid, let's take a moment to familiarize ourselves with some key facts about the monument. The first pyramid, known as the Step Pyramid, was built during the Third Dynasty of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, approximately around 2630 B.C. Step Pyramid served as the burial tomb of Pharaoh Djoser, and its construction marks a significant architectural shift from the earlier mastaba-style tombs. It consists of six distinct stacked layers, giving it a stepped appearance and has a height of about 62 meters (203 feet). Step 2: Understanding the significance of pyramid design The pyramids of ancient Egypt were more than just colossal burial tombs; they also held deep spiritual and religious significance for the Egyptians. The pyramid shape was believed to represent the primordial mound from which life emerged and facilitated the pharaoh's journey to the afterlife. The design of these monumental structures evolved over time, from the first step pyramid to the smooth-sided pyramids like the famous Great Pyramid of Giza. Step 3: Introducing the architect behind the first pyramid Now that we have familiarized ourselves with some basic information about the first pyramid, let's move on to our quiz question: Who designed the first pyramid in history? A. Imhotep B. Hemiunu C. Ptah-hotep D. Senenmut The correct answer is A. Imhotep! Imhotep was an eminent Egyptian polymath who served as the royal counselor and vizier to Pharaoh Djoser. More than just an architect, he was also a skilled physician, priest, and political figure. Imhotep is credited with designing and overseeing the construction of the Step Pyramid at Saqqara, which was a significant leap from the preceding mastaba tombs. Step 4: Celebrating Imhotep's legacy Imhotep's innovative design for the first pyramid laid the foundation for future pyramid constructions that would go on to define ancient Egypt's architectural landscape. His genius laid the groundwork for monumental advancements in engineering and architecture, leaving a lasting impact not only on Egyptian history but on the world as a whole. In recognition of his exceptional contributions, Imhotep was later deified by the Egyptians and became the god of medicine and healing. His enduring reputation as an ingenious architect, physician, and polymath is a testament to his remarkable talents and a fascinating aspect of human history. Conclusion: The story of the first pyramid design and its mastermind, Imhotep, is a captivating tale that highlights the ingenuity and creativity of ancient Egypt. Whether you aced our quiz or learned something new about the history of the pyramids, it is essential to remember the importance of acknowledging and celebrating the innovators whose incredible achievements continue to shape our world today."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Senate GOP blocks Obama's pick for D.C. appeals court ’s pick for a seat on the crucial federal appeals court in Washington on Tuesday, dealing the a setback as it continues to struggle to fill judicial vacancies across the nation. The GOP filibustered the nomination of Caitlin Halligan, a New York lawyer who contended was a moderate nominee who had won praise from some conservatives. But Republicans said they were concerned about Halligan’s record on gun rights and terrorism detainee issues. All but one—Alaska’s —voted to prevent her nomination from going forward for a final floor vote, where the judge could have been approved by a simple majority. The final tally was 54-45, six votes short of the 60 needed to break the filibuster. It marked the second time this year that Republicans have filibustered a key Obama judicial nominee. They denied Californian Goodwin Liu a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco in May. Obama eventually withdrew Liu’s nomination, and he was tapped by California Gov. for a seat on the state Supreme Court instead. Obama chose Halligan, a former New York state solicitor general who now serves as general counsel to the Manhattan district attorney’s office, for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, considered one of the most important federal appellate courts in the nation because of its role in reviewing decisions made by government agencies. A judgeship on the court is often viewed as a steppingstone to the Supreme Court and nominations to the D.C. Circuit have for years prompted clashes between Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, Halligan was picked to replace , who was elevated to the high court as its chief justice in 2005. The vacancy has languished for five years and is now among three on the appeals court. Halligan remains the White House’s lone D.C. Circuit nominee. was able to place three of his nominees on the court, but all came during his second term in office. Senate Democrats and interest groups argued that in blocking Halligan, the GOP abandoned a standard that was agreed upon by both parties in 2005, when Republicans threatened to do away with the judicial filibuster entirely. Then, the so-called “Gang of 14”—a bipartisan group of senators—vowed to push through any nominee except in “extraordinary circumstances.” Obama registered his disappointment in a White House statement, saying Halligan’s nomination “fell victim to the Republican pattern of obstructionism that puts party ahead of country.” Senate Republicans are “blocking 20 other highly qualified judicial nominees,” Obama said. “These are distinguished nominees who, historically, would be confirmed without delay.” GOP senators who were members of the Gang of 14 such as of Maine, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and of Arizona, all voted to block Halligan “With Tuesday's filibuster, the ‘Gang of 14’ deal on judicial nominations is officially dead and the partisan war over the courts has escalated to a dangerous new level, even while the vacancy rate on the federal judiciary has reached a crisis point,” said Douglas Kendall, president of the left-leaning Constitutional Accountability Center. of Kentucky, in remarks on the Senate floor prior to the vote, said that Halligan was ill-suited for the court. “Ms. Halligan’s record strongly suggests that she wouldn’t view a seat on the U.S. appeals court as an opportunity to adjudicate, even-handedly, disputes between parties based on the law, but instead as an opportunity to put her thumb on the scale in favor of whatever individual or group or cause she happens to believe in,” he said. Republicans still invoke the name of Miguel Estrada, who was nominated to the D.C. Circuit by Bush but whose nomination was stalled by a filibuster eight years ago, as an example of Democratic obstructionism and hypocrisy. But ironically, Estrada has been a vocal supporter of Halligan’s nomination. The Senate has confirmed 24 of Obama’s appeals court nominees and 97 district court nominees over the last three years, with 15 appellate vacancies and 67 trial court slots yet to be filled.

The hypothesis that they are a family is certainly a possibility, but there may be other plausible explanations for why these four individuals are walking together. Let's consider a few alternative scenarios: 1. Friends or neighbors: It's possible that these individuals could be friends or neighbors who have decided to enjoy a walk in the snow together. In this case, they might not be family members but merely enjoying each other's company in their shared outdoor space. 2. Guided tour or group outing: It's also conceivable that the adults and the child could be a part of a guided tour or group outing, in which case they might not be related but simply taking part in the same activity. 3. Chance encounter: Another possibility is that these individuals could have come across one another by chance while walking along this path, and are simply walking in the same direction. In this scenario, they might not know each other at all, let alone be family members. 4. Blended family or multi-generational family: Even if they are family members, there is the possibility that it could be a blended family or a multi-generational family, which would mean the relationships among them might be more complex than simply two parents and their children.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Making a good job choice is almost as good as choosing a good life. So, choosing a job is one of the most important decisions to make in life. For my job, there are three important things that I will consider: The first one - that I must work in an area I like - is most important to me. Someone once said if you find a job that you enjoy, then you won't have to work another day. I would like to work in an area where I can be more creative. I would like to be the most valuable member there. All this is possible only if I like what I do. The second one is that the area of my work must lead me to solve some new and hard problems. I would like to stay in the same area for a long time. In order for this to happen, the work must provide enough problems. More than just working to live, I enjoy making a difference and trying my best for the whole progress. I would also like to be well _ for my hard work, so I can lead a comfortable life with this hard-won money. Then I can provide the best for my family. The third important thing is that I would like to work in an area that would help other people. The work in my mind is in fields such as the army, training or management. In such areas, I can help to develop the abilities of others and bring out their best. It would be a most satisfying job to help young people to become the best that they can be. When I become old, I would like to look back with a great sense of satisfaction that thousands of people have become better persons through my work. I accept the idea that no one should make a choice of a job suddenly or quickly. He should decide what he wants to be in the long run. Then, he should decide how he works towards it. He should study the proper courses, read the books and speak to knowledgeable persons in that field before making a job choice. A good choice will most probably lead to a better life.

The chef tried to store the beef in the freezer but the freezer was too small. He scratched his head, wondering what he could do to make space for the large cut of beef. He decided to take the following steps: 1. Assess the contents of the freezer: Before making any decisions, the chef needed to see what was taking up so much space in the freezer. He opened the door and took a good look at the various ingredients, containers, and frozen meals stuffed inside. 2. Remove non-essential or expired items: The chef figured that there might be some items in the freezer that were past their prime or not immediately necessary for upcoming meals. He began to remove items that were expired, frost-bitten, or not needed in the near future, carefully checking the dates and condition of each item. 3. Rearrange the remaining items: With the non-essential and expired items removed, the chef now had to optimize the remaining space in the freezer. He rearranged the items, placing smaller items and containers inside larger ones, stacking items with flat surfaces, and filling empty spaces in the best possible manner. 4. Consider alternative storage solutions: Despite his best efforts, the chef realized that the freezer was still not large enough to accommodate the huge cut of beef. He began to think of alternative storage solutions, such as splitting the beef into smaller portions and storing them in separate containers, or using a separate cooler with ice packs to keep the beef cold until it could be cooked or a larger storage option could be found. 5. Consult with colleagues: The chef decided to ask his fellow chefs and kitchen staff for their input in case they had faced similar issues in the past. They might have valuable insights or creative solutions that he had not yet considered. After going through these steps, the chef was able to effectively manage the space in his freezer and figure out a solution for storing the large cut of beef.

In this case, \\"set\\" is an example of a homograph – a word that is spelled the same way as another word but has a different meaning and may have a different pronunciation. The context in which the word is used helps determine its meaning. Let's examine each sentence separately to understand the different meanings of \\"set.\\" Sentence 1: The film is set in Africa. In this sentence, \\"set\\" is used as a past participle of the verb \\"to set\\" and describes where the action or story of the film takes place. It is referring to the location or setting of the film, which is Africa. The film's events, characters, and settings are all portrayed as taking place within the African continent.

In this sentence, \\"set\\" is used as an imperative verb, instructing someone to arrange or establish an experiment. In this context, \\"set up\\" is a phrasal verb that means to prepare or organize something (in this case, an experiment). The person receiving this instruction is expected to put together the necessary materials, equipment, and procedures in order to carry out the experiment.

If \\"An important older man gives a speech to reporters.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The VIP address his crowd.\\"?","completion":"Yes, it can be logically inferred that \\"The VIP address his crowd\\" if the given statement is \\"An important older man gives a speech to reporters.\\" Here's an explanation as to how the connection is made: 1. In the given statement, an \\"important older man\\" is referred to. The word \\"important\\" can be equated to someone with some sort of significance or status, such as a VIP (Very Important Person). So, in this context, it is reasonable to replace the phrase \\"important older man\\" with the term \\"VIP.\\" 2. The statement describes the important older man or VIP giving a \\"speech.\\" Typically, when someone gives a speech, they are addressing an audience, which can also be referred to as a crowd. 3. Now, let's analyze the audience being addressed: \\"reporters.\\" Reporters are people who gather information and distribute news. When a VIP or an important person gives a speech to reporters, it is usually with the intention of disseminating their thoughts or points to a significantly larger group, namely their followers or another group relevant to the VIP's position. In this case, the group of reporters may be considered as a part of the VIP's larger \\"crowd,\\" or as a means to convey the VIP's message to their crowd. 4. Combining the previously mentioned points, the initial statement can be logically rephrased as \\"The VIP address his crowd.\\" Even though the word \\"crowd\\" may not directly imply the group of reporters, it can be assumed that the crowd being addressed includes the reporters as well as the people who will receive the news from these reporters. In conclusion, given the statement \\"An important older man gives a speech to reporters,\\" it is logical to infer that \\"The VIP address his crowd\\" can be a valid conclusion. The inference is based on the connections made between the words \\"important older man\\" and \\"VIP,\\" as well as the concept of addressing an audience or crowd through a speech being relayed by reporters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Petro Doroshenko Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, aiming to gain control of Ukraine but facing defeats from other factions struggling over control of that region, in a final bid to preserve his power in Ukraine, signed a treaty with Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 that recognized the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire.:273 In the meantime, Commonwealth forces were trying to put down unrest in Ukraine, but were weakened by decades long wars ). Trying to capitalize on that weakness, Tatars, who commonly raided across the Commonwealth borders in search of loot and plunder, invaded, this time allying themselves with Cossacks under hetman Doroshenko. They were however stopped by Commonwealth forces under hetman John Sobieski, who stopped their first push , defeating them several times, and finally gaining an armistice after the Battle of Podhajce. In 1670, however, hetman Doroshenko tried once again to take over Ukraine, and in 1671 Khan of Crimea, Adil Giray, supportive of the Commonwealth, was replaced with a new one, Selim I Giray, by the Ottoman sultan. Selim entered into an alliance with the Doroshenko's Cossacks; but again like in 1666-67 the Cossack-Tatar forces were dealt defeats by Sobieski. Selim then renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan and pleaded for assistance, to which the Sultan agreed. Thus an irregular border conflict escalated into a regular war in 1671, as the Ottoman Empire was now prepared to send its regular units onto the battlefield in a bid to try to gain control of that region for itself.:646 What 2 things did the treaty do?","completion":"The treaty between Petro Doroshenko, the Hetman of Zaporizhian Host, and Sultan Mehmed IV in 1669 did two primary things: 1. Recognize the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal of the Ottoman Empire: By acknowledging the Cossack Hetmanate as a vassal state, the treaty established a formal relationship between the two entities, granting the Ottoman Empire some control and influence over the Cossack region. 2. Provide support to Doroshenko's bid to gain control of Ukraine: In signing the treaty, the Ottoman Empire indirectly supported Petro Doroshenko's efforts to establish his authority and control over Ukraine, which was embroiled in a power struggle among different factions at that time. This support from the Ottomans aimed to strengthen Doroshenko's position and counteract other factions and the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth's presence in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Washington state, which had many wildfires year-round, and Oregon, state which had almost no wildfires. Ben enjoyed the visit and planned to return. Which state had more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Washington state experienced many wildfires year-round, whereas Oregon had almost no wildfires. The prevalence of wildfires in Washington state would likely result in a larger amount of smoke containing carbon dioxide, among other harmful substances, being released into the atmosphere as a result of the fires. When wildfires occur, various gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), and particulate matter are released into the atmosphere. The nature and concentrations of these pollutants depend on various factors such as the type of vegetation being burned, weather conditions, and the intensity of the fire. People living in the vicinity of wildfires or areas where smoke particles travel due to air currents could be at increased risk of inhaling carbon dioxide and other harmful substances in the smoke. Taking all this into consideration, it can be concluded that more people in Washington state would be inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke due to the higher frequency of wildfires occurring there compared to Oregon. With recurring wildfires, a more significant number of residents living in or near affected areas in Washington state are exposed to harmful air pollutants, such as carbon dioxide. However, it's essential to mention that the impact of wildfires on air quality and human exposure can vary depending on the specific locations of the fires, population densities, and how the smoke disperses in the air. Also, carbon dioxide is just one of the many substances in wildfire smoke that can affect human health. Other pollutants, such as particulate matter and ozone, can also harm the respiratory system and overall health of individuals. In conclusion, Washington state, with its prevalent wildfires year-round, is likely to have more people inhaling carbon dioxide from the wildfire smoke than Oregon, which had almost no wildfires. However, a more definitive answer would require assessment of each state's population density, the specific location of the fires, and the patterns of smoke dispersion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Network insiders tell Daily Mail Online that the long-running talk show could end after this season, amid struggling ratings and infighting among the talk show hosts. Currently in its eighteenth season, the show created by retired TV journalist Barbara Walters is suffering some of its lowest ratings ever with its new team of Whoopi Goldberg, Rosie O'Donnell, Nicolle Wallace and Rosie Perez.

Explanation: The correct sentence is \\"The View launched in 1997 and became successful in the 11am time slot on ABC, a time period that no other morning show had been able to perform well in.\\" This makes sense as 'The View' is a television show that airs on the network ABC, and it correctly continues the discussion from the previous paragraph.

Under the project, which was created as part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the IRS provides funding to programs that offer tax education and representation to low-income individuals. Does it follow that \\"The IRS provides financial support to programs that help low-income individuals. \\"?","completion":"Yes, it is correct to say that \\"The IRS provides financial support to programs that help low-income individuals.\\" As part of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) implemented projects aimed at helping low-income individuals with their tax-related needs, to offer tax education and representation to those who might struggle to access these services due to financial constraints. One of the primary reasons the IRS has initiatives in place to support low-income individuals is to help them navigate the often complex and taxing, no pun intended, process of understanding, filing, and complying with tax laws and regulations. These programs are designed to empower and protect the rights of low-income taxpayers by providing them with accurate and relevant information, education, and representation. Some of the programs that the IRS provides financial support to include: 1. Low Income Taxpayer Clinics (LITCs) - These clinics offer affordable or no-cost legal assistance to low-income individuals who are involved in tax disputes with the IRS. Many LITCs also provide consultations, education, and guidance on taxpayers' rights and responsibilities. The LITC program is run by non-profit organizations, and they receive partial funding from the IRS through grants. 2. Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) - The VITA program provides free, basic tax return preparation services to individuals with low-to-moderate incomes, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and those with limited English proficiency. The IRS grants funding to partner organizations that manage VITA sites and train volunteers, who in turn, provide free tax help to qualified individuals. 3. Tax Counseling for the Elderly (TCE) - Similar to the VITA program, TCE offers free tax help for individuals aged 60 and older, focusing on issues unique to senior citizens. IRS-certified volunteers, often with backgrounds in retirement planning or counseling, provide the tax assistance. TCE program partners receive grant funding from the IRS to cover operational expenses. 4. IRS outreach programs - The IRS also conducts outreach programs to raise awareness about tax benefits, credits, and other opportunities available to low-income individuals and families. This includes promoting the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), Child Tax Credit (CTC), and other tax benefits targeted at reducing poverty and providing financial relief to low-income taxpayers. In conclusion, it is accurate to assert that the IRS provides financial support to programs that help low-income individuals as part of its commitment to ensure these individuals can access appropriate tax education and representation, as well as receive the necessary support for a better understanding of their tax obligations and rights. These initiatives contribute to the goal of promoting tax compliance and protecting the rights of all taxpayers, regardless of their income level."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Coral Polge is a person who has provided comfort to thousands. She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her. Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic artist. She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died. Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life. Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait. There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception .

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday blamed Hamas for abducting three teenagers who went missing in Jewish settlements in the West Bank. \\"This morning I can say what I was unable to say yesterday before the extensive wave of arrests of Hamas members in Judea and Samaria,\\" he said at the start of the weekly Cabinet meeting. \\"Those who perpetrated the abduction of our youths were members of Hamas -- the same Hamas that Abu Mazen made a unity government with. This has severe repercussions.\\" Abu Mazen is another name for Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Netanyahu said he asked Abbas \\"to do everything to help bring them back in peace.\\" He's also given security forces orders to locate the teenagers and prevent them from being moved to Gaza or any other place. One of three boys is a dual Israeli-American citizen, according to CNN affiliate Channel 10 Israel, which attributed the information to a source at Netanyahu's office. Israeli and U.S. officials have not publicly confirmed the report. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Sunday for the immediate release of the boys. \\"We are still seeking details on the parties responsible for this despicable terrorist act, although many indications point to Hamas' involvement,\\" Kerry said in a written statement that offered support to the Israeli government. \\"As we gather this information, we reiterate our position that Hamas is a terrorist organization known for its attacks on innocent civilians and which has used kidnapping in the past.\\" Netanyahu: Israeli forces can use 'all measures' to free teens. 'We'll hug them soon' Gilad Shaar, 16; Naftali Frenkel, 16; and Eyal Yifrach, 19, have been missing since late Thursday or Friday, and were last seen around Gush Etzion, according to the Israel Defense Forces. The three \\"were just on their way home,\\" Naftali's mother, Racheli Frankel, told reporters. \\"We trust\\" that they \\"will be with us here, and we'll hug them soon ... and God willing, we'll all be able to celebrate their return safely,\\" she said. She thanked the security forces for their efforts and the U.S. Embassy for its support. \\"We feel waves and waves of prayers and support and positive energy in this direction.\\" Israeli soldiers have detained about 80 Palestinian suspects in the search for the three teens, the IDF said Sunday. Netanyahu on Saturday gave security forces the OK to use \\"all measures\\" at their disposal to find the teenagers. The Palestinian Ministry of Information said in a written statement that the arrests come under \\"flimsy pretexts\\" as a \\"continuation of the aggression\\" on Palestinians. \\"The ministry also asserts that the Israeli military campaign has been on going for decades, during which (Israel) kidnapped the entire Palestinian people,\\" it said. Hamas responds. A Hamas spokesman in Gaza told CNN that Netanyahu's comments attributing blame were \\"stupid and baseless.\\" \\"The arrest campaign made by the Israeli occupation in the West Bank is targeted to break the backbone of Hamas and bring it down, but the Israelis will not succeed in achieving their goal,\\" Sami Abu Zuhri said. But Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said the kidnappings are a reminder of Hamas' tactics. \\"When the Fatah-Hamas government was formed last month, the international community quickly recognized and welcomed it,\\" he wrote in a Facebook post. \\"Suddenly, Hamas' cruel acts of terrorism were forgotten, their never-ending attempts to harm innocent civilians, along with the Hamas Charter, which calls for the total destruction of the state of Israel.\\" Now, he wrote, \\"the international community has been given a second chance to correct its moral, diplomatic and strategic mistakes. Wall to wall condemnations of the kidnapping are called for, as well as placing responsibility on the Palestinian government, including the threat of taking physical, economic and diplomatic steps against it.\\" But, he wrote, the international community is \\"keeping silent, and by doing so, not only are the Palestinians receiving a false, lenient message, but Israel also understands again that she has no one to count on but herself, something that will not encourage further compromises on her part in the near future.\\" IDF spokesman Lt. Col. Peter Lerner said, \\"We are determined in bringing the boys home in a (hasty) manner, in safety and in good health. Palestinian terrorists will not feel safe, will not be able to hide and will feel the heavy arm of the Israeli military capabilities.\\" '#BringBackOurBoys' The abduction of the three teens inspired social media users to use the hashtag #BringBackOurBoys, a reference to the #BringBackOurGirls campaign for more than 200 Nigerian school girls who were kidnapped by militants. The thread quickly became contentious, with pro-Palestinian users alleging many Palestinian children have been kidnapped by Israeli soldiers and imprisoned.

Which circuit would have higher temperature, circuit A or circuit B? John is preparing for a do it yourself science project. First, he made a circuit with adequate resistance. He labeled that state of the circuit as circuit A. Then he lowered the resistance. He called that new state of the circuit as circuit B. While he was doing all this, his friend Keith showed up with another circuit, circuit C. But that circuit's insulation was damaged. Hint: For example, if a circuit has a potential difference of 100 volts and it is intended for the circuit to contain a 100 ohm resistance, then the wires carrying the current for this circuit will be designed for 1.0 amp. If that 100 ohm resistance is suddenly cut out of the circuit and only 0.10 ohm resistance remains, then the voltage will push 1000 amps of current through the circuit. This current overheats the wires and may damage the circuits or start a fire in the walls or the appliance. There are many possible causes of a short circuit, one possible cause could be something overheating, melting wires, and thereby fusing the circuit closed, bypassing the resistance. Another cause might be something damaging the insulation of a wire, allowing the incoming and grounds wires to touch. In any case, once the resistance is lost, the voltage pushes a huge amount of charge through the wires causing them to overheat.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which friend studied less about the natural development of species? Hint: New species develop naturally through the process of natural selection . Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.

Movie plot title: The Other Guys Movie plot: Detective Allen Gamble (Will Ferrell) is a mild-mannered forensic accountant and was a pimp in the past. Hot-tempered detective Terry \\"Yankee Clipper\\" Hoitz (Mark Wahlberg) has been partnered with Allen ever since he mistakenly shot Derek Jeter during the World Series. Allen and Terry receive no respect from the other officers, particularly detectives Martin (Rob Riggle) and Fosse (Damon Wayans, Jr.). All but Terry idolize cocky detectives Chris Danson (Dwayne Johnson) and P. K. Highsmith (Samuel L. Jackson), who are considered the city's best policemen even though they frequently cause millions of dollars in property damage catching petty criminals. During a pursuit, Danson and Highsmith leap to their deaths after misjudging their ability to survive a fall, which causes the precinct to wonder why they did it and who will take their place. Allen and Terry investigate a scaffolding permit violation by multi-billionaire Sir David Ershon (Steve Coogan) but wind up uncovering a much bigger plot by Ershon to cover his losses to his client Lendl Global. Lendl CEO Pamela Boardman (Anne Heche) hires a team of mercenaries led by Roger Wesley (Ray Stevenson) to make sure Ershon pays her back. During their investigation, Allen confides in Terry about how he ran a college dating service in his past, though he denies that he was a pimp. When Allen's life spiraled out of control, he was sent to the hospital where he met his future wife Sheila (Eva Mendes), and he promised Sheila that he would never get out of control again.

There were no signs of an imminent deal based on the comments by the top executives at their presentations to the UBS Global Media and Communication Conference held Monday. Neither CBS Corp. Chairman Leslie Moonves nor Viacom interim Chief Executive Bob Bakish hinted of an immediate future together. Although he acknowledged that “anything can happen,” Moonves expressed confidence that CBS would continue to prosper on its own. “We are very happy the way we are as a stand-alone company,” Moonves said. “We’ve said this and we truly believe this. There is nothing that we want. There is nothing that we lack. Our stock hit a 52-week high this week. We are executing tremendously.” For his part, Bakish, who took his post Nov. 15 after running Viacom’s international businesses for the last nine years, said his focus will be a turnaround of the struggling media conglomerate while a special committee evaluates a possible CBS deal. “My mandate from the board is to drive Viacom as a strong independent company and to revitalize areas of our performance,” he said. “Whether or not [a CBS transaction happens] we will ensure Viacom can be as strong as it can be.” At the urging of Sumner Redstone and his daughter Shari, the controlling shareholders of the two companies, each firm has formed a special committee to explore a merger. Viacom and CBS were part of the same company until Sumner Redstone cleaved his empire in two in 2006. Analysts widely expect that should the two companies merge, Moonves would be entrusted to run a combined CBS/Viacom. Moonves is respected on Wall Street and enjoys a strong working relationship with Shari Redstone. But a CBS executive familiar with the talks said no action is expected before the end of this year. CBS also has improved its businesses — becoming a major producer and seller of programming to overseas broadcasters and streaming services — at a time when Viacom has suffered ratings declines. That was reflected in Monday’s remarks by Moonves, who touted a strong fall prime-time launch for the most-watched TV network because all five of its new series have been picked up for a full season. He also said all of the network’s sports contracts are profitable, including the 1-billion-a-year deal with the NFL. Moonves said despite the ratings declines in NFL viewing this season — largely blamed on competition from the compelling presidential election campaign — it continues to be the best product on television. (His network carries a Sunday package and the first half of the “Thursday Night Football” schedule). The telecast draws the largest TV audiences and provides a promotional platform for other CBS programming, luring young male viewers who don’t watch a lot of network television. “I remember the three years we didn’t have it from 1995 to 1998,” he said. “The network fell apart.” The NFL is also a reason that Moonves believes AT&T will eventually make a deal to carry the network on its new streaming service. CBS is the only major broadcast network not offered in the package that gives subscribers 80 channels for 35 a month. Quoting his favorite film “The Godfather” when talking about the negotiations, Moonves said, “We’re not unreasonable people.” Moonves also said he is “guardedly optimistic” that CBS will make a deal with Warner Bros. to bring back another season of TV’s top-rated sitcom,“The Big Bang Theory.” The network is currently in negotiation with the studio that produces “Big Bang.” Though expensive, the show is still valuable in helping build other new series on the schedule. On the Viacom side, Bakish touted the value of the company’s cable network brand names, which are still growing overseas. He said reviving MTV and Comedy Central will be a priority. “We’ve lost share and we need to take that back,” he said. Bakish indicated that he would like to see MTV return to its roots in music programming. He also offered a vote of confidence in “The Daily Show” host Trevor Noah, saying the topical comedy program’s ratings have held up since the end of the presidential election. Bakish shut down speculation that Viacom is eyeing a stake in the youth-oriented media company Vice. “We are not going to do it,” he said.","completion":"CBS and Viacom Merger: Possible but Not in 2016"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He was a mountain man (fur trapper), wilderness guide, Indian agent, and U.S. Army officer. Carson became a frontier legend in his own lifetime via biographies and news articles. Exaggerated versions of his exploits were the subject of dime novels. Carson wanted to take a winter break from the campaign. Major General Carleton refused. Kit was ordered to invade the Canyon de Chelly. It was here that many Navajos had taken refuge. Historian David Roberts writes, \\"Carson's sweep through the Canyon de Chelly in the winter of 1863-1864 would prove to be the decisive action in the Campaign.\\" The Canyon de Chelly was a sacred place for the Navajo. They believed that it would now be their strongest sanctuary. Three hundred Navajo took refuge on the canyon rim at a place called Fortress Rock. They resisted Carson's invasion by building rope ladders and bridges, lowering water pots into a stream, and keeping quiet and out of sight. These three hundred Navajo survived the invasion. In January 1864, Carson swept through the 35-mile (56 km) Canyon with his forces. The thousands of peach trees in the canyon were cut down. Few Navajo were killed or captured. Carson's invasion, however, proved to the Navajo that the United States could invade their country at any time. Many Navajo surrendered at Fort Canby. By March 1864, there were 3,000 refugees at Fort Canby. An additional 5,000 arrived in the camp. They were suffering from the intense cold and hunger. Carson asked for supplies to feed and clothe them. The thousands of Navajo were led to Bosque Redondo. Many died along the way. Stragglers in the rear were shot and killed. In Navajo history, this horrific trek is known as Long Walk of the Navajo. By 1866, reports indicated that Bosque Redondo was a complete failure. Major Carleton was fired. Congress started investigations. In 1868, a treaty was signed, and the Navajo were allowed to return to their homeland. Bosque Redondo was closed.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Were they ever attacked there?","completion":"The original text provided does not contain any specific article to quote from, nor does it have any clear indication that the Navajos were attacked in a specific location during Kit Carson's campaign.

Humans may use a host of facial cues – visible just hours after an infection starts – to avoid contracting illnesses from others, study indicates Coughing, sneezing and clutching the stomach might be obvious signs of sickness, but humans can also spot if someone is healthy simply from a glance at their face, new research suggests. Scientists have found that signs of a person being acutely unwell – such as pale lips, a downward turn of the mouth and droopy eyelids – are visible just hours after an infection begins. “We use a number of facial cues from other people and we probably judge the health in other people all the time,” said John Axelsson, a co-author of the research and a professor at the stress research institute at Stockholm University. While previous work has shown that besides overt symptoms – such as sniffing – changes in skin colour can serve as a guide to health, experts say the latest study highlights the ways in which humans might use a host of early signals to avoid contracting infection from others. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, Axelsson and colleagues described how they injected 16 healthy adults with a placebo and, at a separate point in time, molecules from E coli which are known to rapidly trigger flu-like symptoms. The participants were unaware which injection they had received, and were photographed about two hours after each injection. The team then showed the portraits to 62 participants who were asked to judge whether the pictured person was sick or healthy, with each picture shown for a maximum of five seconds. The results reveal that the participants were able to spot a sick person slightly better than if they were guessing, correctly identifying someone as being unwell 52% of the time. However, more impressively, they correctly labelled individuals as being healthy 70% of the time. Happily disgusted? Scientists map facial expressions for 21 emotions Read more Axelsson said the judgement of whether someone was sick or healthy might vary depending on the people analysing the images, noting that people looking for a partner might be better at spotting signs of health, while those afraid of catching an infection might be better at noticing cues for sickness. “I think it depends a bit on the context you are in, on what you are sensitive for,” he said. To delve deeper a new group of 60 participants were shown the photographs, without being told which injection had been given. Individuals photographed after being injected with the E coli molecules were, on average, rated as looking more sick and more tired than in photos taken after they were given the placebo. They were also rated as having a more swollen face, redder eyes, less glossy and less patchy skin as well as a more drooping mouth, hanging eyelids and – in particular – paler lips. However further analysis showed that just how sick a person was judged was most reliably linked to paler skin and droopier eyelids. Professor Ben Jones of the Face Research Lab at the University of Glasgow welcomed the research. “This study adds to growing evidence for the existence of facial cues associated with acute sickness and help us understand how, unfortunately, social stigmas about people suffering illnesses might emerge,” he said. But he noted that the study did not replicate real life, where faces can show many types of variation, even in the same person. Also, other studies have used the same set of photographs, meaning caution was needed against conclusions based on only a small group of individuals. Dr Carmen Lefevre of the centre for behaviour change at University College London also raised concerns about the small number of people who had been photographed. Nonetheless, she said the research supports the idea that humans have developed a range of behavioural mechanisms to help avoid catching diseases. “This is the first study [to show] that illness [is detectable] shortly after onset,” she added. Dr Rachel McMullan of the Open University said that it would be helpful to look at whether the results held for a wide range of ethnic groups and for different diseases, but added the results suggested ill individuals could be spotted soon after infection. “Being able to quickly identify and avoid potentially sick, contagious individuals will certainly be an evolutionary advantage and this study is a good starting point for further research into the how we detect early signs of infection,” she said. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

That’s the conclusion of a new study in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , which finds that sick people share facial features—pale skin, swollen faces, droopy eyelids, and looking tired—that reveal they might be contagious. Although those signs may seem obvious, no one has explicitly tested them until now. Researchers took mug shots of 16 Caucasian volunteers a few hours after injecting them with a placebo or a piece of bacteria that made people feel sick and caused their immune systems to respond as if they had an infection. They then showed the photos to 62 people, who rated the faces (pictured above as composite images with noninfected individuals on the left and infected on the right) as “sick” or “healthy” in 5 seconds or less. Raters identified 81% of sick people better than chance. But, what is it about our faces that give away whether we’re feeling under the weather? To find this out, a separate group of 60 people assessed how sick and tired the people in the photos looked and the extent to which each trait—pale skin and lips, droopy eyelids and corners of the mouth, how puffy their faces looked, eye redness, and tiredness—publicized illness. The researchers found pale skin and hanging eyelids were the best predictors of sickness. So, if staying healthy is part of your New Year’s resolution, perhaps give pallid and tired looking friends and colleagues a wide berth. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"New research suggests that humans can identify early signs of illness in others by observing facial cues, such as pale lips, droopy eyelids, and a downward turn of the mouth.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf.

This recommendation is based on the fact that some local governments and real estate websites make this data accessible online, making it easier and more efficient for homeowners to start their research from the comfort of their own home rather than going to a real estate office in person.

At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition.

(CNN)Two Renaissance sculptures of a nude man riding a panther may have been created by Michelangelo, says a British museum. The Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge says that the bronze sculptures, known as the Rothschild Bronzes and dating from the 1500s, were probably created just after the famed artist's David and just before he painted the ceiling of the Vatican's Sistine Chapel. The museum and researchers at the University of Cambridge say they have \\"compelling evidence\\" that the works, attributed to a Dutch sculptor, are actually from Michelangelo. If so, they are the only surviving Michelangelo bronzes in the world, says the museum. The key clue that the unsigned bronzes were actually done by Michelangelo came from one of the master's apprentices. Last year, Paul Joannides, a Cambridge art history professor, noted that a Michelangelo student had made a study of several Michelangelo sketches for works believed lost. One of the drawings in the study, which dates from 1508, matched one of the bronzes. Further research indicated they were in Michelangelo's style, and X-rays roughly confirmed the era of their creation. \\"Even a peroneal tendon is visible, as is the transverse arch of the foot,\\" wrote University of Warwick anatomist Peter Abrahams, according to the UK Guardian. Victoria Avery, keeper of applied arts at the Fitzwilliam Museum, described the project to the Guardian as \\"a Renaissance whodunit.\\" She says that the museum was careful in assembling the evidence and that the works are masterpieces. \\"The modeling is superb, they are so powerful and so compelling, so whoever made them had to be superb,\\" she said. The works -- and some of the evidence -- will be on display at the Fitzwilliam from Tuesday through August 9. Though the museum is confident of the works' origins, research is continuing, and results will be presented at a conference in early July. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Context: The first technical dictionary was drafted by John Harris and entitled Lexicon Technicum: Or, An Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences. Harris' book avoided theological and biographical entries; instead it concentrated on science and technology. Published in 1704, the Lexicon technicum was the first book to be written in English that took a methodical approach to describing mathematics and commercial arithmetic along with the physical sciences and navigation. Other technical dictionaries followed Harris' model, including Ephraim Chambers' Cyclopaedia (1728), which included five editions, and was a substantially larger work than Harris'. The folio edition of the work even included foldout engravings. The Cyclopaedia emphasized Newtonian theories, Lockean philosophy, and contained thorough examinations of technologies, such as engraving, brewing, and dyeing.","completion":"The Lexicon Technicum was published later than it was drafted.

Here is an article: A young company with a one-of-a-kind technological innovation is celebrating a milestone that's enabling tens of millions of children worldwide to better access the power of play. One World Futbol Project, founded in 2010, produced and delivered its millionth ultra-durable soccer ball at a school in South Africa with the help of Chevrolet, its founding corporate partner, the companies announced on Monday. The millionth ball was delivered as part of a ceremony during which Chevrolet and local partner, Dreamfields Project unveiled a new soccer pitch at the Mabu-a-tiou girls' primary school in Hammanskraal, South Africa, on Saturday. One World, a certified B Corporation founded in 2010, partnered with Chevrolet two years ago to donate and distribute 1.5 million balls to communities in need around the globe. As part of its What Do You #PlayFor campaign, Chevrolet is also rebuilding soccer pitches, including the one at Mabu-a-tiou. Dreamfields provides soccer kits, boots and balls for the students, including those at the 17 schools that attended Saturday's event. Young women at the Mabu-a-tiou school in South Africa play with a One World futbol. \\"It was a beautiful moment none of us will soon forget,\\" Tim Mahoney, Global Chevrolet's chief marketing officer, told Mashable in an email. \\"It showed how this sport can help us to share the power of play, and create possibilities for people all around the world.” The revitalized pitch in Hammanskraal, a rural town north of Pretoria, looked \\"tired and neglected\\" before these organizations got ahold of it, according to Dreamfields CEO and founder John Perlman. While Chevrolet provided the funds and One World the balls, Dreamfields will be responsible for helping maintain the renovated pitch, which was deliberately kept soil-based, in light of water scarcity in the community. Dreamfields is also in the process of distributing 4,000 One World soccer balls to programs across South Africa. One World Futbol founders Lisa and Tim Jahnigen with the millionth ball, the South African students, and their former ball. After seeing images of children in underdeveloped nations playing soccer with balls made from trash, One World founder Tim Jahnigen conceived of a ball that wouldn't deflate, even if punctured. A chance meeting with Sting led to the music legend and philanthropist providing the funding needed to research and develop the ball, which is created using an injection-molded foam. It withstands the rigors of rough terrain and, because of its unique design, doesn't need to be inflated. Calling the millionth ball a \\"milestone achievement,\\" Sting said Monday in an emailed statement that he's \\"proud to be part of an initiative that brings the transformative power of play to children who need it most.\\" All over the world, nonprofit organizations are relying on the indestructible ball to lead programs that empower young people, from urban centers to rural communities. In these places, play is not just a luxury — it also encourages learning and personal development. The following video details the work of another One World Futbol project in Zanzibar, the site of the organization's first large-scale drop (a delivery of 20,000 balls), as part of its partnership with Chevrolet. In it, Mubarak Maman, a director at Save the Children in Tanzania, describes the importance of One World's mission to provide durable soccer balls. Play is like \\"food, it's like clothes, it's one of the components that contributes positively to the development of a healthy child,\\" he says. Ben Gucciardi, who uses the unbreakable ball in the Soccer Without Borders program at an Oakland, California, public school for refugee and immigrant youth, said his kids' participation in soccer often helps keep them in school. Doc Lawson, a former soccer star who now runs a program for youth in his native Liberia, told Mashable in January that he was running through \\"15 to 20 balls a day\\" before he began to use the One World football, which he called a \\"hero ball.\\" Perlman, too, echoed that sentiment. \\"Here, we talk about that ball as the miracle ball,\\" Lawson said in an interview Thursday. \\"Because in the communities that we work, hope is in quite short supply. And disappointment is such a part of the ether\\" that the simple durability of the ball is a powerful force. It sends a message that says, \\"Actually, there are some things in life that are indestructible and uncrushable,\\" he added. According to One World internal numbers, 1 million footballs represents 30 million kids globally who are more able to play on a regular basis. But that means more than just having fun: It's \\"learning to win, learning to lose, learning to see life in longer timelines,\\" Perlman said. And if that still sounds frivolous, see the United Nations' Declaration of the Rights of the Child — play has long been designated a human right. \\"While the ball technology is unique, the real magic is not in the ball,\\" Jahnigen said in a statement from Saturday's unveiling of the new soccer pitch in South Africa. \\"It is what happens when children are allowed to play.\\" Have something to add to this story?

Freeman added a third goal with a diving header from Chapman's cross in the final minute of the half. Chapman slipped the ball past Alex Cisak to score following a good run into the area nine minutes after the restart and then found the net again 15 minutes later after meeting a David Brooks cross. Chapman completed his treble in stoppage time, chipping over Cisak following a defensive error. Report supplied by the Press Association. Match ends, Sheffield United 6, Leyton Orient 0.

Given the following context: This movie was a tribute to R. D. Burman. Jhankaar Beats is a story about love, friendship, and music. Deep is happily married to the lovely Shanti, with a little daughter Muskaan and another baby on the way. Rishi is his best friend and colleague at an advertising agency. Rishi is a little immature and stubborn, and this keeps on causing fights at home with his equally headstrong wife Nicky. Rishi and Deep are dedicated musicians, obsessive about the music of R.D. Burman. They play at a club sometimes and compete in an annual pop music contest called \\"Jhankaar Beats\\" — they have lost for the past two years. When the movie starts, Rishi has been kicked out of his house by Nicky and the two are considering getting a divorce. Deep's nagging mother-in-law has come for a two-month visit. The men are under pressure to get an advertising campaign ready for a new client, an oddball condom manufacturer. Around this time they meet Indraneel (Shayan Munshi, Neel for short), who is the son of their boss Mr. Kapoor and is joining the company. Neel is an ace guitarist who has his own problems — he is attracted to a pretty girl, Preeti but cannot muster the courage to talk to her. To make things worse, his father has decided that he is wasting his life and has given him an ultimatum — find a girl in two months or settle down with a wife his parents choose. Rishi and Deep, though they tease him mercilessly, grow very fond of Neel, and he has a sure ally in Shanti. Shanti, meanwhile, is trying to get Rishi to see sense and make up with Nicky. There are a host of colourful supporting characters, among them a newlywed couple living above Deep's flat, Nicky's handsome lawyer, and the very sexy owner of a rival advertising agency. How they resolve all their issues forms the rest of the story. answer the following question: What is the nickname of the person whose father has decided that he is wasting his life?

How do you say \\"Originally there were ten basins.\\" in Spanish?","completion":"To translate \\"Originally there were ten basins.\\" to Spanish, I will follow these steps: 1. Identify the main components of the sentence: - \\"Originally\\" is an adverb that indicates the initial circumstance. - \\"there were\\" is a past tense of the verb \\"to be\\" (in this case, indicating existence). - \\"ten\\" is a numeral indicating the quantity. - \\"basins\\" is a plural noun, the object of the sentence. 2. Translate the components to their Spanish equivalents: - \\"Originally\\" can be translated as \\"originalmente\\" or \\"inicialmente\\". - \\"there were\\" in this context can be translated as \\"había\\" (past tense of \\"haber\\" to express existence). - \\"ten\\" can be translated as \\"diez\\". - \\"basins\\" can be translated as \\"cuencas\\" (if referring to geographical basins) or \\"recipientes\\" (if referring to containers). 3. Combine the translated components to form the sentence in Spanish: - Assuming you are referring to geographical basins, the sentence would be: \\"Inicialmente había diez cuencas.\\" - If you are referring to basins as containers, the sentence would be: \\"Inicialmente había diez recipientes.\\" Therefore, \\"Originally there were ten basins.\\" can be translated to Spanish as \\"Inicialmente había diez cuencas.\\" or \\"Inicialmente había diez recipientes.\\" depending on the context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Because time does not permit I do not want to go into an in depth analysis and talk about how, when the Liberal government took office in 1993, the unemployment rate was at 11.5 percent and today as we all know it is 9 percent and dropping; how we inherited a 42 billion deficit from a Conservative government that had never met its budget targets; or how we inherited a country so weakened from all aspects that we were being described as a third world economy. Can we draw the following conclusion? There was not enough time to go into details","completion":"Based on the provided information, it seems that the lack of time was a significant factor that prevented an in-depth analysis of the mentioned economic and political issues. Nonetheless, an overview of the key points can be helpful in understanding the context and the reasons behind the expressed concern. When the Liberal government came into power in 1994, it faced considerable challenges, including an unemployment rate of 11.5 percent, a 42 billion deficit accrued from the Conservative government, and a national image of being a weakened economy, leading to the term 'a third world economy.' However, now the unemployment rate is at 9 percent, suggesting an improvement in the situation. The high unemployment rate in 1993 was likely a result of various factors, such as insufficient job opportunities, poor labor market conditions, economic policies, or other structural factors. With the new government in place, it can be inferred that some measures have been implemented to address this issue, leading to the unemployment rate's drop to 9 percent. However, without a detailed analysis, it is not clear which specific policies and steps have been taken to achieve this improvement. Similarly, the 42 billion deficit often reflects a situation where the government's debt has significantly increased due to excessive spending, inadequate revenue generation, or ineffective fiscal policies. Upon inheriting this deficit, the Liberal government likely had to make some tough decisions and implement various measures to control the budget and to work towards reducing the deficit. Again, without a detailed analysis, it is not possible to pinpoint which specific policies and actions have been employed and how effective they have been in addressing the deficit issue. Finally, the country's perception as a third-world economy had to be addressed by strengthening the economic position and showing progress and growth to the international community. This perception might have been a result of poor economic indicators, slow growth rates, inadequate infrastructure, or other socio-economic factors. It is very likely that the Liberal government took several measures to address these issues and boost economic growth, but without a detailed analysis, it is not feasible to determine which specific strategies have been employed and how successful they have been. Therefore, although time does not permit a comprehensive examination of the outlined issues and the efforts of the Liberal government, we can draw the conclusion that the lack of time led to only a superficial understanding of the situation. A detailed analysis would allow for a more profound understanding of the factors that contributed to the problems and the effectiveness of the policies and actions taken by the government in navigating these challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - exhausted - lonely - worked all day - were very tired - feel better I believe the correct choice is \\"were very tired\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The question posed seems to indicate that the speaker, and possibly others, have not experienced rest recently, which might suggest that they have been engaging in a significant amount of physical or mental activity. To better understand and analyze the given response options, let us examine each possibility: 1. Exhausted: If someone feels exhausted, it implies that they have reached a state of extreme fatigue. Enduring long stretches of work or intense activity can cause a person to feel exhausted. This could be an accurate choice to describe the speaker's feeling due to a lack of rest, as exhaustion often results from overexertion. 2. Lonely: Feeling lonely generally refers to experiencing a sense of isolation or longing for companionship. While a lack of rest can undoubtedly affect a person's emotional state, the feeling of loneliness is not necessarily directly linked to their physical condition or energy levels. Thus, this choice may not be the most accurate representation of the speaker's feelings. 3. Worked all day: This statement simply implies that the person has spent their entire day engaged in work. While this might be true, it does not provide information about how they feel due to their lack of rest. It is a description of the situation rather than the feeling they experience. 4. Were very tired: If someone feels very tired, it implies that they have experienced fatigue as a result of either physical or mental strain. Fatigue can range from mild to severe and is often directly related to the amount of rest or sleep a person gets. Choosing \\"were very tired\\" gives a more accurate representation of how the speaker feels. It reflects the fact that the speaker has not had sufficient rest and that the feeling stems from their fatigue. 5. Feel better: This statement signifies that the speaker's condition has improved, which seems contradictory to the posed question. Without rest, it is difficult for someone to genuinely feel better as fatigue still affects their overall well-being. Therefore, this choice is less likely to be the correct description. Considering the analysis of these options, the most appropriate choice appears to be \\"were very tired.\\" This option highlights the direct relationship between the lack of rest and the feeling of fatigue that the speaker is experiencing. Furthermore, it emphasizes that their physical or mental exertion has led to a state of weariness, reinforcing the importance of rest to maintain overall well-being and energy levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The risks involved with \\"the largest UK government-run IT project in history\\" were \\"staggering\\", a report said. It recommended that the government drastically scale back the programme or abandon it altogether. Smart Energy GB, the independent body set up to publicise smart meters, said the IoD wanted to take the UK \\"back to an analogue dark age\\". Energy-saving digital smart meters, designed to replace existing analogue gas and electricity meters, should help householders to monitor their energy-use far more accurately, and energy companies to do away with estimated bills. By some estimates, the new meters could save us £17bn on our energy bills. But the IoD believes the government's plan to roll out smart meters to all 30 million UK households by 2020 is far too ambitious. \\"The pace of technological innovation may well leave the current generation of meters behind and leave consumers in a cycle of installation, de-installation and re-installation,\\" it said. Under the scheme, energy companies must begin offering free smart meters to their customers from the autumn. Despite the £11bn estimated cost to the industry, it will not be compulsory to have one. Responding to the IoD report, Sacha Deshmukh, chief executive of Smart Energy GB, said: \\"The IoD does not understand what's needed to secure Britain's energy infrastructure for the future. \\"The smart meter rollout must be for everybody. It will only deliver the national transformation Britain needs if every home is part of this national upgrade.\\" Nearly 1.4 million households have already had a smart meter installed, he added. But the IoD isn't the only body concerned about the smart meter programme. Earlier this month, the Parliament's Energy and Climate Change Committee said the project was in danger of becoming a costly mistake. The MPs are concerned that allowing each energy company to come up with its own smart meter solution, rather than adopting an industry-wide approach, could lead to inefficiency and further delay. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"The Institute of Directors (IoD) has suggested that the UK government's plan to roll out smart meters to all 30 million UK households by 2020 is too ambitious, as the current technology may become obsolete due to the pace of innovation.

Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona.

Answer the following question: Process: - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person does more exercise happens, how will it affect MORE food being digested. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"When a person engages in more exercise, there can be both direct and indirect effects on the process of digestion. Let's break down how the increased exercise might affect the various stages of digestion: 1. Food intake: With more exercise, the body requires additional energy, leading to an increase in appetite. As a result, people who exercise more may consume more food to meet their increased energy demands. 2. Chewing and saliva production: Exercise can stimulate the release of saliva by increasing blood flow to the salivary glands. Additionally, as people become more aware of their health and fitness, they might pay more attention to chewing their food properly, which can promote better digestion. 3. Stomach function and acid secretion: Exercise, particularly moderate-intensity aerobic exercises, can stimulate more frequent stomach contractions and enhance blood flow to the stomach. This increased blood flow can allow the stomach to secrete more acid, improving the breaking down of food. 4. Intestinal transit rate: Physical activity can positively influence gut motility, speeding up the movement of food through the digestive system. This helps prevent constipation and promotes more efficient absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. 5. Enzyme secretion and nutrient absorption: Exercise can increase the secretion of digestive enzymes in the small intestine, facilitating a more efficient breakdown of food into its constituent nutrients. Better circulation due to exercise will also aid in the absorption of these nutrients, supplying the body with more energy and supporting overall health. 6. Colon function: Regular physical activity promotes the healthy functioning of the colon, thus reducing the risk of constipation and digestive disorders. 7. Expulsion of waste: Increased exercise can lead to frequent bowel movements as it aids in the proper function of the colon. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that more exercise will have both direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. Increased physical activity can improve overall digestion efficiency and promote a healthier gastrointestinal function. It is essential to note, however, that adequate rest and recovery periods are crucial to maintaining the positive effects of exercise on the body and digestive system."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

The sight I saw was heartbreaking. The broken houses seemed to be crying. I couldn't describe how I felt. But something special among the debris turned my day around. I joined a club to clean up the beach after the storm last November. As I removed the debris from the beach, I noticed an object with shiny buttons in the wet sand. It was a jacket,and I was excited since Halloween was coming and I thought I had found a great costume . After picking it up, I was able to see that the jacket was from West Point , the United States Military Academy, and it had the name \\"deGavre\\" written inside. I realized the jacket might be important to someone. I decided to find the jacket's owner and return it. I called the West Point Museum, considering that if the family couldn't be found, the jacket should go there. The museum connected me with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy's Association of Graduates. Kim soon ensured that the jacket had belonged to Chester Braddock deGavre, who was a 1933 graduate and a war hero, but passed away in 1993. I sent Kim a photo of the jacket and she posted it to the West Point Association of Graduates Facebook Page, asking if anyone could help us find the family. In less than two hours, someone had found and called the hero's wife, Teresa. Soon I started to receive personal messages from members of the deGavre family, their friends and others who were touched by the story and they found me on Facebook. Finding Chester deGavre's jacket and connecting to his family with the help of Facebook have been so meaningful to me. I've formed a bond with amazing people I might have never met.

The author believed the jacket could be important to someone, either the rightful owner or family members, or be of historical significance, thus considering the museum as an appropriate place where the jacket could be preserved and appreciated. Upon calling the West Point Museum, the author was connected with Kim McDermott, Director of Communications for the Academy's Association of Graduates. Through her diligent efforts and the power of social media, the jacket was eventually identified as belonging to Chester Braddock deGavre, a 1933 graduate, war hero, and a husband. The jacket was then returned to his family, thereby creating lasting connections and memorable experiences among all parties involved. In summary, the author called the West Point Museum because he thought that the jacket might be collected by the museum, either as a significant piece of history or as a means of reconnecting it with its rightful owner or family.

Chris Christie in New Jersey and Bobby Jindal in Louisiana both have deficits to explain. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Struggling State Economies: A Challenge for Republican Presidential Hopefuls Chris Christie and Bobby Jindal As the next US presidential election inches closer, potential candidates from both sides of the political spectrum are getting ready to throw their hats into the ring. However, for two Republican governors mulling a White House run, their respective state's economic struggles may prove to be a significant hurdle in their campaigns. Long-time New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and outgoing Louisiana Governor Bobby Jindal both have to contend with considerable budget deficits and a lackluster economic performance in their states. New Jersey's high-profile Governor Chris Christie, known for his blunt persona and battles with the state's teacher unions, has been in office since 2010. Over the years, the Garden State has faced multiple economic issues, including a lagging recovery from the Great Recession, declining state revenues, and a looming public pension crisis. This has resulted in an 8 billion deficit for the state. Under Christie's leadership, New Jersey has struggled to stay afloat in comparison to its neighbors, like New York and Pennsylvania, who have both experienced growth and prosperity. The state's credit rating has suffered nine downgrades during his tenure, leaving it with one of the lowest ratings in the country. Critics say that this has happened due to Christie's mismanagement of state finances and his insistence on tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy, with little consideration given to investing in public services, infrastructure, and education. Christie has defended his economic record, citing the fact that New Jersey has added around 150,000 private sector jobs, and has experienced an overall job growth of 1.4%. He also claims that tax cuts have helped attract businesses to invest in the state. However, detractors argue that these figures are unimpressive compared to neighboring states, and that New Jersey's unemployment rate remains higher than the national average. In the Southern state of Louisiana, two-term Governor Bobby Jindal is also dealing with questions about his state's economic health. Jindal inherited a 1 billion surplus when he assumed office in 2008, but as he exits the governor's mansion, the state now faces a 1.6 billion deficit. The Louisiana economy has faced numerous setbacks, including a drop in oil prices, which make up a significant portion of the state's revenue. Jindal's critics argue that his administration's policies have exacerbated the state's economic woes. These policies include cutting taxes and maintaining tax breaks for corporations at the expense of critical social services and education funding. Jindal has taken a hard stance against increasing taxes, asserting that tax increases would drive away businesses. However, with major cuts to education, healthcare, and social services, it remains unclear whether his anti-tax stance and conservative policies have been effective in maintaining a sustainable economy in Louisiana. As candidates declare their intentions to run for the presidency, economic issues will dominate the campaigns. For both Christie and Jindal, their state's struggling economies may be a difficult hurdle for them to overcome as they vie for the Republican nomination. Each candidate will have to convince voters that despite the economic challenges faced by their states, they have the necessary experience and policies to successfully steer the U.S. economy in a positive direction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Whether it's a crowded parking lot, a narrow alley, or a congested traffic lane, these situations can be both challenging and intimidating for many. Adjusting your vehicle in tight spots, restarting when necessary, and carefully opening your doors can make a significant difference in ensuring a smooth, safe, and stress-free driving experience. In this article, we will discuss these steps in detail and provide valuable tips for navigating tight spaces with ease. Step 1: Assess The Situation Before attempting to navigate a tight spot, it's crucial to assess the situation. Determine the available space, the angle of approach, and predict any potential obstacles. This initial understanding allows you to adapt your strategy accordingly. Step 2: Adjust Your Vehicle Position Once you've sized up the situation, adjust your vehicle's position to create adequate room for maneuvering. If parking, approach the spot at a slow pace and use your mirrors to gain a good view of your surroundings. Move your car at a steady pace and use reference points to stay aware of the proximity to other vehicles, walls, or curbs. If necessary, apply the following rule of thumb: 1. Make necessary adjustments to your seating and mirrors. 2. Take note of the surrounding objects or vehicles to avoid collision. 3. Start by steering your wheels in the opposite direction of the tight spot to create an angle for entry. 4. As your vehicle enters the tight space, steer your wheels in the direction of the parking spot. 5. Adjust your vehicle accordingly until properly maneuvered into position. Step 3: Start Over Whenever Necessary If your initial attempt to adjust your vehicle in a tight spot isn't successful, don't be afraid to start over. It's better to make multiple attempts than to risk hitting another vehicle or object. Put your vehicle in reverse, carefully back up while scanning for potential obstacles, and reattempt the maneuver. Be patient and remember that practice makes perfect. Step 4: Open Your Door Carefully Once your vehicle is in the desired position, proceed with caution when opening the doors. Check for nearby vehicles, pedestrians, and obstacles before you open the door fully, and consider using your car's window to get a better view of your surroundings. Conclusion: Adjusting your vehicle in tight spots can be challenging, but with practice, patience, and the right approach, every driver can master this essential skill. Remember to assess the situation, adjust your vehicle accordingly, start over when needed, and always open your doors carefully. Incorporate these valuable tips into your driving routine, and you'll soon find yourself navigating tight spaces with confidence and ease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the first sentence, it is mentioned that John Gielgud and the Smithsonian are fighting with one another. However, the comparison is made between them, stating they are similar in many ways.

On the other hand, the second sentence states that John Gielgud and the Smithsonian have been friends since high school. This sentence suggests a long-standing friendship between the two, which directly contrasts with the fighting mentioned in the first sentence. Entailment is a semantic relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of the other. In this case, the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. Both sentences provide different perspectives on the relationship between John Gielgud and the Smithsonian.

What is the answer?","completion":"In Greek mythology, Pasiphaë gave birth to the Minotaur, a fearsome creature with the body of a man and the head of a bull. To understand the origins of the Minotaur, it is crucial to examine the characters and the myth surrounding this creature. Pasiphaë was the daughter of the sun god Helios and the nymph Perseis. She was a powerful sorceress and the queen of Crete, married to King Minos. King Minos was the son of Zeus and Europa and was famous for his wisdom and fairness. However, the story of the Minotaur's birth reveals a darker side to the king and his family. According to the myth, King Minos prayed to the sea god Poseidon to send him a magnificent bull as a sign of his divine support for Minos' kingship. Poseidon granted his request and sent a magnificent white bull, known as the Cretan Bull, from the depths of the sea. Minos was supposed to sacrifice this bull in Poseidon's honor, acknowledging the god's role in his rise to power. However, Minos was so captivated by the bull's beauty that he decided to keep it and sacrifice another bull in its place. Poseidon, enraged by Minos' disrespect, decided to punish him. The god of the sea conspired with Pasiphaë's jealous suitors to cast a spell on her, causing her to develop an uncontrollable desire for the Cretan Bull. Unable to resist her unnatural urges, Pasiphaë enlisted the help of the famed inventor Daedalus to create a wooden cow covered with real cowhide. Pasiphaë climbed inside the hollow cow and was able to deceive the bull, which then mated with her. As a result of this strange union, Pasiphaë became pregnant and later gave birth to the half-human, half-bull creature called the Minotaur, which had the body of a man and the head of a bull. Ashamed and fearful of the monstrous offspring, King Minos again turned to Daedalus for assistance. Daedalus designed an elaborate labyrinth to imprison the Minotaur and hide it from the world. The labyrinth was so intricate that no one who entered it could ever find their way out, thus effectively incarcerating the Minotaur within its walls. To satiate the Minotaur's insatiable hunger for human flesh, Minos demanded human tributes from the city of Athens, which had submitted to his reign following their defeat in a war. Every nine years, seven young Athenian men and seven young Athenian women were sent into the labyrinth as sacrifices to the Minotaur. The Minotaur's ultimate demise came at the hands of the Athenian hero Theseus. With the help of Minos' daughter Ariadne, who had fallen in love with Theseus, the hero entered the labyrinth, navigated its twists and turns using a ball of thread provided by Ariadne, and successfully killed the Minotaur. Theseus then managed to escape the labyrinth and sailed back to Athens as a celebrated hero, and the curse of the Minotaur was finally lifted. In summary, Pasiphaë, the queen of Crete, gave birth to the Minotaur, a monstrous creature with the head of a bull and the body of a man. The Minotaur's birth was the result of a complex series of events involving deceit, divine intervention, and human folly. The creature's existence served as both a symbol of the king's hubris and a stark reminder of the consequences of angering the gods. Its death at the hands of the hero Theseus marked the end of a tragic chapter in Greek mythology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate. - The Warring States period was an era in ancient Chinese history following the Spring and Autumn period and concluding with the Qin wars of conquest that saw the annexation of all other contender states, which ultimately led to the Qin state's victory in 221 BC as the first unified Chinese empire known as the Qin dynasty. Although different scholars point toward different dates ranging from 481 BC to 403 BC as the true beginning of the Warring States, Sima Qian's choice of 475 BC is generally the most often cited and popularly accepted one. The Warring States era also overlaps with the second half of the Eastern Zhou dynasty, though the Chinese sovereign, known as the king of Zhou, ruled merely as a figurehead and served as a backdrop against the machinations of the warring states. - Shinmen Sokan ( active 16th century ) was a Japanese lord , daimyo of the Shinmen clan ( Shinmen - shi ) during the middle of the Sengoku period . Sokan was known as a rather petty daimyo in the mountainous regions of Sakushu , which was west of Kyoto . Even though this was so , the Shinmen clan had very good ties with that of the Hirata family , leading to the Shinmen receiving a good amount of support . One such swordsman of note that served under Sokan was the famous Shinmen Munisai , the father of the legendary swordsman Miyamoto Musashi . In 1589 , Sokan ordered Munisai to kill Honiden Gekinosuke ( a minor student under Munisai ) for unknown reasons . Due to this fact however , Munisai was forced to leave his village of Miyamoto . - , also known as Shinmen Takez, Miyamoto Bennosuke or, by his Buddhist name, Niten Draku, was an expert Japanese swordsman and rnin.

Hyh Niten Ichi-ry is mainly known for the two-swordkatana and wakizashikenjutsu techniques Musashi called \\"Niten Ichi\\" (, \\"two heavens as one\\") or \\"Nit Ichi\\" (, \\"two swords as one\\"). - Originally named It Yagor, he at the age of fourteen found himself in a little seaside village called Izu. Legend tells that he floated across the Sagami Bay on a piece of driftwood from shima Island, part of the Izu Islands. The trust of the local villagers was earned when Yagor chased away a group of bandits that went around raiding and pillaging. As he desired to be a great swordsman, the villagers paid for Yagor's travels in seeking out a master. On his journey, Yagor reached Tsurugaoka Hachimang Shinto shrine in Kamakura where he paid homage to the gods and practiced his swordsmanship. One particular day, an unknown assailant tried to attack Yagor but he somehow unconsciously and without thinking drew his sword and cut him down in one swift stroke. Not understanding this technique, Yagor would later describe it as \\"Musken\\" (), a fundamental aspect of his swordsmanship's philosophy. Musken is either an offensive or defensive technique that is delivered spontaneously and without thinking, fully anticipating an opponent's movement; a type of extra-sensory perception similar to mushin. - A was a samurai with no lord or master during the feudal period (11851868) of Japan.

Background: The Cult are a British rock band formed in 1983. Before settling on their current name in January 1984, the band performed under the name Death Cult, which was an evolution of the name of lead singer Ian Astbury's previous band Southern Death Cult. They gained a dedicated following in the UK in the mid-1980s as a post-punk/gothic rock band, with singles such as \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", before breaking mainstream in the United States in the late 1980s as a hard rock band with singles such as \\"Love Removal Machine\\" and \\"Fire Woman\\". According to music critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, the band fuse a \\"heavy metal revivalist\\" sound with the \\"pseudo-mysticism ... of The Doors [and] the guitar-orchestrations of Led Zeppelin ... while adding touches of post-punk goth rock\\". Context: With the same line-up still in place, the band released The Cult in October 1994, produced by Bob Rock. The self-titled 'Cult' album is commonly referred to as the 'Black Sheep' album by fans of the group. Astbury referred to the record as \\"very personal and very revealing\\" songs about his life, with the subject matter ranging from sexual abuse at the age of 15, to the death of Nigel Preston, to his directionless years spent in Glasgow in the late 1970s. The record achieved little success, only reaching No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK. Duffy remarked that he thought that the record wouldn't sell well due to the offensive lyrics. The record went to number one in Portugal also, but quickly dropped out of sight. The single \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" was released with the band going on tour in support of the new album. Only one more single, \\"Star\\", was officially released with a live appearance on UK TV show The Word. \\"Star\\" began life in 1986 as \\"Tom Petty\\" and was recorded at the \\"Sonic Temple\\" demo sessions as \\"Starchild\\", being dropped by the band during rehearsals. In 1993 the song was resurrected and was finally completed for the record in 1994 as, just simply, \\"Star\\". When the band began the Beauty's On The Streets tour in winter 1994, they augmented the line up with James Stevenson on rhythm guitar. As with the Ceremony record several years earlier, no other official singles were released, but several other songs were released on a strictly limited basis: \\"Sacred Life\\" was released in Spain and the Netherlands, \\"Be Free\\" was issued in Canada and France, \\"Saints Are Down\\" was issued in Greece, but none of the songs gained much commercial success. During this tour, the Cult made their first ever appearance in Norway. Question: Did it sell very well? Answer:","completion":"The Cult's self-titled album, released in October 1994, did not achieve significant commercial success. It only reached No. 69 in the US and No. 21 in the UK charts. Although the album did peak at number one in Portugal, it quickly faded from the charts. The singles released from the album, \\"Coming Down (Drug Tongue)\\" and \\"Star,\\" as well as some limited-release tracks, also did not gain substantial commercial success. Guitarist Billy Duffy even commented that he believed the record would not sell well due to its offensive lyrics.

Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment of the tweet \\"It is my birthday in 1 and a bit days!\\" can be analyzed based on the textual content and the associated emotional expression. Sentiment analysis is a way of computationally identifying and categorizing opinions expressed in a piece of text to determine the writer's attitude towards a particular topic or the overall contextual polarity of a document. In this case, the tweet is expressing something related to a personal event that is generally considered positive and celebratory - a birthday. The author of the tweet mentioned their birthday as happening \\"in 1 and a bit days\\", indicating anticipation and positive forward planning. Consequently, the sentiment of this tweet could largely be categorized as positive. The user seems excited, probably thrilled on the occasion of their upcoming birthday. These emotions are typically associated with positive sentiments. \\"Birthday\\" instances are generally linked with celebration, pleasure, and joy, which are undeniably positive sentiments. The usage of explanation mark at the end of the tweet further strengthens the positive sentiment as it is usually associated with expressing excitement, surprise, or joy. However, without additional context or knowledge about the tweeter's personal feelings towards their birthday, we can't with absolute certainty predict the exact level of this positive sentiment. If the person enjoys their birthday, the tweet is most likely very positive. But if they do not, it could carry a more neutral or even negative sentiment. Yet, based on typical societal attitudes towards birthdays, the safe prediction would be positive sentiment. To sum it up, based on the content, tone, and context implied by this particular tweet, the sentiment can be interpreted as positive with overtones of anticipation and excitement towards the author's upcoming birthday."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

During the years 1940-1955, the rate of decline in the U.S. death rate accelerated from 2% per year to 8% per year, then returned to the historical rate of 2% per year. The dramatic decline in the immediate post-war years has been attributed to the rapid development of new treatments and vaccines for infectious disease that occurred during these years. Vaccine development continued to accelerate, with the most notable achievement of the period being Jonas Salk's 1954 development of the polio vaccine under the funding of the non-profit National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis. The vaccine process was never patented, but was instead given to pharmaceutical companies to manufacture as a low-cost generic. In 1960 Maurice Hilleman of Merck Sharp & Dohme identified the SV40 virus, which was later shown to cause tumors in many mammalian species. It was later determined that SV40 was present as a contaminant in polio vaccine lots that had been administered to 90% of the children in the United States. The contamination appears to have originated both in the original cell stock and in monkey tissue used for production. In 2004 the United States Cancer Institute announced that it had concluded that SV40 is not associated with cancer in people.

Summarize this article: Obama calls Boehner, urges him to allow vote on Senate payroll tax cut bill By Amie Parnes - President Obama called Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) on Wednesday and urged him to allow a vote on the two-month payroll tax extension, calling it \\"the only option\\" to ensure taxes don't go up. In a phone call made late Wednesday morning, Obama urged Boehner to take up the Senate's bill, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. In the call, Obama told the Speaker he was committed to working with Congress on extending the payroll tax for the entire year. He also reminded Boehner that \\"the short-term bipartisan compromise passed by almost the entire Senate is the only option to ensure that middle-class families aren't hit with a tax hike in 10 days and gives both sides the time needed to work out a full-year solution,\\" according to a White House readout. Boehner, however, urged Obama to call on Senate Democrats to appoint negotiators to a conference committee and said Republicans remain in Washington and are “ready to work,\\" according to a readout provided by an aide to the Speaker. “Let’s get this done today,” the Speaker told the president, the aide said. Boehner reminded Obama that the House was the only body “that had done what he asked for by providing a full year of payroll tax relief and extended unemployment benefits.” “He urged the President to call on Senator Reid to appoint negotiators so that we can produce a full-year bill by the end of the year that provides a tax cut of 1,000 rather than only 166,” the aide said. “The Speaker told the president that his conference was elected to change the way Washington does business and that we should not waste the next ten days simply because it is an inconvenient time of year.” The differences between the House GOP and the Senate, Boehner told the president, “are not so great that we cannot pass a full-year bill by December 31st,” the aide said. Responding to Boehner's remarks on the call, which became public in the middle of the daily press briefing, Carney stood his ground and restated the administration's position saying the \\"opportunity\\" to pass the Senate legislation \\"is there.\\" \\"Just take it,\\" Carney said. The spokesman added that the \\"sudden insistence\\" by the Speaker to pass a one-year extension \\"doesn't ring true.\\" Asked if there was a stalemate happening, Carney replied, \\"There is a stalemate in that the speaker will not act.\\" Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) chimed in late in the day, rifling off a letter to Boehner urging him and the GOP conference “not to walk away from the American people again.” “There is still time to call the House back and pass the short-term extension bill that received 89 bipartisan votes in the U.S. Senate,” Pelosi wrote. “I am hopeful that reason will prevail in your conference and that we can secure a bipartisan, long-term bill after the first of the year.” Obama also called Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) earlier Wednesday and \\"applauded\\" him for reaching the bipartisan compromise with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Carney said. In that conversation, Reid \\"reaffirmed his commitment to secure a bipartisan yearlong tax cut after the House passes the two-month extension,\\" according to the White House readout. \\"The ball is in the House's court,\\" Carney said, adding that they should \\"do the right thing and pass the bipartisan compromise.\\" \\"They should just get it done,\\" Carney said. Asked about Obama's plans to join his family in Hawaii, Carney said, \\"I don't have any scheduling updates to give you.\\" Obama left the White House Wednesday afternoon for a shopping trip in Northern Virginia. At the same time, Carney said that there would not be any more negotiating done. Obama \\"made clear\\" to Boehner that the House needs to take up the Senate bill. \\"The negotiating has happened already,\\" Carney said. \\"It is not at all the case that the president is saying, 'Here's what I want, and do it.' \\" — Russell Berman contributed. — This story was last updated at 3:58 p.m. ||||| “I have an 11- and 13-year-old at home, and I would love to be at home with them for the holidays and with my wife,” said Rep. Thomas Reed (R-N.Y.), one of the conference committee members. “But the American people deserve that we do our work and this Senate bill, 60 days, it’s just bad, reckless policy.” Boehner appeared to shake off the scathing editorial from The Wall Street Journal, which declared that the Republicans “thoroughly botched the politics” of the payroll tax cut debate and put President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats in a better position to win reelection in 2012. Text Size - + reset “We are the party of lower taxes for the American people,” Boehner said when asked about the editorial. “We have fought for lower taxes for the 21 years that I have been in this Congress, and we will continue to be the party of lower taxes. The fact is that we can resolve the differences between the two parties and give the American people a real Christmas present.” The Ohio Republican later added that it would be “helpful” if senators — both Republicans and Democrats — were in the Capitol to help negotiate a deal. But there were no signs — at least publicly, that the Senate is going to help. Several moderate Senate Republicans who are up for reelection next year have criticized House Republicans for not passing the Senate’s two-month extension. And on Tuesday, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) joined in, declaring that the tax cut fight was “harming the Republican Party.” “It is harming the view, if it’s possible anymore, of the American people about Congress,” McCain told CNN. “And we’ve got to get this thing resolved.” McCain also tweeted Wednesday morning that the Journal’s editorial page was “right on the mark.” And Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) — who earlier this week said Reid should call the Senate back to Washington to work out a deal with House Republicans — said in a Wednesday morning television interview that the Journal editorial was “right.” “One more public policy blunder, but just get it over with and move on because now it’s been framed as a tax increase, which it’s not,” Corker said on CNBC. “Probably at this point, the best thing to do is to figure out a way to get this behind us and move on and hopefully at some point, figure out a way to begin dealing with the real issues that our country needs to deal with.” Clearly sensing a political advantage on the payroll tax debate, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) told reporters on a conference call that Boehner’s decision to block a vote on the Senate bill was “backfiring.” “When the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal has turned on the top elected Republican in the United States, that tells you something,” said Schumer, who heads the Senate Democrats’ messaging operation. “It shows how quickly the politics and the substance of this issue have turned against the speaker.” Asked whether Democrats were engaging in partisan gamesmanship of their own, Hoyer — who earlier had called the GOP conference committee a “gimmick” and a “political charade” — pushed back. “This is democracy,” Hoyer said. “We’re not playing a game.” Scott Wong contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"President Obama called Speaker John Boehner and urged him to allow a vote on the two-month payroll tax extension, arguing it was the only option to prevent a tax increase.

Begin by gathering the necessary ingredients and kitchen tools. You will need fresh salmon fillets, cornstarch, olive oil or butter, salt, and pepper. For kitchen tools, you'll need a non-stick frying pan, a spatula, and a plate or tray for holding the prepared fillets. 2. Start by rinsing the salmon fillets under cold water to remove any potential scales or debris. Lightly pat the fillets dry with a paper towel, making sure you don't leave any paper residue. Place the fillets on the plate or tray. 3. Holding the fish over the sink, lightly rub it down with a thin layer of cornstarch. This can also be done by lightly sprinkling the cornstarch over each fillet. Be sure to cover both sides of the fillet. Give your fish a gentle shake to remove any excess cornstarch, as the layer should be very thin. The cornstarch will help seal moisture into your fish and help form a slightly crispy exterior when cooked. 4. Season your salmon fillets with salt and pepper to taste. 5. Heat the non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add a thin layer of olive oil or a small knob of butter to the pan, allowing it to melt and evenly coat the surface of the pan. 6. Once the pan is hot, carefully place the salmon fillets skin-side down into the pan. They should sizzle when they hit the pan. If the skin seems to stick, give it a minute more before trying to move the fillet, as it should release once the skin has had a chance to crisp. 7. Cook the salmon fillets for 4-5 minutes on the skin side. Once the skin is crispy and easily releases from the pan, flip the fillets over using a spatula. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes on the other side. This cooking time may vary depending on the thickness of the fillets. 8. After a total of approximately 7-8 minutes of cooking, the salmon should be opaque and easily flake apart with a fork. Remove the fillets from the pan and transfer them to a plate. 9. Serve your quick and easy salmon fillets with a side of your choice, such as a fresh salad, grilled vegetables, or a light rice dish. The fish will be perfectly cooked, moist, and slightly crispy on the outside. Enjoy your delicious meal!"},{"prompt":"Where is the nation of greece located?

Philae will be ejected towards Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko by its carrier spacecraft, Rosetta, on the morning of 12 November. If successful, it will be a historic first - no probe has ever soft-landed on one of these icy bodies before. Controllers at the European Space Agency's operations centre in Darmstadt, Germany, hope to get a positive signal from the robot at just after 1600 GMT (1700 CET). Until now, the chosen landing zone on the \\"head\\" of duck-shaped 67P has been known simply as \\"J\\" - a reference to its position on a list of possible destinations in the landing site selection process. The new name - Agilkia - refers to a patch of high ground in the Nile River south of Egypt. It is the place where ancient Egyptian buildings, including the famous Temple of Isis, were moved when their previous home, the island of Philae, was flooded during the building of the Aswan dams last century. Philae also refers to the obelisk taken from the drowned island which, along with the Rosetta Stone, was used to crack the meaning of ancient hieroglyphs. One hundred and fifty people suggested the name Agilkia in the competition, with a committee nominating Alexandre Brouste from France as the overall winner.

Mr Brouste will now be invited to Darmstadt's \\"mission control\\" to follow the landing event in person. Rosetta will be some 580 million km from Earth when it drops the piggybacked Philae over the comet. The descent is expected to take about seven hours. If the robot manages to latch on to the surface with screws and harpoons, it will begin a series of experiments to analyse the composition and structure of 67P. Its data, along with pictures, will be beamed up to Rosetta for onward transmission to Earth.

Background: Jahlil Okafor (pronounced ; born December 15, 1995) is an American professional basketball player for the Brooklyn Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played his freshman season of college for the 2014-15 Duke national championship team. Okafor was heavily recruited since before high school and had been at the top of the recruiting rankings for several years. He played high school basketball in Chicago, Illinois for Whitney M. Young Magnet High School, where he earned high school national player of the year awards from McDonald's, USA Today and Parade. Context: In October 2010, he successfully tried out for USA Basketball's 2011-12 USA Developmental National Team. In June 2011, he qualified for the 12-man United States team at the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship along with Simeon rivals Parker and Nunn. In the gold medal game, Okafor made all of his field goal attempts posting 18 points and 14 rebounds. For the tournament, his 46 rebounds over 5 games ranked him second on the United States team (to Aaron Gordon) and third at the Championships in rebounding. He was a member of USA Basketball's 12-man Team USA at the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship with Parker and Nunn again. His listed height was 6 feet 11 inches (2.11 m). At a two-game four-team preliminary exhibition tournament in Las Palmas, Canary Islands the week before the championship began, he was named tournament MVP. He was also named MVP of the 2012 FIBA Under-17 World Championship for the gold medal-winning United States team. Okafor posted 17 points and 8 rebounds in the gold medal game. Over the course of the tournament, he was the second-leading scorer with 13.6 points per game and second-leading rebounder for the United States with 8.2 rebounds per game. On May 21, 2013, USA Basketball announced the roster of 24 players, including Okafor, who had accepted invitations to the June 14-19, 2013, USA Basketball Men's U19 World Championship team training camp. The camp was used to select the 12-man team for the June 27 - July 7, 2013 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in Czech Republic. Okafor made the final roster that was announced on June 18. The team won the gold medal and Okafor made the All-Tournament team along with teammate and tournament MVP Gordon. He led the tournament with 77% field goal percentage, and he was the only player on the all tournament team who would return to high school. However, coaches Billy Donovan and Shaka Smart told him his weak link was his conditioning. Question: What other awards did he receive during his career?

Answer: Answer:","completion":"After examining the given product review with the title \\"Religious nonsense\\" and the contents of the review, it is evident that this is a negative review. The reviewer is expressing their dissatisfaction with the book they are reviewing (presumably a religious text or Bible) and suggests that the reader should instead spend their money on books authored by Sam Harris, Christopher Hitchens, and Richard Dawkins. These three authors are well-known for their critical views on religion and the promotion of atheism and secularism in their writings. There are several indicators in the review that denote a negative tone and opinion. Firstly, the title \\"Religious nonsense\\" conveys a negative sentiment and implies that the reviewer deems the content in the book to be without value or merit. Secondly, the explicit suggestion to not buy the book or any other \\"Bibles\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's negative position on the matter. Next, the comparison made by the reviewer between the religious text and the works of the aforementioned authors further supports their negative opinion, as they believe that readers will be \\"much better off\\" by opting for the latter. In general, the review does not present any positive statements or aspects about the product being discussed.

Rafael sees his father Nino (HÃ©ctor Alterio) frequently but his friends rarely. He's fielding offers to sell the restaurant he runs in Buenos Aires, but changes his mind because it was started by his mother and father and has been in the family for years.

One day, Rafael suddenly suffers a heart attack and, as he recovers in the intensive care unit, he is forced to reevaluate his life and decide his priorities. He now wants to sell the restaurant and move to southern Mexico and raise horses. At the same time his father wants to remarry his wife because they were never married in the Catholic Church.

The majority were built between 780 CE and 860 CE, even though the civilisation that created them existed for many centuries. Hypothesis: Hundreds of ancient stone religious monuments lie on the island of Java. There were too many of them.","completion":"To draw a hypothesis from the given context, let's look at the key information provided and analyze it step-by-step. Step 1: Identify key points in the context: 1. Hundreds of ancient stone religious monuments (candi) exist on the island of Java. 2. They date from the early classical period of Javanese civilisation (8th to 9th century CE). 3. The majority were built between 780 CE and 860 CE. 4. The civilisation that created them existed for many centuries. Step 2: Analyze the points for potential hypotheses: Point 1 tells us that there are many ancient stone religious monuments in Java, but it does not necessarily imply that there were \\"too many\\" of them, so drawing a hypothesis on the number of monuments being excessive would require more information or a clearer understanding of what is considered \\"too many.\\" Point 2-4 provide information about the time period and the civilisation that created these monuments, but does not provide information on the number (too many or too few) of such monuments. Step 3: Draw a hypothesis based on the above analysis: Since the context does not explicitly state that there were \\"too many\\" ancient stone religious monuments on the island of Java, the hypothesis that can be drawn from the context is not directly linked to the excessiveness of the number of monuments. A more appropriate hypothesis based on the given context may be: Hypothesis: Hundreds of ancient stone religious monuments lie on the island of Java, reflecting the cultural and religious significance of the classical Javanese civilisation during the 8th to 9th century CE."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Things to Come is an historic film. Along with Metropolis (1927), it stands as one of the first great science fiction spectacles. It is also one of the first doomsday movies. It is remarkable how the filmmakers predict the start of the Second World War within a year, and even, in a subtle way, the year it would end in the real world. But then the film departs from reality, depicting a world ravaged by war (only substitute poison gas for nuclear weapons which of course did not exist in 1936). The last half hour of the film is an incredible sight, making groundbreaking use of models and matte paintings -- later to become staples of the science fiction genre. It is sad that, after Things to Come, Sci-fi would become identified with cheaply made b-movies, a stereotype that wouldn't be broken until 2001:A Space Odyssey more than 30 years later. If they'd stuck with the quality of the effects in this film, things would have been very different in Hollywood. Raymond Massey and some of his co-stars play multiple roles in this film, to good effect. Massey plays a great \\"Doctor Who\\"-like role as a pilot from an advanced (for 1970) civilization who tries to win over the populace of a devastated country ruled by a simple-minded warlord (a very effective performance by Ralph Richardson). Ultimately, the storyline covers 100 years. But that's a big problem with this film -- there really isn't a cohesive storyline. Perhaps in such an episodic film -- somewhat reminiscent of Intolerance, actually -- it's hard to have a conventional plot, but I felt more could have been made of the material, and although the visuals in the final third of the picture are indeed stunning and worth the price of admission ... the plot is nonexistent and the movie itself suddenly ends just as it is getting interesting. Maybe the producers were thinking of another future sci-fi innovation: a sequel? Things to Come is a film every serious sci-fi buff should see at least once. Unlike Metropolis, however, it might not bear repeated viewings.

I went back to return them yesterday, and had my head chewed off by a French lady that claimed to be the owner of all Paris Optique locations. I simply said I wanted a refund when they asked if I wanted store credit or an exchange... I explained what had happened and the lady continued to cut me off, talk down to me, and be downright rude beyond anything I have ever experienced from anyone in retail or the service industry in my life. I found plenty of stories like mine online when I googled Paris Optique, including one that said how the French lady made her 9 year old cousin cry in the store!

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. I am facing a new situation today: John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would patient B see nearby objects clearer or blurrier than patient A? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the new situation provided, patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A. To understand why this is the case, let's review the information about hyperopia mentioned in the background article. Hyperopia, or farsightedness, is a condition where an individual can see distant objects clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. This occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal, causing images to be focused behind the retina rather than directly on it. Convex lenses can be used to correct hyperopia by focusing the images farther forward in the eye, allowing them to fall on the retina and produce a clear image. Now, let's consider the new situation with John, the ophthalmologist, and his two patients. Patient A has been diagnosed with hyperopia, which means they have difficulty viewing nearby objects clearly, causing these objects to appear blurry. On the other hand, patient B does not have any issues with their eyes, suggesting that their vision is normal and they can see both distant and nearby objects clearly. Consequently, patient B would see nearby objects clearer than patient A because patient B does not have hyperopia and can therefore view objects at close range without blurriness. Patient A, who has hyperopia, would require corrective lenses or other interventions to achieve the same clarity for nearby objects as patient B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Peter O'Toole is a treat to watch in roles where the lines he speaks are good and offer a chance for him to swagger in drunken stupor. The lovely Susannah York provides a good foil for O'Toole's dramatic presence. The film alludes to incest--without a single explicit scene--but it is able to entertain the viewer in its raucous social commentary. Though this is not major film by any reckoning, it will be remembered for its entertaining performances. Even York, signing the papers at the end, is a treat to watch, exuding tragedy silently. The possible weakness here is Thompson's laid-back direction. But the film floats because of the actors and the script.

Context: There was a boy named Chan who loved his parents, though they did not love him back; he was not even given a first name. He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs. Question: What is Chan's father's job? Options: A. pet food factory B. not enough information C. gardening tools factory D. sweets factory Answer:","completion":"B. not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which British liner was sunk by a German submarine in 1915?","completion":"The British liner that was sunk by a German submarine in 1915 was the RMS Lusitania. The sinking of the Lusitania is a significant event in maritime history, as it played a crucial role in influencing public opinion during World War I and contributed to the United States' decision to enter the conflict. Launched in 1906, the RMS Lusitania was an ocean liner operated by the Cunard Line. The ship was built by John Brown and Company at its shipyard in Clydebank, Scotland. The Lusitania, alongside its sister ship RMS Mauretania, was known for its speed and elegance. The vessel was designed to carry a total of 2,198 passengers and 850 crew members and boasted a range of luxurious facilities. In the early stages of World War I, Germany faced a naval blockade implemented by the British Royal Navy. The blockade limited Germany's access to essential resources and supplies, which in turn caused severe economic and social repercussions. German U-boats – submarines – were deployed to counteract the blockade and target both military and civilian vessels. On May 7, 1915, the RMS Lusitania, captained by William Thomas Turner, was on a voyage from New York to Liverpool. The ship was carrying 1,959 passengers and crew members, along with a cargo that included munitions and other military supplies for the British war effort. As the Lusitania approached the southern coast of Ireland, it was spotted by a German U-boat, the U-20, commanded by Kapitänleutnant Walther Schwieger. The U-20 fired a single torpedo, which struck the Lusitania on its starboard side. The impact triggered a secondary explosion within the ship, causing considerable damage. The vessel began to list and sink rapidly. As a result, lifeboats were either unreachable or capsized when they hit the water, and many passengers and crew members ended up in the frigid ocean water. The Lusitania sank in less than 18 minutes, with 1,198 people losing their lives in this tragic event. This included 128 American passengers, sparking outrage in the United States. The rapid sinking of the ship is attributed to the explosion of the ship's cargo of munitions, a fact that the British government denied during the investigations that followed. The sinking of the RMS Lusitania became a significant propaganda tool for both Britain and Germany. The British government used it to gather support from neutral countries like the United States, emphasizing the German attack on civilians and noncombatants. Germany, on the other hand, defended its actions stating that it had issued warnings to the civilians through the American newspapers not to board the Lusitania. Initially, the United States pursued diplomatic efforts to address the loss of American lives, and President Woodrow Wilson sent a series of notes to the German government, demanding reparations and an end to submarine warfare against non-military vessels. Germany agreed to modify its naval strategy, temporarily calming the situation. However, the sinking of the Lusitania did have long-term effects on the American public's sentiment towards Germany and played a part in the United States' decision to enter the war in 1917, following Germany's resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare and the disclosure of the Zimmermann Telegram. The tragic case of the RMS Lusitania remains a stark reminder of the devastating effects of warfare on civilian lives and the power of public opinion during times of global conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hindsholm was incorporated into the new Odense county , while the majority of the former province was merged with Tranekær County and was renamed to Svendborg County . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, these sentences convey the same meaning, although with some slight differences in phrasing. Both sentences indicate that Hindsholm was incorporated into the new Odense County, while the majority of the former province was merged with Tranekær County, resulting in the renaming to Svendborg County. To further break down the similarities and differences between the sentences, let's examine each of their components: 1. Both sentences begin with the mention of \\"Hindsholm,\\" indicating that it is an integral part of the subject: - In the first sentence: \\"Hindsholm was incorporated...\\" - In the second sentence: \\"Hindsholm was incorporated...\\" 2. The next section of both sentences describes the incorporation into the new Odense County: - In the first sentence: \\"...into the new Odense County...\\" - In the second sentence: \\"...into the new Odense county...\\" Note that the only difference here is the capitalization of \\"County\\" in the second sentence, which is a minor detail and doesn't impact the overall meaning. 3. The \\"while\\" conjunction is used in both sentences to provide context on what happened to the rest of the former province: - In the first sentence: \\"...while the bulk of the former province...\\" - In the second sentence: \\"...while the majority of the former province...\\" Both \\"bulk\\" and \\"majority\\" imply the same thing – a substantial or main part of the former province. 4. The final portion of the sentences indicates the merging with Tranekær County and renaming to Svendborg County: - In the first sentence: \\"...was merged with Tranekær County and renamed to Svendborg County.\\" - In the second sentence: \\"...was merged with Tranekær County and was renamed to Svendborg County.\\" The extra \\"was\\" in the second sentence may make it seem slightly different, but it does not alter the intended meaning of the sentence. In conclusion, both sentences convey that Hindsholm became a part of the new Odense County and that the former province's remaining territory merged with Tranekær County before being renamed to Svendborg County.

Write a summary based on this article: Author E. L. James arrives for the screening of the movie 'Fifty Shades of Grey' at the 65th Berlinale International Film Festival in Berlin February 11, 2015. NEW YORK E.L. James, the British author of the hugely successful \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" erotic novels, is celebrating the fictional birthday of her famous male character on Thursday with the release of her new book, \\"Grey,\\" which looks set to be an instant bestseller. Publisher Vintage Books said demand for the novel, told from the viewpoint of business tycoon Christian Grey, has been consistent with the other books in the trilogy, which have sold more than 125 million copies worldwide. Vintage, a division of Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, plans to have 1 million copies ready for sale in bookstores on Thursday. \\"Grey\\" has been the top Kindle pre-order book of 2015 on Amazon, and sales are expected to soar when the ebook is released at midnight on Wednesday. The book will also be published in Britain and in audio and Spanish-language versions. \\"It is the highest pre-order of the year,\\" said Sara Nelson, editorial director at Amazon.com. \\"I would be very surprised if it is not a bestseller.\\" \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is the all-time best-selling Kindle title. James announced the surprise launch of the book earlier this month in one of the best-kept secrets of publishing. She was prompted to write it by fans who had asked her to tell Grey's side of the story of his erotic relationship with virginal college student Anastasia Steele. \\"Christian is a complex character,\\" James said when she announced the book's release date on the Instagram social media network, \\"and readers have always been fascinated by his desires and motivations.\\" Grey is a handsome, 27-year-old self-made billionaire with a troubled past who lives and works in an ordered world that becomes unsettled when he meets Steele and introduces her to kinky sex, sadomasochism and bondage. In \\"Grey\\" James will give her millions of avid fans Grey's take on his relationship with Steele and his thoughts and insights. \\"Books like this always have an appeal,\\" said Amazon.com's Nelson. The first book of the trilogy was turned into an R-rated film by Comcast Corp-owned Universal Pictures starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, grossing more than 500 million at the global box office since its February release. Several countries, including India, Malaysia, Indonesia and Kenya, banned the film from their theaters because of its erotic content. Critics said the movie blurred the lines between healthy and harmful sex. Film adaptations of the second and third books are also planned. ||||| EL James’ new book Grey is the raunchiest yet. It tells the love story from the kinky mind of power-hungry heartthrob Christian Grey. In the first review of Grey: Fifty Shades of Grey - as told by Christian - one thing is clear: there’s absolutely nothing vanilla about this book. After weeks of breathless anticipation, Fifty Shades of Grey fans are today at last able to get their hands on a copy of E L James’ saucy new sequel. The wait alone has had fans in a fluster. Suspense was so great that Kent Police were even called in over fears one of the manuscripts had been stolen last week. But the Mirror finally got their hands on one of the very first copies - and say it’s definitely worth the palm-twitching wait. Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan attending the UK premiere of Fifty Shades of Grey The original Fifty Shades of Grey trilogy tells the tale of attractive-but-troubled billionaire Christian Grey who woos innocent student Ana Steele into his adventurous world of S&M. The trilogy sold 125 million copies worldwide since 2011, was translated into 51 languages, revolutionised countless sex lives, and transformed Jamie Dornan into Hollywood’s hottest man with the movie making £318m at the box office. Dominic Lipinski/PA Wire Sam Taylor-Johnson, Jamie Dornan, Dakota Johnson and E L James attending the UK premiere James’ characteristic internal monologues provide a direct line into Christian’s mind, revealing his deepest, darkest desires... and they don’t disappoint. Ana’s self-deprecating irony, her timidity and – later - her growing self-assurance in the face of overbearing Christian were what made us fall in love with her in the first three books. REAL LIFE LOVE: Dakota Johnson and her Welsh boyfriend look back on track But Christian has no problem naming exactly what he wants and how he wants to do it. “She can’t even say ‘f***’ or sex,” he observes in the early pages of this new novel. Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey The book continues in this harder, coarser, more direct attitude, putting paid to any criticism that books are “light” erotica or “mummy porn”. And in case we didn’t guess already, Christian Grey is a man who isn’t afraid of strong language and his fantasies - shared in all their explicit details - spell out exactly what he’s after. Most are too rude to repeat in a family newspaper, but to give you an idea, in one mundane conversation, Christian breaks off to share a daydream about Ana, a “peeled ginger root” - that’s definitely not being used for cooking - and her being “shackled” to his bench. You get the picture. The cover of the new book But it’s not just Christian’s dirty mind that’s being exposed in Grey. For the first time we find ourselves privy to his emotions. The story is punctuated with dreams and flashbacks alluding to his troubled childhood and the nightmares he still suffers. Through these, and his attempts to analyse his feelings for Anastasia Steele , we learn that he is caught in a constant battle with his insecurities. Try as he might, he can’t suppress the conviction that deep down, he doesn’t deserve to be loved. And as we suspected from the first trilogy, it’s really because he’s frightened of his own strong feelings, he turns to BDSM as a means of “taming” his desires. Ana and Christian MORE: If Fifty Shades of Grey had been set in Wales “Maybe this will stop if I fetter, f***, and flog her,” he says of his growing affection for Ana. Grey shows a development from the previous books in more ways than one. While action-hungry fans will be thrilled by the more graphic sex scenes, romance lovers will finally get the answers they’ve been craving. Fifty Shades of Grey author E L James In peeping into the mind of the mysterious Mr Grey, we learn that his desire for her submission is less about his own control as it is wanting to be loved and trusted, and accepted. Does that make him less attractive? Hell no. In fact I think we’re all about to fall just a little bit more in love... ||||| The fourth book in EL James’ erotic series is told from the male protagonist’s point of view, taking us beyond the red room to Christian Grey’s f-f-f-feelings Christian has some serious childhood issues But we knew that already, right? The fourth novel of the bestselling erotica series of all time – wait, make that the bestselling ebook on Kindle full stop – opens with a dream sequence featuring three toy cars and Grey’s anatomy, I mean Mommy. It reads like a Ladybird book. Even Christian is confused when he wakes up. “What the hell was that about?” he asks himself, in a possible foreshadowing of reader reactions. New Fifty Shades of Grey novel puts Christian Grey centre stage Read more But he may have good reason to be messed up No spoilers here. Suffice to say that Christian’s “crack whore” mother, as he referred to her in the earlier books, does have a dark past. Christian can Facebook stalk with the best of us Before he visits Anastasia Steele at the Portland hardware store where she works, he confesses to having run a “background check” to find out whether she’s attached. “I’m now behaving like a stalker,” he has the good grace to admit. But where does his mind jump when he discovers there’s no boyfriend? “Sexual orientation unknown – perhaps she’s gay.” The billionaire does have a charitable conscience While there’s always been a Chandler Bing vibe to Christian (does anyone actually know what he actually does in his job?), the fourth book continues to plug his charity work. There are no fewer than 11 mentions of “the Darfur project” in Grey. Believe us. We searched for them. Ebooks are handy like that. Christian Grey resolves to ‘fetter, fuck and flog’ his new love interest. Photograph: PR Christian’s internal monologue is alliterative In an attempt to beat down his growing fuzzy feelings for Anastasia, he wonders: “Maybe this will stop if I fetter, fuck and flog her ... and not necessarily in that order.” Who doesn’t like a good F word, eh? He really, really hates the housemate We know Ana’s mate Kate is none too keen on her friend’s fella, but in Grey we learn just how mutual that disdain really is. “Fuck you, Kavanagh” is the least of it. The words “persistent”, “tenacious” and “shrieking like a harpy” come up a LOT. EL James has not given up on love (of cliches) “Anastasia, I’ve told you. There’s something about you. I can’t leave you alone. I’m like a moth to a flame.” Despite some literary crossover in terms of sex-crazed male protagonists, we take it Martin Amis is probably not a James fan. She had no choice about writing this novel. Or did she? “This book is dedicated to those readers who asked … and asked … and asked … and asked for this,” writes the author in the acknowledgements of Grey. “You rocked my world.” Has James taken Anastasia’s submissive tendencies to heart? We live in an an age where it’s OK to say no, Erica. ||||| FILE - This file image provided by Vintage Books shows the cover of the new book, \\"Grey,\\" the fourth novel in E L James' multimillion-selling \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" erotic series.

And that's only page five of the fan-anticipated \\"Grey,\\" out Thursday from EL James and her grateful imprint, Vintage Books. Starting with a nightmare flashing back to Grey's rough childhood, James soon gets down to BDSM business as she plows through the familiar story laid out in her first book, \\"Fifty Shades of Grey,\\" only this time she tells it from the hunky billionaire's perspective rather than that of the young and innocent Ana. Flip just a couple more pages and Christian considers correcting Ana's now-famous clumsiness with the aid of a riding crop after she stumbles into his Seattle office to interview him for her college newspaper. Then he lusts after her inviting mouth after she does one of those things she's also known for: biting her lower lip in a way that drives him lustily nuts — nuts to punish her, that is. The new book was requested by fans, James said when she announced June 1 that \\"Grey\\" not only existed but would be out soon after — the book is being released worldwide at midnight local time on Thursday, timed to coincide with Grey's birthday. And she had mentioned in appearances as long ago as 2012 that she wanted to explore what turned into a massively popular erotic trilogy from Grey's point of view. James teased readers with a chapter featuring Grey's narration at the end of her third book, \\"Fifty Shades Freed,\\" and she had written through his eyes in 2010, as part of her episodic \\"Twilight\\" fan fiction when Grey was still Edward Cullen and James was still known as Snowqueens Icedragon. The new book is bereft of any true surprises, like so many other add-ons, but that won't matter much too hard-core fans of this hard-core romance franchise. In 2011, the trilogy's first volume set off a frenzy that had literati laughing at the former TV producer's writing skills but readers buying and sharing copies like crazy. In all, the three books sold more than 125 million copies around the world and spawned the first movie starring Jamie Dornan and Dakota Johnson, with at least two more planned. After the movies, do we really need Grey's little interior asides, \\"Maybe this could work,\\" for example? Is there anything we don't know about him already? He frets as he navigates his paranoid jealousy that other, younger boys in Ana's life might want her, too. He frets that she wants vanilla sex, rather than the kind involving implements in the playroom of his mansion. And he frets as he — the needy, damaged sex dominant — realizes it's been too long between submissives. Grey's self-loathing comes alive in predictable expletives — and predictable cliches as realizes his pull to Ana is \\"like a moth to a flame.\\" Meanwhile, in the Fifty fandom, \\"Grey\\" is the No. 1 pre-order of the year so far for Amazon's Kindle, though Harper Lee's \\"Go Set a Watchman\\" is tops for pre-orders on paper. And according to reports Down Under, frenzied fans in New Zealand were the first to get their hands on the book. James' scheduled whereabouts when the book lands Thursday is a stop to sign copies in New York at a Barnes & Noble store. Back on the British writer's freshest pages, our new narrator marvels at Ana's, er, oral skills after he relieves her of her virginity through traditional sex that he, too, has never experienced. But, as fans already know, he's not a hearts and flowers kind of guy and continues to lean on Ana to take his lifestyle for a spin. Grey doesn't have an inner god to match Ana's ever-present inner goddess, but he does have some unspoken thoughts to match the voluminous email the two pass between them as they do in the original book. He happily declares to himself, \\"Deal done, Grey!\\" when his fresh college graduate warms up to some BDSM and sex-toy shenanigans as her first taste of his world, for instance. James, in media notes accompanying the book, said of her fans that she thinks \\"Christian might have some surprises in store for them.\\" Really? To the very last drop of her retold story, Christian is just as he needs to be, at once gentle and rough, in need of control but compliant. And — SPOILER ALERT — ready to win his Ana back, leaving his creator free to write him another book or two. ___ Follow Leanne Italie on Twitter at http://twitter.com/litalie |||||","completion":"E.L.

Background: Sitting Bull was born on land later included in the Dakota Territory. In 2007, Sitting Bull's great-grandson asserted from family oral tradition that Sitting Bull was born along the Yellowstone River, south of present-day Miles City, Montana. He was named Jumping Badger at birth, and nicknamed Hunkesi, or \\"Slow,\\" said to describe his careful and unhurried nature. When the boy was fourteen years old he accompanied a group of Lakota warriors (which included his father and his uncle Four Horns) in a raiding party to take horses from a camp of Crow warriors. Context: From 1866 to 1868, Red Cloud as a leader of the Oglala Lakota fought against US forces, attacking their forts in an effort to keep control of the Powder River Country of Montana. In support of him, Sitting Bull led numerous war parties against Fort Berthold, Fort Stevenson, and Fort Buford and their environs from 1865 through 1868. Sitting Bull also made guerrilla attacks on emigrant parties and smaller forts throughout the upper Missouri River region. By early 1868, the U.S. government desired a peaceful settlement to Red Cloud's War. It agreed to Red Cloud's demands that the US abandon forts Phil Kearny and C.F. Smith. Gall of the Hunkpapa (among other representatives of the Hunkpapa, Blackfeet, and Yankton Dakota) signed a form of the Treaty of Fort Laramie on July 2, 1868 at Fort Rice (near Bismarck, North Dakota). Sitting Bull did not agree to the treaty. He told the Jesuit missionary, Pierre Jean De Smet, who sought him out on behalf of the government: \\"I wish all to know that I do not propose to sell any part of my country.\\" He continued his hit-and-run attacks on forts in the upper Missouri area throughout the late 1860s and early 1870s. The events of 1866-1868 mark a historically debated period of Sitting Bull's life. According to historian Stanley Vestal, who conducted interviews with surviving Hunkpapa in 1930, Sitting Bull was made \\"Supreme Chief of the whole Sioux Nation\\" at this time. Later historians and ethnologists have refuted this concept of authority, as the Lakota society was highly decentralized. Lakota bands and their elders made individual decisions, including whether to wage war. Question: Was there any specific land areas they were fighting for? Answer:","completion":"Yes, during the period of 1866-1868, the land areas Red Cloud, Sitting Bull, and their respective tribes were primarily fighting for were the Powder River Country of Montana and the surrounding upper Missouri River region. They sought to retain control over their territory from the encroachment of U.S. forces and emigrant parties who were establishing forts, settlements, and infrastructure in these areas. The Treaty of Fort Laramie in 1868 was an attempt by the U.S. government to establish a peaceful settlement, but Sitting Bull did not agree to its terms and continued his opposition to forces in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thousands upon thousands of novels were published. Of those novels, very few are remembered today. However, there are exceptions ; the works of Jane Austen - Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility - for example. They achieved only modest success at first but grew and grew in fame and reputation. How did Jane Austen become so popular? Of course, the novels are romantic. Everyone knows the love story of Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett (in Pride and Prejudice), and how they overcome their own pride and prejudice to live happily ever after. The lovers are almost as famous today as Romeo and Juliet. But there is more to Austen's popularity than the fact that she wrote about love. The books are very witty and ironic , and show a great understanding of society and of people. Pride and Prejudice opens with what must be the most famous sentence in the English novel: \\"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.\\" The truth, of course, is the opposite: wealthy, unmarried young men are extremely attractive to young women. And women - especially penniless or near-penniless ones - are the subjects of Austen's tales. Women nowadays may be more equal to men than they were in Jane Austen's day. However, a sense that women still basically live in a world dominated by men ensures that Austen still has many keen readers. Answer: To analyze why Jane Austen's novels have such a lasting appeal.

Over the centuries, the living here has always been easy enough to attract a steady stream of immigrants. Bountiful food sources might have made Malaysia an inviting place for the contemporaries of Java Man — in 230,000 b.c. But thus far, the country's earliest traces of homo sapiens, found in the Niah Caves of northern Sarawak, are fragments of a skull dating to 40,000 b.c. On the peninsula, the oldest human-related relics (10,000 b.c. ) are Stone Age tools of the Negritos. These small, dark Melanesians are related in type to Australian aborigines and are confined today to the forests of the northern highlands. By 2,000 b.c. , these timid, gentle nomads hunting with bow and arrow were driven back from the coasts by waves of sturdy immigrants arriving in outrigger canoes equipped with sails. Mongolians from South China and Polynesian and Malay peoples from the Philippines and the Indonesian islands settled along the rivers of the peninsula and northern Borneo. They practiced a slash-and-burn agriculture of yams and millet, a technique that exhausted the soil and imposed a semi-nomadic existence from one jungle clearing to another. Families lived in wooden longhouses like those still to be seen today among the Iban peoples of Sarawak. Another unit was added on to the communal dwelling each time a marriage created a new family. Other tough migrants from the South Seas settled along the coasts — sailors, fishermen, traders (for the most part pirates) — known euphemistically as orang laut (sea people).

Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had...

Ratt is an American heavy metal band that had significant commercial success in the 1980s, with their albums having been certified as gold, platinum, and multi-platinum by the RIAA. The group is perhaps best known for hit singles such as \\"Round and Round\\" and \\"Lay It Down\\", tracks that ranked on Billboard's top 40 at No. 12 and No. 40, respectively, as well as other songs such as \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"You're in Love\\" and \\"Dance\\". The self-titled independent EP was well-received and brought the band to the attention of Atlantic Records which signed them. Ratt immediately started writing and recording their first full-length album. Out of the Cellar was released in March 1984 and was praised by both fans and critics. Pearcy's raspy yet bluesy vocals were noted for melding with the pyrotechnic guitar playing of twin leads Crosby and DeMartini, combining the then-prevalent Van Halen and Aerosmith-influenced bravado elements with the then-novel muted, staccato guitar-picking style of Judas Priest. Tawny Kitaen, who was previously in a relationship with Crosby, agreed to appear on the cover of their debut full-length album. She also appeared in their video for \\"Back for More\\" and on their EP from the previous year. The album scored much radio and MTV play with songs like \\"Round and Round\\" (which peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart), \\"Wanted Man\\", \\"Back for More\\", and \\"Lack of Communication\\". Their music videos exposed them to an excited teen audience first tuning into the then fledgling MTV cable network. Milton Berle's guest appearance, dressed in his Uncle Miltie drag character, in the video for \\"Round and Round\\" helped draw even more attention to the band. Out of the Cellar became a commercial success, going platinum many times over in the United States, as well as making Ratt stars at home and in the Far East. The album release was capped off by a successful world tour that saw the band sell out stadiums and arenas worldwide, sharing the stage with such acts as Billy Squier, Ozzy Osbourne, Blackfoot, Iron Maiden, Motley Crue, Twisted Sister and Lita Ford. Out of the Cellar is today widely regarded as the band's best work and a definitive moment in 80s heavy metal, while \\"Round and Round\\" scored at No. 61 on VH1's Greatest Hard Rock Songs Show.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.

Christopher has now pleading guilty to seven drug and firearm offences. 30-year-old was jailed for five years at Guildford Crown Court this week. Article:","completion":"Title: 30-Year-Old Epsom Resident Sentenced to Five Years in Jail Over Drug and Firearm Possession Subtitle: Police Discover Drugs Stashed in Kinder Surprise Eggs and Guns with Ammunition In an unprecedented crackdown against drug peddlers and illegal firearms holders, Surrey Police carried out a raid in Epsom, Surrey, leading to the arrest and sentencing of 30-year-old Warren Christopher. He has now been jailed for five years after pleading guilty to seven drug and firearm offences at Guildford Crown Court. The police operation took place in August, targeting Warren Christopher's residence in Epsom, releasing the information this week. The raid led to the discovery of illegal drugs hidden in an unusual and unsuspecting manner - inside colourful Kinder Surprise eggs. Besides the drugs, an array of firearms and ammunition were also confiscated from Christopher's home. Warren Christopher's decision to hide the drugs in the children's confectionery raised concerns, as this tactic could have far-reaching consequences for unsuspecting children who might come into contact with their toxic, unlawful contents. Following the raid, Christopher was charged with seven offences related to drug and firearm possession. The evidence against him was substantial due to the illicit arsenal uncovered during the search of his residence. On trial at Guildford Crown Court this week, Christopher pleaded guilty to all seven offences. The court sentenced him to a five-year prison term. This lengthy incarceration will serve as a lesson not only to Christopher but also to others involved in such illegal activities, sending a strong message that the authorities will not stand for drug dealing and firearm possession. The successful operation by Surrey Police demonstrates their commitment to upholding the law and keeping the community safe from such threats. This case, in particular, highlights the dangers of drugs, not only their circulation but also their devastating potential influence on young lives. Parents and guardians must continue to educate children about the risks of drug use and be vigilant about any suspicious food items or containers in their children's possession. Cases like these are a stark reminder that criminal intent can infiltrate the most seemingly innocent places. In conclusion, the arrest and sentencing of Warren Christopher serve as a testament to the continuous efforts of the Surrey Police in dismantling criminal networks and safeguarding the wellbeing of the community. The five-year jail term sends a strong signal that drug and firearm offences will not be dealt with leniently, and offenders will face the full force of the law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: We had a light bulb that stopped working and when a new bulb was placed it wouldn’t light up. We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

News article: Virginia’s first hemp crop in decades could signal new opportunity RICHMOND — Marty Phipps started a business this year selling an innovative type of bedding for horses and small animals — a shredded substance that absorbs liquids, resists microbes and cuts down on smell. But because the product is made with hemp, which is the same plant species as marijuana and is tightly controlled by the government, Phipps has to import it from Europe. He figures his costs are double what they would be if hemp were an ordinary crop grown locally. Virginia has joined a nationwide movement to change that equation. This year, for the first time in about 70 years, a group of Virginia farmers harvested a small crop of hemp. It was permitted strictly for research, but a growing chorus — including politicians on the left and right — is pushing to cash in on a versatile crop that can be put to thousands of commercial uses and bring back lost jobs. “It’s pretty ridiculous, actually,” that it’s taken this long, said Del. Joseph R. Yost, a Republican from Blacksburg who sponsored a bill in last year’s General Assembly to set up the hemp research program. “I represent a rural area in the southwest, and it’s viewed as possibly something that could help replace the tobacco industry and manufacturing industry.” Yost’s bill, and a companion measure on the state Senate side, passed unanimously. Another bill this year endorsed the industrial use of hemp. Three universities signed up to participate in the research program — Virginia Tech, James Madison and Virginia State — and the University of Virginia has joined for next year. Each school got seeds, which had to be ordered from European countries and then cleared by federal inspectors. Everyone involved with the research, professors and farmers alike, had to go through federal background checks to handle what is considered a controlled substance. Drug Enforcement Administration agents inspected the state’s seed laboratory. The teams planted about 37 acres on plots in six counties in June, then harvested it in October. Each university sent the state detailed reports of their findings, but the bottom line was pretty straightforward. “Overall, I think the researchers have a positive outlook on hemp’s potential in Virginia,” said Erin Williams, senior policy analyst for the state agriculture department. This is not to be confused with marijuana’s potential in Virginia, which is much slimmer. Hemp and marijuana plants look the same, but hemp has far less of the chemical — tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — that gives marijuana users a high. Experts say you would never plant the two together because they would cross-pollinate, and THC levels would plummet in the pot. Plus hemp is cultivated for its seeds; pot growers prefer that the plants put their energy into creating buds, not seeds. People get confused about the difference. Phipps, for instance, was making a delivery with his father in Loudoun County when a car full of young guys pulled up next to their truck. Seeing the name of the Charlottesville-based business painted on the side — Old Dominion Hemp — “these guys start saluting me and giving high-fives out the window,” Phipps said. “And my Dad’s like, ‘They kind of don’t realize this is animal bedding, do they?’ ” He would argue that federal law is similarly confused, that hemp does not belong in the same category as marijuana. It took a special provision in the 2014 federal farm bill to permit states to allow academic research of hemp cultivation. Now two bills are pending in Congress that would open the door to full-fledged agricultural and industrial use. Those bills have powerful supporters. Both Republican senators from Kentucky, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell, have urged passage. And Kentucky has been especially aggressive about exploiting the federal research loophole to rapidly expand cultivation, with almost 4,500 acres in production this year. Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), who represents the Harrisonburg area, has visited JMU’s research site and favors expansion. “Now it is time to move from research to commercial production in the United States,” he said. But Virginia supporters worry that the bluegrass state is getting a head start. “We could be way more aggressive the way Kentucky is being aggressive,” said Jason Amatucci, founder and executive director of the Virginia Industrial Hemp Coalition. Colorado is going even further, he said, challenging federal law by cultivating not just hemp but marijuana. “But Virginia does not choose to take that risk,” he said. Amatucci, 41, learned about hemp while working in his family’s boxwood business, which is based in Charlottesville. He formed the coalition in 2012 after becoming alarmed about the state of agriculture in Virginia. About 90 percent of Virginia farms are owned by individuals or families, but the average age for farmers is nearly 60, according to state data. As old cash crops such as tobacco continue to decline, owners of small farms need alternatives to thrive and to bring in new generations, Amatucci said. “We’re just trying to get hemp to be an option,” he said. After all, there’s already a booming market for hemp products. Americans spend more than 580 million annually on hemp-based goods, according to a report last year from the Congressional Research Service. Hemp is used in a variety of products, including fabrics, paper, construction materials, automobile parts and nutritional supplements. Much of the consumer money goes outside U.S. borders — hemp is an established crop in more than 30 other countries, according to the CRS report. It wasn’t always this way, of course. Hemp was a crucial product in Colonial-era America, where it was used in sails, rope, clothing, paper and other items. Supporters love to haul out quotes from Thomas Jefferson and other luminaries about the virtues of hemp. It was cultivated in this country through World War II but fell victim to postwar drug enforcement. The efforts to revive the crop in Virginia are somewhat ironic, said Yost, who aside from being a delegate is the executive director of the Giles County Historical Society. In 1619, the Virginia colony passed a law requiring farmers to grow hemp. “Hopefully, it’s making a comeback,” Yost said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"In Virginia, farmers have harvested a small crop of hemp for the first time in about 70 years. Although the crop was permitted strictly for research purposes, there is a growing movement to allow more widespread cultivation of hemp, which is related to marijuana but has a much lower content of the psychoactive chemical tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Hemp can be used for thousands of commercial applications, and could help replace lost jobs in areas such as tobacco farming.

Movie title: Homecoming Movie plot: An unnamed US president (whose appearance is modeled after Bill Clinton and whose voice is modeled after George W. Bush) is running for reelection during a divisive war, and one of his speech writers, David Murch (Jon Tenney), goes on TV to speak with talk show host Marty Clark (Terry David Mulligan) and strident right-wing sexpot (and Ann Coulter-like) Jane Cleaver (Thea Gill). Another guest is Janet Hofstader (Beverly Breuer), the Cindy Sheehan-like mother of a dead soldier, who demands to know what her son died for. Murch gets a bit teary-eyed and explains that he lost his older brother Philip (Ryan McDonnell) in Vietnam.\\"Believe me,\\" he tells the grieving mom, \\"if I had one wish, I would wish for your son to come back, because I know he would tell us how important this struggle is.\\" Cleaver is so impressed with Murch's handling of the situation that she takes him out for a drink later, picks his brain, and eventually seduces him. The Karl Rove-like Kurt Rand (Robert Picardo) interrupts their tryst, calling to let Murch know that the president plans to make his line part of his stump speech.Soon, the soldiers killed in Iraq do start returning from the dead, and it doesn't go the way Murch predicted. They are not back to feast on the living, but unhappily for the president and his supporters, they just want a chance to vote in the upcoming election. \\"We'll vote for anyone who ends this war,\\" one explains. The spin machine goes into overdrive, but the dead are determined to make their voice heard even going as far as one soldier killing Kurt Rand by acting out the zombie stereotype (gouging his eye and slamming his head into the table) when Rand tried to force him to sign an unwanted document by threatening the soldier's mother.While voting results are being counted during the election, people within the current administration decide to skew the results so the current administration remains in power. After the election results are broadcast, more soldiers begin to return from the dead - but not just ones...

Q1: Who was director of the museum featuring the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy? A:","completion":"The final exam question pertains to the director of a specific museum featuring the last sail-only warship. To answer this question thoroughly, it is essential to identify the exact warship being referred to. It's crucial to clarify that the USS Constitution is the last sail-only warship designed and built by the United States Navy which is still in existence, she is also the oldest commissioned warship afloat in the world. The USS Constitution is located in Boston, in the Charlestown Navy Yard, part of the Boston National Historical Park, and it is managed in partnership between the National Park Service and the United States Navy. Therefore, one could argue that the museum is managed by both entities, meaning there technically would be two people in charge – the superintendent of the Boston National Historical Park (responsible for the area the ship is located in) and the commanding officer of the USS Constitution (responsible for the vessel itself). The last recorded superintendent of the Boston National Historical Park was Michael Creasey. However, specific up-to-date knowledge can vary as positions often change over time and may be different today. As for the USS Constitution, she is still on the active roster of the US Navy, hence having a commanding officer. The commanding officer of the USS Constitution is traditionally a U.S. Navy Commander. As of this writing, the 76th commanding officer is Commander John Benda. However, the USS Constitution Museum, an adjunct and independently funded organization to the Historic Ship USS Constitution, has its own president. As of the time of writing, the president is Anne Grimes Rand. Given the nature of the question, it's difficult to pin down one individual who is the 'director' of the museum, as the duties referred to are spread across several entities and, therefore, several individuals. Therefore, the correct answer could be Michael Creasey or Commander John Benda or Anne Grimes Rand, depending on the exact context the question is being asked in.

The decor looked nicer than the furniture because the a). decor in the house was old.; b). furniture in the house was old.;","completion":"The decor looked nicer than the furniture because the furniture in the house was old. In this sentence, the comparison is made between the decor and the furniture of the house. The sentence aims to convey that the decor appears more visually appealing when compared to the furniture. The reason for this difference in appearance is given as the age of the furniture, which implies that it may be showing signs of wear, damage, or outdated style. Taking a more in-depth look at the elements involved in the sentence, we can observe the following: 1. Decor: The decor refers to the decorative elements that contribute to the overall visual appeal and styling of a space. These elements may include artwork, wall coverings, window treatments, lighting fixtures, and accessories. The decor often sets the atmosphere and mood of a space, reflecting the taste and preferences of the occupants. In the given sentence, the decor is characterized as \\"nicer,\\" which implies that it has a more pleasant and attractive appearance. This may be influenced by various factors, such as the colors, patterns, textures, and arrangement of the decorative pieces. 2. Furniture: The furniture refers to the movable items—such as chairs, tables, and cabinets—that fill a space and serve various practical functions. Furniture design can also be an essential aspect of the overall interior styling, as it can define the style, comfort, and utility of the space. In this sentence, the furniture is described as being \\"old,\\" which could indicate a few different things. It may mean that the furniture pieces were acquired a long time ago and have since become worn, damaged, or faded. Alternatively, it could imply that the furniture is of a dated design or style, incongruous with the current trends and preferences. Either way, the age of the furniture detracts from its aesthetic appeal, making it less visually pleasing compared to the decor. To summarize, the sentence ends with, \\"the furniture in the house was old,\\" as this part effectively explains the rationale behind the perceived difference in the appearance of the decor and the furniture. The decor, with its visually pleasing characteristics, is deemed nicer than the old, tired, or outdated furniture, creating a contrast between the two elements within the house."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: In the sixteenth century the State of Michigan had forests all over. But that has long been gone. Especially, in the state's northeast part the vegetation has been cleared in the twentieth century. Wooded areas were replaced by farm lands. All these farmlands were under heavy Irrigation. At one time, in the sixteenth century, plant species like elm and oak used to be plentiful. We still had some elms and oaks in the twentieth century, but they were not great many in number. Was the water table in increased or decreased level in northeast Michigan during sixteenth century? Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

You don't need to be a teenage boy to realize how scary girls can be. Girls know it too. Megan Fox plays a demonic cheerleader in \\"Jennifer's Body,\\" written by Diablo \\"Juno\\" Cody. Certainly Diablo Cody does. The Academy Award-winning \\"Juno\\" scribe proves as much in her second screenplay, a horror comedy about BFFs Jennifer (Megan Fox) and Needy (Amanda Seyfried). These bosom buddies have a relationship that stretches back to the sandbox. They're inseparable opposites: Jennifer is a babe, head cheerleader and a bit of a snot. Needy is nerdy, conventional and a soft touch. Except that when we first meet her, she's locked up in the local mental hospital, kicking back at the guards and muttering darkly about the murders that put her here. Looking back, she dates this disastrous turn of events to the day Jennifer talked her into seeing an up-and-coming indie band at the roadhouse. The gig ends in a deadly inferno that claims the lives of several schoolmates, then Jennifer drives off with the band for an al fresco after-party involving satanic rites and virgin sacrifice. She survives on a technicality, but shows up later that night at Needy's place covered in blood, barfing blue goo and craving fresh flesh. In the days after the tragedy the entire school seems to be suffering from post-traumatic stress. Only Jennifer seems unfazed by the community's second sucker punch: the gruesome fate of the star quarterback in the woods. What's a girl to do if her best friend turns into a heartless boy-eating demon? Needy cleans up the mess and hopes it's just a phase. The last time a horror flick tried for a distinctly female point of view the result was \\"Twilight,\\" which was more of a wan gothic romance than a chiller. Directed by Karyn Kusama, who made \\"Girlfight\\" and \\"Aeon Flux,\\" \\"Jennifer's Body\\" isn't anything like that. It's a much edgier, snappier, bloodier film, aimed primarily at young hipsters and horror fans -- plus anyone else curious to see Megan Fox get nasty. (That's got to include a sizable chunk of the audience, surely?) So smoldering hot that at one point she coolly sets fire to her tongue, Fox makes a convincing vixen, callously picking up victims whenever her luster begins to fade. It's not hard to imagine she can have anyone who takes her fancy -- even Needy is not immune to her charms. Ironically, though, Jennifer is really the needy one here, while her friend eventually finds the self-possession to stand up to her. Similarly, you might come for Fox, but it's Amanda Seyfried's expressive range and toughness that leaves a more lasting impression. The \\"Mamma Mia\\" starlet is destined for good things. iReport.com: Share your review of \\"Jennifer's Body\\" The bitingly smart, funny teen-speak is carried over from \\"Juno,\\" along with sharp pop culture references and a sassy feminist attitude, but the million-dollar question has to be: Is it scary?

The gore scenes come with weird little flourishes: Jennifer's mounting body count attracts a crowd of curious woodland creatures, sounding a sweetly sick echo of \\"Bambi,\\" and a climactic showdown is set in a spectacularly fetid abandoned swimming pool (don't they drain those things?). But the jokiness does tend to undercut the terror. I suspect the film will prove too freaky for \\"Juno\\" boosters, and could have used more straight-ahead scares and sustained suspense to appease the hardcore horror geeks.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. One simple and classy addition to your own stationary is the addition of letters, such as your initials, or maybe just the first letter of your first or last name. Using a linoleum block, you can make a nice stamp with your initials. You should be able to find all the tools for this stamp in a craft store. Sketch out your monogram or design it in a word-processing program. Trace a pencil over your printed monogram, then lay it face down on a linoleum block. Scribble over the block to transfer those pencil lines to the block. Use a linoleum knife to cut the shape into the block (deep, but not all the way through), then cut the monogram out of the block to create a stamp. Placing a picture or photograph on the front of a card can make more personal, especially if the picture has some meaning to both you and the recipient. Print out a picture of your choosing, and glue it to the front of a card. Your picture can be on any type of paper you would like, though you may want to avoid high quality glossy photo paper, especially if you are making a lot of cards, as it can be quite expensive. You can also add the look of a frame to your pictures by cutting out some colored paper and placing that underneath your picture. Different colors or adding more than one border gives you some flexibility in designs. Just make sure your picture doesn’t take up the entire front of your card so there is room for the border. Using bright green leaves you can find in nature, you can add a natural look to paper. Place the leaf on your paper with a lightweight white paper towel on top. Gently hammer the spot where the leaf is until you see the green soak through the paper towel. Pull off the towel, gentle remove the leaf from the paper, and let it dry. There are many different leaves out there which will give you many different kinds of greens. Go ahead and experiment with different types until you get a shade and shape that you like. To add a touch of color, you can add small squares of fabric to the front of your cards. Cut out a square of fabric, making sure it is not bigger than your actual card. Stich it to the card using sewing machine or sewing by hand. This will probably give you a bunch of cards that all look slightly different, rather than being uniform, unless you have a lot of some kind of fabric. This can also be a good way to get rid of excess fabric without just throwing it away. You can also add some slight scents to make your card stand out and be a pleasant surprise for the recipient. Take some cotton pads, and add a few drops of a scent you like, such as scented oils or perfume. Put the cotton pads at the bottom of a plastic container, then cover the pads with a piece of cardstock. Spread your stationary on top of the cardstock and close the top for 24 hours. You can repeat by adding more oil to the cotton pads to get a stronger scent. The cardstock is important because you don’t want the oils to get directly on your paper and damage it. All you want is the smell, not the liquid.","completion":"This article explains how to personalize stationary through techniques such as creating a linoleum block stamp with initials, adding meaningful photos, incorporating natural elements like leaves, attaching fabric squares, and infusing paper with pleasant scents."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

House of the Week | Great Falls manor for 6.5M Years ago, when the owner of this home in Great Falls visited the Homewood Museum on the campus of Johns Hopkins University, the national historic landmark made such an impression on him that it was his inspiration when he designed his home. Homewood Museum, which was built in 1801 by Charles Carroll Jr., is one of the nation’s best-surviving examples of Federal-period architecture, and that style is reflected in this 2004 manor. A wide stone driveway leads up to a stately portico with Corinthian columns and a limestone floor. A copper roof with brass snow birds, an elegant cornice and 11-foot double-hung windows with redwood shutters complete the magnificent facade. The evening rooms — the sumptuous library and formal dining room — are in the front of the house, an ideal placement for formal entertaining. The day rooms — the living room, family room and kitchen — are in the rear, which receives the most sunlight. “When you spend some time there, you are very comfortable,” said listing agent Bay Buchanan of McEnearney Associates. (Buchanan — a former U.S. treasurer, manager of older brother Pat’s three presidential campaigns and conservative commentator — made a career pivot a year ago and became a real estate agent.) The house “overwhelms you the first time you are there. But once you’re in the rooms, it’s very warm, very inviting. It’s a very livable, very friendly place.” For such a grand home, it has an unusual layout. Four of the bedrooms, including the master suite, are on the main level. The master bedroom and family room have glass conservatories attached to them. There’s also a sun room that’s drenched in natural light from the skylights. The spacious kitchen has an ornate tin ceiling, a feature that’s also incorporated into the bar downstairs. The 4,200-square-foot lower level is large enough that “you could have a daggone touch football game” there, Buchanan said. The wine cellar has room to store a vineyard’s worth of wine. The flat, five-acre lot abounds in trees and shrubbery, making the grounds well suited for outdoor entertaining. A 1,300-square-foot apartment above the four-car garage can be used for staff quarters or an in-law suite. The five-bedroom, 10-bathroom house is listed at 6.5 million.

They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil? Hint: Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. Answer:","completion":"Considering the situation of Bobby and Ned's gardens, it is clear that Ned's garden is currently experiencing flooding, while Bobby's garden remains unflooded. Based on the hint provided, we know that the diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is significantly slower in water than in air, which ultimately leads to hypoxic or anoxic conditions in the soil. Under such conditions, anaerobic bacteria thrive, especially among the roots. In Ned's garden, the flooding leads to a lower availability of oxygen, providing an ideal environment for anaerobic bacteria to multiply and prosper. These bacteria utilize alternative electron acceptors, such as nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds when oxygen is scarce, thereby altering the soil chemistry. On the other hand, Bobby's garden is not flooded, indicating better oxygen availability in the soil, which hampers the growth of anaerobic bacteria. In this case, the soil microorganisms use oxygen during respiration when the soil is drier. Thus, aerobic bacteria would dominate Bobby's garden, keeping the anaerobic bacterial population in check. It is important to note that aquatic plants and organisms, such as fish, have specific physiological adaptations to handle oxygen and salt variations in their environment. However, in the context of gardens, these specialized adaptations may not have a significant impact on the anaerobic bacterial population in the soil. In conclusion, based on the given information, it can be inferred that Ned's garden, which is flooded, is likely to have a higher concentration of anaerobic bacteria in its soil compared to Bobby's garden. This is primarily due to the reduced oxygen availability and altered soil chemistry caused by the flooding condition in Ned's garden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Checkered is the most traditional, but white is also popular. Lederhosen are a type of traditional leather or suede breeches with suspenders attached. They usually extend to or just past the knees. Authentic lederhosen can be quite expensive, so check out costume shops or go online for cheaper options. You can also mimic the look by selecting a pair of brown, black, or dark green knee-length pants. The pants should be fairly plain and not have many pockets.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

From 1974 until 1985, the band consisted of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, vocalist David Lee Roth, drummer Alex Van Halen, and bassist Michael Anthony. The band went on to become major stars, and by the early 1980s they were one of the most successful rock acts of the time. 1984 was their most successful album. Context: Van Halen's next lead singer was Gary Cherone, frontman of the then-defunct Boston-based band Extreme, a group which had enjoyed some popular success in the early 1990s. The result was the album Van Halen III. Many songs were longer and more experimental than Van Halen's earlier work. It was a notable contrast from their previous material, with more focus on ballads than traditional rock songs (\\"How Many Say I,\\" with Eddie on vocals). Sales were poor by the band's standards, only reaching Gold certification, despite the album peaking at No. 4 on the U.S. charts. However, Van Halen III did produce the hit \\"Without You,\\" and another album track, \\"Fire in the Hole,\\" appeared on the Lethal Weapon 4 soundtrack. The album was followed by a tour. The III Tour saw Van Halen playing in new countries, including first ever visits to Australia and New Zealand. Shortly afterwards, Van Halen returned to the studio and in early 1999, they started work on a new album. Working titles of songs included \\"Left for Dead,\\" \\"River Wide,\\" \\"Say Uncle,\\" \\"You Wear it Well,\\" \\"More Than Yesterday,\\" \\"I Don't Miss You ... Much,\\" \\"Love Divine,\\" and \\"From Here, Where Do We Go?\\". The project was left unfinished when Cherone left the band amicably in November 1999. Citing musical differences, it is likely III's poor sales and critical reception had a big impact. None of the material from these sessions has ever been released, and in fact the band released no new material at all until three new songs were included on the 2004 Best of Both Worlds compilation. Lyrics that Cherone had written for the Van Halen III follow up would be used in his next project with Tribe of Judah. Touring with Cherone had proven disappointing in terms of attendance. Eddie would later admit that \\"the powers that be\\" (Warner Bros.) had forced his hand in parting with Cherone. Unlike with the previous two singers, there was reportedly no bad blood behind the breakup, and Cherone remained in contact and on good terms with Van Halen. As when Hagar left, speculation resumed on a Roth reunion. Question: Did they ever do a live perforamce?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Van Halen did perform live with Gary Cherone as their lead singer. After the release of the album \\"Van Halen III,\\" the band embarked on a tour called the III Tour to promote the album. The III Tour marked a significant moment for the band as it was their first time performing in several new countries, including Australia and New Zealand. While the tour did take place, it was met with disappointing attendance, which is believed to be due to the poor sales and critical reception of \\"Van Halen III.\\" Despite the challenges faced during their live performances and tours with Cherone, the band maintained a good relationship with him, even after they eventually parted ways."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Question: What is the outer layer of the sun made up of? Answer: plasma Solution:","completion":"To come up with the answer \\"plasma,\\" I referred to the definition of the sun's outer layer. The sun is composed of several layers, including the core, radiative zone, convective zone, photosphere, chromosphere, and corona. The outer layers, specifically the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona, are primarily made up of a highly energized and ionized state of matter called plasma. Plasma is formed when gas atoms are subjected to high temperatures and pressures, causing the electrons to be stripped away from the nucleus. In this state, the gas-like substance consists of free electrons and positively charged ions. Since the outer layers of the sun experience extreme temperatures, they are mainly comprised of plasma. By understanding the definition of the sun's outer layers and the properties of plasma, I deduced that the correct answer to the question \\"What is the outer layer of the sun made up of?\\" is plasma, as it is the primary state of matter found in those regions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Unroll the fly tape and place one of the sticky ends against the ceiling to secure it in place. Allow the rest of the fly tape to hang down from the ceiling. Be careful not to touch it. The reason this choice is better is that flies usually fly at a certain level above the ground and tend to land in higher areas. By placing the fly tape near the ceiling, you are more likely to catch flies as they fly around in those areas. Choice (1) is not as effective because laying the fly tape on the floor only targets flies that land or crawl on the ground, which is less common. Also, laying the tape on the floor increases the risk of catching unwanted things like dirt, dust, and potentially harming small pets or being accidentally stepped on by people."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Skylar would always have all the latest video games ready. Skylar sounded like fun. Given that the answer to a question is \\"buy lots of video games\\", what is the question? Answer:","completion":"\\"What does Skylar do to always have all the latest video games ready and maintain a fun environment around?\\" The answer to this question points towards the act of buying lots of video games by Skylar. Skylar's hobby or passion seemingly revolves around playing video games and being updated with the latest ones in the market. Becoming a part of a video game's initial buzz when it is freshly released is a unique thrill for many gaming enthusiasts. Playing a new video game also offers a fresh experience as one can dive into unexplored territories, venture into new storylines, experiment with different game playing mechanics, and much more. Skylar, as it seems, takes great pleasure in these aspects of gaming and therefore ensures to have all the latest video games ready at their disposal. To do so, Skylar would presumably research upcoming releases, pre-order potential hits, and track release dates closely to purchase the games as soon as they hit the market. Skylar might also have a wide taste in games, spanning across different genres, platforms–from console to PC games, and styles–from large Triple-A studio games to smaller independent releases. This broad spectrum of interest would imply a larger number of games that Skylar could be interested in, therefore leading to frequent purchases. Importantly, buying lots of video games doesn't necessarily define fun by itself but the usage of these games, such as playing by oneself, hosting game nights, sharing with friends, or even reviewing or streaming them online could be the components that truly make this activity fun for Skylar. Hence their reputation of continuously having new video games to offer and provide entertainment not only for themselves but possibly for a group, making Skylar synonymous with fun video game experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Where does the biology teacher meet the former MMA fighter? Answer the above question based on the context below: Former Division I collegiate wrestler Scott Voss is a 42-year-old bored and disillusioned biology teacher at the failing Wilkinson High School. Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring. When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter. While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser. Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs.

In this case, we cannot determine that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence because we don't have enough information about what the person dislikes in the second sentence. They could be disliking a different aspect of the event mentioned in the first sentence or disliking another event or performance altogether.

Article: India now leads the world in smartphone growth. It saw a 55% increase in the number of smartphones in 2014. The number of Web users increased by 37%. Smartphones were the source of 65 % of its Internet traffic and 41 % of its e-commerce, according to a report by the analyst Mary Meeker, titled \\"Internet Trends 2015\\". India's Internet boom has started. Within three or four years, almost every adult in India will own a smartphone. They will be used to order goods, read news, monitor crop growth and so on. Indian adults will be very interested in these devices just as young Americans are. 87% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 who own smartphones say they never separate from these: \\"My smartphone never leaves my side.\\" Four out of five say that the first thing they do on waking is to reach for their smartphones. And three fifths believe that in the next five years everything will be done on mobile devices. In the business world, the rise of mobile platforms is dramatically transforming many industries all over the world. What Indian software developers have to do is to start thinking about solutions to old problems by using all the features of these new devices. They need to take advantage of the unique properties of smartphones and tablets. As Indian software developers and enterprises master the smartphone, they will be able to export their solutions to the rest of the world. This will make possible a new tech revolution that is greater than what created India's IT industry in the 1980s and 1990s. We can expect the rapid transformation of India when a billion people become connected and have equal access to information and services.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"Who was the leader of Prussia at the time?\\" Context: \\"The Treaty of Hubertusburg, between Austria, Prussia, and Saxony, was signed on February 15, 1763, at a hunting lodge between Dresden and Leipzig. Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector. The only concession that Prussia made to Austria was to consent to the election of Archduke Joseph as Holy Roman emperor.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"At the time of the Treaty of Hubertusburg, which was signed on February 15, 1763, the leader of Prussia was King Frederick II, also known as Frederick the Great. Born on January 24, 1712, Frederick II ascended to the throne on May 31, 1740, following the death of his father, King Frederick William I. Frederick II ruled Prussia during a period of significant expansion and military successes, transforming the nation into a major European power. Frederick the Great was a strong advocate of enlightened absolutism and made immense contributions to Prussian culture, politics, and the military during his reign. Besides being a skilled military leader, he was an accomplished writer, musician, and philosopher. He supported the arts and sciences and invited numerous philosophers and intellectuals, including Voltaire, to his court in Potsdam. During the specific context of the Treaty of Hubertusburg, Frederick found himself in a difficult position. This treaty marked the end of the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), a major conflict that involved most of the great European powers and their colonial empires. Prussia, allied with Great Britain, fought against a coalition including Austria, France, Russia, and Sweden. The war was fought not just for territorial gains but also to determine the balance of power in Europe. Following the treaty, the status quo of 1748 was restored. This meant that Frederick reclaimed his territorial conquests, such as Silesia and Glatz, which he had gained during the War of the Austrian Succession (1740-1748). However, this also meant relinquishing Saxony back to its own elector. The Treaty of Hubertusburg demonstrated Frederick's ability to effectively negotiate and maintain critical territorial gains, which were crucial for the future of Prussia. His unwavering determination and excellence in leadership allowed Prussia to rise to prominence in European politics. Under King Frederick II, Prussia established itself as a powerful and influential nation, laying the groundwork for its participation in the future unification of Germany in the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The key here is to be gentle — holding the dryer too close (or running it too hot) can absolutely wreck your boots. The parts you dry first will shrink the most, so start with the parts of the shoe that are loosest on your feet. If either boot is still too lose, spray and dry the boots again in the same way.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight - Question: suppose sealer is not applied to the wood happens, how will it affect The wind and water pick up less sediment. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"C: No effect To understand the relationship between applying sealer to wood and the process of sediment erosion and formation, let's first clarify what the question is asking. The question seems to be suggesting that when sealer is not applied to wood, it could affect the amount of sediment that wind and water can pick up. To answer this question, we must differentiate between the effects of sealing wood and the geological processes of sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition that lead to sedimentary rock formation. Sealing wood is a process used to protect wood surfaces from damage caused by water, moisture, and other environmental factors. By applying sealer, the wood is prevented from absorbing water, and it becomes more resistant to rot or decay. However, this preservation method is related to human constructions or crafts and not directly connected to sediment erosion or sedimentary rock formation. Now, let's break down the sedimentation process: 1. Wind and water erode rocks, which is influenced by natural geological forces and weather patterns. 2. The wind and water pick up the eroded sediment, forming sediment particles that are transported by these natural elements. 3. As sediment particles are carried away, they eventually settle in a new location, where deposition occurs. 4. Over time, multiple layers of sediment accumulate, with the older layers becoming compacted due to the pressure from the newer sediment layers above it. 5. This prolonged compression results in the formation of sedimentary rocks. Given the nature of this sedimentation process, whether or not sealer is applied to wood has no direct effect on the amount of sediment that wind and water pick up. Wood sealer is designed to protect wood from environmental damage, but it is not a contributing factor to the natural geological process involved in sediment erosion, transportation, and deposition. Therefore, the presence or absence of sealed wood in the environment will have no measurable impact on the sediment picked up by wind and water. In conclusion, the correct answer is C: No effect. Whether or not sealer is applied to wood does not influence the amount of sediment picked up by wind and water and is unrelated to the natural processes that lead to the formation of sedimentary rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches.

Chicago DEA agent John Hatcher returns from Colombia, where drug dealers killed his partner Chico. As a result of Chico's death and years of dead end work, John retires and heads to his family's home town of Lincoln Heights in suburban Chicago. He visits the local school to meet his old friend and former U.S. Army buddy Max who works there as a football coach and physical education teacher. As John and Max celebrate their reunion at a club, a gunfight breaks out between local drug dealers and a Jamaican gang at the venue. The gang, known as the Jamaican Posse, is led by a notorious psychotic drug kingpin named Screwface full of West African Vodun and sadism. John arrests one of Screwface's henchmen as the gunfight ends. News of Posse crimes occurring in Chicago and across the United States spread as the Posse expands its operations and recruits more members.

Question: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? As a rule of thumb, you should not take out so much in student loans that you will pay more than 10% of your monthly income post-graduation. Research the average salaries of the field that you would like to enter and divide by twelve to estimate your monthly earnings. Do not take out a loan that would require you to pay more than that per month. Student loans are typically considered a “good” form of debt, because college should increase your earning power enough to pay back the loans. Just be careful that your career choices are compatible with the amount of debt you might incur. Be cautious when taking out loans to attend a for-profit university. Tuition at these institutions is very high and their graduates have had difficulty obtaining jobs. One major chain of for-profit universities is currently being sued for its practices. Do not let student loans deter you from pursuing a degree in highly profitable fields like medicine. Tuition can be particularly high in fields that require postgraduate degrees, but the earnings are more than sufficient to cover student loans. When in doubt, closely and intensely study statistics for your profession of choice. If you are entering a postgraduate program, it should also be able to give you statistics on student placement. Ask for these to confirm that the program is competitive and that it will secure you a job commensurate with the average wages in the field. If you meet certain requirements for long enough, the remainder of your debt will be forgotten. Specific types of student loans, including Direct Loans, Federal Family Education Loans, and Federal Perkins Loans can be forgiven if you make 120 on-time payments while working for a public service organization. Such organizations include the federal, state, or local government and not-for-profits designated as tax-exempt by the IRS. Find an Employment Certification Form on the federal student aid website. Submit it annually to verify that you are meeting requirements for loan forgiveness. Employers are often willing to commit some money to paying off student loans in fields that require specialized skills, including tech, nursing, engineering or finance. You should raise the question when you and your employer are scheduled to discuss compensation. An example would be during hiring negotiations. If you are already working for a company, wait for your annual review. Expect to forego a higher wage and commit to work for the company for a set years of time in return for the student loan payment. This can be a mutually beneficial arrangement because it will save your employer money in wages over the long term, while shaving off interest on your loans. You can save money by claiming a tax deduction on interest paid for student loans. You cannot claim a deduction for the principal on your student loan. Call your lender to ask what portion of your payment was toward the interest on the loan and what was on the principal. You can only claim this deduction if your modified adjusted gross income as an individual was less than 75,000 or 150,000 as a couple. The deduction also only applies if the loan was taken out for educational expenses. Consult an accountant to verify that you qualify. This is an exception to the general rule that you should pay off high interest loans first. Private loans offered by banks are often “variable” loans, which means the rate of interest changes with the general circumstances of the economy. Right now, the interest you pay on these might be lower than what you pay on your federal loans. However, as the economy improves, these rates are likely to go up. Save yourself the risk of rapidly growing credit bills by putting whatever extra money you allocate to student loan repayment toward paying off your private loans. Summary:","completion":"This article advises not to take out excessive student loans, highlighting the importance of researching average salaries in the desired field, being cautious with for-profit universities, considering loan forgiveness programs, discussing loan repayments with employers, claiming tax deductions, and prioritizing private loan repayments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

There's magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping. The production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film. A baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. A homeless man brings him to a Shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read. The old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. The school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks. The new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night. The boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts. This leads to a big fight, the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation. Al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. Aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. The man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. The plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. I'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. The effects, photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot.

You always bought the same brands,usually the brands your mother bought. You didn't know about unit pricing,and furthermore,you didn't care. It never occurred to you to read the labels on anything. After all,you'd bought these things a hundred times. But now,I really look on those days with a feeling of yearn . How innocent we were! How carefree were those trips to the supermarket. No worries. Today a trip to the supermarket is filled with social influence. Every time I buy pork chops I think about the years I'm shaving from my life. I keep a careful eye on the freshness date and examine the tamper-proof packaging. I am victim of that most dangerous social disease:shoppers' panic. I didn't realize how serious my condition had become until the last time I needed laundry, soap. It seemed simple enough. Just run into the market,grab a box of the old reliable and pay for it. I hadn't planned on discovering Ecover,a new brand of laundry soap. It sat quietly on the shelf right next to my old reliable. \\"Healthy,gentle but effective. \\"My respect for it deepened with each new claim as I read the entire package. Then I looked at the price:5. 69 for 2 pound. 5. 69! I cast a quick glance at the old reliable,still on sale for1. 39. Six bucks for laundry soap! These people must be crazy! Who's going to pay six bucks for laundry soap? It's not as though I can't afford it. See,it's concentrated--use less,get more. BUT SIX BUCKS! And the box is made from recycled materials ...This act went on for a solid half hour,after which I left the shelf without any soap at all. Surely the meat department is most threatening place. Remember what protein was good for you? That's all over. Every bite you take kills you. I won't even mention meat's moral influence. When all is said and done,we still must eat.

Choices: - buffalo - fight for life - leave home - hunt for food - eating The rationale to choose \\"hunt for food\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"hunt for food. Step 1: Analyze the question and choices given. - The question is asking about an animal with sharp teeth. - The choices provided are: buffalo, fight for life, leave home, hunt for food, and eating. Step 2: Eliminate unrelated and incorrect choices. - The first choice, \\"buffalo,\\" is an animal and does not answer the question about what the animal does for dinner. - The second choice, \\"fight for life,\\" could be related to surviving but does not specifically answer what the animal does for dinner. - The third choice, \\"leave home,\\" does not have any direct connection with what the animal does for dinner. Step 3: Choose the most appropriate answer. - Among the remaining choices, \\"hunt for food\\" and \\"eating,\\" the most suitable answer is \\"hunt for food\\" because it directly addresses the question about what the animal with sharp teeth does for dinner. Step 4: Justify the chosen answer. The rationale to choose \\"hunt for food\\" as the answer is that it is the most relevant action for an animal with sharp teeth to perform during dinner time. Sharp teeth indicate that the animal is a predator, and predators typically hunt for their food. Additionally, \\"eating\\" is too general and does not provide any specific information about how the animal acquires its dinner. Therefore, \\"hunt for food\\" is the best choice in this context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.
