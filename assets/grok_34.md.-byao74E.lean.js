TORPENHOW was paging the last sheets of some manuscript, while the Nilghai, who had come for chess and remained to talk tactics, was reading through the first part, commenting scornfully the while. 'It's picturesque enough and it's sketchy,' said he; 'but as a serious consideration of affairs in Eastern Europe, it's not worth much.' 'It's off my hands at any rate.... Thirty-seven, thirty-eight, thirty-nine slips altogether, aren't there? That should make between eleven and twelve pages of valuable misinformation. Heigho!' Torpenhow shuffled the writing together and hummed-- Young lambs to sell, young lambs to sell, If I'd as much money as I could tell, I never would cry, Young lambs to sell! Dick entered, self-conscious and a little defiant, but in the best of tempers with all the world. 'Back at last?' said Torpenhow. 'More or less. What have you been doing?' 'Work. Dickie, you behave as though the Bank of England were behind you. Here's Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday gone and you haven't done a line. It's scandalous.' 'The notions come and go, my children--they come and go like our 'baccy,' he answered, filling his pipe. 'Moreover,' he stooped to thrust a spill into the grate, 'Apollo does not always stretch his---- Oh, confound your clumsy jests, Nilghai!'

Eine neue Epoche in der Ära Manson! . Also Leute, mir ist schon klar, dass einige von euch anfangs vielleicht etwas enttäuscht über das neue Album seid, wenn ihr den \\"gewöhnlichen\\" Manson-Stil, wie er z.B. auf Holywood zu finden ist, erwartet. Dennoch sollte man sich die Platte öfters anhören, denn beim 2., 3. Mal (so wars bei mir jedenfalls), wird man förmlich von der enormen Kreativität dieses Ausnahmekünstlers mitgerissen. Die Songs haben Tiefgang, die Texte sind wirklich sehr emotional und ehrlich und beschränken sich diesmal nicht wie früher auf \\"gesellschaftskritische\\" Äußerungen und religionsfeindliche Beschimpfungen, um es etwas softer auszudrücken. Das war ja auch der Stil, der ihn berühmt gemacht hat und genau das respektiere ich ja an Brian Warner,dass er macht, was er will und sein Ding beinhart durchzieht. Jedoch zeigt sich die Qualität eines Künstlers nicht nur durch ständiges Wiederholen des Stils, sondern dass sich der Artist ständig neuentdeckt, was Marilyn Manson hier wirklich grandios geglückt ist. Zur Platte selbst möchte ich sagen, dass ich der Aussage mancher hier zustimme, dass dieses Album poppiger und kommerzieller als seine Werke zuvor gestaltet ist, aber dennoch besitzen die Songs die alt gewöhnliche und Manson typische Eigenschaft, erst nach mehrmaligem Anhören so richtig zu gefallen, obwohl zwei bis drei Songs (wie z.B. \\"Heart-Shaped Glasses\\", \\"They Said That Hell's Not Hot\\" oder \\"Just A Car Crash Away\\") durchaus beim ersten Anhören schon auf Begeisterung stoßen werden. Ganz groß möchte ich noch die klasse Leistung von Tim Skold, dem Gitarristen und Studio-Bassisten von Manson, herrausheben, der die Abwesenheit von John 5 meiner Meinung nach mit Bravur ersetzt hat. Er ist nicht nur Ersatz für John, nein, er gibt der Musik durch wirklich hörenswerte und virtuose Soli ein ganz neues Gesicht. Doch auch der bekannte düstere Hintergrund ist immer noch vorhanden und ergänzt sich perfekt mit den teils poppigen Melodien. Die einzigartige Stimme Mansons, kombiniert mit dem völlige neuen Gitarrensound, setzt der neuen Stilrichtung noch die Krone auf. Ich kann nur raten: nicht beim ersten Mal Schlüsse zu ziehen, sondern geduldig öfters anhören und sich vor allem nicht vor all den Vorurteilen abschrecken zu lassen, die es über diese LP gegeben hat. Einfach zu Hause bequem machen, den CD-Spieler einschalten und sich vom neuen Gesicht dieses Genies beeindrucken lassen und schon bald werden die hitverdächtigen Songs ins Ohr des Zuhörers vordringen, in dem sie auch ( nach eigener Erfahrung) länger verbleiben werden!","completion":"POS"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

They both wear glasses and Kathy comments that she hates that she is so farsighted and wishes there was a surgery to fix it.

After completing his studies in law at the University of Padua, he attracted the attention of the Austrian police by his lectures on political economy, and was obliged to emigrate after starting a mutual aid society among gondoliers. In 1863 he obtained a professorship at the Milan Technical Institute; in 1867 he was appointed professor of constitutional law at Padua, whence he was transferred to the University of Rome. Gifted with eloquence and energy, he popularized the economic ideas of Franz Hermann Schulze-Delitzsch in Italy, worked for the establishment of a commercial college at Venice, and contributed to the spread of people's banks on a basis of limited liability throughout the country. Context: Appointed minister of the treasury in the first Di Rudini cabinet of 1891, he imprudently abolished the system of frequent clearings of banknotes between the state banks, a measure which facilitated the duplication of part of the paper currency and hastened the bank crisis of 1893 and the resulting Banca Romana scandal. A Parliamentary Commission that investigated the bank scandal concluded that former Prime Minister Francesco Crispi, Prime Minister Giovanni Giolitti, and Luzzatti, had been aware of the conditions of the Banca Romana but had held back that information. In 1896 he entered the second Di Rudini cabinet as minister of the treasury, and by timely legislation helped to save the bank of Naples from failure. Following the revolt and suppression of the Fasci Siciliani (1891-1894), Luzzatti introduced two measures of social legislation in 1898. The industrial workmen's compensation scheme from 1883 was made obligatory with the employer bearing all costs; and a voluntary fund for contributory disability and old age pensions was created. After his fall from office in June 1898, his principal achievement was the negotiation of the Franco-Italian commercial treaty, though, as deputy, journalist and professor, he continued to take an active part in all political and economic manifestations. He was again minister of the treasury from November 1903 to March 1905 in Giolitti's second administration, and for the third time from February to May 1906, under Sonnino's premiership. During the latter term of office he achieved the conversion of the Italian 5% debt (reduced to 4% by the tax) to 3 3/4 % to be eventually lowered to 3 1/2 %, an operation which other ministers had attempted without success; although the actual conversion was not completed until after the fall of the cabinet of which he formed part the merit is entirely his. In 1907 he was president of the co-operative congress at Cremona. Question: who investigated the issue?.

Read this: To the southwest, the principality of Halych had developed trade relations with its Polish, Hungarian and Lithuanian neighbours and emerged as the local successor to Kievan Rus'. In 1199, Prince Roman Mstislavich united the two previously separate principalities. In 1202 he conquered Kiev, and assumed the title of Grand Duke of Kievan Rus', which was held by the rulers of Vladimir-Suzdal since 1169. His son, Prince Daniil (r. 1238–1264) looked for support from the West. He accepted a crown as a \\"Rex Rusiae\\" (\\"King of Russia\\") from the Roman papacy, apparently doing so without breaking with Constantinople. In 1370, the patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople granted the King of Poland a metropolitan for his Russian subjects. Lithuanian rulers also requested and received a metropolitan for Novagrudok shortly afterwards. Cyprian, a candidate pushed by the Lithuanian rulers, became Metropolitan of Kiev in 1375 and metropolitan of Moscow in 1382; this way the church in the Russian countries was reunited for some time. In 1439, Kiev became the seat of a separate \\"Metropolitan of Kiev, Galich and all Rus'\\" for all Greek Orthodox Christians under Polish-Lithuanian rule.

Question: Who was Zipoetes' son? Context: The Bithynians were a Thracian people living in northwest Anatolia. After Alexander's conquests the region of Bithynia came under the rule of the native king Bas, who defeated Calas, a general of Alexander the Great, and maintained the independence of Bithynia. His son, Zipoetes I of Bithynia maintained this autonomy against Lysimachus and Seleucus I, and assumed the title of king (basileus) in 297 BCE. His son and successor, Nicomedes I, founded Nicomedia, which soon rose to great prosperity, and during his long reign (c. 278 – c. 255 BCE), as well as those of his successors, the kingdom of Bithynia held a considerable place among the minor monarchies of Anatolia. Nicomedes also invited the Celtic Galatians into Anatolia as mercenaries, and they later turned on his son Prusias I, who defeated them in battle. Their last king, Nicomedes IV, was unable to maintain himself against Mithridates VI of Pontus, and, after being restored to his throne by the Roman Senate, he bequeathed his kingdom by will to the Roman republic (74 BCE).

The other reviewers failed to note that some of these pieces are very hard to find another recording of, and many are probably premiere recordings, the Courante for instance..I.ve never seen it on another disc.. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided review, I would say that the review depicts the product in a predominantly flattering light. Step by Step rationale: 1) The user starts the review by agreeing with other reviewers, indicating that there is a general consensus that the product is good. This is a positive reflection on the product. 2) He noted that there were some discrepancies with the tempo of some preludes, which could be perceived as a slight negative. However, he quickly mitigates this by suggesting that it may be due to the authenticity of the sheet music that the player was using, adding a bit of curiosity and intrigue rather than straight criticism. 3) A key flattering point in the review is the mention of Holzman as a \\"great player and a very good Ponce interpreter\\". This compliments the artist's abilities and skills, which directly attributes positive traits to the product. 4) The user recognizes that some of these pieces are hard to find and many are probably premiere recordings, another positive attribute that adds exclusivity and rarity to the product. 5) Casting more positive light on the product, the user specifically mentions 'Courante' which seems to be unique to this recording. Overall, despite a small potential critique, there's an abundance of praise and admiration in the review, leading to the conclusion that the product is presented in a flattering light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The author never treasured every relation with others; Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me.

The song was ranked number 40 on Engine 145 's 50 Best Country Songs of 2007 . - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The Country Music Association (CMA) was founded in 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee. It originally consisted of only 233 members and was the first trade organization formed to promote a music genre. The objectives of the organization are to guide and enhance the development of Country Music throughout the world; to demonstrate it as a viable medium to advertisers, consumers and media; and to provide a unity of purpose for the Country Music industry. However the CMA may be best known to most country music fans for its annual Country Music Association Awards broadcast live on network television each fall (usually October or November). - The Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance was first awarded in 1965, to Dottie West. The award has had several minor name changes: - The Country Music Association Awards, also known as the CMA Awards or CMAs, are presented to country music artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry. The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures). - The Academy of Country Music Awards, also known as the ACM Awards, were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \\"hat\\" trophy was created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to produce the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today. - Dottie West (born Dorothy Marie Marsh; October 11, 1932 September 4, 1991) was an American country music singer and songwriter. Along with her friends and fellow recording artists Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, she is considered one of the genre's most influential and groundbreaking female artists. Dottie West's career started in the 1960s, with her Top 10 hit, \\"Here Comes My Baby Back Again\\", which won her the first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1965. - The Academy of Country Music (ACM) was founded in 1964 in Los Angeles, California as the Country & Western Music Academy.

House Bill 1125 is currently before the New Hampshire Senate. If passed, it would repeal the crime of adultery. A recent Monitor editorial (“Repeal outdated state adultery law,” Feb. 18) encouraged passage of this bill. I disagree. Adultery should remain a crime. The arguments against it should be unpersuasive. Taxpayers have the right to expect that those who have voluntarily stepped up and sworn to uphold the law will do so. The failure to enforce the law is to law enforcement’s discredit, not an argument to repeal the law. Examine the law on its merits, not its enforcement. Don’t let the tail wag the dog. The government is already in consenting adults’ bedrooms, and rightly so. Our society doesn’t allow siblings to marry, or have sexual relations, consent or age of majority not withstanding. This type of behavior is repugnant to society’s idea of what a family is and is rightly considered criminal. Adultery is similarly repugnant and also ought to be criminal. Government intrusion in intimate relations should be very limited, but retaining the criminal penalties for adultery is on the proper side of the equation. Marriage has non-controversial tax, inheritance, and criminal benefits (a spouse can’t be forced to testify in criminal proceedings) bestowed upon it by the government. It is right that conduct injurious to marriage be prohibited. Fellow citizens, please contact your state senators before April 17 and ask them to defeat this bill. DANIEL J. HAMMOND Nottingham ||||| N.H. may toss law against adultery Lawmakers in the House have passed the repeal, which awaits a vote by the Senate on Thursday By Lynne Tuohy The Associated Press CONCORD, N.H. — New Hampshire is taking steps to repeal a centuries-old law that makes it a crime to commit adultery. The Judicial Branch reports that the law hasn’t been enforced in more than a decade. Rep. Tim O’Flaherty, a Manchester Democrat who sponsored a House bill repealing the statute, said he was motivated by a 2003 ruling by the New Hampshire Supreme Court that same-sex partners in an adulterous affair could not be charged with adultery because of long-standing case law defining adultery as between a man and woman. Marc Hassan, spokesman for Gov. Maggie Hassan, said she will likely sign the repeal measure if it passes. Adultery is a Class B misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to 1,200. O’Flaherty also objects to it on privacy grounds. “I don’t think there’s any appetite in New Hampshire to use police powers to enforce a marriage,” O’Flaherty told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee during a public hearing March 25. At the hearing, the only member of the public who spoke was a man distraught over his own divorce. He said when he tried to file a criminal adultery complaint against his former wife, the officer told him it was the first such complaint he’d taken in 20 years. The Associated Press is not naming the man because it could identify his ex-wife, who was not charged with a crime. “If we retain adultery as a crime, we may deter an otherwise law-abiding citizen ... from falling into the trap of that repugnant behavior,” he said. “It does provide some solace to victims of adultery, who can take comfort in that fact that what happened to them was so evil the state has decided to criminalize it. That is not trivial.” The bill passed the House 268-29 and awaits a vote by the Senate on Thursday. The New Hampshire Supreme Court in 2003 ruled in a split decision that adultery involving two people of the same sex could not be grounds for divorce because case law dating back to the early 1800s defines adultery as “intercourse from which spurious issue may arise” – meaning a child born of the illicit affair. “As ‘spurious issue’ can only arise from intercourse between a man and woman, criminal adultery could only be committed with a person of the opposite sex,” the court ruled. “Persons of the same gender cannot, by definition, engage in the one act that constitutes adultery under the statute.” New Hampshire is not the only state in New England where adultery remains a crime. In Massachusetts, adultery is punishable by up to three years in prison. In Rhode Island, anyone engaged in an adulterous affair faces a fine of up to 500, according to data compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures. Of 21 states that consider adultery a crime, many contain language that is gender specific and excludes same-sex married couples. For example, Oklahoma law defines adultery as “sexual intercourse of a married person with one of the opposite sex.” “It’s not any kind of deterrence,” O’Flaherty said of the law. “People are going to cheat on their spouses regardless of what the law is.” Rep. Carol McGuire, an Epsom Republican, co-sponsored the current repeal measure and a similar bill in 2010. The bill passed the House but was killed in the Senate. McGuire said she believes opponents thought a vote for the bill was tantamount to endorsing adultery. “I don’t want to live in a place where the police are responsible for investigating adultery,” McGuire said. If passed and signed into law, the bill would take effect Jan. 1. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about a bill in New Hampshire that, if passed, would stop making adultery (when a married person has romantic relations with someone who isn't their spouse) a crime.

Article: Who hasn't enjoyed eating peanuts? Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

Given the following passage \\"During the early High Middle Ages, Germany was ruled by the Ottonian dynasty, which struggled to control the powerful dukes ruling over territorial duchies tracing back to the Migration period. In 1024, they were replaced by the Salian dynasty, who famously clashed with the papacy under Emperor Henry IV (r. 1084–1105) over church appointments as part of the Investiture Controversy. His successors continued to struggle against the papacy as well as the German nobility. A period of instability followed the death of Emperor Henry V (r. 1111–25), who died without heirs, until Frederick I Barbarossa (r. 1155–90) took the imperial throne. Although he ruled effectively, the basic problems remained, and his successors continued to struggle into the 13th century. Barbarossa's grandson Frederick II (r. 1220–1250), who was also heir to the throne of Sicily through his mother, clashed repeatedly with the papacy. His court was famous for its scholars and he was often accused of heresy. He and his successors faced many difficulties, including the invasion of the Mongols into Europe in the mid-13th century. Mongols first shattered the Kievan Rus' principalities and then invaded Eastern Europe in 1241, 1259, and 1287.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Coal is mined out of the ground: Reduced water pollution does not affect the mining process. 2. Coal is pulverized into fine powder: Reduced water pollution does not affect the pulverizing process. 3. The coal is mixed with hot air: Reduced water pollution does not affect mixing coal with hot air. 4. The coal and hot air are blown into a boiler: Reduced water pollution does not affect this step. 5. The coal and hot air burn over a fire: Reduced water pollution does not affect combustion. 6. Highly purified water is pumped through pipes in the boiler: Assuming water purification is efficient, the reduced pollution should not have a significant effect on this step. If the water purification process is less energy-intensive due to reduced pollution, there might be some indirect positive effect on energy consumption, but this will be minimal. 7. The water turns into steam: As long as the purified water is heated to a sufficient temperature, the reduced pollution will not impact steam production. However, using cleaner water might have some indirect benefits like reduced scaling and fouling inside the boiler, leading to improved heat transfer efficiency and better performance over time. 8. The steam presses against turbines: Reduced water pollution has no direct effect on this step. 9. The turbines spin: Since the water pollution reduction has no direct impact on steam production, there is no direct effect on the spinning turbines. 10. Electricity is produced: Reduced water pollution does not affect the electricity production process. In conclusion, while reduced water pollution is beneficial for the environment and has some potential indirect, positive implications, it does not have a significant direct effect on water converting to steam or the overall process of electricity generation from coal."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Here is a news article: Image copyright Reuters Image caption Authorities were earlier forced to relocate the container full of corpses following complaints A refrigerated trailer containing at least 100 corpses in Mexico's western state of Jalisco has angered residents who have complained about the smell. Authorities said on Monday they were trying to relocate the container, which was rented after mortuaries in the city of Guadalajara became full. \\"We have a lot of children in this neighbourhood... it could make us all sick,\\" resident José Luis Tovar said. Laws in Mexico prevent the cremation of bodies linked to violent crime. Local authorities said they were looking for a longer-term solution to store the bodies following a recent wave of violence. \\"We ran out of cemetery plots where we could bury them,\\" the head of the Jalisco forensic investigators unit, Luis Octavio Cotero, said. He added that a site was being established that was expected to facilitate some 800 corpses, AFP news agency reports. The refrigerated trailer had previously been parked at a warehouse in the neighbourhood of Duraznera, on the outskirts of Guadalajara, but after two weeks the residents began to complain of a foul stench and said the container was attracting flies. It was then moved to an empty lot in the suburb of Tlajomulco de Zúñiga, but residents there began to protest at the weekend. \\"We don't want it here. They need to put it somewhere else, it stinks,\\" Mr Tovar said. Mexico has suffered a wave of violent killings in recent years. More than 200,000 people have been killed or have disappeared since December 2006, when Mexico's government declared war on organised crime. Mexico experienced its most violent year in 2017 with more than 25,000 murders, official figures suggest. It is the highest annual tally since modern records began. Organised crime accounted for nearly three-quarters of those murders. ||||| Locals in Guadalajara complained after they noticed the trailer’s stench following wave of violence that overwhelmed morgues Mexicans have reacted with outrage after authorities in the western state of Jalisco left a trailer full of decomposing corpses on the outskirts of Mexico’s second-largest city following a wave of violence which overwhelmed local morgues. Locals in the Guadalajara suburb of Tlajomulco complained to police after they were alerted to the presence of the trailer by the stench. “This affects our kids, it smells horrible and the longer it stays it’s going to stink even worse,�? Patricia Jiménez told Reuters. It soon emerged that the trailer had previously been parked by officials in the suburb of Tlaquepaque, but was moved on orders of the mayor. It has now been moved to an industrial area near the state attorney general’s office, according to news reports. Quick guide Mexico's war on drugs Show Hide Why did Mexico launch its war on drugs? On 10 December 2006, president Felipe Calderón, launched Mexico’s war on drugs by sending 6,500 troops into his home state of Michoacán, where rival cartels were engaged in tit-for-tat massacres. Calderón declared war eight days after taking power – a move widely seen as an attempt to boost his own legitimacy after a bitterly contested election victory. Within two months, around 20,000 troops were involved in operations across the country. What has the war cost so far? The US has donated at least 1.5bn through the Merida Initiative since 2008, while Mexico has spent at least 54bn on security and defence since 2007. Critics say that this influx of cash has helped create an opaque security industry open to corruption at every level. But the biggest costs have been human: since 2007, around 230,000 people have been murdered and more than 28,000 reported as disappeared. Human rights groups have also detailed a vast rise in human rights abuses by security forces. As the cartels have fractured and diversified, other violent crimes such as kidnapping and extortion have also surged. In addition, hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced by violence. What has been achieved? Improved collaboration between the US and Mexico has resulted in numerous high-profile arrests and drug busts. Officials say 25 of the 37 drug traffickers on Calderón’s most-wanted list have been jailed, extradited to the US or killed, although not all of these actions have been independently corroborated. The biggest victory – and most embarrassing blunder – under Peña Nieto’s leadership was the recapture, escape and another recapture of Joaquín “El Chapo�? Guzmán, leader of the Sinaloa cartel. While the crackdown and capture of kingpins has won praise from the media and US, it has done little to reduce the violence. How is the US involved? Mexico’s decade-long war on drugs would never have been possible without the huge injection of American cash and military cooperation under the Merida Initiative. The funds have continued to flow despite growing evidence of serious human rights violations. Photograph: Pedro Pardo/AFP The Jalisco state attorney general’s office has not commented, but an official in the office said the trailer was properly refrigerated and never “abandoned�?. The office also disputed press reports the trailer contained 157 corpses, with sources telling local media the number was closer to 100. Jalisco’s general secretary Roberto López told local media that the state’s morgue had been overwhelmed by a surge in deaths, adding that a new morgue should be finished in a month and a half. “When it is built, these bodies will be transferred,�? he said. The row over the trailer – which erupted as the country celebrated its national day on Sunday – was yet another reminder of the grim toll from the country’s decade-long drug war. Mexico’s homicide rate hit a record high in 2017 with 29,168 murders registered. The country recorded 2,599 homicides in July 2018, its most murderous month since 1997, when Mexico started keeping such statistics. It was not the first time that the bloodletting has been so severe that local morgues have run out of space – similar incidents have occurred in the opium heartlands of Guerrero. Mexico: bounty raised over 1m on drug cartel kingpin 'El Mencho' Read more But the gruesome episode in Guadalajara has underlined how violence has spread to all corners of the country. The surrounding Jalisco state has deteriorated rapidly in recent months: 15 people were injured in May when a gun battle erupted in the city centre after a brazen assassination attempt on the state’s employment secretary. In March, three film students in the Guadalajara suburb of Tonalá disappeared after unwittingly filming property associated with a drug trafficker when they were working on a college project. Much of the violence in the region is the work of the Jalisco New Generation Cartel (CJNG) which has disputed territories across the country – especially those controlled by the rival Sinaloa Cartel, whose former leader Joaquín “El Chapo�? Guzmán was extradited to the United States last year. More recently, CJNG has itself splintered into rival factions. In July, US and Mexican officials announced that had raised the reward to 1.56m for information leading to the arrest of the CJNG boss Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, known as “El Mencho�?. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"In Mexico, there was a big trailer that had many dead bodies inside it and the trailer was very cold like a refrigerator to keep the bodies from smelling bad.

Then they shouted, but only a dismal echo came back. Dick fancied once that he heard Tom calling, but was not sure. Daylight found them still searching around, Dick and Sam with more sober faces than they had worn in many a day. They knew only too well the danger of becoming lost in those wild mountains. \\"Perhaps he has fallen in with Baxter's party,\\" suggested Dick, as they came to a halt at the edge of a cliff overlooking a rushing river far below.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Nathan Charles Buckley (born 26 July 1972) is a former professional Australian rules football player, commentator and coach, best known for his time as captain of the Collingwood Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL). He is currently the senior coach of the Collingwood Football Club. He is listed by journalist Mike Sheahan as one of the top 50 players of all time. Buckley won the inaugural Rising Star Award, in 1993, then went on to become one of the game's elite, captaining Collingwood between 1999 and 2007, winning the Norm Smith Medal for best player afield in the 2002 Grand Final despite playing in the losing team, only the third player in history to do so, the Brownlow Medal in 2003, winning Collingwood's Best and Fairest award, the Copeland Trophy, six times and named in the Collingwood Team of the Century. During his first season Buckley's arrangement with the Bears became common knowledge. At the end of the contract he attracted strong interest from all Melbourne-based clubs, chiefly Collingwood, Geelong and North Melbourne. However, it was Collingwood that successfully arranged a trade deal acceptable to all parties. Unbeknown to other AFL clubs and to the AFL itself, Collingwood and Brisbane had already agreed to make the trade happen. Collingwood selected ten players on its list who were \\"untouchable\\", and the Bears could take any two players outside this list, as well as the Collingwood Magpies' first round draft pick, in exchange for Buckley. The move saw Buckley move to Collingwood in exchange for Craig Starcevich, Troy Lehmann and the Magpies' first-round draft pick (no. 12, future double-premiership player Chris Scott). Buckley was adamant that the move was the right career direction, with the belief he had more chance of winning a premiership with Collingwood. Ironically, Brisbane would beat Collingwood in two consecutive AFL Grand Finals in 2002 and 2003. In his first season with Collingwood, the Magpies were eliminated by the West Coast Eagles by two points in Perth. From here, Buckley would be a consistent performer for Collingwood. As well as winning a Brownlow Medal in 2003, he finished in the top three twice before the turn of the century. He was also named Collingwood's Best and Fairest six times in 10 years (including one tied), as well as six consecutive years in the All-Australian Team from 1996 to 2002. In 1999, Buckley suffered a broken jaw playing against Carlton in Round 2. He returned in Round 8 to help Collingwood to their first win of the season and their first in 13 matches. Collingwood finished the season last, only the second time in their history (the other being in 1976). Buckley also competed in the last game at Collingwood's long-time home ground Victoria Park against one of their main rivals, the Brisbane Lions. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What happened later in his career with Collingwood?","completion":"Later in his career with Collingwood, \\"Buckley would be a consistent performer for Collingwood.

Background: Gorillaz are an English virtual band created in 1998 by musician Damon Albarn and artist Jamie Hewlett. The band consists of four animated members: 2-D (lead vocals, keyboards), Murdoc Niccals (bass guitar), Noodle (guitar, keyboards), and Russel Hobbs (drums and percussion). These members are fictional and are not personas of any \\"real life\\" musicians involved in the project. Their fictional universe is explored through the band's music videos, as well as a number of other short cartoons. Context: Musician Damon Albarn and comic book artist Jamie Hewlett met in 1990 when guitarist Graham Coxon, a fan of Hewlett's work, asked him to interview Blur, a band Albarn and Coxon had recently formed. The interview was published in Deadline magazine, home of Hewlett's comic strip Tank Girl. Hewlett initially thought Albarn was \\"arsey, a wanker\\"; despite becoming acquaintances with the band, they often did not get on, especially after Hewlett began seeing Coxon's ex-girlfriend Jane Olliver. Despite this, Albarn and Hewlett started sharing a flat on Westbourne Grove in London in 1997. Hewlett had recently broken up with Olliver and Albarn was at the end of his highly publicised relationship with Justine Frischmann of Elastica. The idea to create Gorillaz came about when Albarn and Hewlett were watching MTV. Hewlett said, \\"If you watch MTV for too long, it's a bit like hell - there's nothing of substance there. So we got this idea for a cartoon band, something that would be a comment on that.\\" The band originally identified themselves as \\"Gorilla\\" and the first song they recorded was \\"Ghost Train\\" which was later released as a B-side on their single \\"Rock the House\\" and the B-side compilation G Sides. The musicians behind Gorillaz' first incarnation included Albarn, Del the Funky Homosapien, Dan the Automator and Kid Koala, who had previously worked together on the track \\"Time Keeps on Slipping\\" for Deltron 3030's eponymous debut album. Although not released under the Gorillaz name, Albarn has said that \\"one of the first ever Gorillaz tunes\\" was Blur's 1997 single \\"On Your Own\\", which was released for their fifth studio album Blur. Question: What did Hewlett to help the band take off?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Jamie Hewlett, a comic book artist, helped the band Gorillaz take off by creating the animated characters and the fictional universe in which the band exists. He collaborated with Damon Albarn to develop the concept of a virtual band, using his artistic talents to form the unique animated members: 2-D, Murdoc Niccals, Noodle, and Russel Hobbs. These characters, along with their fictional world, are explored through the band's music videos and various other short cartoons, giving Gorillaz a distinct identity and visual appeal that contributed to their success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the equation -27*f - 3*f - 30 = 0 for f, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms (coefficients of f). -27*f and -3*f are like terms, so we add their coefficients: -27 - 3 = -30 The equation now becomes: -30*f - 30 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable f. First, we should get rid of the constant term (-30) on the left side of the equation. To do that, we can add 30 to both sides of the equation: -30*f - 30 + 30 = 0 + 30 -30*f = 30 Step 3: Solve for f. Now, we should divide both sides of the equation by -30 to solve for f: f = 30 / -30 Step 4: Simplify the solution. f = -1 So, the solution for the equation -27*f - 3*f - 30 = 0 is f = -1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Wayne Rooney is fit for the Manchester derby this weekend. Rooney gave Manchester United a scare on Monday when he limped away from Carrington after training. However, it is understood that the United captain trained fully on Wednesday and will play at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday. Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney has been suspended since his red against West Ham last month. Rooney will return for the Manchester derby after serving a three-game suspension. Rooney has not played since last month after serving a three-game ban for a sending-off against West Ham. United manager Louis van Gaal has told Rooney he will definitely start and it remains to be seen who makes way. Robin van Persie could be the one to suffer after a series of indifferent performances, despite scoring a late equaliser against Chelsea at Old Trafford last Sunday. Meanwhile, former United goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel now believes Manchester City are a ‘bigger club’ than their local rivals based on recent form. During his eight years at Old Trafford, Schmeichel did not lose one Manchester derby and United were undoubtedly superior to City. Rooney was seen limping after attending a sponsorship event for Bulova watches at Old Trafford. But the 50-year-old thinks the balance of power has well and truly shifted in City’s favour. ‘In my first couple of years at United I didn’t understand the rivalry with City. Liverpool and Leeds were much bigger,’ Schmeichel told BBC Sport. ‘Now it’s different. Man City are the champions, they won their second Premier League title last season and maybe at the moment they are a bigger club than Manchester United in terms of results so the significance has changed.’ The Champions League winner is still very much a United fan, though, and admits playing against Sir Alex Ferguson’s team in City blue was a ‘very weird’ experience. Like many other United supporters, Schmeichel has become concerned by the inconsistency shown by the team since Ferguson retired. ‘The derby is a tricky one for United because of their inconsistency,’ he said. ‘We don’t know what we will get on Sunday.’ Schmeichel shouts instructions to the outfield players during a match for Manchester City. Peter Schmeichel has acknowledged that Manchester City are a bigger club than United on recent form. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Isotopes considered stable are those for which no radioactive decay has yet been observed. Elements with atomic numbers 83 through 94 are unstable to the point that radioactive decay of all isotopes can be detected. Some of these elements, notably bismuth (atomic number 83), thorium (atomic number 90), and uranium (atomic number 92), have one or more isotopes with half-lives long enough to survive as remnants of the explosive stellar nucleosynthesis that produced the heavy metals before the formation of our Solar System. At over 1.9×1019 years, over a billion times longer than the current estimated age of the universe, bismuth-209 (atomic number 83) has the longest known alpha decay half-life of any naturally occurring element, and is almost always considered on par with the 80 stable elements. The very heaviest elements (those beyond plutonium, element 94) undergo radioactive decay with half-lives so short that they are not found in nature and must be synthesized. Paragraph: David was studying for his chemistry exam. To understand the elements of the periodic table better he categorized them into three groups, cat A, cat B, and cat C. In cat A he placed all the elements with atomic numbers lower than 83. In cat B he put the elements with atomic numbers from 83 to 94.

A second royal engagement was fixed for 19 May, at which Wolfgang was asked by the king to play pieces by Handel, Johann Christian Bach and Carl Friedrich Abel.

Sentence 2: A landscaped park can be found in the center of the city.

Here's a detailed explanation to show that the second sentence is derived from the information provided in the first sentence: 1. Sentence 1 provides information about a park called the Maidan, which is located in the center of the city. 2. It mentions that Maidan is landscaped to allow for a clear line of fire from all around Fort William, indicating that it is a well-designed park built for strategic purposes. 3. The sentence also provides historical background, mentioning the role of Robert Clive in its reconstruction on a more easily defended site than its predecessor.

The paste, a volatile chemical compound, was reacting violently to the moisture on his skin, and now, with horrifying quickness, the fiery tendrils were consuming him entirely. Chris sprinted out the door, immediately feeling the intense heat billowing behind him as de Kere's agonized screams pierced the air. He knew that he had only seconds before the fire reached the stockpile of unstable compounds located throughout the establishment. And so, without looking back, he dedicated all his efforts to evacuating the premises. As he raced through the corridors, Chris shouted for everyone to get out, alerting other knights and personnel to the impending disaster. Panic gripped the halls as other inhabitants of the building scrambled to evacuate, heedless of the belongings they were leaving behind. Amid the chaos, Chris thought about de Kere—how the knight had become a victim of his own experiments, how his thirst for knowledge and power had led him to this terrible and fiery end. Though he had warned de Kere of the dangers surrounding the paste, Chris couldn't shake the guilt he felt for unleashing such a destructive force upon the man. Perhaps he could have done more to prevent the catastrophe, yet the consequences now became undeniable. With adrenaline pumping fiercely through his veins, Chris burst through the main doors of the building and into the crowded streets, just as the first explosion rocked the structure. A timed cascade of blasts wiped out each section of the compound, reducing it to a heap of smoldering ruin. The shockwaves from the explosions knocked Chris and dozens of others off their feet, while shards of glass and debris rained down upon the unfortunate souls. Coughing and disoriented, Chris struggled to get up. He scanned the shocked faces around him, desperately searching for any friends or comrades who had managed to escape in time. Some were battered but alive; others, horrifyingly, were not so fortunate. As the reality of the situation started to sink in, Chris couldn't deny the part he had played in this disaster. He knew that he would never forget the image of de Kere, his eyes pleading, consumed by the very flame he had so desired to wield. Though he had escaped the flames that had claimed de Kere's life, he couldn't escape the guilt that smoldered within his own heart. \\"Watch it happen, pal,\\" the words Chris had uttered echoed hauntingly inside his mind. In the aftermath of the fiery incident, as he mourned the lives lost, Chris resolved to dedicate his life to finding safer methods and working toward a world of progress without destruction. He knew that if knowledge and ambition could lead to such devastation, then only wisdom and empathy could prevent further suffering. And as the sun dipped beneath the horizon that fateful day, Chris set forth on a new path—one that would lead him not just toward his own redemption but also toward a brighter and more compassionate world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters. But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

Today, we are going to learn about a special type of bird and how the changing weather in their home is making them smaller. These birds have a big journey every year and are called migratory birds. First, let's learn what migratory birds are. Imagine if you had to travel a long, long way every year to find a new home because the place where you lived got too cold or there wasn't enough food. Well, that's what migratory birds do! They travel from one part of the world to another during different seasons because the weather changes and it becomes hard for them to find food. Now, let's talk about the little birdie who loves to live in the Arctic. The Arctic is a very cold place, way up in the far north where the icebergs float and polar bears roam. This little birdie likes to make its home in the cold Arctic during the warm summer months, but as the weather in the Arctic gets warmer, something strange is happening to it. Researchers, who are like detective scientists, have found out that this little birdie is becoming smaller! That means it's not growing as big as it used to. They think this might be happening because of the warmer temperatures at the bird's Arctic home. Warmer weather can sometimes make it harder for these birds to find the food they need to grow big and strong, like bugs, worms, and seeds. You might wonder why this is important for us to know. Well, when we learn about how weather changes affect the plants, animals, and other living things on our planet, we can understand our world better. We can also help protect these special birds and their habitats by taking care of our environment. For example, we can do simple things like planting more trees, saving water, and recycling. These small acts can make a big difference in helping our planet stay healthy and happy, so our little birdie friends can continue their amazing journey every year.

Real Madrid sealed a record-extending 32nd La Liga title after Wednesday's 3-0 win at Athletic Bilbao maintained an unassailable seven-point lead over arch rivals and defending Spanish champions Barcelona with two matches to play. Goals from Gonzalo Higuain, Mesut Ozil and Cristiano Ronaldo wrapped up the clinching victory for Jose Mourinho's men at San Mames. Mourinho has now won league titles in Portugal with Porto, England with Chelsea, Italy with Inter and Spain with Real, who broke Barcelona's three-year La Liga reign. \\"This one has been the toughest. I've won seven league titles overall and I know what it feels like,\\" Mourinho told the club's website. \\"Barcelona won all their games, as befits the great team that they are. They've been winning to the very last day. They are a club with great tradition that knows we deserved to win this title.\\" Earlier on Wednesday, Barca thrashed fourth-placed Malaga 4-1 to keep up the pressure on Real as Lionel Messi scored his eighth hat-trick this season and broke Gerd Muller's record for a European season. Argentina's three-time world player of the year now has 68 goals in 2011-12, going past the mark Germany legend Muller set in 1972-73 for Bayern Munich. It took Messi's tally in La Liga to 46, two more than Ronaldo, but his efforts have proved in vain. Real's trip to the Europa League finalists looked a tough one, and when Ronaldo saw an early penalty saved by Gorka Iraizoz, their small band of supporters might have been worried. But Argentina striker Higuain settled nerves with a fine strike before Ronaldo played in Ozil for a second to make it 2-0 at halftime. Early in the second half the Portugal star netted his 44th in the league this season with a close-range header, and Bilbao's last hopes of salvaging something from the game ended when Javi Martinez was sent off for a second yellow card. At the finish Mourinho was hoisted high by his players as they celebrated the club's first championship since 2008. \\"We have to celebrate this championship. We have to continue working after tomorrow because next season will also be tough and we have games to play still in this campaign,\\" the 49-year-old said. \\"This team deserves even more emotion and affection, and I expect the Bernabeu to give it to them in our match against Mallorca.\\" The Dutch title was also decided on Wednesday as Ajax Amsterdam beat VVV Venlo 2-0 with goals in each half from Siem De Jong. It is Ajax's second straight title under Frank de Boer and came after a late-season charge with 13 straight wins. Ajax were eight points behind joint leaders PSV Eindhoven and AZ Alkmaar in mid-February before their unstoppable run. In Serie A, Juventus' lead was cut to a single point after being held to a 1-1 draw by 10-man Lecce. Second-placed AC Milan beat Atalanta 2-0 to revive their hopes on a night Juve could have clinched the title if results had gone in their favor. Sulley Muntari put Milan ahead in the San Siro and Robinho sealed a vital victory in injury time. In Turin, Juventus appeared to be cruising to a routine home win when Claudio Marchisio scored in the first half. Lecce's hopes appeared over when Juan Cuadrado was sent off for a second booking early in the second half, but the leaders wasted a string of chances before Andrea Bertolacci took advantage of a horrible error by home keeper Gianluigi Buffon to level. In other action, Inter Milan's Champions League chances receded with a 3-1 loss at Parma which left the 2010 European titleholders three points behind Napoli and Udinese in the race for third place.

Question: How would Kai feel afterwards? Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: full of energy B: dedicated C: exhausted Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, Kai is practicing intently on a daily basis, and the training sessions are described as really hard and fast paced. Such intense physical activity generally demands a lot from the body, significantly consuming body energy, thus leading one to feel physically drained. Therefore, the most suitable answer to the question \\"How would Kai feel afterwards?\\" would be C: exhausted. The other choices do not accurately represent Kai's condition as a result of these practices. Answer A: \\"full of energy,\\" suggests that Kai would feel energized after the practice sessions. However, given the intensity and frequency of the practice sessions, it is unlikely that Kai would be full of energy afterwards; instead, he is more likely to be tired. Answer B: \\"dedicated,\\" pertains more to a mental state rather than a physical feeling after exercising. From the statement given, we can infer that Kai is dedicated because he is practicing every day, but this does not provide information on how he would physically feel afterward. For these reasons, answer C: \\"exhausted\\" is the best choice and aligns best with the information given in the context as an intense and fast-paced practice schedule on a daily base would typically leave a person feeling tired and drained. It's important to note that while feeling exhausted, it does not negate Kai's dedication or potential feelings of satisfaction or accomplishment after his practices, those are just not the feelings being asked about in this question."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Caleb, the teenage son of prominent conservative columnist Jeff Jacoby and his wife, Laura, was last seen at around 12:30 pm on Monday, leaving both family and community members shaken and distressed. Caleb's disappearance has ignited a wave of concern, as the Brookline community and surrounding areas rally together in an effort to bring the missing teenager back home safely. The Brookline Police Department has been tirelessly working on the case, with support from local and state police agencies, as well as numerous community members and volunteers who have dedicated their time to searching the nearby streets and neighborhoods. Residents of Brookline have been distributing flyers bearing Caleb's photo and several groups have embarked on grassroots searches throughout the area, extending their efforts to neighboring towns and cities. Social media has also played a significant role in raising awareness, as several \\"Help Find Caleb Jacoby\\" pages have cropped up on platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. These groups have been coordinating search efforts, sharing information and updates, and urging the public to keep an eye out for any signs of the missing teenager. The teenager, who is reported to have brown hair, green eyes, and stands at 5'11\\" tall, was last seen wearing khaki pants, a navy polo shirt, black sneakers, a blue and white New England Patriots hat, and carrying a monogrammed burgundy backpack. Police encourage anyone with information, no matter how insignificant it may seem, to come forward and provide any leads that might aide in locating Caleb. His father, Jeff Jacoby, is a highly-regarded journalist and conservative columnist for The Boston Globe. He has been an influential figure in the local and national media scene for several years and is often praised for his insightful analyses and sharp wit. The family's anguish has been widely publicized, with both Jeff and Laura Jacoby expressing their heart-wrenching pain and gratitude for the support they have received from the community in their search for Caleb. \\"This is every parent's nightmare, and we are living it,\\" Mr. Jacoby said in a statement to the media, \\"Every moment without knowing where Caleb is or what has happened to him is an eternity of torture. But we are so grateful for the immense outpouring of love, support, and help from people both far and wide.\\" During this difficult time, the community has shown immense resilience and solidarity, coming together in a shared effort to locate the missing teenager and provide solace to the Jacobys. Despite the shock and sadness surrounding Caleb's disappearance, the collective response of Brookline and its residents serves as a testament to the strength and compassion that can be found within small towns across America.

It is the hope of his family, friends, and acquaintances that Caleb will be found soon, safely returning home to those who have been desperately seeking him throughout this harrowing ordeal. Anyone with information about Caleb Jacoby's whereabouts is urged to contact the Brookline Police Department at (617) 730-2222 or the anonymous tip line at (617) 730-2244."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To determine whether the palace has marbled floors, further information about the palace's interior design and construction would be required. The Merdeka Palace, historically known as Istana Gambir or Paleis te Koningsplein during colonial times, is one of the most prominent and historically significant buildings in Indonesia. It has been used for various governmental and ceremonial purposes since its inception, and its architectural style is an intricate mix of local and European influences.

The palace has undergone several renovations and extensions throughout its existence, and the materials used for flooring may have changed over time due to practical or aesthetic reasons. However, as the building serves as the official residence of the President of the Republic of Indonesia, it is likely to feature high-quality materials and finishes, which may include marble flooring.

So is Sara Blakely, the founder of Spanx. They didn’t grow up with money or the finer things in life, they weren’t offered “legacy” preferences for college, and they didn’t get a trophy on the soccer field just because they showed up. They worked hard and found their support through family, teachers and mentors. But what makes them tick? That’s what I wanted to know. Andrea Guendelman, cofounder and CEO of BeVisible, was curious as well, so together we asked the women we’re featuring in our Self-Made Women series what they believe are the top 10 traits of successful self-made women. Here’s what they said: Grit. There’s no doubt about it, self-made women have a fire inside them, a fuel that keeps them going through hell and high water . When you come across a self-made woman, you can feel it in her presence. She exudes an undeniable energy of conviction and resolve. It’s almost as if she’s always in the ‘on’ state, ready and open to anything. –Amira Polack (25) Youth Campaign Lead at SAP Self-aware. Self-made women are aware of who they are and have made meaning from the experiences that have shaped their worldview.Heightened self-awareness provides them with clarity, both personally and professionally, and this helps them to align their goals and objectives to their purpose and meaning. That’s a powerful combination. –Rumeet Billan (31) Social Entrepreneur & President, Jobs in Education Sara Blakely, Founder of Spanx is a self-made woman. Visionary. Self-made women are able to see beyond the way things are and create something new. They are able to see opportunities where others see obstacles and unfairness. And while others often get taken out by what seems impossible, self-made women are inspired into action to construct a new reality no matter how deep or systemic the scraps. –Rachel Armstrong (34) Founder, Executive Director and Attorney at Farm Commons Self-forgiving. Self-made women look at the past, the darkest moments and poorest choices with compassion, knowing they did the best they could with the resources and tools at the time. They release the weight of regretful actions and free themselves from judgment.–Maranda Pleasant (36), Founder/Editor-in-Chief ORIGIN Magazine, Mantra Yoga + Health Magazine, Thrive Magazine Focused. Self-made women have the ability to weed out what’s important and what’s not, what needs to be addressed immediately and what can wait. They know when to say ‘yes’, but more importantly, they know when to say ‘no’ . –Jessica Teal (38) Principal, Teal Media What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text outlines ten traits that commonly define self-made women, according to a variety of successful women: 1. **Grit**: Self-made women have a fiery determination, a fuel that keeps propelling them towards their goals, marked by a constant readiness and openness. 2. **Self-awareness**: They are conscious of who they are, making meaning out of their personal experiences that shape their worldview. This intrinsic insight provides personal and professional clarity, helping to align their goals with their purpose. 3. **Visionary**: They have the ability to transcend beyond existing situations and cultivate something innovative. They see opportunities where others observe hurdles and are driven by seemingly impossible circumstances. 4. **Self-forgiving**: They approach their past mistakes with empathy, understanding their limitations at that point in time. They let go of regret and guilt, liberating themselves from self-judgment. 5. **Focus**: The ability to discern the important from the insignificant and to know when to assert both agreement and refusal, underlies their decision-making abilities. The text emphasizes that the traits of grit, self-awareness, being visionary, self-forgiveness, and focus are critical to the growth and success of self-made women. Examples of such women include Oprah Winfrey, Sara Blakely, Amira Polack, Rumeet Billan, Rachel Armstrong, Maranda Pleasant, and Jessica Teal. Their experiences and perspectives gathered in their self-made journeys provide valuable insights into these characteristic traits. In the broader context, these traits can be seen as universally beneficial constructs – not just for women aiming to become self-made and successful. Regardless of gender, anyone seeking personal and professional development can cultivate these traits for an enriching journey towards achievement and self-actualization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Andrew Cuomo of two inmates' escape from a maximum security prison yesterday in Dannemora in a turn of events he tells ABC News \\"could have been from the plot of a movie.\\" The movie comparison being bandied about is The Shawshank Redemption, and Sky News notes that escapees David Sweat and Richard Matt added a particularly dramatic touch: They left behind a taunting note bearing a smiley face and \\"Have a Nice Day!\\" But Cuomo, who ditched plans to attend yesterday's history-making Belmont Stakes, is quick to underscore that these are murderers who are \\"nothing to be trifled with.\\" Officials still don't know how the duo got their hands on power tools to cut through the wall, though Cuomo notes there are \\"a number of contractors working\\" on the Clinton Correctional Facility, which sits about 20 miles from the Canadian border. And apparently nobody is talking: \\"I chatted with a couple of the inmates myself and said, 'You must be a very heavy sleeper,' \\" Cuomo said. \\"They were heard, they had to be heard.\\" It's not Matt's first breakout, adds the New York Times: He escaped an Erie County jail in 1986. \\"The whole town’s locked down,\\" a local resident tells the Times. \\"You can’t drive anywhere. You can’t come into town. They’ve got detours all over the place. They’re checking trunks. It’s just something I’ve never seen before.\\" Says Cuomo: \\"I’m sure they knew that since it was the first escape it was going to be a big deal. But we'll get them back and we'll give them the note back.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"In a dramatic event reminiscent of a movie plot, two inmates escaped from the maximum-security Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, New York in 2015. The two escapees, David Sweat and Richard Matt, were both convicted murderers who managed to obtain power tools and cut through the prison wall to make their escape. The incident marked the first breakout from the prison since 1865, and New York Governor Andrew Cuomo was determined to make it the last. The escape drew comparisons to the film \\"The Shawshank Redemption,\\" particularly due to the taunting note left behind by Sweat and Matt, which featured a smiley face and the message \\"Have a Nice Day!\\" Governor Cuomo, who canceled plans to attend the historic Belmont Stakes to address the situation, emphasized the seriousness of the escape, noting that the inmates were dangerous and \\"nothing to be trifled with.\\" At the time of the incident, officials did not know how Sweat and Matt acquired the power tools they used in their escape. Cuomo revealed that several contractors were working at the correctional facility, which is located approximately 20 miles from the Canadian border. Despite the use of power tools, no one reported hearing any noise during the escape. Governor Cuomo said, \\"I chatted with a couple of the inmates myself and said, 'You must be a very heavy sleeper. They were heard, they had to be heard.'\\" Interestingly, this was not Richard Matt's first escape from a correctional facility. He previously escaped an Erie County jail in 1986. The breakout from Clinton Correctional Facility put the town of Dannemora on high alert, with roadblocks, detours, and trunk searches in place to try to apprehend the escapees. One resident described the situation as \\"something I've never seen before.\\" Governor Cuomo was confident that the fugitives would be captured and vowed to return their taunting note to them. The escape led to an extensive manhunt and renewed focus on prison security in New York state, while also highlighting the challenges faced by law enforcement and corrections officials in preventing and responding to such incidents. Ultimately, the event served as a reminder of the importance of maintaining security in prisons and being diligent in ensuring that dangerous criminals are not able to escape and pose a threat to public safety."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

House training your Maltipoo is one of the most important and also the most difficult things that you will need to do when you first get her. House training involves developing a regular toileting schedule for your dog, cleaning up when your dog has an accident, and praising your dog when she goes to the bathroom outside. Try placing some puppy pads or newspaper in a few places around the house in case your Maltipoo has an emergency and you are not around. Make sure that you take your dog out after he eats as well as a few more times in between. If you are often gone for long periods, then consider having a neighbor or friend stop by to let your dog out. Never yell at your dog, hit your dog, or rub your dog’s face in urine or feces. These methods of house training do not work and they will only frighten and confuse your dog. You may also want to consider crate training your Maltipoo. Crate training can help with housetraining and it is also a good way to teach your Maltipoo not to chew on furniture, shoes, and other off-limits items. . Training your dog is an excellent way to make sure that he is well-behaved and that he listens to you.

Background: Sonny & Cher were an American pop music duo, actors, singers and entertainers made up of husband-and-wife Sonny and Cher Bono in the 1960s and 1970s. The couple started their career in the mid-1960s as R&B backing singers for record producer Phil Spector. The pair first achieved fame with two hit songs in 1965, \\"Baby Don't Go\\" and \\"I Got You Babe\\". Signing with Atco/Atlantic Records, they released three studio albums in the late 1960s, as well as the soundtrack recordings for two unsuccessful movies, Good Times and Chastity, with Cher contributing vocals to one cut, \\"Chastity's Song (Band of Thieves)\\" . Context: In 1967 Sonny and Cher released their third album, In Case You're In Love. It peaked at number 45 in the U.S. charts. It contained two hit singles, both written by Bono, \\"The Beat Goes On\\" (No. 6 on the Billboard Hot 100) and \\"Little Man\\" (No. 21 on the Billboard Hot 100), that peaked at the number one in five European countries. In an attempt to capitalize on the duo's initial success, Bono speedily arranged a film project for the duo to star in. But the 1967 feature, Good Times, was a major bomb, despite the efforts of fledgling director William Friedkin and co-star George Sanders. After Good Times flopped in 1968, Columbia Pictures immediately sold rights to their intended follow-up film Speedway to MGM. The couple were replaced by Elvis Presley and Nancy Sinatra. In 1969, another film, Chastity, starring Cher, written and produced by Sonny, was also a commercial bomb. Sonny and Cher's career had stalled by 1968 as album sales quickly dried up. Their gentle, easy-listening pop sound and drug-free life had become unpopular in an era increasingly consumed with the psychedelic rock of the evolving landscape of American pop culture during the late 1960s. Bono decided to forge ahead, carving a new career for the duo in Las Vegas resorts, where they sharpened their public persona with Cher as the wise-cracking singer, and Bono as the good-natured recipient of her insults. In reality, Bono controlled every aspect of their act, from the musical arrangements to the joke-writing. While success was slow to come, their luck improved when network TV talent scouts attended a show, noting their potential appeal for a variety series. Sonny and Cher also welcomed their first child, Chastity Sun Bono, born on March 4, 1969. Question: Did they star in any other films during this time?. Whats the answer?","completion":"During this period, Sonny and Cher starred in two films: Good Times (1967) and Chastity (1969). Good Times was a comedy-musical film directed by William Friedkin and featured Sonny and Cher playing themselves in a series of comedy sketches that loosely followed their attempts to make a fictional movie, which was essentially a spoof of their music career. Despite the endeavors of Friedkin, who later achieved fame for directing The French Connection (1971) and The Exorcist (1973), and the presence of renowned actor George Sanders, Good Times failed both critically and commercially, making it a significant disappointment for the duo. Chastity, released in 1969, was a drama film starring Cher and written and produced by Sonny. The movie revolved around the character of Chastity, played by Cher, a runaway who experiences various hardships and adventures while hitchhiking throughout the American Southwest. Unfortunately, Chastity performed poorly at the box office and received negative reviews, further stalling Sonny and Cher's careers during this time. Despite the unsuccessful foray into film, Sonny and Cher transitioned to a successful career in television, headlining their own popular variety show, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour, which aired from 1971 to 1974, and later The Sonny & Cher Show (1976–1977). These shows helped to re-establish their presence in the entertainment world and became the most prominent and enduring aspect of their careers during the 1970s."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We gave Tiger swimming lessons in our plastic wading pool. I taught the kitten the way Pa taught me: I threw him into water where he could not stand, and I watched, ready to grab him if he went under. Tiger did not thrash desperately like me. He merely paddled urgently for the edge of the plastic pool with his head high and his thin legs churning. Little Bit said, \\"Dog paddle,\\" and we all laughed. \\"Tiger paddle,\\" I said, and we all laughed some more, even Jordy. That was probably when Ma noticed the kitten swimming lessons and stopped them. Our swimming lessons happened in two places. When Pa took us, we went to Hawkins Springs behind Mrs. DeLyons' Fountain of Youth Motor Hotel. When Ma took us, we drove to Mermaid Springs State Park, where we would sometimes meet Mr. Drake. I liked Mermaid Springs better because I felt safe there. Ma could not swim, so she never made me jump off a dock into deep water, and she always insisted that I wear an orange styrofoam cylinder on my back like a skindiver or spaceman. Ma usually sat on a towel on the grass near the beach, reading a magazine or a book while tanning her legs. Every now and then she would call to us not to go too far or not to splash each other. When she wore her one-piece red swimming suit, she would come in up to her waist, then lower herself to her shoulders, being careful not to get her hair wet. On the rarest occasions, she would wear a swimming cap and float on her back in the shallow water. Often she stayed in her shorts and shirt, adding sunglasses and removing shoes as her concession to summer and the beach. Where did they get Tiger?

Despite his weakened technical mastery, his intellect and musical expression were still strong, and he continued to draw large audiences to his concerts. In Naples, Italy, in November 1956, just after the Soviets crushed the Hungarian uprising, as soon as he walked onto the stage the audience burst into wild applause and shouts of Viva l’Ungheria! (Italian for \\"Long live Hungary!\\"), delaying the concert for nearly fifteen minutes.In 1960 Szigeti officially retired from performing, and returned to Switzerland with his wife. There he devoted himself primarily to teaching, although he still traveled regularly to judge international violin competitions. Top-class students from all over Europe and the United States came to study under him. One of these students was Arnold Steinhardt, who spent the summer of 1962 with Szigeti. He came to the conclusion that \\"Joseph Szigeti was a template for the musician I would like to become: inquisitive, innovative, sensitive, feeling, informed\\".Toward the end of his life, Szigeti suffered from frail health. He was put on strict diets and had several stays in hospital, but his friends asserted that this did nothing to dampen his characteristic cheerfulness.

Believing the casual attitude displayed by the troops to be the primary source of their defeat, he quickly begins to set things to rights. Patton's belief in himself is unshakable, and there's only one way to get things done-his way. Quickly establishing discipline and routine, he commands his men with an iron fist. He also has great respect for the Germans he's up against, and has studied the tactics of Rommel in the field.In Berlin, the Germans are also assessing Patton.

At this point the narrator (Harry) introduces himself and apologizes, somewhat defensively, for not being very good. \\"Do you see any other narrators?\\" he asks.

Therefore, the Czech translation of the name \\"Omar\\" is also \\"Omar\\". However, if you'd like to know more about the name itself and its meaning in different cultures, here's some additional information: Omar is a popular male name in various cultures and is derived from Arabic. It is commonly found in Arabic-speaking regions, as well as Spanish-speaking, Persian-speaking, and Western countries. The name Omar has different meanings in various cultures, and it is related to the biblical name \\"Omer.\\" In Arabic, the meaning of the name Omar is \\"flourishing\\" or \\"longevity.\\" It is also the name of a historical figure, Umar ibn al-Khattab, who was one of the closest companions of the Prophet Muhammad and later became the second caliph of the Islamic Caliphate. Due to this association, the name Omar has gained prominence and popularity among Muslims. In Hebrew, the name Omer is derived from the root word meaning \\"flourish\\" or \\"prosper,\\" which has a similar meaning to the Arabic interpretation. It can also refer to the Omer period, which is a 49-day period of counting between Passover and Shavuot in the Jewish calendar. Additionally, in the Old Testament, Omer is an ancient unit of measurement for grain. In Spanish-speaking countries, the name Omar is used as-is and usually carries the same Arabic-derived meaning.

After a run-in with two locals, Neil (Sam Worthington) and Collin (Damien Richardson), the cruise winds to a close and Kate prepares to return the group to base. Everett (Robert Taylor) spots a flare in the distance, and Kate tells the group that they must investigate to determine whether someone needs rescuing. A few miles up river, they come across a half-sunken wreck when suddenly, something crashes into the tourists' boat, creating a crack in the side. Kate's only choice is to run it ashore on a small island in the middle of the river. The group disembarks and begins discussion of what to do when Everett is suddenly pulled into the water by an unseen predator and killed. Kate comes to the conclusion that they are in the heart of a large crocodile's territory and that it will be more aggressive than usual. The tourists realize that by nightfall, the tide will start to rise and in a matter of hours, their small island will be submerged. Neil and Collin arrive soon after, and as they near the island, an unseen force, smashes their boat and sinks it. Neil manages to swim to the island safely, but Collin disappears. As night falls, Neil suggests that he swims to the riverbank in order to string a rope between two trees, creating a zip-line that will allow the group to cross the river. Neil succeeds in setting up the rope and Mary Ellen (Caroline Brazier) crosses first, only to freeze in fear halfway across.

The BCCI will receive 405m (£319m) over the cycle of 2016 to 2023 - three times more than England's 139m (£110m), the second largest share. The International Cricket Council's board had voted 13-1 in favour of India being allocated 293m (£227m) in April. That led to reports India were planning to boycott the Champions Trophy. After the vote - on proposals for a new financial model intended to redistribute revenue more equally - the BCCI missed the deadline to name a squad for the tournament. A team was later selected, with India eventually losing in the final to Pakistan, but a BCCI statement explaining the delay said its secretary Amitabh Choudhary would continue to negotiate with the ICC, adding that it was \\"keeping its legal options open\\".

Ireland and Afghanistan, who on Thursday were granted Test status, will share 240m (£189m) of funding with the ICC's associate members. by BBC sports news correspondent Joe Wilson There is a logic in some circles of Indian cricket which runs; 'if we generate 70% of income in the global game, shouldn't we get 70% of the revenue?' It's an argument the ICC has had to confront, keeping India on board while trying to ensure some equity in financial distribution. After all, it is a global game (even if India - and the IPL in particular - is in a world of its own with a global marketplace within its own borders). Thus it was back in April that the ICC board voted in a financial package that saw India take 293m over the next cycle. Discontent followed, as did mutterings of not participating in the Champions Trophy. Now the compromise gives them 405m, which is significantly more, but nowhere near the figure approaching 600m hardliners may have wanted. Where does the extra money to distribute to India come from? After all, the ICC now has two new full members to fund. Well, Ireland and Afghanistan will see their income increased dramatically but will still be a long way behind Zimbabwe.

Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections.

Describe the sentiment embodied by this tweet.","completion":"The sentiment embodied by the tweet \\"Goodbye Twitter\\" can be perceived as a mixture of emotions that ultimately lead to the person's decision to depart from the popular social media platform. The sentiment can consist of various feelings such as frustration, sadness, liberation, disillusionment, and even relief. Here's an analysis of these emotions and why someone might express \\"Goodbye Twitter.\\" 1. Frustration: The user might be expressing their frustration with the Twitter platform or the behavior of other users on the platform. They may have faced negative or toxic interactions that have left them feeling annoyed or disheartened with their experience. These could include trolling, harassment, or cyberbullying. 2. Sadness: The user could be feeling a sense of sadness or loss as they bid farewell to Twitter. They may have invested time and energy into building relationships and engaging with others on the platform and could be mourning the end of those connections. 3. Liberation: Conversely, the user might experience a feeling of liberation as they decide to leave Twitter. In choosing to detach from the platform, the user may feel free from the constraints and pressures that come with maintaining an online persona or participating in digital exchanges. 4. Disillusionment: The tweet could also be an expression of the user's disillusionment with the nature of social media itself, where they believe that the platform is no longer serving its intended purpose of connecting people and fostering meaningful discourse. Instead, they may feel that Twitter has become more about promoting superficial or negative interactions, fostering echo chambers, or encouraging the spread of misinformation. 5. Relief: Lastly, the sentiment of \\"Goodbye Twitter\\" might also signify relief for the user, as they can now distance themselves from the constant bombardment of information, opinions, and updates that are inherent to social media platforms. By stepping away from Twitter, they might feel a sense of relief from the feeling of being perpetually connected and an alleviation of the pressures brought on by the digital world. Given the nature of the tweet, the sentiment analysis suggests the user's desire to break away from the platform for one or many reasons as outlined above.

Question: What does Tucker's foot become? Movie title: Black Sheep Movie plot: A young Henry Oldfield (Nick Fenton) lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand, with his father and older brother, Angus. After witnessing his father's pride on Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident. The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep. Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a mutant lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep. Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it.

Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\".

There may be some people who find that they have negative reactions to some of the foods on the diet – others may find that it simply is not suitable for their lifestyle. However, it is an excellent choice for most people because the health benefits are tremendous. Lower blood pressure, reduced cholesterol levels, reduced risk of diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, diabetes and much more. The diet is based on consuming wholesome fresh foods in their natural state and by cooking them in a healthy ways. Red meats are eaten only on occasion; sugar, processed foods filled with additives, fast foods, and junk food, which are the cause of so many illnesses in today’s world are simply not eaten. It should not be news that most health problems in the US can be attributed to a poor diet and a sedentary lifestyle. The Mediterranean diet solves both problems, if you let it. It provides the healthy nutritious foods your body needs for energy and well-being; plus, it incorporates exercise to solve the sedentary lifestyle issue. Let’s look at some of the potential difficulties. 1. The diet can be expensive.

Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump is sending a 4.4 trillion budget request to Congress that includes money for a southern border wall and building up the military, but is projected to increase the federal deficit by more than 1 trillion. White House officials all but acknowledged the proposal unveiled Monday has little chance of becoming law — Congress alone controls federal government spending. But the White House insisted the budget proposal still sends an important message about Trump's priorities. \\"This is a messaging document,\\" White House budget director Mick Mulvaney told reporters at a briefing Monday. The Trump budget calls for major cuts to domestic programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps. But the plan would still not balance the federal budget, in part because of reduced federal revenue due to tax cuts passed last year. Democrats widely rejected the plan. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the proposal a \\"brutal collection of broken promises and staggering cuts.\\" The proposal's failure to eliminate debt is also likely to upset some Republicans, who have traditionally opposed budget deficits. \\"It's simply adjusting to the Washington, D.C., we live in,\\" Mulvaney said, stressing that the new budget plan would help \\"turn the tide\\" on national debt. The White House proposal builds on the massive, two-year spending bill passed last week by Congress and signed by the president. That bill includes a major boost for the military, as well as domestic programs. Mulvaney, a former lawmaker and long-time opponent of federal debt, has acknowledged he likely would not have supported the bill were he still in Congress. But he said the new White House proposal does not mean that all of the money approved by Congress must be spent. \\"These are spending caps, these are not spending floors,\\" he said.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the solution: 1. Write down the given equation: -27*t = -24*t - 9 2. Add 24*t to both sides of the equation to eliminate the -24*t term from the right side of the equation and bring all the t terms to the left side: -27*t + 24*t = -24*t + 24*t - 9 Simplify: -3*t = -9 3. Now, to isolate t in the equation, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is -3: (-3*t) / (-3) = (-9) / (-3) 4.

Input: CONTEXT: Breads get their structure from glutens--a type of protein formed by the combination of glutenin with gliaten. Kneading and resting the dough helps the formation of glutens--I assume by shifting glutenin and gliatin molecules around, this increases the odds of bindings occurring.Oils can bind to glutenin and gliatin and inhibit these reactions, so fats--oils and butter--definitely play a role in the texture control.It prevents the dough from getting too elastic, which controls texture. This elasticity change would also change the maximum air bubble size. Altering resting times and yeast quantity also change these, but trading off for a different flavor.

Information: - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Heroes of Might and Magic III: The Restoration of Erathia (also known as Heroes III or HoMM3) is a turn-based strategy game developed by Jon Van Caneghem through New World Computing originally released for Microsoft Windows by the 3DO Company in 1999.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery. Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next...

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The two main tertiary institutions are the Australian National University (ANU) in Acton and the University of Canberra (UC) in Bruce, with over 10,500 and 8,000 full-time-equivalent students respectively. Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy. As a result, some schools closed during the 2006–08 period, while others were merged; the creation of combined primary and secondary government schools will proceed over the next decade. The new policy has provoked significant opposition. Most suburbs are planned to include a primary and a nearby preschool; these are usually located near open areas where recreational and sporting activities are easily available.

In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001--2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration. The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses. is it illegal to play zone in the nba?","completion":"No, it is not illegal to play zone defense in the NBA. Zone defenses were once prohibited in the NBA, but this changed during the 2001-2002 season when the league allowed teams to adopt zone defenses as part of their defensive strategies. Although zone defenses are now permitted, most NBA teams do not rely heavily on them as their primary defensive strategy. One reason for the limited use of zone defenses in the NBA is the existence of the defensive three-second violation rule. This rule makes it challenging to employ zone defenses effectively, as it prohibits a defensive player from being in the key area (also known as the paint) for more than three seconds without actively guarding an offensive player. Since traditional zone defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to prevent dribble penetration, the defensive three-second violation rule can hinder the success of these strategies. Despite these potential obstacles, there are still NBA teams that use zone defenses successfully, such as the Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle. The Mavericks have been known to employ zone defenses as part of their defensive game plan. In conclusion, while zone defenses are not illegal in the NBA, their usage is relatively limited due to the restrictions imposed by the defensive three-second violation rule. However, some teams do occasionally incorporate zone defenses into their strategies to disrupt opposing offenses and capitalize on the elements of surprise and versatility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

US faces calls to ‘walk away’ from Iran talks A leading Republican critic of the Iranian nuclear talks is calling on the U.S. to \\"walk away\\" from the table after negotiators missed a key deadline, while other lawmakers joined in voicing concern that Iran could extract critical final-hour concessions in the scramble to salvage an agreement. Negotiations resumed in Switzerland on Wednesday but were almost immediately beset by competing claims, just hours after diplomats abandoned a March 31 deadline to reach the outline of a deal and agreed to press on. And as the latest round hit the week mark, three of the six foreign ministers involved left the talks with prospects for agreement remaining uncertain. Amid the confusion, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told Fox News he's concerned the framework of a deal could allow Iran keep its uranium stockpiles and continue to enrich uranium in an underground bunker. \\"You have to be willing to walk away from the table and to reapply leverage to Iran,\\" Cotton said. \\"And the fact that they're not willing to do that, that we're still sitting in Switzerland negotiating when three of our negotiating partners have already left just demonstrates to Iran that they can continue to demand dangerous concessions from the West.\\" Speaking on MSNBC, former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean seemed to agree. He said that while President Obama is \\"right\\" to seek a deal, it might be time to \\"step away\\" from the table and make clear that the U.S. is not backing off key positions -- including on Iran's uranium stockpile and the pace of sanctions relief. \\"I am worried about this,\\" Dean said. Rep. Martha McSally, R-Ariz., also told Fox News \\"we're potentially [legitimizing] them having a nuclear infrastructure.\\" She added: \\"We don't know exactly what's behind closed doors.\\" Despite all sides agreeing to blow by their deadline in pursuit of a rough agreement, even the White House threatened to abandon the talks if Iran wouldn't budge. \\"If they're unwilling to make those kinds of commitments that give us that assurance -- and by us I mean not just the United States, I mean the international community -- then we'll have to walk away from the negotiating table and consider what other options may be available to us, and there is certainly the possibility that that could happen,\\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Tuesday. Earnest indicated Wednesday that's still an option but called the scenario \\"hypothetical\\" as talks are \\"making some progress.\\" He said talks continue to be \\"productive\\" but that \\"we have not yet received the specific, tangible commitments we and the international community require.\\" On Tuesday, negotiators had been trying to agree to simply a joint statement that could justify talks continuing until a final June deadline. Iran's deputy foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters that if the sides make progress on the text of a joint statement, then that could be issued by the end of the day. But he suggested the statement would contain no specifics. A senior western official quickly pushed back, saying that nothing about a statement had been decided and that Iran's negotiating partners would not accept a document that contained no details. The German Foreign Ministry tweeted that \\"nothing is agreed,\\" although \\"progress is visible.\\" Araghchi named differences on sanctions relief on his country as one dispute, along with disputes on Iran's uranium enrichment-related research and development. \\"Definitely our research and development program on high-end centrifuges should continue,\\" he told Iranian television. The U.S. and its negotiating partners want to crimp Iranian efforts to improve the performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium because advancing the technology could let Iran produce material that could be used to arm a nuclear weapon much more quickly than at present. The exchanges reflected significant gaps between the sides, and came shortly after the end of the first post-deadline meeting between U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, his British and German counterparts and Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammed Javad Zarif in the Swiss town of Lausanne. They and their teams were continuing a marathon effort to bridge still significant gaps and hammer out a framework accord that would serve as the basis for a final agreement by the end of June. Eager to avoid a collapse in the discussions, the United States and others claimed late Tuesday that enough progress had been made to warrant an extension after six days of intense bartering. But the foreign ministers of China, France and Russia all departed Lausanne overnight, although the significance of their absence was not clear. Kerry postponed his planned Tuesday departure to stay in Lausanne, and an Iranian negotiator said his team would stay \\"as long as necessary\\" to clear the remaining hurdles. Officials say their intention is to produce a joint statement outlining general political commitments to resolving concerns about Iran's nuclear program in exchange for sanctions relief. In addition, they are trying to fashion other documents that would lay out in more detail the steps they must take by June 30 to meet those goals. The additional documents would allow the sides to make the case that the next round of talks will not simply be a continuation of negotiations that have already been twice extended since an interim agreement between Iran, the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany was concluded in November 2013. Obama and other leaders, including Iran's, have said they are not interested in a third extension. But if the parties agree only to a broad framework that leaves key details unresolved, Obama can expect stiff opposition at home from members of Congress who want to move forward with new, stiffer Iran sanctions. Lawmakers had agreed to hold off on such a measure through March while the parties negotiated. The White House says new sanctions would scuttle further diplomatic efforts to contain Iran's nuclear work and possibly lead Israel to act on threats to use military force to accomplish that goal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu continued to question the course of talks on Wednesday. He said Iran views Israel's destruction as non-negotiable, \\"but evidently giving Iran's murderous regime a clear path to the bomb is negotiable. This is unconscionable,\\" he said. \\"At the same time, Iran is accelerating its campaign of terror, subjugation and conquest throughout the region, most recently in Yemen.\\" Netanyahu said a better deal would \\"significantly roll back Iran's nuclear infrastructure\\" and link a lifting of restrictions on its nuclear program to \\"a change in Iran's behavior.\\" The Associated Press contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"This text revolves around the U.S.-Iran nuclear talks, with a heavy emphasis on political reactions to, and the potentially adverse outcomes of, the negotiations. Amongst the most important aspects are: 1) Missing the Key Deadline: Negotiators missed a crucial March 31 deadline to reach the outline of the agreement. Despite this, the discussion continued, indicating a commitment from the negotiators. Some critics were alarmed, however, suggesting that this could lead to harmful concessions from the U.S. due to a desperate scramble to seal a deal. 2) Differing Claims: After the resumption of negotiations, conflicting claims vexed the progress. For instance, Iran's deputy foreign minster Abbas Araghchi implied that the US is willing to move forward without a detailed, joint statement, while a senior Western official contradicted that assertion. 3) Departure of Foreign Ministers: Three of the six foreign ministers left the talks, which cast more uncertainty over their prospects. 4) U.S Domestic Reactions: Strong concerns were expressed by several U.S. officials. Sen. Tom Cotton (R-Ark), and Rep. Martha McSally (R-Ariz) disapproved of the ongoing negotiations, fearing that the U.S. was granting too many concessions. Former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean also voiced his worries and appeared to align with Republican critics. This cross-party consensus on potential issues with the negotiation may make it harder for a deal to be ratified domestically. 5) Opposition from Israel: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reiterated his previous concerns about the talks and Iran's intentions, prodding for a deal that could restrict Iran's nuclear advancements and change its international demeanor. 6) The White House's Stance: Despite the mounting domestic and international pressures, the White House opted for patience and chose to persist with negotiations. They conveyed a willingness to walk away if Iran does not provide sufficient commitments, but emphasized that they were making some progress. 7) Specific Concerns in the Talks: The U.S. aims to curb Iranian efforts to improve performance of centrifuges that enrich uranium. Iran, however, wants relief from sanctions. 8) Sustainability of Talks: There seems to be a unanimous unwillingness to extend the talks for a third time, after already being extended twice since reaching an interim agreement in 2013. But opposition from Congress, who might impose new sanctions on Iran, threatens the diplomatic path. 9) Iran’s Behavior: The reiterations of Iranian-backed violence in Yemen and general regional instability are pointed to as reasons to distrust Iran’s intentions behind the negotiating table."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Palmer was born to Doris (Morrison) and Milfred Jerome \\"Deacon\\" Palmer (1905-1976) in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, a working-class steel mill town. He learned golf from his father, who had suffered from polio at a young age and was head professional and greenskeeper at Latrobe Country Club, which allowed young Arnold to accompany his father as he maintained the course. Palmer attended Wake Forest College on a golf scholarship. He left upon the death of close friend Bud Worsham (1929-1950) and enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard, where he served for three years, 1951-1954. Palmer was married to the former Winnie Walzer (1934-1999) for 45 years; the couple had two daughters. She died at age 65 on November 20, 1999, from complications due to ovarian cancer. His grandson, Sam Saunders, is a professional golfer who grew up playing at Bay Hill, where he won the club championship at age 15. He attended Clemson University in South Carolina on a golf scholarship and turned pro in 2008. Saunders stated that Palmer's family nickname is \\"Dumpy\\". He married his second wife, Kathleen Gawthrop, in 2005 in Hawaii. During the spring and summer months, Palmer resided in Latrobe, and he spent winters in Orlando and La Quinta, California. He first visited Orlando in 1948 during a college match. When he took up residence in Orlando, Palmer helped the city become a recreation destination, \\"turning the entire state of Florida into a golfing paradise\\". That included building one of the premier events on the PGA Tour there along with his contributing to new hospitals. On hearing about Palmer's death, Tiger Woods said, \\"My kids were born at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies, and his philanthropic work will be remembered along with his accomplishments in golf.\\" Arnold Palmer Boulevard is named in his honor. Palmer had supported Scottish football club Rangers F.C. since his boyhood. He was a member of the Freemasons since 1958. Palmer created the Arnie's Army Charitable Foundation to help children and youth. The Foundation saw the creation of the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women & Babies Center, The Howard Philips Center for Children & Families, the Arnold Palmer Hospital for Children, and the Winnie Palmer Nature Reserve. He was also a spokesman for Hertz Rent-a-Car with O. J. Simpson. During his playing career, Arnold Palmer smoked cigarettes, which caused him to battle an addiction to nicotine. He noted that many of his colleagues smoked, and he even endorsed the product in television commercials. Later in life, Palmer made a complete about-face and urged the public to give up smoking.

Given the question: Given the following passage \\"Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people.

Background: Colbert was born in Washington, D.C., the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family. He spent his early years in Bethesda, Maryland. He grew up on James Island, South Carolina. Colbert and his siblings, in descending order by age, are James III, Edward, Mary, William, Margo, Thomas, Jay, Elizabeth, Paul, Peter, and Stephen. Context: While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close's ImprovOlympic at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long-form improvisation, rather than improvisational comedy. \\"I wasn't gonna do Second City\\", Colbert later recalled, \\"because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv - there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people\\". After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job. A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs. Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free. Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly. Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for Steve Carell. It was there he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello, with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first - Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as \\"an illiterate thug\\" - but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility. When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions, Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show Exit 57. The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series. Following the cancelation of Exit 57, Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on The Dana Carvey Show, alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, and also Robert Smigel, Charlie Kaufman, Louis C.K., and Dino Stamatopoulos, among others. The series, described by one reviewer as \\"kamikaze satire\\" in \\"borderline-questionable taste\\", had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes. Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for Saturday Night Live with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, The Ambiguously Gay Duo, to SNL from The Dana Carvey Show; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for VH1 and MTV, before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for Good Morning America. Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to The Daily Show's then-producer, Madeline Smithberg, who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997.

George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner.

He noted that the album contained less \\"rough edges and attitude\\" than predecessor Vulture Street, and likening the album more to Odyssey Number Five. Sputnikmusic's James Bishop agreed, claiming the band should be concerned by the \\"lack of experimentation or ambition\\" on the album. He again stated that the album was consistent, noting that \\"there actually isn't a bad song present\\".

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Get all of your stretching done first before you start singing. Move your neck in slow circles to stretch those muscles, or switch between a big smile and an open mouth in the shape of an ‘O’ to stretch your face. Do each exercise 5-10 times to stretch your muscles well. Bend your head back and flex your tongue outwards to stretch your throat. Do 5 big yawns to stretch the muscles around your mouth. Focus on one stretch if you don't have much time, or do 5 of each exercise to practice multiple stretches in one sitting. This is when you make your voice imitate the sound of an ambulance’s siren, moving up to the higher notes, back down to lower notes, and then back up again in one continuous sound. This will help you find out what your full range is while stretching your vocal cords. These help you reach your maximum high note by trying to imitate the high pitched noise of a siren. Arpeggios are useful exercises that help you transition from the different major and minor scales. Singing arpeggios to different vowels or other sounds is a great way to extend your vocal range. Go online to find videos of arpeggio scales for you to sing along with, helping you practice. You might sing \\"ee-ee-ee-ee-ee,\\" with the first and last \\"ee\\" being the lowest and the middle one being the highest note. Instead of being a continuous sound, arpeggios have very small pauses between each note. Vocal slides are a great way for you to gently reach high notes before coming back down. Use your voice to slide from a low note to a high note, and then back down as if your voice was on a swing. Vocal slides are more controlled than vocal sirens, though they sometimes sound similar. Try humming your vocal slides or choosing a sound like “wooo” or “ahhh.” Vocal slides help relax your throat, making it easier for you to reach higher notes. While most of your early practicing should be focused on reaching the high notes briefly and then going back down, after you’ve mastered this skill, you can go even further. Once you reach your highest note, try to hold it for several seconds before going back down the scale.

The encoding material sits atop a thicker substrate (usually polycarbonate) which makes up the bulk of the disc and forms a dust defocusing layer. The encoding pattern follows a continuous, spiral path covering the entire disc surface and extending from the innermost track to the outermost track. The data is stored on the disc with a laser or stamping machine, and can be accessed when the data path is illuminated with a laser diode in an optical disc drive which spins the disc at speeds of about 200 to 4,000 RPM or more, depending on the drive type, disc format, and the distance of the read head from the center of the disc (inner tracks are read at a higher disc speed). Most optical discs exhibit a characteristic iridescence as a result of the diffraction grating formed by its grooves. This side of the disc contains the actual data and is typically coated with a transparent material, usually lacquer. The reverse side of an optical disc usually has a printed label, sometimes made of paper but often printed or stamped onto the disc itself. Unlike the 3-inch floppy disk, most optical discs do not have an integrated protective casing and are therefore susceptible to data transfer problems due to scratches, fingerprints, and other environmental problems. - , formerly known as , is a Japanese multinational electronics corporation headquartered in Kadoma, Osaka, Japan. - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

Detailed Instructions: Classify the given hotel review based on the sentiment it expresses into two classes: negative and positive. Q: I stayed two nights at the Hilton Chicago. That was the last time I will be staying there. When I arrived, I could not believe that the hotel did not offer free parking. They wanted at least 10. What am I paying for when I stay there for the night? The website also touted the clean linens. The room was clean and I believe the linens were clean. The problem was with all of the down pillows etc. Don't they know that people have allergies? I also later found out that this hotel allows pets. I think that this was another part of my symptoms. If you like a clean hotel without having allergy attacks I suggest you opt for somewhere else to stay. I did not like how they nickel and dimed me in the end for parking. Beware hidden costs. I will try somewhere else in the future. Not worth the money or the sneezing all night. A:","completion":"Based on the content of the review, the sentiment expressed by the reviewer seems to be negative. Step 1: Analyzing the review: The reviewer mentions several elements that lead to dissatisfaction with the hotel - including the lack of free parking, allergy issues triggered by down pillows, extra charges at the end of the stay, and allowing pets which they considered as leading to allergic symptoms. Step 2: Weighing the positive and negative sentiment: The reviewer does mention that the hotel was clean, and there was a belief that linens were clean but these positives are overshadowed by the multiple negatives. Step 3: Classifying based on degree of sentiment: The fact that the reviewer ends the testimonial stating that they will try other places in the future, indicating they would not return to this hotel, is a strong signal of overall negative sentiment. After going through these steps, we can confidently classify this hotel review as negative. The negative sentiment expressed here is stronger and more plentiful than the positive sentiment, leading to this overall classification."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

On the other hand, if you enjoy British crime mysteries, following clues and seeing how they all logically fall into place at the end, you'll be very disappointed. Here are some of the logical inconsistencies that lead to that disappointment: * While the police utilize the CCTV cameras early on to gather clues about the mystery, the huge truck that stopped and blocked the children's view just before her disappearance doesn't get caught on camera. This is a critical piece of the mystery. It's inconsistent to have the car the children were in caught on camera and not the big truck that is so critical to the mystery. * The movie goes to great lengths to show the sophistication of the equipment in tracking down the children's movements but misses the opportunity to utilize the same sophisticated equipment is tracking down vehicles that may have entered the crime scene from camera-visible locations adjacent to the crime scene as part of developing clues. * In England, driving is on the left. The director goes out of his way to have the car at the crime scene park on the right, several meters away from the flower kiosk, when it could have easily parked immediately behind, or even on the side; as the huge truck did. * The police forensics team is so meticulous as to find a discarded cell phone in a sewer drain several miles from the scene of the crime, but can't find any blood evidence from the head injury right at the crime scene, even though they secured the scene just hours after the disappearance and with no intervening rainfall. * Search dogs were not used at all to find the missing children; this from the country that is well known for developing the hound dog for search and hunting. * It is illogical that such a highly publicized news story would not turn up the presumably innocent truck driver that stopped at the flower kiosk. * It is illogical that the mother would go to such extremes and expend so much effort to leave carpet fiber clues under her fingernails for her eventual murder investigators even coaxing her daughter to do the same-- while she simply could not have crawled out of the unguarded mobile home. If she had enough sense about her to ask her daughter to get carpet fibers under her nails, she could of just as easily asked her daughter to call out for help or even leave the mobile home that was in a crowded residential park. * The suspect that abducted the little girl was portrayed as mentally slow/dimwitted --justifying his unknowingly drowning of the mother but, he was smart enough not to cooperate with the police and also fully exercise his rights not to self-incriminate.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device But when he hosts an IAAF council conference call on Friday evening at a secret location in London, he will be aware that not only is his reputation on the line, but that of his sport. Coe and his 26 council colleagues must decide whether to suspend Russia from international athletics as punishment for the World Anti-Doping Agency's (Wada) damning report. They are almost certain to do so. This is not a decision to take lightly. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), the sport's governing body, has never before banned a nation for cheating. A few countries have been suspended for government interference, but not for state-sponsored doping. And this is Russia, one of the richest and most powerful sporting nations on earth, both as host and medallist. Next year alone, Russia is meant to be hosting May's World Race Walking championships in Cheboksary, and the Junior World Championships in Kazan in July. Both may have to be staged elsewhere if the threat of a suspension is carried out. And what sort of message would isolation send out with the 2018 World Cup on the horizon? But given that the IAAF itself is reeling from devastating accusations that it was an accomplice to the cheating, the pressure to be seen to act decisively, to set a proper example and to establish a real deterrent - as requested by one of the Wada report authors Dick Pound - has become intense. The IAAF's Constitutional Objects include \\"eradicating doping from the sport and safeguarding the authenticity and integrity of athletics\\". Russia appears to have flouted such a pledge, so a suspension seems certain. And with Pound admitting that all this is merely \\"the tip of the iceberg\\", if a precedent is set, then further bans in other countries and in other sports could well follow. A hearing will have to be held before any provisional suspension is fully signed off, but with that regarded as a formality, the main question of course is when such a ban would be lifted. The IAAF may well make the suspension indefinite, but set out conditions that Russia must meet before it is allowed to be reinstated. The sense is Russia will simply do what is required, say it has cleaned up its act, and be back in time for the big one - the Rio Olympics - next summer, making it look like a mere slap on the wrist. That is hardly something that will help win back confidence in the sport - or its new leader. Many will want the Russian federation to receive the same punishment that athletes get for cheating - a four-year ban. But International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach has already said he expects to see Russia participating in Rio. Even Pound suggested something similar. And with Russian President Vladimir Putin striking a rather conciliatory tone, it is easy to see where this is heading. In March 2016, the IAAF council will meet again in Cardiff. Do not be surprised if that is when Russia is able to prove it is now Wada-compliant again, and allowed back into the fold, to the inevitable howls of protest that athletics has not been tough enough. But whatever the IAAF decides to do, for its president Lord Coe, a dream job as the most powerful man in athletics risks becoming a nightmare. Media playback is not supported on this device The fact he was an IAAF vice-president for eight years before taking over from Lamine Diack - now under investigation by French prosecutors for accepting bribes to cover up doping - has led many to question whether he was either complicit in the wrongdoing, or, as he insists, just ignorant of it. Either way, it does not reflect well on a man who must now somehow rebuild trust in his sport. The last thing Coe needs is to appear like track and field's version of Fifa's Michel Platini or cycling's Pat McQuaid - an insider tarnished by association. Those close to Coe say his role as vice-president involved just a few meetings a year at the IAAF, that for most of that time he was far too busy organising the London 2012 Olympics to be across all that was going on in Monaco and he is genuinely stunned and horrified by what has been exposed. They also point out the criminal investigation into extortion allegations restricts what he can say and he should be judged on what he does now he is in power, rather than during his election campaign, when winning votes was the priority. All this may be true. But others make the point Coe has not helped himself. Why, they ask, did he lavish praise on his \\"spiritual\\" leader Diack in August when he succeeded him, despite plenty of warning signs - the outgoing president's son (along with other senior IAAF officials) had stood down last December, already under investigation by the IAAF's own ethics committee. Why did he describe media reports of a cover-up as \\"a declaration of war\\", and pour scorn on the \\"so-called experts\\" used by German broadcaster ARD and the Sunday Times to analyse leaked blood samples? Coe has said \\"it was not a criticism of any journalism or any media, it was simply a reaction to the selective use of data to call into question the reputation of clean athletes\\". But why does he continue to refuse an interview with Hajo Seppelt, the German investigative journalist who exposed the scandal? And why - when the IAAF had already charged several senior officials (including its anti-doping chief), and when it was already widely known that Wada's report would be terrible news for Russia - did he tell the BBC's Sportsweek programme on Sunday he would rather not ban countries - before hearing the full commission report? He was then forced into a humiliating U-turn the following evening, when a windswept Coe arrived at TV studios in Millbank, Westminster, and was put through a series of media grillings. During a long and overwhelmingly successful career as an athlete, politician and administrator, Coe has faced plenty of challenges, from chairing Fifa's ethics committee to advising former Conservative party leader William Hague. But nothing quite like this. The aura appears to have gone. The judgment seems, at times, to be missing. Despite concerns over a potential conflict of interest, Coe continues to refuse to give up his £100,000-a-year role as a special ambassador for sportswear giant Nike. Coe insists the arrangement is merely to support a corporate social responsibility project. And it is important to note the IAAF presidency is an unpaid role, so he has to earn a living elsewhere. But it does not help that Nike supplies Russian athletes with their kit, or that Coe appears to have a permanent parking bay at the company's headquarters. It does not help that their leading coach Alberto Salazar is under investigation by the United States Anti-Doping Agency (Usada) over alleged doping violations, which he denies. It does not help that they sponsor two-time doper, US sprinter Justin Gatlin. It does not help that Eugene, a city with close links to the company, was awarded the 2021 athletics World Championships without a vote. Paul Sinton-Hewitt is the founder of Parkrun, the increasingly popular, non-profit running movement, that boasts two million registered members and 125,000 weekly runners. He describes Coe's Nike links as \\"unbelievable and bizarre\\". \\"Seb says he is doing everything in his power to clean up the sport,\\" he told the BBC. \\"I am prepared to give him the benefit of the doubt and to support him if he disinvests himself from any organisations which might have an influence over any decision that he may have to make. This means he should remove all personal ties with Nike - and with (sports marketing company) CSM. \\"Without this break I will continue to question his independence. He has to be whiter than white. It is absolutely wrong he should be getting income from anyone who could force him to be compromised. He now has very little time to prove he's the right man for the job.\\" Others are equally critical. Renee Anne Shirley, the whistleblower who exposed Jamaica's lack of testing levels told the Herald that Coe \\"had his head in the sand\\". British 400m runner Martyn Rooney - Team GB's captain at the World Championships in Beijing this summer - told the BBC: \\"It is pretty disrespectful to everyone involved in athletics to believe that the vice-president did not know what was going on within IAAF. \\"That is his job and if he believes he did not know what was going on he has not been doing his job properly.\\" Coe is not responsible for the crisis athletics finds itself in. It is not his fault that the worst doping scandal in sports history has been exposed so early in his tenure, or that athletics was already struggling for fans and sponsors with competition from much bigger and more popular sports, let alone now. It is not his fault that doping is a global problem. He is not to blame for the fact Wada seems drastically underfunded, and chronically compromised by a lack of independence from the very sports it has to get tough with. He is not to blame that the IOC signed a 7.75bn (£5.1bn) deal with NBC last year but only gives about 15m (£9.9m) a year to Wada (half its budget), or that Wada is not responsible for the testing of samples, with many labs under the jurisdiction of national governments or federations, with the obvious potential for a conflict of interest. It is not his fault that lifetime bans are not legally enforceable, and that in so few countries is doping a criminal offence. To be fair to Coe, he has been calling for an independent body to handle drug testing in track and field for some time. Media playback is not supported on this device It was Wada who failed to act on the information offered to its officials by Russian whistleblower Vitaly Stepanov back in 2013, and then an expose about Russian doping in the Mail on Sunday the same year. Coe cannot force the anti-doping community to follow UK Anti-Doping's lead and place more emphasis on intelligence and investigation. It is not down to him that the resources for testing regimes around the world are so inconsistent, and so simple for the cheats to evade, or that sports appear so incapable of running themselves properly, so vulnerable to people for whom power and wealth seem more important than integrity. It is not down to him that the boom in the money and status of sport has so incentivised cheating and political exploitation. In time these issues must be addressed but right now they offer Coe little comfort. He got his way and was elected to the job he wanted. Now it is his responsibility to salvage whatever credibility is left in his sport. He owes it to the clean athletes around the world who dedicate their lives to honest competition. He owes it to the volunteers who give up time for the sport they love and to the fans who will watch the action in Rio and wonder whether they can believe what they are seeing any longer. Athletics is yet to hit rock-bottom. That will come in due course when Wada's commission reveals more sordid details of this unbelievable scandal. This goes beyond Russia. But at least this week's events could just be a catalyst for change. Coe said he wanted to help his sport. Now he has the chance. Once, Coe may have thought he would be remembered for winning races. Later, that the triumph of London 2012 was how he would be judged. Instead, it turns out his days of reckoning are now. Sadly the task is proving harder than he could ever have imagined. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"There's a big meeting happening with important athletics people. They need to decide if they should punish Russia and not let their athletes compete for a while because they cheated with drugs. This is a difficult decision because it might upset the upcoming events and it's never been done before. It's also important because it could affect other countries and sports later on. The man in charge, Lord Coe, is being criticized because some people think he knew about the cheating and didn't do anything.

Context: With both teams coming off of wins, the 2-1 Green Bay Packers will travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota to face the 3-0 Minnesota Vikings in a Monday Night Football showdown. The Vikings will be led by starting quarterback Brett Favre. The game started with the Packers in possession. After the offense moved the ball consistently down field down to the Minnesota 24-yard line, but Aaron Rodgers was then sacked by two Vikings defenders for a 9-yard loss and fumbled the football. The ball was recovered by Vikings linebacker Chad Greenway at the Vikings 33-yard line. After the turnover, Brett Favre took to the field clad in purple. The Vikings too seemed to also be able to move the ball just as effectively with multiple short runs by running back Adrian Peterson and throws by Brett Favre. The Vikings finally capped the 12-play, 67-yard drive with a 1-yard touchdown pass short left from Brett Favre to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. With the score, the Vikings took the early 7-0 lead. The Packers then took to the field looking to make up for the turnover on their first possession of the game. On 3rd and 5 after an incompletion to Greg Jennings and a 5-yard run by fullback John Kuhn, Aaron Rodgers fired a pass to second year tight end Jermichael Finley deep middle in which he caught around the Vikings 35-yard line and then ran the ball the rest of the way into the end zone for a Packers 62-yard touchdown. With the extra point the game was now tied 7-7. The Vikings took to the field again, but after two incompletions and a completion for a 5-yard loss the Vikings were forced to punt. The Packers then took over at the Minnesota 43-yard line. The Packers again managed to move the ball quite effectively against the Vikings defense but like the first drive of the game, the drive ended with a turn over. This time it was an attempted short right pass to Greg Jennings from Aaron Rodgers that was intercepted by Antoine Winfield at the Vikings 23-yard line. Similar to the last drive after the Packers turned over the ball, the Vikings managed to move the ball effortlessly down to the Packers 14-yard line in which Brett Favre then connected with wide receiver Sidney Rice for Favre's second touchdown strike against the Packers. With the score the Vikings retook the lead at 14-7. The Packers then took to the field looking again to make up for another costly turnover, but the offense failed to move the ball and Aaron Rodgers was sacked on 3rd down forcing the Packers to punt. The Packers would level the score though on the Vikings next offensive play of the game. Vikings running back Adrian Peterson ran wide left and was stacked up behind the line of scrimmage. While he was being stopped, Packers rookie linebacker Clay Matthews ripped the ball away from Peterson and returned the ball untouched 42 yards for the Packers tying touchdown at 14-14. On the Vikings next possession looking to retake the lead, Favre and company compiled together a drive highlighted by a 43-yard pass from Brett Favre to Percy Harvin down to the Packers 3-yard line. On the next play, Favre dropped back to pass and the ball was intercepted by Packers cornerback Charles Woodson in the center of the end zone but the play was nullified by a defensive pass interference call paired with a defensive offside penalty. The pass inference penalty was accepted and the ball was placed on the Packers 1-yard line. On the next play Vikings running back Adrian Peterson rushed up the middle for the score to give the Vikings a 21-14 lead. The Packers took over with little time remaining but still attempted to put points on the board. After a 14-yard pass to Greg Jennings down to the Vikings 48-yard line, Aaron Rodgers took the team's final timeout with 1 second remaining. On the final play of the half Rodgers tossed a deep ball into a group of players the right corner of the end zone but the ball fell incomplete ending the half 21-14 in favor of the Vikings. The Vikings received the ball at the start of the second half, and managed to still move the ball effectively against the Packers defense that was getting virtually no pressure on Brett Favre. On second and ten at the Green Bay 44-yard line, Brett Favre connected with Jeff Dugan to the Green Bay 31 for 25 yards and then capped the drive with a 31-yard strike to receiver Bernard Berrian deep left for a touchdown to extend the Vikings lead to 28-14. The Packers then took to the field and managed to move the ball down field highlighted by a 24-yard pass to Donald Driver and a 20-yard pass to Ryan Grant down to the Minnesota 5-yard line setting the team up first and goal at the Vikings 5-yard line. On first down Ryan Grant ran up the middle for a four-yard gain. On second down the Packers tried a trick play that looked like a run wide right for Grant, but Rodgers handed the ball off to fullback John Kuhn who ran up the middle but the Vikings were not fooled and Kuhn's attempt to score a touchdown was stopped when his knee hit down at the line of scrimmage before lunging into the endzone. On third down, Rodgers connected with tight end Jermichael Finley who ran an out route to the right, but was tackled right after the reception at the line of scrimmage by Vikings linebacker Ben Leber for no gain. The Packers then choose to go for it on fourth down rather than settling the field goal. On the play, Rodgers looked right, then back left and passed to Packers tight end Donald Lee short middle, but Lee failed to catch the pass resulting in loss of downs and the Vikings took over possession at their 1-yard line. On the Vikings next drive that continued on into the final quarter of play, the Vikings managed to move the ball out of their own end zone down to their own 37-yard line, but the drive stalled on a 5-yard completed screen pass short of the first down marker on 3rd and 10. The Packers took over at their own 15-yard line, and Rodgers was sacked on first down. On second down Ryan Grant ran up the middle for 10 yards making up for the lost yardage on the sack and more. The drive came to an end though on the next play when quarterback Aaron Rodgers pretended to walk toward the sideline and the ball was directly snapped to backup running back DeShawn Wynn. Wynn managed to gain 6 yards on 3rd and 7, but falling a yard short on the trick play the Packers were forced to punt. The Viking offense then took to the field again, but the Packers defense held the Vikings on third down and they too were forced to punt. After another stellar punt by Vikings punter Chris Kluwe, the Packers were again pinned deep in their own end at their own 1-yard line. After two unsuccessful plays for no gain on first and second down, Aaron Rodgers was sacked by Jared Allen at the goal line and fumbled the football. The ball was recovered by the Vikings, but the ruling on the field was challenged by the Packers that the ground had caused the fumbled. The ruling on the field was then changed to a safety rather than giving the Vikings the ball at the Packers 1-yard line and the Vikings extended their lead to 30-14. After the safety the Packers kicked off and the Vikings took over at their 40-yard line.The Packers managed to again hold the Vikings defense to a three and out and the ball was punted back to the Packers. On the Packers next possession, Ryan Grant started off the drive with a 15-yard run, and Jermichael Finley caught a 37-yard pass from Rodgers two plays later. Three plays later after an 11-yard rush by Aaron Rodgers and an incomplete pass, Rodgers connected with second year wide receiver Jordy Nelson for a 33-yard touchdown strike. After a failed two-point conversion pass to Ryan Grant the Vikings lead was decreased to 30-20. The Packers then tried a failed onside kick and the Vikings took over the ball with 3:39 remaining in the game, but due to poor clock management by the Vikings they were held to a three and out and only had run 29 seconds off of the game clock after the punt. The Packers took over at their own 18-yard line with 3:10 remaining in the contest. On first play of the drive, Rodgers connected with Donald Driver for 10 yards which with the reception tied Sterling Sharpe's club career high receptions total with 595. On third and 12 at their own 26-yard line, Rodgers hit James Jones in the middle of the field in which he then took the ball to the Minnesota 40 for 34 yards. Five plays later after Rodgers threw the ball away on third down, Mason Crosby converted a 31-yard field goal to decrease the Vikings lead to 30-23. The Packers attempted their second onside kick of the game with 55 seconds remaining, but the kick was again recovered by the Vikings ending all chances of a comeback. The Vikings then lined up in the victory formation and ran out the clock to defeat the Packers 30-23. During the contest, Packers return specialist Will Blackmon suffered a season ending knee injury. With the loss, the Packers go into their bye week with a 2-2 record sitting in third place in the NFC North behind the 4-0 Minnesota Vikings and the 3-1 Chicago Bears. Question: Who won the game?

First -born children receive all the attention from their parents. Most families have twice as many photos of a first-born than any other child. Parents usually give first-born more responsibility and depend on them to take care of younger brothers and sisters. As a result, first -born are often responsible, hard-working, and jealous . They often want to do well at school and work. There are more first-born American Presidents, for example, George Bush, George Washington, and Lyndon Baines Johnson than second or last-born children. When a second child arrives, parents are more relaxed. The second child has to compete with the first-born for the parents' attention and love. Their children often choose different sports and hobbies to do well at school and work, but have to be creative to get their family's attention. They are often friendly and cool.

Detailed Instructions: Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

I recently visited what I had heard was a popular local spot, and I am compelled to share my negative review about my experience as a caution for others considering a visit. To say I am disappointed would be a massive understatement. Upon arrival, the first impression was less than positive, and it was all downhill from there. First and foremost, the parking was nothing short of a nightmare. With limited spaces available, I ended up driving around for over 20 minutes to find a spot several blocks away—clearly a sign of poor planning and impractical design. A disorganized valet service added to the mix, further contributing to the chaos and frustration. Upon entering the establishment, I was met with an overwhelming and pungent odor. The smell was a combination of damp and stale, which was not only unpleasant but also raised concerns about the cleanliness of the place. I had hoped that the further I ventured inside, the better the atmosphere would become, but I was sadly mistaken. The decor was reminiscent of a garage sale, a hodgepodge of outdated and worn furniture with no apparent theme or style in mind. Dim lighting only accentuated the dinginess of the environment. The overall ambiance was, to put it mildly, gloomy and unwelcoming. My optimism dwindled even more when I encountered the staff. I was not greeted with a smile, but instead, I was met with an indifferent attitude by employees who seemed to care little about providing an enjoyable customer experience. The service was slow and sub-par, which felt like an insult, given the premium prices they charged for their offerings. When it comes to the food and drinks, the disappointment reached its pinnacle. The menu was both limited and unimaginative. Despite the restricted options, I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt, hoping that the execution would make up for the lack of variety. Unfortunately, I was sorely mistaken. My meal arrived lukewarm, with the presentation being nothing short of amateurish. The food was bland, lacked seasoning and fresh ingredients, and it became evident that their main concern was cutting costs instead of providing a memorable dining experience. My experience at this establishment was nothing short of dismal. The combination of the pungent odor, lackluster ambiance, indifferent staff, and substandard food made for an experience that not only left a bad taste in my mouth but also felt like an utter waste of time and money.

Answer the following question: Here's a short story: Sara closed her computer and absentmindedly pushed a paper towel roll across the plastic computer lid. Then she pushed the paper towel roll across a couch cushion. She quickly realizes that the paper towel roll moves more easily on the plastic computer lid than it does on the couch cushion, which she concludes is because there is more friction on (A) the couch cushion (B) the plastic computer lid.. What is the most sensical answer between \\"plastic computer lid\\" and \\"couch cushion\\"? Answer:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"plastic computer lid\\" and \\"couch cushion\\" is \\"couch cushion.\\" To better understand why this is the most sensible answer, we must first delve into the concept of friction. Friction is the force that resists the movement of one surface over another. It can work in one of two ways: static friction, which is the force keeping an object at rest, and kinetic (sliding) friction, which is the force working against a moving object. In Sara's short story, she pushes a paper towel roll across two different surfaces: a plastic computer lid and a couch cushion. The friction she experiences is kinetic friction, as the paper towel roll is in motion. Friction is determined by two factors: the nature of the surfaces in contact and the force pressing the surfaces together (in this case, the weight of the paper towel roll). The nature of the surfaces in contact can be characterized by the coefficient of friction, which depends on the materials sliding against each other. A higher coefficient of friction means more resistance to movement, while a lower coefficient of friction means less resistance. The plastic computer lid is likely to have a smoother texture. This smoothness means that there are fewer surface irregularities for the paper towel roll to overcome, leading to a lower coefficient of friction between the roll and the plastic computer lid. As a result, the paper towel roll moves more easily across this surface. On the other hand, the couch cushion will have a rougher texture due to the fabric upholstery of the cushion. This roughness creates more contact points between the paper towel roll and the cushion, and the tension provided by the fabric fiber gives rise to a higher coefficient of friction. This increased friction makes it more difficult for the paper towel roll to move across the couch cushion, which is why Sara concludes there is more friction on this surface. Based on this information and the observations described in the short story, it can be said that the most sensical conclusion is that there is more friction on the couch cushion than on the plastic computer lid. This increased friction is what causes the paper towel roll to move more easily on the computer lid than on the couch cushion."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Summarize this article: Jailed U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) contractor Alan Gross, (R), poses for a picture during a visit with Cuban Jewish Community leader Adela Dworin, (C), and David Prinstein, Vice President, at Havana's Carlos J Finlay Military Hospital September 28,... Judy Gross, wife of U.S. aid contractor Alan Gross, talks to Reuters during an interview in Havana June 25, 2014. HAVANA U.S. foreign aid worker Alan Gross completed his fifth year in a Cuban prison on Wednesday with his wife warning he is in terrible condition, while any hopes for improving hostile U.S.-Cuban relations hinge largely on his fate. \\"I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done,\\" his wife, Judy Gross, said in a statement that described him as gaunt, hobbling and missing five teeth. Cuba arrested Gross, now 65, on Dec. 3, 2009, and later convicted the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) subcontractor to 15 years in prison for importing banned technology and trying to establish clandestine internet service for Cuban Jews. The case is emblematic of bitter U.S.-Cuban relations dating to the 1959 revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, and any potential breakthrough appears remote while Gross is still in prison. \\"The Cuban government’s release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba,\\" the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Wednesday. The United States has rejected offers to discuss swapping Gross for three Cuban intelligence agents serving prisons terms in the United States, saying it would be wrong to equate Gross with Cuban spies. Havana labels the three as anti-terrorist heroes who defended Cuba by helping infiltrate anti-Castro extremist groups in Florida. Obama has the authority to conduct a prisoner swap and rewrite U.S. policy on Cuba. Although he said \\"we have to continue to update our policies\\" on Cuba over a year ago, he has yet to signal change. Gross' wife is urging Obama to take action. \\"It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late,\\" she said. Gross' mental and physical health has declined, he can barely walk or see out of his right eye, and he has grown increasingly suicidal while losing some 100 pounds (46 kg), according to his lawyer, Scott Gilbert. In April he went on a 9-day hunger strike. After his 65th birthday last May, Gross vowed not to turn 66 in prison, telling visitors he would rather die. He said goodbye to his wife and daughter in July and has refused to see them or U.S. diplomats in Havana, Gilbert said. (Reporting by Daniel Trotta Editing by W Simon) ||||| Today is the 5th anniversary of U.S. government contractor Alan Gross's arrest for espionage in Cuba, and ABC news has learned exclusive details about the 65-year-old’s frail physical condition and his even worse mental situation. Last spring it was reported that Gross had lost more than 100 pounds, but today sources who have visited with Gross in the last week told ABC News his health has vastly deteriorated. He has lost all but one of his front teeth, can barely walk because of hip damage, and is blind in one eye. Gross is no longer accepting visits or food from the U.S. Interest Section in Havana and refuses medical or dental care from the Cuban military hospital where he is being held. Because of mobility issues stemming from his deteriorating health, he stays in his room at the military hospital 24 hours a day. He is kept in a 10 by 20 foot dorm room with 2 other prisoners who speak no English. Gross has threatened to begin a hunger strike this month if he is not released soon and vows not to spend one more year in captivity—even if it means he dies of hunger. In a statement released this morning to mark the anniversary Wednesday, Gross’s wife Judy says: “Enough is enough. My husband has paid a terrible price for serving his country and community.” “Alan is resolved that he will not endure another year imprisoned in Cuba, and I am afraid that we are at the end. After five years of literally wasting away, Alan is done. It is time for President Obama to bring Alan back to the United States now; otherwise it will be too late.” Gross was sentenced to 15 years in 2011 for bringing telecommunication devices into Cuba while working as a subcontractor for USAID. The Cuban government accused him of being party to a U.S.-led plot to overthrow the government through an “Arab spring.” White House sources tell ABC news the National Security Council and president are aware of Gross’s condition and are working on a solution. In a statement released today, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said \\"we remain deeply concerned for Alan’s health, and reiterate our call for his release.\\" \\"The Cuban Government’s release of Alan on humanitarian grounds would remove an impediment to more constructive relations between the United States and Cuba.\\" Cuban officials tell ABC News they are equally concerned about Gross’ deteriorating health but that he has continued to refuse all medical care. The Cuban government has long equated Gross’s arrest with those of five Cuban spies arrested in Miami for spying on anti-Castro groups and has proposed a “humanitarian release” involving prisoners of both sides. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A man named Alan Gross, who was working for the U.S. Agency for International Development, has been in a Cuban prison for 5 years.

Article: An electric signal can trick a monkey's brain into believing the animal's finger has been touched. Touch something, and your brain knows. The hand sends signals to the brain to announce contact was made. But that feeling of touch may not require making actual contact, tests on monkeys now show. Zapping brain cells can fool the animal into thinking its finger has touched something. A person who has lost a limb or become paralyzed may need an artificial limb to complete everyday tasks. But such patients may not truly feel any objects they hold. The new findings point toward one day creating a sense of touch in those who use such artificial limbs. Psychologist Sliman Bensmaia of University of Chicago worked on the new tests. His team's findings appeared on October 14 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. The sense of touch is crucial to everyday tasks: People without _ may have difficulty cracking an egg, lifting a cup or even turning a doorknob. That's why restoring it is a major goal for designers of artificial limbs. In their new study, Bensmaia and his co-workers worked with rhesus monkeys . The scientists implanted electrodes --- small devices that can detect and relay an electrical signal--into the animals' brains. The scientists used the electrode data to identify which neurons had become active. Then the scientists used the implanted electrodes to zap those same neurons. And the monkeys reacted as though their fingers had been touched. In fact, they hadn't. The monkeys couldn't use words to tell the scientists what they had felt. Instead, they communicated by looking in a particular direction--just as when they had really been touched. The new findings show how touch-sensitive devices could be built. The new study also offers \\" a nice clear pathway\\" for figuring out how to restore a sense of touch to an amputee or someone with a injury of spinal cord.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.\\", answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

Help as much as you can. Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. Question: How many grams of protein per kilo does the author probably eat? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The text does not provide enough information to determine exactly how many grams of protein per kilo the author eats.

Earlier this year, A Samsung CEO spent a lot of time talking about the Internet things. He said that five years from now,every Samsung product will be part of the Internet of things,no matter whether it's a remote control or a washing machine. So, how do household objects that are part of the Internet of things work? Well,think of a common chair. When connected to the Internet, the chair warms up when it knows the user has just walked into the room and is feeling cold. An Internet-connected camera could help people feel safer in their homes. It can know people's faces and has an infrared sensor ,so even if it's dark it can see when someone passes by and send you a message on your smartphone to let you know who's there. If the person is someone you don't know,it can tell you that ,too. But according to MIT Technology Roview, whether companies are connecting dog food bowls or security systems to the Internet, there may be some problems. For example, many early connected-home objects don't have much built-in security, which means they could be hacked . Morever, it could be difficult to get these new machines to work together especially when they are made by different companies. To fight this ,many companies have joined the Open Interconnect Consortium, which had 45 menbers by late 2014.

It provides a suggestion for how to approach conversations and make the party more enjoyable. Wrong answers: 1. If someone asks you a question you are not familiar with, you could say, \\" sorry. I'm not sure what you mean. - This answer is incorrect because it focuses on a specific situation and not on the overall approach to surviving a boring party. 2. If you are overly preoccupied with other people, try asking for a friend's phone number to address your problems. People are also more likely to stay tuned in if they are able to hear the conversations going on around them. - This answer is incorrect because it does not clearly relate to staying open-minded or being engaged at the party. 3. Don't forget to stay polite, as well. This shows people you understand and respect the other people, even if they don't speak well of you. - This answer is incorrect because it focuses on being polite and respectful, which is important but doesn't specifically address making a boring party more fun and engaging."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Option [i] - Giving each bridesmaid a nice chunk of cash: 1. Cash is a universally acceptable gift. 2. It allows bridesmaids to use the money however they like or need. 3. It could potentially offset the costs bridesmaids incurred for the wedding (e.g., clothing, makeup, and travel expenses). However, cash as a gift might not: 1. Feel as personal or heartfelt as a gift with more sentiment. 2. Adequately represent the appreciation you have for their help and support during the planning of your wedding. Option [ii] - Giving each bridesmaid a sentimental gift: 1. A sentimental gift shows that you put thought and effort into selecting a meaningful item. 2. It can be tailored to each bridesmaid's interests or the relationship you share. 3. Acts as a long-lasting reminder of the special day and the bond between you and your bridesmaids. 4. Emphasizes the personal connection rather than the material aspect. However, a sentimental gift might not: 1. Have the same practical usability or immediate value as cash. Considering the potential impact on the recipients, the goal is to thank the bridesmaids for their help in the wedding, and sentimental gifts seem to better convey gratitude and thoughtfulness. Giving each bridesmaid a small, meaningful token of your appreciation sends a clear message of your love and gratitude for their help and support. A sentimental gift will create a lasting memory and connection tied to the wedding and your friendship. Therefore, option [ii] - giving each of your bridesmaids a sentimental gift - makes more sense to accomplish the goal of thanking your bridesmaids for helping with your wedding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb. Saccone’s campaign endorsed Trump’s tariff plan in a statement, saying “If other countries aren’t playing by the rules and tariffs are needed to protect steel and aluminum jobs in Southwestern Pennsylvania,... According to the above context, answer the following question. What the supporters of the plan saying? Select from the following. *American manufacturers will be hurt. *American labor unions will be at a disadvantage. *They need to act now before China takes away jobs. *not enough information.

Please answer the following question: Creativity is the key to a brighter future, say education and business experts. Here is how schools and parents can encourage this important skill in children. If Dick Drew had listened to his boss in 1925, we might not have an important product: a new type of tape. Drew worked for the Minnesota Mining Company. At work he developed a kind of material strong enough to hold things together. But his boss told him not to think more about the idea. Finally, using his own time, Drew improved the tape, which now is used everywhere by many people. And his old company learned from its mistake. Now it encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just thinking and developing new ideas. Creativity is not something one is just born with, nor is it necessarily a character of high intelligence . Just because a person is highly intelligent does not mean that he uses it creatively. Creativity is the matter of using the resources one has to produce new ideas that are good for something. Unluckily, schools have not tried to encourage creativity. With strong attention to test results and the development of reading, writing and mathematical skills, many educators give up creativity for correct answers. The result is that children can give back information but can't recognize ways to use it in new situations. They may know the rules correctly, but they are unable to use them to work out practical problems. It is important to give children choices. From the earliest age, children should be allowed to make decisions and understand their results. Even if it's choosing between two kinds of food for lunch, decision-making helps thinking skills. As children grow older, parents should let their children decide how to use their time or spend their money, but not help them too much if they make the wrong decision. The child may have a hard time, but that is all right. This is because the most important character of creative people is a very strong desire to find a way out of trouble. What did the company where Dick Drew work learn from its mistake? A) They encouraged people to work a longer time. B) They discouraged people to think freely. C) They asked people to spend all their work time developing new ideas. D) They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas. Answer:","completion":"D) They encouraged people to spend some of their work time thinking and improving new ideas. Justification: The passage states that after the innovation by Dick Drew, his old company learned from its mistake and now encourages people to spend 15 percent of their work time just on thinking and developing new ideas. Therefore, option D is the accurate representation of the company's approach as learned from their previous mistake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Up in front of me was a giant billboard advertising yet another jeweler, in ten-foot letters and bright silver watches like massive alien machines. The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea. I made the call the next day. It would put me back a good half grand, but it would be worth it. There would be no design meeting; I sent them the image and it was printed. A few weeks later it went up. Now on my commute, when I paused in the crush of metal bodies, I looked up and saw mountains by Maxfield Parrish, reaching up to the clouds in impossible cragginess, rivulets and gushing streams painted down their sides, with the sun striking vibrant oranges and reds into the shadows of the rocks. There were trees in copper-patina green and still pools quieter than the middle of winter but warm as the first day of summer. No doubt people thought it was the first part of a two-stage advertising gimmick, or a filler to be used when no one was renting space on the sign. But I was happy.

To determine Edward John McClernand's age at the time of his death, we need to analyze the information given. Edward John McClernand was born on December 29, 1848, and died on February 9, 1936. To calculate his age at the time of his death, we subtract his birth year from his death year, and then consider the months and days to determine if he had already had his birthday in the year of his death: - Subtract the Birth Year from the Death Year: 1936 - 1848 = 88 Now, we need to consider if he already had his birthday in 1936 before he passed away on February 9th: - Edward John McClernand was born on December 29th, which means his birthday had not occurred yet in the year 1936 before his death on February 9th.

In particular, it is a port for cruise ships; its heyday was the first half of the 20th century, and in particular the inter-war years, when it handled almost half the passenger traffic of the UK. Today it remains home to luxury cruise ships, as well as being the largest freight port on the Channel coast and fourth largest UK port by tonnage, with several container terminals. Unlike some other ports, such as Liverpool, London, and Bristol, where industry and docks have largely moved out of the city centres leaving room for redevelopment, Southampton retains much of its inner-city industry. Despite the still active and expanding docklands to the west of the city centre, further enhanced with the opening of a fourth cruise terminal in 2009, parts of the eastern docks have been redeveloped; the Ocean Village development, which included a local marina and small entertainment complex, is a good example.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Wow. Rarely have I felt the need to comment on movies lately, but this one especially is begging for a beatdown. Let's start at the beginning. First, writer-director Susan Montford puts Kim Basinger in the tired old victim role, complete with the requisite abusive husband and dull suburban existence. Let it be said right now that almost all content in this dull movie is completely hackneyed and trite. Montford's pathetic attempt at symbolism involving the Christmas tree with no star is laughable. When She Goes Out for some Christmas wrapping paper one dark and ominous night, Della is furious that somebody double-parked their car on the busiest shopping night of the year. She decides to do something about it, so she leaves a nasty note on the car's windshield. The next fifteen minutes of the movie are devoted to Della walking around aimlessly in the shopping mall. When she finally gets to her car, the thugs confront her about the note, a cop is killed, and she runs, and they catch up to her, and she gets away, and they chase her some more, and on and on. Everything is completely predictable and uninvolving. The thugs are not scary or menacing at all, and they all get picked off one by one in all the usual ways. This is one of those movies in which all the action depends on the characters being as stupid as you can imagine. Why the bad guys don't just kill her instead of waiting for her to hit them with a tire iron is beyond me. And once, just once, in a film like this, does the leader of the pack have to die last? What does it matter that they are all picked off one by one when they are all equally inept? Much of the movie simply consists of Lukas Haas running around in the woods screaming \\"Della!!!\\" And the inclusion of Joy Division on the soundtrack of this wretched film is insulting. The part that really made me run for my computer keypad was when Della, exhausted and hurt, cries out to the heavens, \\"Where are you, God?\\" Where, indeed, was god when this movie was being made? I give it a 2 only because of competent cinematography and lighting, and it's not as bad as 'BTK Killer,' the ultimate marker for judging any terrible film. Cheers!","completion":"The sentiment of the review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer criticizes the movie on various aspects, such as the plot, character development, and predictability. They find the content to be hackneyed, uninspiring, and unoriginal. Additionally, the reviewer points out perceived flaws in the writing and the film's symbolism, as well as characters' actions and decisions.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Paul Reiser steps away from the standup comedy spotlight to write a warmly humorous and gently tender story about family - what we see and what we don't see, what we expect and what surprises us. THE THING ABOUT MY FOLKS doesn't set any new standards for film, but it is a fine little story well told that reminds us about the significant bonds that family represents. Sam Kleinman (Peter Falk) has been a workaholic, at times pushing his wife Muriel (Olympia Dukakis), his daughters (Mackenzie Connolly and Lydia Jordan), and his son Ben (Paul Reiser) into the background. One day Muriel leaves a note that after years of marriage she is leaving! Her daughters, along with Ben's wife Rachel (Elizabeth Perkins) immediately begin the search for her whereabouts, leaving the confused and hurt and disgruntle Sam to sort things out on a road trip with son Ben. The road trip becomes a time for the two men to learn who each other is and what they each mean to their status as father and son and as family members. Sam relaxes for the first time in his life and introduces the now workaholic Ben to the pleasures and fun of living. The trip comes to an end with a phone call about the whereabouts of Muriel and why she left and the regrouping of the wiser family draws the story's warm ending. All is not what it seemed: it's better and, well, different. Falk and Reiser play off each other like the pros they are, but in many ways the film belongs to the brief moments when Olympia Dukakis is on screen, reminding us that she is one of our strongest matriarchs on film.

After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

Furthermore, they felt that the religious themes were not necessary for the movie and were heavy-handed. The reviewer even goes as far as advising recovering Christians to avoid the film, as it may make them feel ill. These negative aspects of the review seem to outweigh the positives, which leads to the conclusion that the sentiment overall is negative. Furthermore, the reviewer's discussion of certain thematic elements highlights the potential for the film to engage in more nuanced and in-depth conversation about its subject matter, indicating that there may have been a missed opportunity in terms of storytelling execution. In conclusion, although the reviewer found some redeeming qualities in the film, such as its ability to provoke conversation and explore moral lessons, the negative aspects - subpar acting and dialogue, as well as excessive religious subtext - contributed to a negative sentiment overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Today, we are going to talk about something fun and exciting - luxury car deals! Imagine fancy, shiny cars with soft, comfy seats, and lots of buttons and gadgets inside. These cars are called luxury cars because they are very special and look super cool. People usually enjoy driving these cars because they look nice and drive smoothly. Sometimes, car makers or the people who sell cars have special offers called \\"deals\\". These deals make it easier for people to buy luxury cars. When there is a luxury car deal, it's like a SALE just like you would see on toys or clothes in a store. It means people can buy these fancy cars for a little less money. Now, let me tell you why these luxury car deals are happening. One reason is that there are new car models coming. The car-maker people want to make room for the new models, so they offer deals on the current models to make them more attractive to people. This way, more people will buy the older models, and then there will be space for the new cars. Another reason is the changing of the seasons. When the weather starts to get either colder or warmer, people might want different types of cars. So, the car sellers make deals on the luxury cars to encourage people to buy them during specific times of the year. Now you know what luxury car deals are all about! Remember, these deals happen to make fancy cars a little more affordable for people to buy. So, next time you see a luxury car on the road, think about the exciting deals that helped someone drive that shiny, cool car!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer is:","completion":"John Mulvihill is an Irish individual who was notably involved in politics. Born on July 1, 1945, Mulvihill was previously aligned with the Labour Party of Ireland, hence categorizing him as a former Labour Party politician. One of the key roles Mulvihill held in Irish politics was as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Cork East. A TD is a member of Dáil Éireann, the lower house of the Oireachtas which is the Irish Parliament. This position signifies that Mulvihill was involved in legislative work and had a role as a representative of the Cork East area. He served in this capacity from 1992 to 1997. Before entering politics, Mulvihill worked as a plant operator. His political career began when he stood and got elected in the general elections of 1992. This period marked a significant swing to the Labour Party and it appears that Mulvihill's election was a part of this wider political shift. However, like some of his Labour peers, he lost his seat in the subsequent general elections held in 1997. His seat was taken over by David Stanton, a member of the Fine Gael Party, a center-right to liberal-conservative political party in Ireland. Despite this loss, Mulvihill attempted and stood in the general elections of 2002, 2007, and 2011, although he was unsuccessful in these attempts. In addition to his TD role, Mulvihill also served as a local councillor within the Midleton Local Electoral Area under the Cork County Council. He dutifully served in this role for a considerable period spanning from 1991 to 2014. Lastly, information can be inferred about his family as well. Mulvihill's son, aptly named John Mulvihill Junior, followed in his father's political footsteps. The younger Mulvihill served as a member of the Cobh Town Council, and at one point held the prestigious title of Mayor of Cobh. This contributes to our understanding of the Mulvihill family's significant involvement in the political landscape of their community and Ireland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Craig watches TV and sleeps all day while Neil is out working two jobs.","completion":"As the sun cracked the horizon, heralding a new day, life went on in the small, bustling town. Somewhere, in a neatly bricked house with a well-manicured lawn, Craig yawned, stretching his arms above his head, sinking deep into the inviting comfort of his recliner. The house still held the remaining hints of the previous night's dinner, and the musty aroma of the fireplace that had been lit to create a warm, cozy ambiance. Instead of clearing the table and washing the dishes left behind, Craig felt the lure of the television taking hold. The large flat screen was mounted on the wall, framed by an arrangement of family photos, mementos, and paintings that brought personality and life to their modest home. Oblivious to the world outside, Craig mindlessly flicked through channels, watching snippets of news, reality shows, and sitcom reruns with equal disinterest. The world outside was distant – the chattering of the birds and the low rumbling of morning commuters barely managed to penetrate the fog of disinterest that had settled around the house. Meanwhile, Neil, a man with the weary look of someone wearing far more than just the weight of his years on his shoulders, trudged through his first job at the local supermarket. Packed with patrons eager to get the day over with, the supermarket cacophony punctuated the atmosphere with the clamor of carts, scanners, and ever-present small talk. With deft, well-rehearsed movements, Neil rang up each item in rapid succession and fluently asked the rehearsed question, \\"Would you like assistance with your bags?\\" a smile clinging to his lips despite his growing sense of exhaustion. But as the supermarket's hands edged toward closing time, Neil couldn't afford any respite. Instead, he traded his uniform to become a dishwasher at a popular restaurant, a place known for its hearty portions and good vibes. In contrast to the monotony at the supermarket, the kitchen was a battleground of pots, pans, and dishes piling high with endless expectations. Neil scrubbed and scoured diligently, cleaning away the remnants of forgotten meals, his hands pruned and aching from their hours-long sojourn in hot soapy water. But no matter how tired or worn his body and soul felt, the thought of their shared home was what spurred him on. Back at the house, the sun had begun to dip low, casting warm, golden light through the windows. Craig, still ensconced in his recliner, awoke with a start, his nap-induced stupor only temporarily alleviated. Outside, children played and laughed, their parents casting watchful eyes over their raucous games. As the day slid toward evening, Craig couldn't help but think about their life together and the yawning divide that had grown between himself and Neil, the thick veil of apathy that loomed larger than ever. Though they once had shared their dreams and hopes for the future, the divide between those dreams and their reality had grown increasingly insurmountable. That evening, when Neil's weary footsteps finally echoed in the hallway and he entered the house with the weight of the world sagging his shoulders, he was met with a sight he hadn't dared to expect. Craig had washed the dishes, the counters now gleamed with a renewed sense of cleanliness and purpose, and dinner was being reheated on the stove. A feeble smile tugged at Craig's heartstrings as Neil's face shed the exhaustion of the day, replaced by surprise and, perhaps, a renewed hope. In that moment, without a word between them, they understood that change wouldn't come all at once. Though classed as unremarkable moments, the small steps they had taken that day had come to be an incandescent flicker of hope, a promise that the path ahead could be brighter. As Neil sat down to eat and Craig eased into his role as his partner's support system, they knew that this was the first step in reigniting their dreams and walking toward a shared destiny."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: Two old buddies are sent to Japan to get back results of a genetic research containing videotape, which is stolen by the black suited ninjas at the beginning of the movie. First they just have to learn some ninja skill, because \\"only ninja can beat the ninja.\\" Sakura killers tries hard to be enjoyable ninja-flick but fails that badly. The whole movie is just so hollow and predictable that is hard to say anything good about it: Same plot has been seen in different variations dozens of times before, characters are too briefly drawn, direction is dull and script doesn't offer anything surprising, even in the ending scene, which by itself reduced movie's (trash)value. Even 80's ninja-flick-fan, who understands the esthetic of trash-movies, is hard to find this movie even barely enjoyable. It simply doesn't offer anything new to viewer, neither in visual level nor in plot. Shurikens are thrown and katanas are swinging, but it's not enough to lead the movie direction it meant to be and recurred similar fighting scenes numbs even the most calloused viewer after the first 30 minutes. It's hard to recommend movie to anyone. Even Franco Nero's clumsy performance in \\"Enter the Ninja\\" falls behind Sakura killer's American-ninjas. Even in visual level movie doesn't have any balls and it's waste of time to try to find any great fighting scenes in this movie: There isn't any. In all, one of the most futile ninja-flicks, I've ever seen. Doesn't interest even in curiosity. Trust me on this one. ½ out of 10. Now, what is this review like?

They mention that the movie doesn't offer anything new or visually exciting and calls it a waste of time. The review also states that it's hard to recommend the film to anyone.

Background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). Paragraph: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.

In The Archers, which river flows through Ambridge?","completion":"The river that flows through Ambridge in the long-running British radio drama series, The Archers, is called the River Am. The Archers, first broadcasted in 1951, is set in the fictional village of Ambridge located in the equally fictional county of Borsetshire, which is said to be situated in the English Midlands. The River Am is a vital geographical feature within the show, playing an essential role in the village's agricultural and local community life. Several water-related activities such as fishing, boating, and riverside walks are referenced in the series, highlighting the Am's significance to Ambridge and its inhabitants. Furthermore, the river serves as a location for various storylines and character development, often witnessing crucial plot points and scenes. In addition to the River Am, Ambridge features other quintessential English countryside elements, such as farms, independent shops, a church, a village hall, a pub, and several local businesses. These contribute to the vibrant rural setting of the show, contextualizing the everyday lives of The Archers' characters. The Archers is a significant cultural and social fixture in British radio history, touching upon various themes such as agriculture, village politics, family dynamics, and contemporary social issues. The show has managed to maintain its relevance in current times by adapting to societal changes while staying true to its original premise. The River Am, as an emblematic element of the series, holds great importance due to its role in shaping Ambridge's landscape and identity, staying central to the experiences and interactions of the characters throughout the years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the profound affection I feel towards him and his work, it will be a challenge to wrap it up so briefly. Humor, beauty, erudition, skill, generosity, fun. There’s six. Dan Winters and I had exchanged a few sincerely firm handshakes in 1999, but it was at the bachelor party of a mutual friend in July of 2000 that I feel we first truly took each other’s measure. Dan and I were to appear as fellow groomsmen in the impending nuptials, and I clearly recall a gratifying sense of relief when I was told that, instead of the traditionally misogynistic stripper fete complete with uncomfortably soused fraternity brothers, Dan would be leading we grooms-buddies on a hike to a swimming hole in his native Ventura County. “God damn”, I thought, “this Dan guy might be all right.” I didn’t know any of the guys except the groom, but having been brought up properly in a fine, rural Illinois family, I was reasonably certain I knew just how to comport myself in this situation. I arrived at the location with a canvas army backpack filled with ice and a case of Coronas. To my relief, my new compatriots quickly confirmed that I had acted appropriately in the arena of refreshments, then Dan took one look at my vintage World War 2 backpack and told me the exact Allied campaign in which it had been utilized, as well as the year the Swiss switched over from canvas to leather shoulder straps. A crush began to blossom in the springtime of my heart. He said, “C’mon. You guys are gonna love this place.” We hiked, rather arduously, albeit enjoyably, up a rocky, switchback trail for about an hour, to arrive, astonished, at an altitudinous landscape, the likes of which I had only previously seen in an Ansel Adams calendar. The “swimming hole” was but one perfect basin in a series of boulder-strewn pools that had been created over the millennia by a small creek burbling ever deeper into the granite hill. One deep, round hole, complete with cascading waterfall, allowed for a 20-foot cliff-dive into its emerald water. Having spent most of my life in the relatively flatter environs of the Midwest, this magical setting Dan had gifted upon us fairly beggared my imagination. It seemed much more suited to a scene in which Bilbo Baggins might be found engaged in a chin-wag about finger-jewelry with a thin, lisping, somewhat amphibious chap, than one in which seven men in their 30’s lay about sipping cold cervezas. However other-worldly it might have seemed, we were not in a fantasy. We were simply in the place where Dan had taken us. Soon thereafter, Dan visited my woodshop, pointing out all the right materials and jigs, and we giggled like cub scouts over a myriad of jack planes, spokeshaves, bandsaws, and especially my 1943 Delta drill press, the clear “hottie” amongst my arsenal of machines. Curves for days. We had a drawn-out discussion about floor sweeping techniques. No shit. Once again, he knew more about my tools and their inner workings than I could ever hope to learn, for you see, this man is lovingly obsessed with all of the implements mankind has created, using nothing but ingenuity and elbow-grease. He is fully enraptured, and luckily for us, he has a penchant to make us see what he sees as well. Dan Winters is in love with a telephone pole! It sounds silly until you see the picture he has taken of it. Then you say, “Oh…Jesus. Wow.” A suspension bridge, a firearm, a salad fork or an engine will possess him until he has taken it into the embrace of his lens and spun it about the dance floor for all of us to countenance, until we have perceived the message and realized the poignant beauty that caused him to pick up his camera in the first place. The many-colored layers of his talent and his fascination do not stop at leather saddles, hand tools and carburetors. Dan’s portraits of human beings, from anonymous citizens to luminaries, are deceptively simple renderings of personality and nuance. They are pregnant with pathos. I’ve never seen photos of celebrities that made them seem like such, well, human beings. He suggests that the viewer really think about the person depicted, in a different way than we’ve been taught by modern fashion. His haunting plates of honey bees are shot with the efficient scrutiny of the entomologist combined with a surrealist’s elan. The works on paper are laced with specific meaning and emotional truth, in turns beautiful, humorous, and chilling. He takes on sumi-e black ink painting and writes an entire poem with three strokes of his brush. The longer I’ve known Dan Winters, the more I am astonished at the breadth of his ability to convey relevant and powerful emotions with his images. I’ve seen Dan break into a sweat simply from the enthusiasm he feels for a conversational topic. Our world, and the people living in it, excite him. He will not be contained. When he’s shooting, Dan begins to behave like a hound who has caught wind of a coon. His pulse quickens and his eyes are never still, evaluating the light, the composition, the subject, until he locks in through the lens and then his eye never wavers. He makes photographs in the same spirit with which he’ll drive you to Lockhart, Texas in his cherry 1964 Chevy pickup, give you a tour of the three greatest barbecue joints in the world, then actually show you how to eat the barbecue. “Take a bite of brisket. Amazing, right? Now take a little bite of the jalapeno. Right?” Right, indeed. Dan Winters is a genius at tasting life who loves to share his gifts with the people, and that makes you and I a couple of lucky bastards. 1,000 words. Insufficient.

In 1642 a Cambodian Prince named Ponhea Chan became King Ramathipothei after overthrowing and assassinating the previous King. Malay Muslim merchants in Cambodia helped him in his takeover, and he subsequently converted to Islam from Buddhism, changed his name to Ibrahim, and married a Malay woman. He then started a war to drive out the Dutch East India Company, by first starting a massacre in the capital of the Dutch, commandeering two of their ships, and killing 35 Dutch employees of the Company in addition to the Company's ambassador. On the Mekong River, the Cambodians defeated the Dutch East India Company in a mostly naval war from 1643-44 with the Cambodian forces suffering 1,000 dead, and the Dutch forces suffering 156 dead out of 432 soldiers and multiple Dutch warships fell into Cambodian hands. The Dutch East India Company ambassador who was killed along with his men was Pierre de Rogemortes, and it was not until two centuries later that European influence in Cambodia could recover from the defeat inflicted on the Dutch. This Muslim Cambodian King was ousted and arrested by the Vietnamese Nguyen lords after Ibrahim's brothers, who remained Buddhists, requested Vietnamese help to restore Buddhism to Cambodia by removing him from the throne. In the 1670s the Dutch left all the trading posts they had maintained in Cambodia after the massacre in 1643.

The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome. After some dramatic events that reveal his surprising connections to Syra, who is his long-lost younger sister Myriam, Fulvius rejects his evil ways, converts to Christianity and becomes a hermit.

London's FTSE 100 index closed down 4.6% at 5,898.87, with major markets in France and Germany down by 5.5% and 4.96% respectively. In total, £73.75bn was wiped off the FTSE 100 as a result of Monday's falls. In volatile trading, Wall Street's Dow Jones fell 6%, then almost recovered its losses before closing 3.6% lower. At one point it fell below 16,000 for the first time since February 2014, while the technology-heavy Nasdaq index closed 3.8% lower, recovering from an earlier plunge of 8%. The S&P 500 ended trading 3.9% lower and 11% below its May record, putting it officially in \\"correction\\" territory - a fall of 10% or more from its peak. Shares in Asia were hit overnight, with the Shanghai Composite in China closing down 8.5%, its worst close since 2007. At its lowest point in the day, the FTSE 100 had lost as much as 6%, wiping some £100bn off its value. Global investors are worried about growth in the world's second largest economy.

All the traders knew this wouldn't be a typical sleepy August Monday. Minutes after the opening bell, the Dow fell a staggering 1089 points, its biggest ever points drop. One floor trader complained his shirt was soaked with sweat after the early plunge in stocks. Another, Stephen Guilfoyle from Deep Value, told me the US markets were 'bordering on the edge of panic but not quite there yet.' He can remember the crash of 1987 and said this didn't feel as bad. Indeed by late morning, US markets were showing some resilience, leading Mark Otto of J Streicher to conclude that Monday's big market moves in the US were similar to the 'flash crash' of 2010, when billions of dollars were wiped off some of the world's biggest companies in a matter of minutes, only to recover almost as quickly.

Currencies and commodities are also falling sharply, because those markets rely heavily on strong demand from China. Without strong reassurances from officials in China, investors have not had much reason to buy. Analysis: Karishma Vaswani, Asia business correspondent Beijing's official mouthpiece has called it China's \\"Black Monday\\". The Shanghai Composite tumbled by 8.5%, its biggest fall since 2007. That plunge wiped out this year's gains as investors refused to buy into the Chinese government's repeated attempts to shore up confidence. Everyone wants to know what the Chinese government is going to do next to shore up shares and confidence in the economy. The smart money is on the central bank reducing interest rates and injecting a semblance of consumer confidence into the markets. That is what many had hoped would happen over the weekend. But at each point in what appears to be an ever-deepening Chinese slowdown, the government has seemed slow to react.

Image copyright Getty Images Image caption India did not escape the global sell-off with the main index falling nearly 6% Beijing's latest intervention, to allow its main state pension fund to invest in the stock market, failed to calm traders' fears, both in China and abroad. Over the past week, the Shanghai index fell 12%, adding up to a 30% drop since the middle of June. The sharp fall sparked a global sell-off, with the Dow Jones in the US losing 6%, while the FTSE 100 posted its biggest weekly loss this year, of 5%. Earlier this month, the Chinese central bank devalued the yuan in an attempt to boost exports. European investors worry that a cheaper Chinese currency will make European exports less competitive. In other developments: ||||| NEW YORK A near-9 percent dive in China shares sent world stocks and commodity prices tumbling on Monday, and U.S. stocks ended a volatile day with the S&P; 500 and Nasdaq composite indexes sliding into correction territory. After dropping more than 1,000 points, or almost 7 percent, at Wall Street's open, the Dow Jones industrial average cut its losses but still finished down 3.6 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed down 3.9 percent for the day and was 11 percent lower than its May record high. The benchmark S&P; index has accumulated 9.95 percent of losses in just five sessions. A key measure of U.S. equity volatility, the CBOE Volatility Index, or VIX, shot above the 50 mark for the first time since 2009, dropped back near 30 and then rose to 40. Some U.S. investors went bargain hunting after the dip, causing at least some of the accelerated selling toward the day's end, according to Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives for Charles Schwab in Austin, Texas. \\"It's a very risky proposition to take things home overnight in this kind of a market. If you got a profit that quick, it's often safer to take a small profit than run the risk,\\" said Frederick, \\"If things don't settle down in China we could have another ugly open tomorrow.\\" Hong Kong's Hang Seng index futures were down 2 percent and Nikkei futures were down 6 percent, suggesting there may be more losses in store when trading resumes in Asia on Tuesday. European stocks closed off 5.4 percent after Asian shares slumped to three-year lows when a three-month-long rout in Chinese equities threatened to get out of hand. U.S. markets had some reprieve after Europe closed but then pushed back down toward early lows in late afternoon. The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 588.40 points, or 3.57 percent, at 15,871.35. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index was down 77.68 points, or 3.94 percent, at 1,893.21. The Nasdaq Composite Index was down 179.79 points, or 3.82 percent, at 4,526.25. U.S. traders had rushed for the exits in Monday's first half-hour of trading when deepening concerns about a China-led global economic slowdown and tumbling commodities prices followed a 5 percent decline in the S&P; and Dow on Thursday and Friday. \\"Anybody with a pulse was nervous when the market opened,\\" said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. Monday's trading volume exceeded 14 billion shares, double the 7 billion daily average for the month to date, calculated by BATS Global Markets. In comparison, about 10.6 billion shares changed hands in Friday's selloff. Oil prices settled sharply down after plunging to six-and-a-half year lows. Safe-haven U.S. government and German bonds, as well as the yen and the euro, rallied as currency concerns kicked in due to China's recent currency devaluation. U.S. crude settled down 5.5 percent at 38.24 a barrel after falling as low as 37.75 earlier. Brent settled off 6 percent at 42.69 after falling as low as 42.51, taking both under January's lows for the first time. Worries about weaker demand from normally resource-hungry China added to global supply glut concerns. The S&P;'s energy sector was the weakest performer, with a 5.2 percent decline for the day. Copper, seen as a barometer of global industrial demand, hit a six-year low, and nickel fell sharply. GREAT FALL OF CHINA The slump in Chinese stocks was their worst performance since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2007 and wiped out what was left of 2015's gains, which in June stood at more than 50 percent. Many traders had hoped Beijing would take support measures, such as an interest rate cut, over the weekend after China's main stock markets slumped 11 percent last week. With serious doubts emerging about the likelihood of a U.S. interest rate rise this year, the dollar was down 1.6 percent against other major currencies after falling as much as 2.5 percent earlier in the day. The Australian dollar fell to more than six-year lows and many emerging market currencies also plunged, while the frantic dash to safety pushed the euro to a seven-and-a-half month high of more than 1.17. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 5.4 percent to a more than three-year low. Tokyo's Nikkei ended down 4.6 percent and Australian and Indonesian shares hit two-year troughs. London's FTSE 100, with its large number of global miners and oil firms, ended down 4.7 percent for its 10th straight decline - its worst run since 2003. The MSCI all world stock index was off 3.8 percent at the end of the U.S. session.

(Associated Press) A Chinese investor monitors stock prices at a brokerage house in Beijing, Monday, Aug. 24, 2015. Stocks tumbled across Asia on Monday as investors shaken by the sell-off last week on Wall Street unloaded... (Associated Press) The decline threatened to weigh anew on global markets after last week's Chinese losses triggered a worldwide selloff. The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index fell 8.5 percent to close at 3,209.91 points, its biggest one-day loss since an 8.8 percent decline on Feb. 27, 2007. The index is down 38 percent from its June 12 peak and just under 1 percent below its closing on Dec. 31, last year's final trading day. The slump has inflicted heavy losses on small investors, souring many on stock ownership and threatening to disrupt Communist Party plans to use the market to raise money for reforms of state industry. \\"It feels like the end of the world,\\" said Pan Chong, a social media specialist. He said he invested 50,000 yuan (7,900) in April, made 40 percent and then saw the market wipe out those gains. \\"The so-called correction will finally become a long-term bear market,\\" said Pan, 25. \\"So I'm considering selling all my shares as soon as possible.\\" The Chinese benchmark soared more than 150 percent starting in late 2014 after state media said shares were inexpensive, which led investors to believe Beijing would shore up prices if needed. Urged on by state media, millions of novice investors rushed into the market. Prices faltered and then plunged after an unrelated change in banking regulations in June led investors to question whether Beijing's support might be weakening. The market index fell 30 percent, prompting Beijing to intervene by barring big shareholders from selling and promising state-owned brokerages and pension funds would buy. Beijing's initiatives helped to calm markets. But after the state-owned company charged with buying shares to prop up prices announced it would not intervene every day, the Shanghai index fell 11.5 percent last week. The declines come at a time when exports, manufacturing and other Chinese industries are weakening, leaving little economic foundation for higher share prices. The latest fall probably was triggered by poor performance at publicly traded companies, said Guo Tianyong, a professor at the Central University of Finance and Economics in Beijing. The government reported last week that profits at state-owned companies contracted by 2.3 percent in July from a year ago, compared with a 0.1 percent contraction through June. \\"We shouldn't doubt the government's ability to rescue the market. If they want, they could push up the stock index to 5,000, but it is not necessary for the government to play an excessive role,\\" said Guo. \\"It still would be better for the market itself to play its role.\\" Beijing's surprise Aug. 11 devaluation of its yuan added to investor jitters. They worry the change will lead to money flowing out of China, reducing credit available for trading. The central bank has responded by pumping extra money into credit markets. The ruling party wants to use the markets to raise money for state companies to reduce debt loads and modernize. The party also wants to encourage stock ownership as a way for families to save for retirement, reducing demand for social spending. But small investors whose holdings have plunged in value say they will no longer buy shares. Lu Zhen, 29, an employee at a financial firm, said the value of his shares rose by 250,000 yuan (40,000) over the first half of the year. But he said since the June downturn, he has lost that and an additional 150,000 yuan (24,000). \\"This is definitely the end of a bull market,\\" Lu said. ___ AP researchers Dong Tongjian and Yu Bing contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"This text describes a significant drop in global stock markets in response to fears of a Chinese economic slowdown.

The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

Mechanical energy is a combination of the energy of motion or position. This type of energy describes objects that are moving or could move. A moving ball can have energy from motion. An arrow can also have the energy of motion. Both are types of mechanical energy. Can you think of some other examples? Where does the energy of motion come from? It comes from the energy created by position. This energy is stored energy. This means it is not moving yet, but it has the potential to move. How can you store energy? The arrow gains energy from the drawn bow. As the arrow is released, the bow releases its stored energy and puts the arrow into motion. Can you think of some other ways to store energy using position?

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Timmons was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of a minister. He had a sister, Eleanor. Both of his parents, and several aunts and uncles, played the piano. From an early age Timmons studied music with an uncle, Robert Habershaw, who also taught McCoy Tyner. Timmons moved to New York in 1954. He played with Kenny Dorham in 1956, making his recording debut with the trumpeter in a live set in May of that year. He went on to play and record with Chet Baker in 1956-57 (bassist Scott LaFaro was part of this band for a time), Sonny Stitt in 1957, and Maynard Ferguson in 1957-58. He also recorded as a sideman with hornmen Curtis Fuller, Hank Mobley, and Lee Morgan, all for Blue Note Records in 1957. Timmons became best known as a member of Art Blakey's band the Jazz Messengers, which he was first part of from July 1958 to September 1959, including for a tour of Europe. He was recruited for the Messengers by saxophonist Benny Golson, who said that \\"He was inventive, [...] He could play bebop and he could play funky - he could play a lot of things, and I thought it was the element that Art needed. He hadn't had anybody quite like Bobby, who could go here or go there, rather than walking in a single corridor.\\" By late 1958 Timmons was sharing bandmate Morgan's East Sixth Street apartment and the pair had bought a piano, allowing Timmons to practice and Morgan to work on composing. From around the time he joined Blakey, Timmons, along with some of his fellow band members, was a heroin user. After leaving Blakey, Timmons joined Cannonball Adderley's band, in October 1959. Timmons was also known as a composer during this period: The Encyclopedia of Jazz states that his compositions \\"Moanin'\\" (from the 1958 album of the same title), \\"This Here\\", and \\"Dat Dere\\" \\"helped generate the gospel-tinged 'soul jazz' style of [the] late '50s and early '60s.\\" The first was written when Timmons was first with Blakey; the others were composed when he was with Adderley. \\"This Here\\" (sometimes \\"Dis Here\\") was a surprise commercial success for Adderley: recorded in concert in 1959, it was released as part of The Cannonball Adderley Quintet in San Francisco album while the band was still on tour, and they discovered its popularity only when they arrived back in New York and found crowds outside the Village Gate, where they were due to play. Timmons was reported to be dissatisfied with the money he had received from \\"This Here\\", and was enticed in February 1960 into leaving Adderley and returning to Blakey's band by the offer of more pay. Timmons then appeared on further well-known albums with the drummer, including A Night in Tunisia, The Freedom Rider and The Witch Doctor. His own recording debut as sole leader was This Here Is Bobby Timmons in 1960, which contained his first versions of his best-known compositions. In the same year, he played on recordings led by Nat Adderley, Arnett Cobb, and Johnny Griffin, among others; on the first of these, Work Song, Timmons did not appear on all of the tracks, because he had been drinking heavily. Did he record any albums at that time?","completion":"Yes, Timmons recorded several albums during that time.

Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Powering an electrical device with a battery requires electron flow, and ask you the question \\"electron flow allows a battery to do what?\\", is the correct answer \\"power an electrical device\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the correct answer is \\"power an electrical device.\\" When you state that \\"Powering an electrical device with a battery requires electron flow,\\" you are implying that electrons are fundamental to the operation of a battery. Thus, when you ask the question \\"electron flow allows a battery to do what?\\" it logically follows that the answer would be \\"power an electrical device.\\" To provide a more detailed explanation, it is important to understand how batteries work. A battery is a device that stores chemical energy and converts it into electrical energy. This conversion occurs through a chemical reaction that takes place within the battery's cells, which contain two different electrodes: the anode (negative) and the cathode (positive). The battery also contains an electrolyte, which is an ion-conducting substance that facilitates the flow of charge between the anode and the cathode. When an electrical device is connected to a battery, a closed circuit is created. As a result, electrons are released from the anode and begin flowing in the circuit. These electrons travel to the cathode through the electrical device, effectively powering it. The electrolyte allows for the flow of ions from the anode to the cathode as well, which helps maintain electrical neutrality within the battery. The chemical reactions occurring in the battery will continue until either the chemical reactants are exhausted or the electrical circuit is broken. In summary, the correct answer is \\"power an electrical device\\" because the electron flow is what allows a battery to provide the required electrical energy to operate the connected device. This flow of electrons, facilitated by the chemical reactions within the battery, is responsible for generating the electrical current that drives the device's various components. Without this electron flow, a battery would not be able to serve its primary function: supplying power to an electrical system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abdoulaziz Keita proved to be the hero for Guinea as he saved a spot kick before stepping up to score the winner. Guinea are now through to face DR Congo in the semi-finals on Wednesday in Kigali. The opening ten minutes set the tone for the rest of the game as both sides started slowly and neither managed a shot on target. Both sides then sent headers wide first from Guinea's Kile Bangoura and then minutes later by Zambia captain Chris Katongo. With 20 minutes left to play Guinea's Ibrahima Sory Sankhon saw his free kick deflected onto the woodwork. Captain Chris Katongo thought he had won the game with six minutes left to play but his effort was disallowed for offside. One of the better chances in extra-time fell to Zambia's Adrian Chama as he took the ball into the area but was denied by a good save from Abdoulaziz Keita in the Guinea goal. With neither side able to break the deadlock the game was decided by penalties. Katongo, who scored when he helped Zambia win the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, had his effort saved by Keita. Guinea then scored their first effort and Buchizya Mfune then got Zambia on the board. Things were then levelled up when Jacob Banda saved Sankhon's shot, both sides then scored to keep things level.

Context: During this period, the island enjoyed increased revenues through the sale of flax, with prices peaking in 1951. However, the industry declined because of transportation costs and competition from synthetic fibres. The decision by the British Post Office to use synthetic fibres for its mailbags was a further blow, contributing to the closure of the island's flax mills in 1965.

The relevant information is that synthetic fibres were in competition with flax, a natural material. Step 4: Determine the answer based on the information extracted. Since the question is asking for a likely component of sheets not made from natural components, and the context mentions synthetic fibres as competitors to natural flax, it can be inferred that synthetic fibres would be a likely component of such sheets.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: People usually hate mice, but one mouse has won the hearts of the people all over the world---the famous Mickey Mouse. Fifty years ago most movies were silent. A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse that could talk his movies. He named his mouse Mickey Mouse. People, both young and old, were very excited at the talking mouse. Children loved to see their friend, because he brought joy and laughter to them. Mickey was a clean mouse right from the beginning. Perhaps this is one reason why people hate real mice and love Mickey Mouse. In his early life Mickey made some mistakes. People were angry. They wrote to Disney and said that they did not want Mickey to do silly things. So Disney made a new animal named Donald Duck. He also made a dog called Pluto. This dog does stupid things and makes mistakes wherever he goes. Now our Mickey Mouse is not only clean but also important. He appears as a beautiful and clever star.

Question: What instrument is used to measure the specific gravity (or relative density) of liquids such as beer and wine? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question The question asks for an instrument that measures the specific gravity (or relative density) of liquids, specifically beer and wine. Step 2: Recall relevant knowledge From my knowledge database, I know that specific gravity is the ratio of the density of a substance to the density of a reference substance, usually water. It is used to determine the concentration of alcohol or sugar content in liquids such as beer, wine, and various other beverages. Step 3: Identify the instrument and justify the choice The instrument used to measure the specific gravity of liquids, especially in the context of beer and wine production, is a hydrometer. Step 4: Explain the choice and use of the instrument A hydrometer is a glass instrument that consists of a weighted bulb at the bottom and a calibrated scale at the top. It is designed to float in a liquid and allows you to measure the specific gravity by observing the level at which the liquid's surface intersects the calibrated scale. The reason a hydrometer is suitable for measuring specific gravity in liquid mixtures like beer and wine is because it gives a quick and relatively accurate indication of the changes that occur in the liquid, such as sugar and alcohol content, as fermentation proceeds. This enables the person testing the specific gravity to make adjustments as necessary during production. Answer: A hydrometer is used to measure the specific gravity (or relative density) of liquids such as beer and wine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Summarize: Michael Sandford, 20, from Dorking, Surrey, was accused of trying to grab a police officer's gun to shoot Mr Trump at a Las Vegas rally on 18 June. He pleaded guilty to being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting an official function. His plea means he could be deported and his sentence reduced. Sandford previously pleaded not guilty to charges of disrupting government business and official functions, being an illegal alien and possession of a gun and had been due to stand trial later this month. He may have faced up to 20 years in a US prison if he had been convicted at trial. He is due to be sentenced on 13 December. At a court in Nevada, he acknowledged he had been treated in the past for mental illness. Entering his pleas, he said: \\"I tried to take a gun from a policeman to shoot someone with, and I'm pleading guilty.\\" His mother Lynne Sandford and the family's UK lawyer visited him in jail for the first time last week to persuade him to sign the plea agreement. Mrs Sandford said: \\"Even though he has signed the plea agreement, which should be the best option, it won't necessarily happen that way. \\"The judge at sentencing can either agree with what is in the plea bargain or he can totally overthrow that and impose a punishment of his own.\\" She added that her son told her he was \\"incredibly sorry and remorseful for everything,\\" adding: \\"Everybody says this is not him - this is so opposite to what he is.\\" Sandford's lawyers said he suffers seizures, obsession-compulsion anxiety and autism spectrum disorders. His mother said he was recently diagnosed as having had a psychotic episode at the time of the incident and should serve any sentence in a UK psychiatric hospital.

Question: How many songs by Frankie Laine were on the 10-inch LP released by Columbia Records in 1956? Context: Eventually the 12-inch (300 mm) 33 1⁄3 rpm LP prevailed as the predominant format for musical albums, and 10-inch LPs were no longer issued.

He was born in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico to Mexican parents, which suggests that he is likely a Mexican citizen by birth. However, there are ways he could also be a natural-born U.S. citizen, even if he was born in Mexico. For example, if his parents were American citizens who were living in Mexico at the time of his birth, he might have received U.S. citizenship at birth. Alternatively, he may have acquired U.S. citizenship if his parents became naturalized U.S. citizens while he was still a minor. The term \\"Mexican-American\\" typically refers to individuals of Mexican descent living in the U.S., but it doesn't automatically imply U.S. citizenship, let alone natural-born citizenship. Furthermore, being based in Santa Ana, California can suggest residence, but it doesn't necessarily mean U.S. citizenship either. The phrase “Mexican-American” often refers to nationality, heritage or cultural identification, but not necessarily legal citizenship.

Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane. contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the two archipelagos of India?, what is it ? A:","completion":"The names of the two archipelagos of India mentioned in the article are the Lakshadweep and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. The Lakshadweep is a group of coral atolls located off India's south-western coast, while the Andaman and Nicobar Islands are a volcanic chain situated in the Andaman Sea.

Article: The accident at Lake Sherwood was in our backyard. An SUV had gone off the road,down a hill, and collided with a tree. When we heard the wreck, I remembered to say \\"call 911\\". My family was the first on the scene. Nick, my son, was on the cell phone with 911. He saw a friend who was a victim in the crash who was a 15 years old girl who was badly disfigured and had died instantly. It was a terrible scene. There had been six people in the truck, all between 15 and 17 years old. My husband and I checked all the victims, and I picked one who was conscious and stayed with him. I talked with him and had him lay on the ground. When I asked him if he was hurt, he said he was sore all over. When help arrived, they asked me to stay and continue working with them. I did as Debbie Romine, .my instructor, said in class, and did what they wanted. They even said thank you before they left. The sheriff deputies came by Saturday night to get our statements and play the 911 tape back, so Nick could identify all the voices in the background. They said over and over that the way he handled the call was the best they had heard in a long time. He was calm and worked with them even when he saw his friend who had died.

Under the guise of enhancing cognitive abilities and making them smarter, healthier, and more successful, the company manages to persuade both the town authorities and parents to partake in this \\"once-in-a-lifetime\\" opportunity. The story follows a group of five children: John, who aspires to be an artist; Jane, a passionate young mathematician; Jacob, a promising athlete; Lily, a shy bookworm; and Mark, a tech prodigy. As the experiment begins, the children are given a daily pill to take, which they are constantly reminded is the key to their success. Initially, the drugs seem to be working as promised. The children show significant improvement in their respective fields, and the town quickly becomes a shining example of progress. However, as the months pass, the side effects of the experiment become more apparent. Their personalities begin to change, making them passionate and driven, but also more aggressive and detached from emotions. Friendships start to deteriorate, ambitions turn into obsessions, and the once-harmonious town starts to fray. When the mysterious disappearance of Dr. Samantha Grey, the local pediatrician overseeing the administration of the drugs, is revealed, a few family members grow suspicious. Jane's father, who is a local journalist, begins to delve deeper into Invicare's experiments. In doing so, he uncovers that the real purpose of the drug is to produce a generation of manipulable superhumans, capable of dominating industries and ensuring the corporation's profits rise indefinitely. As the conspiracy unfolds, the group of five friends, all now distant from one another, are forced to recognize their dilemma. With the help of Dr. Grey, who had gone into hiding after stumbling upon the corporation's true intentions, they gradually come together. The doctor, in an act of defiance, creates a counter-drug to reverse the negative effects of the drug and gradually deprogram the children to regain their true selves. They must rely on one another to escape the clutches of Invicare's henchmen and reveal the truth about the experiment. As the climax of the film, the small group orchestrates a protest at their school, with the support of the wider community, forcing Invicare to abandon the experiment. The company's unethical practices are exposed, and justice is served. Throughout the ordeal, the children regain the friendships they had lost and learn valuable lessons about the importance of solidarity, staying true to oneself, and the consequences of unbridled ambition. In the end, Harborside becomes a symbol of hope in the face of corporate greed, and the children emerge stronger than before, understanding that their talents and abilities are what define them, not the drugs consumed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Just start from seed, they grow extremely well with little care needed. Just keep the soil in the pot damp. Test the soil with your finger, if it's damp at 2 inches down, you don't need to water yet.; B. Herbs grow really well in pots which can be placed near a window. Just start from seed, they grow extremely well but care is needed. Just keep the soil in the pot very nearly dry. Test the soil with you finger, if it's dry at 2 inches down, you don't need to water yet.;","completion":"Solution A is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning. In both solutions, the suggestion to grow herbs in pots near a window provides a viable alternative for those who do not have access to actual soil. However, the main difference between the two solutions lies in the care and watering instructions for the potted herbs. Solution A emphasizes keeping the soil damp, which generally correlates to proper plant care and healthy growth. When the soil is moist, it provides the necessary hydration and nutrients for the plants, and testing the soil with a finger for dampness at 2 inches depth is a good rule of thumb for determining if the plants need watering. A damp environment at this depth ensures that the herbs' roots are accessing the water they need while also promoting healthy root growth. Allowing the soil to dry out too much, as suggested in solution B, can cause the herbs to wilt or become too stressed, potentially leading to failure in growing the garden successfully. Furthermore, solution A mentions that the herbs grow extremely well with little care needed, generally speaking, many herbs, such as basil, parsley, and mint, are characterized by their hardiness and adaptability to different growing conditions. They can usually thrive with minimal care once they are established, making it a reasonable and realistic assumption. In contrast, Solution B advises maintaining the soil very nearly dry and holding off watering until the soil is dry at 2 inches down. While some herbs, such as rosemary or thyme, may prefer well-drained soil, keeping the soil consistently very nearly dry may deprive the plants of the moisture necessary for their survival and growth. Furthermore, the statement in solution B that implies herbs require close care contradicts the generally accepted knowledge about the low maintenance nature of many herbs. In summary, Solution A is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it offers better conditions to ensure the successful growth of an herb garden without actual soil. It takes into account the need for the moisture that is more supportive of plant growth, development and overall low maintenance characteristics of many herbs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, on this particular day, the narrator is feeling more energetic and healthier than usual. She is able to go for a pleasant walk and enjoy the beautiful day, which indicates that her usual pregnancy-related discomforts are not as bothersome as they generally are.

Choices: - slowly - quickly - symmetrically - easily A: A:","completion":"Easily Reactive elements can combine more easily with other elements. To provide a deeper understanding, let's take a closer look at what reactive elements are and how reactivity works in chemical reactions. Reactivity is a chemical property that describes the tendency of an element to undergo chemical changes when it comes into contact with other elements or compounds. Highly reactive elements are more likely to form compounds and engage in chemical reactions, whereas less reactive elements are more likely to resist changes to their structure and remain in their elemental state. Reactivity depends on several factors, including the number of valence electrons (electrons in the outermost electron shell) and the atomic structure of an element. Elements can be grouped into various categories depending on their reactivity. Some well-known examples include: 1. Alkali metals (Group 1 elements in the periodic table), such as lithium (Li), sodium (Na), and potassium (K), are highly reactive. These metals have one valence electron, which is readily lost in chemical reactions. Their reactivity increases down the group because it becomes easier to lose that electron as the atomic size increases. 2. Alkaline earth metals (Group 2 elements), including magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca), are also reactive but less so than alkali metals. They have two valence electrons, which can be lost during chemical reactions. Similar to alkali metals, their reactivity also increases down the group. 3. Halogens (Group 17 elements), such as fluorine (F), chlorine (Cl), and bromine (Br), are highly reactive nonmetals with seven valence electrons. They readily accept an electron to achieve a stable electron configuration, leading to frequent participation in chemical reactions. In a chemical reaction, highly reactive elements, like those mentioned above, are more likely to combine with other elements as they aim to achieve stable electron configurations by losing, gaining, or sharing electrons. Since reactive elements are more prone to engage in chemical reactions, they can be said to combine more easily with other elements. In contrast, less reactive elements, such as noble gases (Group 18 elements) like helium (He), neon (Ne), and argon (Ar), have a full set of valence electrons and are already in a stable electron configuration. As a result, they are reluctant to participate in chemical reactions and are less likely to combine with other elements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: WHERE WAS YUKO MORIGUCHI'S DAUGHTER FOUND? Movie plot title: Confessions Movie plot: Junior high school teacher Yuko Moriguchi (Takako Matsu) announces to her class that she will resign before spring break. Moriguchi reveals that because the HIV-positive biological father of her daughter Manami was ill, she used to bring Manami (Mana Ashida) to school with her. One day, after school, she returned to the room where Manami was but found her gone. Her daughter was later found drowned in a school swimming pool. She then explains that two pupils in her class, whom she dubs \\"Student A\\" and \\"Student B\\", have murdered her four-year-old daughter. She had found a small bunny purse amongst Manami's belongings which should not have belonged there, which led her to question Shuya, one of her students. Shuya, who immediately admitted killing Manami, mocked her compassionate reaction to his feigned expression of remorse with \\"just kidding\\". Having revealed their identities, she explained that because the killers, as minors, are protected by the Juvenile Law of 1947, turning them in wouldn't make a difference. So to exact revenge on them, she admits injecting her late daughter's biological father's HIV-contaminated blood in the milk cartons of the two students who she claimed to have murdered her daughter. The rest of the film switches between the aftermath of Moriguchi's confession and the events before the confession through a series of first-person narratives from Moriguchi and her three students. Naoki Shimomura (Kaoru Fujiwara), Student B, becomes a shut-in because he believes he has acquired AIDS from drinking HIV-contaminated milk. His mother (Yoshino Kimura), after spotting the hidden malicious messages in well-wishes cards from Naoki's classmates, realizes her son was somehow involved with an earlier incident. She decides to commit murder-suicide to free her son and herself from torment, but in the ensuing struggle, Naoki kills her. The police arrest him for the murder. Shuya Watanabe (Yukito Nishii), Student A, explains that his mother abused him before leaving to pursue her scientific ambitions....

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It is important to spend time in nature and sometimes get out of where? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - city - man made - indoors - town - artificial A:","completion":"Spending time in nature is essential for the overall health and well-being of individuals. The most suitable option to answer the above question is \\"get out of city\\" and \\"indoors.\\" However, all options contribute in some way to the understanding of why it's crucial to spend time in nature. Getting out of the city: Cities are densely populated urban environments that often lack an abundance of natural landscapes and green spaces. Noise, air pollution, intense traffic, and the constant hustle and bustle of everyday city life can heavily contribute to stress and fatigue. Escaping to a natural environment, such as a forest, beach, or national park, can allow individuals to experience fresh air, tranquility, and a mental reset that's vital for overall health. Exploring nature outside of town: Similar to the city, smaller towns may not have multiple green spaces or natural landscapes within their borders. Getting out of town to immerse oneself in nature is an excellent way of connecting with the environment and renewing one's perspective on life. Stepping away from man-made and artificial surroundings: Man-made and artificial environments often do not provide the same benefits as natural surroundings. Natural landscapes offer diverse ecosystems that promote biodiversity and the opportunity to observe and interact with wildlife in their native habitats. Stepping away from artificial environments allows individuals to appreciate nature on a deeper level. Spending time outdoors instead of indoors: Being indoors for extended periods can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and an increased risk of physical and mental health issues. By stepping outside and spending time in nature, individuals can engage in physical activities such as walking, hiking, or swimming that promote cardiovascular health, increased energy, and enhanced mood. In conclusion, spending time in nature by getting out of the city, town, or artificial environment and stepping outdoors is crucial for mental, emotional, and physical well-being. It allows individuals to connect with the natural world, reduce stress, improve their mood, and enhance their overall health."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the text and determine if the sentence is true: Since '82 Federal Chancellor (elected by \\"constructive vote of no confidence\\" against former Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, Social Democratic Party (SPD); reelected 1983, 1987, 1991 and 1994). This makes Helmut Kohl the longest-serving chancellor of the Federal Republic, passing by Konrad Adenauer, the first chancellor, this October. Sentence: The Federal REpublic will be less stable without Helmut Kohl.","completion":"The text does not provide sufficient information for us to conclude whether the sentence \\"The Federal Republic will be less stable without Helmut Kohl\\" is true or false. While the text highlights Helmut Kohl's tenure as the longest-serving chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany and mentions several instances of his re-election, it does not provide any details about his specific accomplishments or policies during his time in office. Therefore, we cannot make a determination about the potential impact of his absence on the stability of the Federal Republic. Furthermore, the concept of 'stability' is broad and can refer to various aspects including political, economic, or social stability. The text does not provide specific indications of how Helmut Kohl contributed to any of these aspects of stability. The sentence in question is making an inference that cannot be substantiated based on the information provided in the text. To fully assess the claim, it would require further information detailing Kohl's roles, policies, effects on domestic and foreign affairs, his impact on Germany's economy, and responses from the public and political sphere to his leadership. Understanding the specific context in which Kohl operated and the specific contributions he made can provide a more grounded analysis of the potential impact of his absence on the stability of the Federal Republic. We must remember that the stability of a country depends on many factors, and while the leadership of a long-serving chancellor can certainly be impactful, it is not the sole determinant of a country's stability. Other factors like the political system, international relations, social issues, and economic conditions can all play significant roles in determining a country's stability. So, in conclusion, based on the information provided in the text, it's inconclusive to confirm the truthfulness of the sentence: \\"The Federal Republic will be less stable without Helmut Kohl.\\""},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Jordan looked high and low for his lost puppy but could not find it. Given the context: How would Jordan feel afterwards? Options are: i. jordan doesnt give up; ii. pessimistic about the dog being found; iii. optimistic about finding the cat; Answer:","completion":"Answer: ii. pessimistic about the dog being found In the given scenario, Jordan has been searching high and low for his lost puppy but has not been able to find it. This experience is undoubtedly disheartening and frustrating for Jordan, as losing a pet can evoke strong emotional responses, such as sadness, worry, and a sense of responsibility for the well-being of the lost animal. Given the three options provided, the most fitting description of how Jordan would feel after this exhaustive search is \\"pessimistic about the dog being found.\\" This is because, after putting in considerable effort without any success, it is reasonable to assume that Jordan may begin to feel less hopeful about the chances of finding his puppy. In this state of mind, he might start to believe that the prospects for locating his dog are bleak, and this pessimism can take a toll on his emotional well-being. On the other hand, the first option states that \\"Jordan doesn't give up.\\" Although this option may seem plausible, it is not a description of how Jordan would feel after the experience; rather, it highlights a characteristic or attitude Jordan may adopt during the search. As the question asks how Jordan would feel \\"afterwards,\\" this option does not accurately focus on his emotional state. Lastly, the third option refers to Jordan being \\"optimistic about finding the cat.\\" This is not a valid answer, as it strays from the context provided and does not pertain to Jordan's lost puppy. The question specifically asks about feelings regarding the lost dog, not any other animal, making this choice irrelevant to the scenario. In conclusion, based on the given context and options provided, it can be inferred that Jordan would likely feel pessimistic about his dog being found after trying his hardest and not yielding the desired outcome. This feeling of pessimism captures the emotional toll that losing a pet and being unable to locate it can have on a person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature... What does Kane probably think of Mike Pompeo? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - he is level headed for seeing the importance of canceling the - not enough information - he can save them money - he had the right to have the drills cancelled Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the correct answer is: \\"not enough information.\\" There is no specific mention of Foreign Minister Kang's opinion of Mike Pompeo in the text provided.

Does the sentence \\"Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659, and the island has a population of about 4,250 inhabitants, mainly descended from people from Britain – settlers (\\"planters\\") and soldiers – and slaves who were brought there from the beginning of settlement – initially from Africa (the Cape Verde Islands, Gold Coast and west coast of Africa are mentioned in early records), then India and Madagascar.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"When was Saint Helena first settled?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence provides a valid answer to the question \\"When was Saint Helena first settled?\\" According to the provided information, it states that Saint Helena was first settled by the English in 1659. This directly addresses the question and gives a specific year for the initial settlement of the island. To offer an in-depth understanding, it is essential to understand the historical context and additional details related to the settlement. Saint Helena, an island located in the South Atlantic Ocean, is considered one of the most remote inhabited places globally. It measures about 122 square kilometers (47 square miles) and is part of a British Overseas Territory which includes Ascension Island and Tristan da Cunha. Saint Helena is most famous for being the site of Napoleon Bonaparte's exile and eventual death. The English East India Company was granted a charter by Oliver Cromwell in 1657 to govern Saint Helena and establish a fort and a permanent garrison on the island. The goal was to strategically use it as a supply depot and a reprieve for ships traveling from Europe to Asia and back, given its location in the middle of the trade route. A ship named the 'Constantinople Merchant' arrived in 1659, carrying the first English settlers, Captain John Dutton, his crew, and civilian planters, marking the beginning of the settlement. The population of Saint Helena grew over time as settlers, soldiers, and slaves arrived from various parts of the world. The island's early population consisted of people mainly from Britain as well as African slaves brought there from places like Cape Verde Islands, Gold Coast, and the west coast of Africa. Later, indentured laborers and slaves from India and Madagascar were also brought over to the island. Today, the island's population stands at about 4,250 inhabitants, primarily descended from the original settlers, soldiers, and slaves. The unique and diverse mix of early settlers has resulted in a rich cultural and historical heritage on the island, making it a fascinating place to study and visit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Coming off their bye week, the Patriots traveled to Candlestick Park to face the 49ers in the first of two straight West Coast games for the Patriots. After a 49ers punt on their first series started the game, Cassel's second pass of the game was intercepted by linebacker Takeo Spikes to give the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 45-yard line. On the next play, 49ers quarterback J. T. O'Sullivan threw an interception of his own, this one to Meriweather at the Patriots' 4-yard line. A three-and-out for the Patriots on their ensuing drive ended in a 35-yard Chris Hanson punt that gave the 49ers the ball at the Patriots' 30-yard line to begin their next drive. A defensive holding penalty on Patriots cornerback Deltha O'Neal on third down extended the drive, leading to a 16-yard touchdown catch by running back Frank Gore that gave the 49ers a 7-0 lead. On the Patriots' next drive, a fumbled snap by Cassel set up 3rd and 8 from the Patriots' own 34-yard line; Cassel then threw a deep pass to Moss, which was caught at the 49ers' 21-yard line and run in for a 66-yard touchdown that tied the game at 7-7. A 38-yard Isaac Bruce reception from O'Sullivan on the 49ers' ensuing possession backed the Patriots' defense up to their own 22-yard line, and two plays later, O'Sullivan and Bruce again connected on a pass, this one a touchdown from 6 yards out to give the 49ers a 14-7 lead. An exchange of punts brought the teams into the second quarter, where on the third play of a Patriots drive Cassel threw his second interception of the day, this one to Nate Clements on the 49ers' 6-yard line on a deep pass intended to Moss. The 49ers went three-and-out, leading to a 13-play, 40-yard Patriots drive where a third down sack of Cassel in the red zone set up a 35-yard Gostkowski field goal that trimmed the 49ers' lead to 14-10. The 49ers punted again on their next possession, giving the Patriots the ball on their own 20-yard line with just over three minutes remaining in the first half. 11 plays later, the Patriots faced a 2nd and goal from the 49ers' 2-yard line, where a Faulk touchdown run gave the Patriots a 17-14 lead at halftime. On the Patriots' opening possession of the second half, Cassel was sacked to begin the drive, and then again was sacked nine plays later on third down to force the Patriots to punt. Two plays later, O'Sullivan was intercepted by safety Rodney Harrison to give the Patriots the ball at the 49ers' 24-yard line. The Patriots reached the 49ers' 1-yard line, but were denied the end zone twice by the 49ers, setting up fourth down from the 2-yard line. Faulk took the direct snap on the play and ran in for his second touchdown of the game, giving the Patriots a 24-14 lead. Following a 49ers punt, an 8-play Patriots drive resulted in a 40-yard Gostkowski field goal that extended the Patriots lead to 27-14 early in the fourth quarter. Starting from their own 20-yard line, the 49ers began an 11-play drive that ended on a 5-yard touchdown catch by Bruce from O'Sullivan that cut the Patriots' lead to 27-21. The Patriots responded with a 10-play series of their own; six plays into the drive, Faulk caught a second-down pass and was originally deemed to be down short of the first down, but the Patriots challenged the play and Faulk was found to have gained the necessary first down yardage. An offensive pass interference penalty on Moss set up a 3rd and 20 that the Patriots did not convert; Gostkowski then hit a 49-yard line field goal to extend the Patriots' lead to 30-21. A third-down sack of O'Sullivan led to a fourth-down interception by O'Neal that gave the Patriots the ball with 2:45 remaining in the game. The 49ers used all of their timeouts during the Patriots' next possession, and after a Patriots punt, the 49ers failed to convert on fourth down to give the Patriots the ball to end the game.

Paragraph: Life for the partners of Cates, Katalinic & Lund holds little of the glamour one might expect from a career in law. Instead of lunches at Lut��ce, they caucus at the Palace Diner in Queens. Wooing clients means passing out fliers on street corners, not securing box seats at Madison Square Garden. To make ends meet, one partner stacks pipe and cleans the yard at a plumbing warehouse. Another handles urine samples in a hospital lab. A sign of failure, of a feeble economy, perhaps? Hardly. They are heeding the call of a growing pool of law schools, which are for the first time pointing graduates in a new direction and teaching them how to get there. Forget the lure of large firms, the security of a government post. Here is how to grapple \\"in the service of justice,\\" as many of the schools put it, instead. Convinced that corporate largess and government programs barely dent the nation's legal needs, the law schools are urging graduates to buck tradition, pass up big salaries and ignore mushrooming student debt to join tiny neighborhood practices or simply start their own, all with an eye toward charging no more than their clients can afford. This is not pro bono legal work; it is \\"low bono,\\" a term the schools coined to define the atypical kind of law career they are training students for. While its practitioners do charge for their services, they are also dead set on turning no one away - or at least as few as possible. \\"When you go into this kind of social justice law, it's really brutal and you're almost guaranteed to struggle for a couple of years before there's a light at the end of the tunnel,\\" said Fred Rooney, director of the Community Legal Resource Network at City University of New York School of Law, from which the lawyers of the newly formed Cates, Katalinic & Lund graduated last May. \\"But if our graduates don't do it, the millions of people who cannot access justice in this country will continue to soar.\\" The movement, primly called the consortium, started four years ago by CUNY, Northeastern University, the University of Maryland and St. Mary's Law School in Texas.

Context: Meetings for worship and study are held at Kingdom Halls, which are typically functional in character, and do not contain religious symbols. Witnesses are assigned to a congregation in whose \\"territory\\" they usually reside and attend weekly services they refer to as \\"meetings\\" as scheduled by congregation elders. The meetings are largely devoted to study of Watch Tower Society literature and the Bible.

How does the sentence end? I prefer the dermatologist's treatments for acne rather than the over-the-counter treatments, because the","completion":"dermatologist's treatments are more personalized, effective, and backed by scientific research. Firstly, the dermatologist's treatments are personalized to an individual's specific skin type, acne severity, and lifestyle factors. Over-the-counter (OTC) treatments, on the other hand, are designed to cater to a wide range of consumers and might not be suitable for everyone. A dermatologist will conduct a thorough skin examination, consider the patient's medical history, and possibly run some tests to identify the underlying causes of the acne. Based on these factors, the dermatologist can formulate a unique treatment plan that directly targets the root causes of the acne, and not just the symptoms. Moreover, the efficacy of the treatments prescribed by a dermatologist is often higher than that of OTC treatments. Dermatologists have access to a wide range of treatments, such as prescription topical creams that contain retinoids, antibiotics, or azelaic acid, and oral medications like antibiotics, hormonal therapies, or even isotretinoin for severe cases. These prescription medications often have a higher concentration of active ingredients and are more rigorously tested for their efficacy, ensuring that patients receive the most effective treatment possible. OTC treatments, on the other hand, may not be as potent or effective due to their lower concentrations of active ingredients. In addition to personalized solutions and increased efficacy, dermatologist's treatments are also backed by scientific research and professional expertise. A dermatologist undergoes extensive training in the field of skin care and is better equipped to choose the latest, evidence-based treatments for acne. They are also able to monitor the progress of the treatment, make necessary adjustments to ensure optimal results, and identify any potential side effects early on, minimizing the risk of complications. OTC treatments, while being widely available and affordable, might not have the same level of professional oversight and may result in individuals struggling to find the right product through a trial-and-error process. This lack of guidance may lead to further skin complications or extended periods of unsuccessful treatments. Lastly, a dermatologist is also proficient in the use of advanced acne treatments such as chemical peels, microdermabrasion, laser therapies, or even light therapy. These treatments are typically not available over-the-counter and can provide a more comprehensive approach to tackling severe or persistent cases of acne. These treatment options also signify the dermatologist's ability to adapt and cater their approach to an individual's needs and provide a more holistic acne management plan. In summary, the dermatologist's treatments for acne are preferred over over-the-counter treatments due to their ability to provide personalized solutions, increased efficacy, professional expertise, and access to a wider range of advanced treatment options. These factors contribute to a more targeted approach towards addressing the root causes of acne and achieving long-lasting results, improving the overall skin health and well-being of individuals who choose to invest in professional dermatological care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason I'm giving this two stars was because my problem was resolved. Food wasn't bad, staff was alright and not completely to blame... but the reason I'm writing a review at all is because of a situation that, in my mind, really should not have happened. (Edit: For clarity, I ordered this online for delivery. Why? Because how often do you come across a Subway that delivers?) Let's first take a moment to discuss a BLT. Pretty simple sandwich, right? BLT: Bacon Lettuce Tomato; a sandwich so bold, so forthright that it needs no further explanation. Adding things to it is on you, of course, so when I ordered Subway's BLT I kept that in mind, assuming there would be no issues with such a simple base. What I end up with is my order... sans the lettuce and tomato. I couldn't make this up: A BLT without lettuce and tomato. Normally, I'm the type of person who kind of shrugs off minor mistakes (mostly because I'm too hungry and the food is still consumable), but 1/3 of my sandwich is completely missing; I was too hungry NOT to do anything about it. A phone call to the store has me talking with the manager, telling me about the standard subway policies. Basically, the only standard on the sandwich is the meat, and everything is up to you. So... there really is not point in even telling them the name of the sandwich you want and adding to that--you have to name what's in it and what you want added to that. I fail to see the logic in having pre-constructed sandwiches at all. So unless you're in the restaurant guiding them step-by-step on how to make your sandwich, you'll pretty much have to tell them, \\"Yes, I want bacon AND lettuce AND tomato in my BLT.\\" (For future ref: if you really want bacon in your BLT, you're going to have to order double meat, or you'll just end up with the essence of bacon. Those little slivers of bacon really don't cut it.) I'd go into things about using common sense even if Subway's policies say otherwise... but then I'd be breaking Yelp's review guidelines.

We were both in great anger. \\"Never set foot in this house again!\\" stormed Father. With tears welling up in my eyes, I rushed out of the flat and ran along the street. The street lights were shining, causing rather sad-feeling. I wandered aimlessly. A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me.

I can't stand his outrageous words: \\"I can't throw you away, let alone these old papers?\\" All the lights were off except Father's. Dad was always like this.

Does the term grow mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"Yes, the term \\"grow\\" means the same thing in both of these sentences. It refers to the process of improving or increasing gradually, especially in size, quantity, or complexity. In both instances, the term is used to describe the process of a living organism developing, adapting, and expanding in size, through various stages of its life cycle. In the first sentence, \\"Corn doesn't grow here,\\" the term \\"grow\\" indicates that the environment or conditions in this particular area are not suitable for the cultivation and development of corn. This could be because of factors such as climate, soil composition, or other agricultural considerations. Here, \\"grow\\" is used to describe the failure of the corn plant to thrive and reach its full potential in this specific location. In the second sentence, \\"In these forests, mushrooms grow under the trees,\\" the term \\"grow\\" is again used to describe the development and expansion of a living organism, in this case, mushrooms, as they progress through their life cycle. In this context, the mushrooms are thriving under the trees in the forest, where the environmental conditions, such as shade, moisture, and availability of nutrients, are suitable for their growth and proliferation. It is important to note that while the term \\"grow\\" means the same fundamental process in both sentences, the actual growth process for corn and mushrooms differs biologically. Corn is a type of cereal plant that relies on photosynthesis and nutrients from the soil, while mushrooms are fungi that obtain their nutrients through the decomposition of organic matter. Regardless of these biological differences, in both sentences, \\"grow\\" denotes the same essential process of development and expansion of a living organism under suitable conditions."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: What do you think of a forest, what do you see? Just trees? Or do you see many other things, such as singing birds, colorful plants and wild flowers? The forest is a whole of its own. It is full of many different living things. But even though they are all different, they have one thing in common: they all need each other in order to live on. The trees feed the forest \\"people\\" by making food in their leaves; by using sunlight to join water and minerals from the soil and air. Their deep network of roots joins the soil together and stops it from dying out, making it possible for living things to live in it. Human beings are like the living things in the forest. We need one another in order to live. We need the farmers to grow our food, railroad and truck drivers to bring it to our shops and clerks to sell it to us. We need people to prepare our food and cook it and others to take our waste things away. Then, of course, we need doctors, nurses, government leaders, mailmen, telephone operators, and many others. We also need other human beings in another way. We need people for friendship, to talk over our problems, exchange ideas. Think how lonely and unhappy you would be if you lived all alone. Life is a matter of giving and taking. We need to help other people as much as we need other people to help us. Think what a good feeling you have when you have done something for someone else.

Former Wizards owner Irene Pollin wouldn't have a problem with name changing back to Bullets The Washington Wizards will conjure images of the franchise’s more successful past this season with a new, retro, red-white-and-blue motif. The uniforms will feature horizontal stripes, a “dc” logo with a touch reminiscent of the hands that formed the “l’s” in Bullets jerseys, and even a little basketball. Since taking over as majority owner of the Wizards, Ted Leonsis has made it his mission to move forward while maintaining a connection with the past. The one thing Leonsis has thus far refrained from doing is changing the name back to the Bullets, however, despite pleas from many fans to do just that. Those calls may get a bit louder after Abe Pollin’s widow and former Wizards’ co-owner said recently she wouldn’t object to such a change. “I respect my husband’s wishes. I love him very much. I miss him terribly. If the fans want to change it back — hey, why not?” Irene Pollin said. “To me, it’s what do the fans want? What’s going to please them? To me, they’re the ones who support, care.” Abe Pollin changed the name from Bullets to Wizards in 1997, partly because he didn’t want the team to be associated with gun violence. Leonsis has consistently made public comments that he has no plans of going back to the Bullets. Leonsis declined comment when asked to respond last week, but when the Wizards unveiled their new look last May, he told WJFK (106.7 FM) that a name change is “almost like a grandstanding thing. I mean, it’s a cheap way to get people to support you.” He was asked again in October and told WTOP (103.5 FM), “there’s no name change that’s being contemplated.” The Bullets made four trips to the NBA Finals in the 1970s, winning the championship in 1978, then went through a period of mediocrity during the 1980s and 1990s. The team has missed the playoffs in 10 of their 14 seasons as the Wizards, advancing to the second round just once. The possibility of the name going back perhaps became more remote when Gilbert Arenas and Javaris Crittenton were suspended during the 2009-10 season for bringing guns to the locker room. But Leonsis, who started attending Bullets games as a student at Georgetown University, has mostly been reluctant for fear of insulting his predecessors — especially since Abe Pollin died just two years ago — and a desire to stay politically correct. Leonsis has written on his blog and said in interviews that many fans have also expressed that sentiment to him when arguing for a need to avoid calling the team the Bullets. “I don’t agree with that,” Pollin said. “It wasn’t up to me to change it. It was really my husband. He was very uncomfortable. I think he got really upset when our friend, Yitzhak Rabin, was murdered. And I think it bothered him that the team he was involved with had a name like Bullets.” Rabin, the prime minister of Israel, was assassinated in Nov. 1995, a few months after Abe Pollin announced that he was considering a name change for the franchise he bought for 1 million in 1964. The Baltimore Bullets were named after a 234-foot brick factory, the Phoenix Shot Tower, where bullets and cannons were produced from 1828 to 1892. “When we bought the team, it had that name. It was ‘faster than a speeding bullet.’ That was the idea,” Irene Pollin said. “But at the time, the name bullet didn’t really signify violence and death. It was just a fast projectile, really. Which is a really different idea than a bullet that kills. Maybe it can be thought of again as a speeding projectile, but I doubt that Ted would want to change the name back.” The Bullets moved to the Washington area in 1973 but held on to the name for nearly a quarter-century before the switch that coincided with the move to the arena now known as Verizon Center. Some fans and former players have never accepted the change. “I like the name Wizards. You know why? I named it,” Irene Pollin said with a laugh. “For one thing, Washington Bullets is euphonious. Baltimore Bullets has the [alliteration]. But Washington, I thought it needed it’s own thing. We were changing it to something with a ‘W’ that sounded good with the name Washington. That’s why. There was a contest. But actually, what’s interesting, I say I named it, but in the contest, people did come up with the Wizards name. So it wasn’t just me.” Pollin has attended one game since selling the team to Leonsis, sitting next to him for the home opener last season. She plans to attend the home opener against the New Jersey Nets on Monday, but has mostly maintained a low profile since representing the franchise at the NBA draft lottery and wearing her late husband’s championship ring as the Wizards won the rights to select John Wall with the No. 1 overall pick. Pollin was excited when Leonsis re-branded the franchise with a design reminiscent of better times for the organization. “I like the look of it and I think the reason I like it is, because it has a lot of good memories,” Pollin said. “We won the championship. It could be other colors. But it doesn’t matter, there are a lot of people in Washington that remember that and remember that as a really fun time. And really, I like that idea. “Look, he owns the team, he can do whatever he wants,” Pollin said of Leonsis. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Irene Pollin, the former Wizards owner and widow of Abe Pollin, has stated she wouldn't object to the team changing its name back to the Bullets if fans desired it.

Healthcare-acquired infections, as they're known, can lead to longer hospital stays, increased treatment costs, and in some cases, even death, Constanza Correa adds. The CDC director says 200 people per day die of such illnesses. The good news is that Correa and others are testing a simple method that could cut down on such illnesses: Copper bed rails. Copper has been known for millennia as a material that can quickly get rid of bacteria, viruses, and more; in Correa's words, it \\"kills everything.\\" A US study found last year that the rails cut infections from 8.1% to 3.4% of hospital rooms. Correa's team has been replacing bed rails in Chile with copper since last year; so far, they've made the conversion on 150 beds in four hospitals. And \\"bed rails are only the first step. You can have copper IV poles, feeding tables, night tables, even mattress covers.\\" Indeed, an earlier study highlighted at the Blaze investigated copper door handles, toilet seats, and faucets; researchers found that they had 95% fewer \\"bugs\\" on them than standard equipment, the Daily Mail reported in 2008. More recently, researchers in Germany have been exploring the possibilities of copper; they found a 50% reduction in microbes, Deutsche Welle reports. (Another metal may work wonders against superbugs.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Healthcare-acquired infections (HCAIs) pose a significant threat to patients across the globe, with the US alone witnessing a new infection in one in every 25 hospital patients, according to the federal health department. HCAIs can lead to prolonged hospital stays, higher treatment costs, and even death in certain cases, with 200 people reportedly dying every day from such illnesses in the US. Developing countries face even more severe numbers, with infection rates triple that of industrialized countries, as stated by Chilean researcher Constanza Correa. However, a simple method using copper in hospital bed rails has shown potential in reducing these infections. Copper is renowned for its antimicrobial properties, which can quickly eliminate bacteria, viruses, and other infectious agents. A U.S. study found that the incorporation of copper in bed rails cut infection rates from 8.1% to 3.4% of hospital rooms. Taking inspiration from this study, Correa and her team have been working on replacing bed rails in Chile with copper since last year. Their efforts currently span 150 beds across four hospitals. Correa believes that bed rails are merely the first step in a broader campaign to leverage copper's antimicrobial properties in medical infrastructure. She envisions enhancing various hospital equipment, such as IV poles, feeding tables, night tables, and mattress covers, with copper. Prior research has also highlighted the benefits of using copper in preventing infections. A study featured on the Blaze investigated copper door handles, toilet seats, and faucets. These surfaces were found to have 95% fewer \\"bugs\\" than their non-copper counterparts, as reported by the Daily Mail in 2008. More recently, researchers in Germany discovered a 50% reduction in microbes on copper surfaces. With the effectiveness of copper against infections already proven, further implementation of solutions that incorporate the metal could help to curb the threat and widespread impact of HCAIs. The ongoing research and adaptation process has the potential to save lives, reduce recovery time, and ensure safer hospital environments for both patients and healthcare professionals.

It grow along cracks in stone walls and along the roadside near my home in Settignano, which is blooming with spring goodness right now: robinia (black locust) trees, wild garlic (three-cornered leek) and even elderflowers are already bursting. I asked the vendor just to double check, “Is this borage?” “Si,” Came the answer, “Borragine.” He confirmed. “I’ve had it in ravioli,” I started to say, “Brava!” He said, as if we were about to start a guessing game on what could be done with it. Actually, there’s a lot that can be done with it. If you can use it as a ravioli filling with ricotta, then you can imagine it taking the place of spinach in gnudi, too, but also soups or frittata or stirred through polenta. I learned that the flowers are just as delicious, if not more interesting, for their delicate cucumber-like flavour — people told me of their use in salads or cocktails like Pimms, and someone even mentioned she freezes them in ice cubes, what a pretty idea for those first warm nights when you can dine al fresco, homemade cocktail in hand. Then there’s risotto and of course the fritters, much like these ones. Or you can simply deep fry the clusters of buds that haven’t yet burst open like these deep-fried robinia flowers. borage and ricotta crepes The problem, I was thinking, as I took home my bag of borage, is that I can’t decide what to make. There’s simply too much choice. I consulted two of my favourite books that also happen to be cookbooks. Patience Gray’s Honey from a Weed and Luigi Ballerini’s A Feast of Weeds.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: - An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates - Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow - Acid and enzyme in the stomach break the food down - Releases nutrients - Food then pumped into small intestine - Fluid and enzymes from liver and pancreas pumped into small intestine - Help break food into smallest molecules - Nutrients pass through wall of small intestine - Nutrients absorbed into blood stream Answer:","completion":"The final step of the process described is: Nutrients absorbed into the bloodstream. Here is a step-by-step breakdown to justify the process: 1. An enzyme in saliva begins to break down carbohydrates: The process of digestion starts in the mouth with the enzyme in saliva (amylase) initiating the breakdown of carbohydrates. 2. Food is squeezed down the esophagus when you swallow: The process of swallowing helps move the food bolus down the esophagus via a series of muscular contractions called peristalsis. 3. Acid and enzymes in the stomach break the food down: In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes (such as pepsin) further break down the food, particularly proteins, into more basic nutrients. 4. Releases nutrients: As food is broken down into smaller particles, nutrients are released and made available for further breakdown and absorption. 5. Food is then pumped into the small intestine: The partially digested food, called chyme, moves into the small intestine where the majority of digestion and absorption occurs. 6. Fluid and enzymes from the liver and pancreas are pumped into the small intestine: The liver and pancreas release bile and pancreatic juices, respectively, into the small intestine to aid in the breakdown of fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. 7. Help break food into the smallest molecules: The bile and enzymes continue to break down the food particles into their smallest molecular components, such as amino acids, simple sugars, and fatty acids, making them ready for absorption. 8. Nutrients pass through the wall of the small intestine: The vital nutrients, now in their simplest form, pass through the villi and microvilli which line the walls of the small intestine, where they are absorbed. 9. Nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream: The final step is the absorption of these nutrients into the bloodstream, where they can be transported to cells throughout the body to provide energy, support growth, and maintain overall health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Arctic Fox Characteristics The arctic fox is dark gray to bluish brown in the summer. In the winter its fur is white or creamy white. It has a long bushy tail, a short nose and small, curled back ears. It has short legs and thick fur. Its short legs and nose, thick fur and small ears are adaptions that help it survive in cold climates. Because its legs are so short and its ears and nose are small, they are less exposed to the cold. The arctic fox also has thick fur and hair on its paw pads that help keep it warm. When the arctic fox is sleeping, it protects its nose from the cold by curling its bushy tail around its body. The arctic fox is about three feet long and weighs between five and fifteen pounds. Males are larger than females. Diet The arctic fox is an opportunities eater. It will eat just about whatever it comes across. It eats small mammals like lemmings and it also eats birds, insects and eggs. In fact, in the winter it often follows polar bears and wolves and eats their leftover kill. In the summer the arctic fox will carry extra food to its den and store it under rocks to eat later. The arctic fox sometimes even makes its own freezer by digging a hole in the permafrost and storing its food there. A major source of food for the arctic fox is the lemming. In fact, the arctic fox population often peaks every four years in a cycle that follows lemming population changes. Life Cycle The arctic fox mates between February and June. The female builds a new den and gives birth to between six and twelve dark--furred kits. Both the female and the male will take care of the young kits. The male will guard the den and bring food to the den for the mother and the kits. The kits are weaned when they are between two and four weeks old and then they will start to leave the den.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The body's second line of defense against pathogens includes the inflammatory response. If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue. Now, I have a new situation: Two medical school students named Dan and Bob learned about the human immune system. Dan studied more about the subject, and became very interested to pursue it more in the future. Answer this question please: Which student learned that the infected skin area may become painful?

U.S. wrestlers outraged over decision to drop sport from Olympics Olympic gold medalist and current pro wrestler Kurt Angle reacts to the Olympics dropping wrestling. February 13, 2013, 9:00 a.m. To say U.S. wrestlers are unhappy about the IOC's decision to drop their sport from the Olympics is an understatement. “I don't think I've really accepted it yet,” said Cael Sanderson, who won a gold medal at the 2004 Games. “I'll absolutely do everything in my power to make sure that the decision doesn't go through and it isn't finalized in the fall. This is a big deal. You're talking about your kids having that dream of winning a gold medal. It inspires you to be better, to work hard, to set goals.” International Olympic Committee leaders dropped wrestling from the Summer Games on Tuesday. The move is set to take effect for the 2020 Olympics and eliminates a sport that has been a staple of both the ancient and modern Games. Former Olympic champion Tom Brands says the international wrestling community needs to band together and fight. “You have to get people behind you, you have to do it smart,” he said. “You have to do it educated, you have to do it professionally, and you have to do it with some muscle, as well.” The decision by the IOC to phase out wrestling will leave the U.S. without one of its most successful Olympic sports. The only sports in which the Americans have won more medals than wrestling is swimming and track and field. “It just made me sick to think that the opportunity for 14-, 15-, 16-year-old kids who have thoughts about being an Olympic champion is erased,” two-time Olympic gold medalist John Smith said. Former gold medalist Kurt Angle said, “The Americans have been such a big success. I'm hoping the IOC doesn't have something against the American community. This is hard. This is going to hurt college programs. This is going to hurt MMA. Most of all, it's going to affect all those kids, the dreams of wanting to be an Olympic champion.

The hypothesis suggests that Mameluke period designs were of poor quality. However, the premise describes Sabeel Qait Bey as an example of \\"fine design and craftsmanship\\" from the Mameluke period, which indicates that there were high-quality designs during this time. To further explore this topic, it is important to understand the Mameluke period and its artistic achievements. The Mamluks were a powerful military caste that ruled Egypt and the Levant between the 13th and early 16th centuries. The Mamluk period saw the creation of various architectural and artistic masterpieces, many of which are considered among the finest in Islamic art and architecture. The Mamluk period marked a time of great artistic production, and many craftsmen, architects, and artisans played a significant role in shaping the region's aesthetic values. It was during this time that many elegant buildings, such as mosques, educational institutions, and public facilities like Sabeel Qait Bey, were constructed. Sabeel Qait Bey, which is mentioned in the premise, is a fine example of Mamluk craftsmanship. This ornate kiosk dates back to the 15th century and is attributed to Sultan Qait Bey, one of the last Mamluk rulers in Egypt. The kiosk, meant to provide fresh water to visitors, showcases the intricate designs and high level of skill that Mamluk architects and artisans had. This contradicts the hypothesis, which claims that Mamluk period designs were of poor quality. There might have been some design elements or structures from the Mamluk period that were not as well-crafted as others. Nevertheless, it is essential to consider that there is a wide range of quality in any period or style. The hypothesis stating that all Mamluk period designs were of poor quality is an over-generalization that undermines the achievements and contributions of Mamluk artisans. In conclusion, based on the premise provided and the historical and contextual knowledge of the Mamluk period, it is not possible to assert that the hypothesis is true. Sabeel Qait Bey serves as a testament to the fine design and craftsmanship from the Mamluk era, contradicting the idea that Mamluk designs were of poor quality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She may also be the first woman in KFC's nearly 90-year-history to depict the Colonel. The company said the \\"best historical minds at KFC\\" could not remember a woman having stepped into the role. McEntire was approached about doing so in December. \\"I said 'Holy smokes!',\\" McEntire told The AP. \\"KFC has been a part of my life forever.\\" KFC said it picked McEntire because of her Southern roots, and to help promote its new Smoky Mountain BBQ, which combines fried chicken with a taste of barbeque.

Col. Harland Sanders, who died 36 years ago, first started selling fried chicken from a single restaurant in 1930. KFC, now owned by Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum Brands Inc., resurrected the Colonel for its ads in 2015 after a nearly 20 year absence, hiring Rob Lowe, Ray Liotta, Norm MacDonald, Darrell Hammond and Jim Gaffigan.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The Kosovar Parliament refuses to adopt a law for the conservation of cultural monuments in the historical center of Prizren, despite the fact that the initiative is taken from the Ahtisaari plan for independence. In this statement, it is mentioned that the Parliament of Kosovo, the legislative branch of the country's government, is not willing to pass a legislation aiming at preserving the historical and cultural landmarks located within the central area of Prizren, an ancient city in Kosovo. Prizren is known for its rich cultural history and significance, making the conservation of its monuments an important matter. Remarkably, this refusal comes despite the fact that the initiative for the conservation law stems from the Ahtisaari plan. The Ahtisaari plan, or the Comprehensive Proposal for the Kosovo Status Settlement, is a plan formulated by former Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, who had been appointed by the United Nations to oversee negotiations between Serbia and Kosovo regarding the status of Kosovo. The proposal was presented in 2007 and mainly focuses on promoting autonomy, democracy, human rights, and protection and preservation of the cultural heritage in Kosovo. This plan has served as a framework for Kosovo's independence since its declaration in 2008. The refusal of the Kosovar Parliament to adopt this particular law thus raises concerns about the preservation of Prizren's historical center, as well as the country's commitment to protecting its cultural assets. It also highlights potential issues regarding the implementation of the principles outlined in the Ahtisaari plan. It is essential for the Parliament to reconsider this decision and work towards the conservation and protection of the cultural heritage in Prizren. This would not only contribute to the preservation of the city's unique character and identity but would also demonstrate adherence to international commitments and the principles of independence proposed by the Ahtisaari plan.

Tocqueville asserted that the values that had triumphed in the North and were present in the South had begun to suffocate old-world ethics and social arrangements. Legislatures abolished primogeniture and entails, resulting in more widely distributed land holdings. This was a contrast to the general aristocratic pattern in which only the eldest child, usually a man, inherited the estate, which had the effect of keeping large estates intact from generation to generation. In America, in contrast, landed elites were less likely to pass on fortunes to a single child by the action of primogeniture, which meant that as time went by, large estates became broken up within a few generations which, in turn, made the children more equal overall. It was not always a negative development, according to Joshua Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville, since bonds of affection and shared experience between children often replaced the more formal relation between the eldest child and the siblings, characteristic of the previous aristocratic pattern. Overall, in the new democracies, hereditary fortunes became exceedingly difficult to secure and more people were forced to struggle for their own living. This rapidly democratizing society, as Tocqueville understood it, had a population devoted to \\"middling\\" values which wanted to amass, through hard work, vast fortunes. In Tocqueville's mind, this explained why America was so different from Europe. In Europe, he claimed, nobody cared about making money. The lower classes had no hope of gaining more than minimal wealth, while the upper classes found it crass, vulgar, and unbecoming of their sort to care about something as unseemly as money; many were virtually guaranteed wealth and took it for granted. At the same time in America, workers would see people fashioned in exquisite attire and merely proclaim that through hard work they too would soon possess the fortune necessary to enjoy such luxuries. Despite maintaining with Aristotle, Montesquieu, and others that the balance of property determined the balance of power, Tocqueville argued that, as America showed, equitable property holdings did not ensure the rule of the best men.

What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the unfortunate crash of the Genesis space capsule that occurred in the Utah desert, resulting in the loss of its valuable payload, which included billions of solar particles collected from the sun. The incident took place on a Wednesday and marked a disappointing end to an otherwise successful three-year scientific journey. The Genesis mission was designed to collect and return samples of solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun's outer layers. These samples are invaluable scientific resources for better understanding the composition of the sun, exploring the birth and early evolution of our solar system, and providing further insight into the elemental and isotopic make-up of the solar wind. The space capsule was expected to make a safe return to Earth by deploying a parachute for a controlled descent. However, due to some last-minute complications, the parachute system failed, ultimately leading to the crash in the Utah desert. It is important to note that before this unfortunate event, the mission was considered near-flawless, with the space capsule having successfully performed its intended functions throughout the three-year journey. The crash of the Genesis space capsule was not only a significant setback to the scientific community, but it also underscored the importance of space mission reliability and the inherent risks associated with space exploration. It serves as a reminder of the need for meticulous planning, thorough testing, and constant innovation in order to ensure the successful accomplishment of future missions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Barb and Ann were friends. The used to play together outside in the yard till one day Barb's parents found out that she had sickle cell anemia. They haven't played together since. But I can use this background: Some individuals have a specific mutation in the primary sequence of their hemoglobin molecules that causes them to aggregate, resulting in a deformation of their red blood cells. This abnormality is genetic in nature. A person may inherit the gene from one parent and have sickle cell trait (only some of the hemoglobin is hemoglobin S), which is usually not life-threatening. Inheriting the gene from both parents will result in sickle cell disease, which is a very serious condition. What is an answer for this question: Which girl had hemoglobin S in her blood? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Barb is the girl with hemoglobin S in her blood. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Barb was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, a genetic condition caused by a mutation in the hemoglobin molecules of an individual's red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia is characterized by the presence of hemoglobin S, an abnormal type of hemoglobin that causes red blood cells to become misshapen and sickle-shaped, leading to various health complications. The description of Barb's sudden change in lifestyle and inability to continue playing with Ann suggests that she has been affected by the symptoms of sickle cell disease, which may include fatigue, frequent infections, and episodes of pain. In the provided background information, it is explained that inheriting the gene for hemoglobin S from one parent results in sickle cell trait, whereas inheriting the gene from both parents leads to sickle cell disease. Since Barb has been diagnosed with sickle cell anemia, which is synonymous with sickle cell disease, she must have inherited the gene from both of her parents. This confirms that it is Barb who has hemoglobin S in her blood as a result of her genetic condition."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

It can refer to a person, organization, or object, but in this case, it's too broad. The specific type of entity is a human, so that's the correct answer. (c). abbreviation - An abbreviation is a shortened form of a word or phrase. This doesn't fit the context of the question, as we're talking about a person who had a thought, not a shortened word. (e). numeric - Numeric refers to numbers or numerical values. The answer to this question is about a person, not a number. (f). location - A location is a specific point, area, or place. The question is about a person, not a place, so this is not the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They often work extra hours, suffer from loss of creative ability and have little time to make friends. When they go off from work late at night, somethimes they might think of asking for a leave the next day and having a holiday somewhere.

The hierarchy: This term indicates an ordered system or arrangement of things, such as a chain of command. 2. OMB Bulletin 94-01: This refers to a specific bulletin (official statement or communication) published by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in the United States. OMB is responsible for producing budget and policy guidance within the federal government. 3. November 16, 1993: This is the date on which OMB Bulletin 94-01 was published. 4. Hypothesis: The OMB Bulletin 94-01 had the list of the entire chain of command. Given the information provided in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise merely states that \\"The hierarchy was published\\" in OMB Bulletin 94-01 on November 16, 1993. It does not specify which hierarchy or the extent of the hierarchy that was published. The hierarchy could refer to a broad range of possibilities, such as an organizational chart for a government agency, a specific part of an organization's chain of command, or any ordered system related to government policy. If we knew more specifics about the hierarchy in question, we might be able to draw a more concrete conclusion about the hypothesis. Furthermore, the phrase \\"entire chain of command\\" suggests the hypothesis is referring to a comprehensive hierarchy. We cannot confirm from the given premise that the published hierarchy in OMB Bulletin 94-01 was indeed complete or exhaustive. It might have been a partial representation, focused on specific aspects or functional areas, or part of a larger series of bulletins providing more context. To conclude, based on the premise alone, we cannot definitively determine whether the hypothesis \\"The OMB Bulletin 94-01 had the list of the entire chain of command\\" is true. Additional information specifying the nature and context of the hierarchy published in the bulletin is necessary to make a more well-informed judgment. It would be appropriate to explore the contents of OMB Bulletin 94-01 and relevant historical context to determine if the published hierarchy addresses the entire chain of command, or if it provides partial or specific information about the chain of command within the context of the bulletin's purpose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With 38 songs in the Top 10 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary charts, Diamond has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, making him one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Neil Diamond has been touring around the world consecutively for 50 years. Neil Diamond 50 - 50th Anniversary Collection Diamond was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1984 and into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2011. Diamond was born in Brooklyn, New York, to a Jewish family descended from Russian and Polish immigrants. His parents were Rose (nee Rapaport) and Akeeba \\"Kieve\\" Diamond, a dry-goods merchant. He grew up in several homes in Brooklyn, having also spent four years in Cheyenne, Wyoming, where his father was stationed in the army. In Brooklyn he attended Erasmus Hall High School and was a member of the Freshman Chorus and Choral Club, along with classmate Barbra Streisand. They were not close friends at the time, Diamond recalls: \\"We were two poor kids in Brooklyn. We hung out in the front of Erasmus High and smoked cigarettes.\\" After his family moved he then attended Abraham Lincoln High School, and was a member of the fencing team. Also on the team was his best friend, future Olympic fencer Herb Cohen. For his 16th birthday, he received his first guitar. When he was 16, and still in high school, Diamond spent a number of weeks at Surprise Lake Camp, a camp for Jewish children in upstate New York, when folk singer Pete Seeger performed a small concert. Seeing the widely recognized singer perform, and watching other children singing songs for Seeger that they wrote themselves, had an immediate effect on Diamond, who then became aware of the possibility of writing his own songs. \\"And the next thing, I got a guitar when we got back to Brooklyn, started to take lessons and almost immediately began to write songs,\\" he said. He adds that his attraction to songwriting was the \\"first real interest\\" he had growing up, besides helping him release his youthful \\"frustrations\\". Diamond also used his newly developing skill to write poetry. By writing poems for girls he was attracted to in school, he soon learned it often won their hearts. His male classmates took note and began asking him to write poems for them which they would sing and use with equal success. He spent the summer following his graduation as a waiter in the Catskills resort area. There he first met Jaye Posner, who would years later become his wife. Diamond next attended New York University as a pre-med major on a fencing scholarship, again on the fencing team with Herb Cohen. He was a member of the 1960 NCAA men's championship fencing team. Often bored in class, he found writing song lyrics more to his liking. He began cutting classes and taking the train up to Tin Pan Alley, where he tried to get some of his songs heard by local music publishers. In his senior year, when he was just 10 units short of graduation, Sunbeam Music Publishing offered him a 16-week job writing songs for 50 a week (equivalent to about US405 per week, in 2017 dollars), and he dropped out of college to accept it.

Here is an article: I have a working definition of power, which came to me in an anecdote about Prince. One night at the end of last summer, according to someone who was there, Prince, the elusive chanteur, went to a concert in New York. Twenty minutes into the show, he decided he wanted McDonald’s French fries. Fifteen minutes after that, McDonald’s French fries were served to him on a white china plate. He ate standing up. Power like that has no uniform. In the late 1970s and 1980s, white-collar women began to dress for the power they wanted, not the power they had. Suits were gray, maybe navy. Collars were white. Jackets were double-breasted, the better to hide a pair of breasts. If uniformity was the object of ‘‘power dressing,’’ the prototype was Katharine Hepburn: a woman for whom pockets seemed invented; who embodied the whole idea of a tall order; whose tomboy élan and gun-moll humor, in combination with a number of custom suits, made her the ultimate midcentury working girl. As Hepburn once said of Humphrey Bogart, ‘‘He’s a real man, nothing feminine about him.’’ A powerful woman couldn’t have much feminine about her either. This spring, the codes have been switched. ‘‘Unisex’’ no longer means ‘‘mannish,’’ but rather glamorously bisexual in a fin-de-siècle way. ‘‘Nine to five’’ means ‘‘nine a.m. to five a.m.,’’ which means daywear looks a lot like Saturday-night wear. I’m not sure ‘‘appropriate’’ means anything. Here’s a list I made of looks you should try right now (unless it’s actually a list of things Prince once wore that I love): Harley-ready leather, head-to-toe polka dots, oversize white shirts with black thigh-high stockings, brassy or brocaded jackets over Elizabethan frills, silk suits in violet or orange. What Hepburn in the ’50s was to women at work in the ’80s, Prince in the ’80s — half-freaky, half-ladylike, and always a bit overdressed — is to us now. The new looks may be too loud to confer real authority, but with the right attitude, and if no one else at your office reads this article, you may just look so extraordinary as to seem irreplaceable. Gucci is leading the craze. Last January, a hitherto-unknown designer, the 43-year-old Alessandro Michele, was promoted from inside the fashion house to become its creative director and the toast of the industry. His spring 2016 women’s wear show was, accordingly, a lesson in rapid advancement, as well in the charms of unexpectedness. Secretary dresses and skirts with matching blouses — pussy-bowed, preposterously colored, embroidered — got louder and sheerer as the show went on, proving that outfits can be as open-concept as offices. Trousers came purposefully, imperfectly creased, perhaps to remind us that if women on the make are no longer ironing men’s clothes, we’re also short of time to iron our own. In the mid 1990s, the Chicago Tribune’s ‘‘Women at Work’’ columnist, Carol Kleiman, proposed that a woman fed up with sexist style rules should dress for a casual Friday, ‘‘like a Mighty Morphin Power Ranger, preferably in a very bright color (I prefer shocking pink), with comfortable boots,’’ since in an outfit like this, ‘‘no one will dare mess with you by suggesting a list of dress-down clothes to wear to work.’’ Kleiman would have loved the opening look at Louis Vuitton: a pink leather moto on a pink-haired model, paired with an embellished kilt and flatforms. If the ‘‘power suit’’ circa Tom Ford at Gucci was lean and mean and made a gal look like a neo-noir detective, the new or alternative suiting is versatile and mismatched, the look of a superhero halfway through a costume change: satin blazers with cargo pants in monochrome (Ford, at his namesake label), deconstructed tweeds with raw-edged leather and biker boots (Lanvin) or Converse and sequins (Marc Jacobs). I’m personally craving a navy pinstripe two-piece (Versace), the skirt knee-length and frayed with a careless high slit, the jacket left unzipped over a navel-baring Oxford in computer blue. If we’re always working as late as we say we are, we might as well dress for Friday like it’s Saturday night. Or like it’s a lucky Sunday morning. For spring, lingerie was the rage at Balenciaga, where Alexander Wang showed nothing that wasn’t pure white; at Givenchy, where Riccardo Tisci maxed out the potential of black and white crepe-back satin and point-de-gaze lace; and even at Céline, where Phoebe Philo showed a few loose-cut slips. Call it bedroom-to-boardroom dressing, a fad so oddly romantic as to be totally uncool — though Prince, no stranger to lace, would likely say otherwise. To be cool, Prince told Rolling Stone in 1990, ‘‘all you have to ask yourself is, ‘Is there anybody I’m afraid of?’ If not, then you’re cool.’’ Maybe it’s enough to be fearless, redundant to be fearsome; men have tended, anyway, to be afraid of the women they don’t scare. Certainly — I’m not being facetious here — one way to suggest you have nothing to fear at work, on the subway or on the street is to dress every inch the soft target. A decade after ‘‘The Woman’s Dress for Success Book’’ (1977) by John T. Molloy, the best-selling guide to Hepburnesque professionalism at work, the author complained to The Los Angeles Times that businesswomen ‘‘fluff out’’ at the top. ‘‘They wear conservative clothing for 10 promotions,’’ he said, ‘‘then deny that they were tough as nails to get there and start dressing like Madame Bovary.’’ If Molloy meant to suggest that women who run with the wolves shouldn’t wear sheep’s clothes, he may have had a point, though I’d say the clothes he recommended — those ‘‘boring but powerful’’ separates in colorless cotton and wool — were considerably more sheepish than those he mocked, asking: ‘‘Can you imagine a man wearing an orange suit?’’ Luckily, today you can. Of course, Molloy did not consider the odds that a woman — in a matching tangelo pant and blazer from Altuzarra’s spring show, perhaps — has been denying herself risk or frivolity in her sartorial choices for years, and only now is no longer in denial; the probability that a woman whose success depends on being seen as ‘‘one of the guys’’ might, upon getting there, look around and say, Wait, I take it back.

PUBLISHED:. 07:51 EST, 28 July 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:19 EST, 28 July 2013. Loyal: Dinah May (left) was assistant to Michael Winner for 35 years and was with him at his death. Michael Winner's long-serving personal assistant has told how he died peacefully in her arms. Dinah May, 59, said the film director and food critic had died quietly after she told him his friends 'in heaven are waiting for you'. The former model and Miss Great Britain was Mr Winner's personal assistant for 35 years. Her notoriously outrageous and straight-talking boss would famously shout 'DINAH!' whenever he needed anything. Miss May's loyalty to her boss meant she nursed him through his deteriorating health and became his carer in his final months. She said she had gone to change his dressings as he lay on a coma on the day he died in January when she spoke to him. 'I was just holding his hand and I was saying, \\"What are you holding on for? You said goodbye to everybody, everyone in heaven is waiting for you\\" and suddenly his breath started to change and he took his last breath and that was it,' she told the Sunday Times. She added it was 'heartbreaking' to watch him die. 'He had gone through hell and to see it any longer... No, he had to go. I felt so sorry for him, it was tragic,' she said. Mr Winner left her £300,000 and the £1.2 million Kensington flat he owned in which she lived rent-free. But it was revealed last week he owed £12million in debts which has dramatically shrunk his estate to £4.75million. As a result, Miss May has received a tax bill for £150,000 and has been told there is a £600,000 loan on the flat which she will also have to pay. She said: ‘Michael was great fun but oh, what a complete mess. He always promised me a pension. If he saw me crying because I was worried about the future, he told me not to worry because I was well taken care of in his will. 'And of course I believed him. Towards the end he kept writing and rewriting his will. We used to joke it was like the hokey-cokey. One day someone was in, the next day they were out. I suppose that was because he knew the money was running out. ‘Michael made it clear that his bequests to me should be clear of inheritance tax and gift tax and that if there was any, his estate should pay it.

The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period.

The premise only provides us with the most basic scenario and a limited amount of information to make an accurate assessment. Let's analyze the premise and the hypothesis to understand why this is the case. Premise: A person on their knees next to a car with pieces of wood underneath. In this scenario, all we know is that there is a person kneeling next to a car, and there are pieces of wood underneath the car. This premise doesn't give us any clear information about what the person is doing or their intentions. They could be a mechanic fixing an issue, a car owner trying to change a flat tire, or even a neighbor helping someone with their car. Hypothesis: A mechanic is looking over a broken axle on a customer's car. The hypothesis is a much more specific interpretation of the situation that assumes the person is a mechanic working on repairing a broken axle on the customer's car. However, based on the premise, we cannot confirm this is the case. Several scenarios and interpretations can be drawn from the given premise, and the hypothesis is just one of them. Here are examples of alternative hypotheses that could also be deduced from the premise: 1. The person is not a mechanic but rather the car's owner who is trying to diagnose or fix an issue with the vehicle. 2. The car is stuck, and the wood pieces are being used as a makeshift way to provide traction. 3. The individual is an artist, using the car and the wood pieces as a part of their artistic installation or performance. 4. Someone is trying to steal something from under the car, like its catalytic converter.

Justifying the step: To continue an existing story, it's imperative to comprehend its themes in order to stay true to the existing plot. In their small apartment, Kayla and Megan sipped coffee as they sat on the couch with their laptops. As they worked on their respective blogs, Kayla couldn't help but notice Megan's focused gaze on her own screen. Megan had traveled to numerous exotic places, capturing the essence of different cultures and landscapes in a way that made readers feel as if they were there on the journey with her. Step 2: Introduce contrasting elements to make the story engaging.

Their mutual support and enthusiasm for each other's work made their friendship stronger. Step 3: Introduce obstacles or challenges to the plot. Justifying the step: Introducing obstacles and challenges in a story keeps readers engaged while providing opportunities for character development. One day, during a conversation over lunch, Kayla mentioned a world-renowned anthropology conference that was to take place in two months. This conference was an incredible opportunity for her to showcase some of her most groundbreaking research.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Antonio Ramiro Romo (born April 21, 1980) is an American football television analyst and former quarterback who played 14 seasons with the Dallas Cowboys of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for Eastern Illinois University, where he won the Walter Payton Award in 2002, and led the Panthers to an Ohio Valley Conference championship in 2001. He signed as an undrafted free agent with the Cowboys in 2003. Beginning his career as a holder, Romo became the Cowboys' starting quarterback during the 2006 season. On September 7, 2008, Romo led the Cowboys to a 28-10 win over the Cleveland Browns in their season opener. Romo completed 24 of his 32 passes for a total of 320 yards and one touchdown. After the game, Romo required 13 stitches for a large gash on his chin that occurred during the third quarter when linebacker Willie McGinest hit him in the chin with his helmet. The NFL fined McGinest 7,500 for the hit. On September 15, Romo led the Dallas Cowboys to a 41-37 win against the Philadelphia Eagles in the second game of the 2008 season. Romo completed 21 of his 30 passes for a total of 312 yards and three touchdowns. The 54 combined points scored by the Cowboys and Eagles in the first half were the second most points scored in a half during a Monday Night Football game. Romo and the Cowboys won their third straight before losing to the Washington Redskins, falling to 3-1. Following a win against the Cincinnati Bengals, Romo was injured in a loss to the Arizona Cardinals. The Cowboys, under Brad Johnson, went 1-2 the next three games, falling to the St. Louis Rams, beating the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, and losing to the New York Giants. In what became a de facto third playoff game for Romo shortly prior to its start, on December 28, Romo and the Cowboys failed to compete against the Philadelphia Eagles in a 44-6 loss. Romo committed three turnovers in the game and went 21/39 for 183 yards and no touchdowns. The loss dropped Romo's combined record in December to 5-8 and again raised questions about his performance in games of consequence. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What injury did he sustain?","completion":"Antonio Romo got hurt in a game, and the injury he had was called a \\"broken pinkie finger.\\" That's the smallest finger on his hand, and it got hurt while he was playing football."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchus' continued dominance was ensured by an ethnic quota for top bureaucratic appointments. Hong Taiji's reign also saw a fundamental change of policy towards his Han Chinese subjects. Nurhaci had treated Han in Liaodong differently according to how much grain they had, those with less than 5 to 7 sin were treated like chattel while those with more than that amount were rewarded with property. Due to a revolt by Han in Liaodong in 1623, Nurhachi, who previously gave concessions to conquered Han subjects in Liaodong, turned against them and ordered that they no longer be trusted; He enacted discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens were and not like the conquered Han in Liaodong. Hong Taiji instead incorporated them into the Jurchen \\"nation\\" as full (if not first-class) citizens, obligated to provide military service. By 1648, less than one-sixth of the bannermen were of Manchu ancestry. This change of policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower and reduced his military dependence on banners not under his personal control, it also greatly encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Through these and other measures Hong Taiji was able to centralize power unto the office of the Khan, which in the long run prevented the Jurchen federation from fragmenting after his death. Question: When did a Han revolt occur?","completion":"A Han revolt occurred in Liaodong in 1623. This event led Nurhaci, the leader of the Jurchen at the time, to change his policy towards the conquered Han Chinese in Liaodong. He started enacting discriminatory policies and killings against them, while ordering that Han who assimilated to the Jurchen (in Jilin) before 1619 be treated equally as Jurchens. In contrast, Hong Taiji, who succeeded Nurhaci, adopted a different approach and incorporated the Han Chinese into the Jurchen \\"nation\\" as full citizens, obligated to provide military service. This shift in policy not only increased Hong Taiji's manpower but also encouraged other Han Chinese subjects of the Ming dynasty to surrender and accept Jurchen rule when they were defeated militarily. Overall, Hong Taiji's approach aided in centralizing power and prevented the fragmentation of the Jurchen federation after his death."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A: forget about the situation B: carried out C: know the person well Answer:","completion":"Based on the context provided, it is difficult to definitively conclude what Quinn would want to do next. However, we can examine each of the given options and provide an analysis of their likelihood: A: Forget about the situation It is possible that Quinn may choose to forget about the situation, especially if they feel that their support has been adequately provided and there is no further action they need to take. However, this depends on the nature of the decision and whether Quinn is directly involved in the outcome. If the decision has significant consequences for Quinn or if they have a close relationship with the person involved, they may be less likely to forget about the situation entirely. B: Carried out If Quinn supported one's decision, it can be inferred that they believe it was the right choice and would want to see it carried out. If Quinn has a role in the implementation of the decision or if they feel responsible for the outcome, they may want to ensure that the decision is properly executed. This may involve providing help, resources, or guidance in carrying out the decision. This option seems the most likely, given that Quinn has already shown support for the decision. C: Know the person well The context given does not indicate whether Quinn already knows the person well or not.

Given the background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. and the situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Answer the following question: Which team lead a less safer experiment? A:","completion":"Team A led a less safe experiment because they heated the can of soup without venting it first. This allowed the pressure inside the can to build up due to the increase in kinetic energy of the air molecules and the potential boiling of the soup, which could eventually lead to the can exploding. Venting the can, as Team B did, allows the pressure inside to escape and lowers the risk of explosion, making their experiment safer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset. - Tennessee (\\"Tanasi\\") is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States. Tennessee is the 36th largest and the 16th most populous of the 50 United States. Tennessee is bordered by Kentucky and Virginia to the north, North Carolina to the east, Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi to the south, and Arkansas and Missouri to the west. The Appalachian Mountains dominate the eastern part of the state, and the Mississippi River forms the state's western border. Tennessee's capital and second largest city is Nashville, which has a population of 654,610. Memphis is the state's largest city, with a population of 655,770. - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

Jacksonville is the most populous municipality in the state and is the largest city by area in the contiguous United States. The Miami metropolitan area is Florida's most populous urban area. The city of Tallahassee is the state capital. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it. - The Ictaluridae , sometimes called ictalurids , are a family of catfish native to North America , where they are important food fish and sometimes as a sport fish . It includes about 51 species . They include fish commonly known as bullheads , madtoms , channel catfish , and blue catfish . - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere.

It includes the well-known channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") and blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\"). - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL. - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Channel catfish (\\"Ictalurus punctatus\\") is North America's most numerous catfish species. It is the official fish of Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, Nebraska, and Tennessee, and is informally referred to as a \\"channel cat\\". In the United States, they are the most fished catfish species with approximately 8 million anglers targeting them per year. The popularity of channel catfish for food has contributed to the rapid expansion of aquaculture of this species in the United States. - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably. - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\". - The blue catfish (\\"Ictalurus furcatus\\") is the largest species of North American catfish, reaching a length of and a weight of . The average length is about 2546 in (64117 cm). The fish can live to 20 years. The native distribution of blue catfish is primarily in the Mississippi River drainage, including the Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Arkansas Rivers, and the Rio Grande, and south along the Gulf Coast to Belize and Guatemala. . These large catfish have also been introduced in a number of reservoirs and rivers, notably the Santee Cooper lakes of Lake Marion and Lake Moultrie in South Carolina, the James River in Virginia, Powerton Lake in Pekin, Illinois, and Springfield Lake in Springfield, Illinois. This fish is also found in some lakes in Florida. The fish is considered an invasive pest in some areas, particularly the Chesapeake Bay. Blue catfish can tolerate brackish water, thus can colonize along inland waterways of coastal regions. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel. - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.

Chauvetia multilirata is a species of sea snail , a true gastropod mollusk in the Buccinidae family , the marine whelks .","completion":"The two sentences from Wikipedia provided convey similar information but are not exactly the same in meaning. Let's analyze each sentence to understand the subtle differences: Sentence 1: \\"Chauvetia multilirata is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Buccinidae, the true whelks.\\" In this sentence, Chauvetia multilirata is described as a species of sea snail that belongs to the class of marine gastropod molluscs. Furthermore, it is specified that it is a member of the family Buccinidae, which consists of the true whelks. The sentence offers a more hierarchical categorization of the species, starting from the sea snail group, moving on to gastropod molluscs, and ending with the family Buccinidae. Sentence 2: \\"Chauvetia multilirata is a species of sea snail, a true gastropod mollusk in the Buccinidae family, the marine whelks.\\" This sentence also identifies Chauvetia multilirata as a species of sea snail, but it emphasizes its characteristics as a \\"true\\" gastropod mollusk within the Buccinidae family. Here, the term \\"marine whelks\\" is used interchangeably with the term \\"true whelks,\\" establishing a link between the marine environment and the whelks. This sentence does not follow the same hierarchical structure as the first one, and the focus is more on the relation between Chauvetia multilirata and being a marine gastropod mollusk belonging to the family Buccinidae. In summary, while both sentences convey the fact that Chauvetia multilirata is a sea snail species and a gastropod mollusk in the Buccinidae family, the first sentence provides a hierarchical categorization of the species, while the second sentence emphasizes its marine environment and its true characteristics as a gastropod mollusk. The differences are subtle, and both sentences are informative, but they are not exactly the same in meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Input: In 2014-15 there were 33,781 cases of children, aged 10 and under, needing the removal of one or more teeth - a rise of 3% on the previous year. The Chief Dental Officer for NHS England, Sara Hurley, described the figures as \\"disappointing\\". She said children in England drank more sugary drinks than anywhere in Europe. \\"Even though people understand the impact of a sugary diet so many children have advanced tooth decay - a highly preventable disease,\\" said Ms Hurley. \\"We are also creating a legacy of obesity and significant health problems. \\"If we are to get serious about tackling this then prevention is the key,\\" she added. Since 2011-12 there has been a steady rise in the number of children needing tooth extractions, according to statistics collated by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC). Over the four-year period there were 128,558 cases in total of children having teeth removed because of decay. And the 2014-15 figures show a 9.8% rise from the 30,761 recorded in 2011-12. Prof Nigel Hunt from the Royal College of Surgeons said: \\"An almost 10% increase in the number of children being admitted to hospital for tooth extraction due to decay over a four-year period is unacceptable.\\" \\"The need for tooth extraction continues to be the number one reason why five to nine-year-old children are admitted to hospital.\\" He also said that poor oral health education was another reason for the rise. The figures also showed a wide regional variance across England. For example, in 2014-15 the rate of tooth extractions in Yorkshire and the Humber was 894.5 for every 100,000 people (6,413 episodes). That was more than five times the rate recorded in the East of England, which was 164.5 per 100,000 population (1,328 episodes). The authors of the HSCIC study said: \\"Nationally, there is a strong correlation between area deprivation and the rate of tooth extraction.\\" \\"As deprivation increases so does the rate of tooth extraction.\\" London had the most children needing hospital admission as an inpatient for tooth decay, with 8,362 cases. In the North West, there were 6,672 cases, and 6,413 in Yorkshire and Humber. The shadow public health minister, Andrew Gwynne, described the figures as \\"disturbing\\". \\"The government should be standing up for parents, particularly those living in more deprived communities, and helping them to tackle tooth decay,\\" he said. A Department of Health spokesperson said: \\"Children's teeth are dramatically healthier than they were 10 years ago, but we still know there is more to do.\\" \\"We are radically changing NHS dentistry, so that dentists will be paid for keeping the nations' teeth healthy, rather than just for treating problems as they arise.\\" The figures over the past four years break down as follows: Tooth decay is caused by plaque collecting, in particular, around the gum line, the edges of fillings and the grooved surfaces of the teeth. Plaque is made up of food debris, saliva and bacteria normally present in the mouth. The acids generated by bacteria breaking food down can begin to attack tooth enamel within 20 minutes of a meal. If plaque is allowed to collect over time it will harden into tartar. Both tartar and plaque contain acids which, over time, can dissolve the protective, hard, enamel coating of the tooth and create holes, or cavities. Most cavities form over a period of months, or even years. They are usually painless, but they can grow very large and damage the much softer internal structures of the tooth such as the dentin and the pulp, which is found at the core. If they remain untreated, they can kill the nerve and blood vessels of the tooth, and ultimately the tooth itself. The most obvious sign of tooth decay is toothache, particularly after hot or cold food or drinks. Pits or holes may also be visible in the teeth. Plaque and tartar also irritate the gums, and lead to a gum disease called gingivitis.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the conclusion of the hypothesis can be drawn from the given premise, let's break down and analyze each statement: Premise: \\"Utah looks like my dream come true.\\" In this statement, the person is expressing that Utah appears to possess the qualities or characteristics they desire, or that it satisfies their expectations in some way. This could relate to various aspects, such as landscape, culture, or personal goals. The key phrase is \\"looks like,\\" which means that there might still be room for uncertainty or that they haven't fully experienced Utah yet. Hypothesis: \\"Utah is a place of my fantasies.\\" This statement suggests that Utah is an ideal location or a place where the person's dreams and fantasies come to life. It seems to emphasize the imaginative and aspirational qualities of Utah for the person, rather than focusing on specific, concrete factors. Now, the question is whether we can conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. Based on the analysis, it appears that the premise and hypothesis are closely related. Both statements convey a positive perception of Utah and imply that it meets the person's desires or expectations. However, there are slight differences in emphasis and wording. The premise focuses on the appearance or resemblance of Utah to the person's dreams, whereas the hypothesis highlights the fantastical, idealized nature of Utah. The premise contains a hint of uncertainty with the phrase \\"looks like,\\" whereas the hypothesis presents a more assertive impression that Utah is indeed the place of the person's fantasies. Although these differences exist, it is plausible to argue that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely to be true as well. This conclusion is based on the assumption that when someone finds a location to be their \\"dream come true,\\" it implies that the place embodies the qualities they fantasize about and aspire to experience. However, it is essential to consider both the limitations of language and subjective interpretation. The premise and hypothesis might hold slightly different meanings for different people or could be reliant on individual emotions or experiences. As a result, while it is possible to deduce a connection between the premise and hypothesis, one must bear in mind the subjective nature of such statements and the impact of personal context on arriving at a definitive conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(nee Moody; 1922 - January 1, 2011). He is of French, Italian, Panamanian, and Scottish descent. When he was one and a half years old, his family moved to Port Tampa, Florida. As a boy, he was a pitcher in Little League Baseball. Hogan remained WWF World Heavyweight Champion for four years (1,474 days). In front of 33 million viewers, however, Hogan finally lost the title to Andre on the February 5 episode of The Main Event after a convoluted scam involving \\"The Million Dollar Man\\" Ted DiBiase and Earl Hebner (who assumed the place of his twin brother Dave Hebner, the match's appointed referee). After Andre delivered a belly to belly suplex on Hogan, Hebner counted the pin while Hogan's left shoulder was clearly off the mat. After the match, Andre handed the title over to DiBiase to complete their business deal. As a result, the WWF World Heavyweight Championship was vacated for the first time in its 25-year history because then WWF President Jack Tunney decreed the championship could not be sold from one wrestler to another. At WrestleMania IV, Hogan participated in a tournament for the vacant WWF World Heavyweight Championship to regain it; he and Andre were given a bye into quarter-finals, but their match resulted in a double disqualification. Later that night in the main event, Hogan came to ringside to stop Andre interfering which helped \\"Macho Man\\" Randy Savage defeat Ted DiBiase to win the title. Together, Hogan, Savage, and manager Miss Elizabeth formed a partnership known as The Mega Powers. After Savage became WWF World Heavyweight Champion at WrestleMania IV, they feuded with The Mega Bucks (Andre the Giant and Ted DiBiase) and defeated them at the main event of the first SummerSlam. They then went on to feud with Slick's Twin Towers: Akeem and Big Boss Man. In mid-1988, Hogan wrestled at house shows in singles competition with his \\"War Bonnet\\", a red and yellow gladiator helmet with a fist-shaped crest. This was notably used to give Bad News Brown his first WWF loss at a Madison Square Garden house show before it was discarded altogether. The War Bonnet gimmick was revisited in the WWE's online comedy series Are You Serious? in 2012. The Mega Powers began to implode due to Savage's burgeoning jealousy of Hogan and his paranoid suspicions that Hogan and Elizabeth were more than friends. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, Hogan eliminated Savage from the Royal Rumble match while eliminating Bad News Brown, which caused tension, only to be eliminated by The Twin Towers himself. In early 1989, the duo broke up while wrestling The Twin Towers on the February 3 episode of The Main Event, when Savage accidentally collided with Miss Elizabeth during the match, and Hogan took her backstage to receive medical attention, temporarily abandoning Savage, who slapped Hogan and left the ring, where Hogan eventually won the match by himself.

Hypothesis: The Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military from the given context. Here is a detailed explanation to support this hypothesis: Contextual Analysis: The context provided outlines an historical event known as the Raid on Le Havre, which took place in July 1759 during the Seven Years' War. The Royal Navy, led by Rear-Admiral George Rodney, conducted a naval bombardment on the French port of Le Havre to destroy the invasion barges that were being gathered by the French for a planned invasion of Great Britain. To frame the hypothesis, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the role the Royal Navy played during this event and its connection with Great Britain. The Royal Navy: The Royal Navy is the principal naval warfare and maritime service branch of the British Armed Forces, which is responsible for the defense of the United Kingdom, its overseas territories, and various other interests. It originated in the early 16th century and has been a significant component of the British military throughout history, including the Seven Years' War, when the Raid on Le Havre occurred. In the given context, the Royal Navy's operation under Rear-Admiral George Rodney had a clear objective: to destroy French invasion barges intended to attack Great Britain. Considering that the Royal Navy was operating to protect Great Britain's interests, it is reasonable to conclude that it was (and still is) an integral part of Great Britain's military. Great Britain's Military: Great Britain's military (or the British Armed Forces) refers to the combined military organizations of the United Kingdom, responsible for the nation's defense and the protection of its people and interests. The military is composed of various branches, including the British Army, the Royal Air Force, and the Royal Navy. Hypothesis: Given the role of the Royal Navy in the Raid on Le Havre and its connection to the British Armed Forces, we can confidently draw the hypothesis that the Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military. Its responsibility during the event in question was to neutralize the threat posed by the French invasion plans, demonstrating its commitment to the defense of Great Britain and acting on behalf of the nation's interests. Therefore, the hypothesis is consistent with the information provided in the context: Hypothesis: The Royal Navy is part of Great Britain's military."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The primary concern expressed is that the reviewer \\"did not receive what I ordered.\\" This means that the reviewer did not get the product they had expected or paid for, which understandably creates frustration and disappointment. This issue speaks to the seller's reliability, implying that the seller may have delivered the wrong item or misrepresented the product. Either way, this situation suggests a lack of attention to detail or, worse, dishonesty on the seller's part. Additionally, the reviewer mentions that \\"it took over two weeks to receive the order.\\" This statement implies that the shipping time was longer than the reviewer had anticipated. Long wait times for delivery can significantly impact customer satisfaction, as many consumers expect prompt shipment in today's fast-paced world. The tardy delivery time adds another layer of dissatisfaction to the reviewer's experience with the seller and contributes to the negative sentiment portrayed in the review. In conclusion, the product review in question undoubtedly conveys a negative sentiment. This conclusion is supported by the review's title, the reviewer's declaration of not intending to purchase from the seller again, and the specific issues reported with receiving the wrong item and a prolonged delivery time. The reviewer's experience was far from ideal, leading to the expression of dissatisfaction and disappointment with the seller, ultimately giving a negative impression to other potential customers who may come across this review."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The character was created by writer Bill Finger and artist Bob Kane and made his first appearance in Detective Comics #58 in December 1941. The Penguin is one of Batman's most enduring and well-known foes, known for his distinctive appearance, sharp wit, and criminal genius. The Penguin, as his name suggests, is often depicted as a short, rotund man wearing a tuxedo, top hat, monocle, and carrying an umbrella that conceals various gadgets and weapons. His waddle-like walk and bird-like features, along with his penchant for using birds in his criminal pursuits, earned him the nickname \\"The Penguin\\". Oswald Cobblepot is a man who embraces his outward appearance and uses it as one of his many tools in his villainous endeavors. Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot was born into a wealthy family but faced many challenges in his early life. His father died of bronchial pneumonia, and his overprotective mother made him carry an umbrella constantly to shield him from rain and illnesses. He was mercilessly teased and bullied by his peers because of his short stature and odd appearance. Soon after his mother's death, Oswald lost the family fortune forcing him to survive in the harsh streets of Gotham City. These early struggles fueled Oswald's desire for power and wealth, ultimately leading him down the path of crime. Despite his odd appearance, The Penguin is a highly intelligent and cunning criminal mastermind, often organizing and leading vast criminal empires. He is also an expert at manipulating both his enemies and allies. Unlike many of Batman's other adversaries, The Penguin does not possess any superhuman abilities or powers. Instead, he relies on his intellect, wealth, and an array of weapons hidden within his ever-present umbrella. Some of these weapons include bladed tips, firearms, electric shock devices, and even explosive rockets. Throughout his appearances in various Batman comics and other media, The Penguin has been portrayed in varying ways, from a simple thief to a high-stakes criminal mastermind. He has been known to control underground criminal networks, manage nightclubs, and even dabble in the world of politics. Despite his ruthless nature, Oswald Cobblepot is a man of culture and sophistication, enjoying fine food, music, and art. The Penguin has also appeared in various television shows, films, and video games. Some of the most notable portrayals of this character include Burgess Meredith in the 1960s Batman television series and its accompanying movie, Danny DeVito in the 1992 film Batman Returns and Robin Lord Taylor in the recent Gotham television series. In each of these iterations, The Penguin has been depicted as a calculating and devious adversary, challenging Batman and his allies with his elaborate schemes and criminal enterprises. In conclusion, Oswald Chesterfield Cobblepot, better known as The Penguin, is a timeless and unforgettable Batman villain whose distinctive appearance, ruthless intelligence, and penchant for using avian-inspired methods in his criminal pursuits have made him an enduring and formidable foe for the Dark Knight and his allies. His various portrayals throughout history have showcased his remarkable adaptability as a character and his unique place within the Gotham City's criminal underworld."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Payback Movie plot: Note: This is a synopsis of the threatrical release of PAYBACK. There is also a Director's Cut in circulation. The chapters are from the DVD of the film.1. Quality health care.A wounded man, Porter (Mel Gibson), has bullets extracted from his back by a scruffy-looking, middle-aged, medical guy, someone probably disbarred from legally practicing medicine, who uses alcohol in equal parts as a disinfectant and an emotional support.Porter; Voice-Over: \\"GSW. That's what the hospitals call it. Gunshot wound. Doctor has to report it to the police. That makes it hard for guys in my line to get what I'd call 'quality health care'. Not many men know what their life is worth. I do. Seventy grand. That's what they took from me. And that's what I was going to get back.Some time later, the now-recovered Porter walks across the 59th Street Bridge into Manhattan, but he's not feeling groovy. He is crossing his own private Rubicon.V.O. continues: \\"They say, 'Time heals all wounds.' You'd think that after five months of lying on my back, I would've given up any idea of getting even.

The beggar, who had been loudly describing himself as \\"a cripple\\", leaps up, only to be restrained by Porter. (\\"Shut up! I cured you!\\") In a coffee shop, Porter uses his stolen cash to buy himself a cup of coffee and a small sandwich. He asks for a cigarette from the waitress at the counter, and then steals the packet of cigarettes from the waitress after paying the bill. (He does a lot of smoking in this movie.) On the street again, he picks a pocket of a wealthy businessman, taking a wallet. In a restroom, he examines the ID photo of the guy he robbed. The man in the photo is smiling.

Overwhelmed by the situation, the guilt she feels for betraying Porter, and the weight of her addiction, Lynn decides to end her life. Porter discovers her lifeless body and is devastated by her death. Lynn's death serves as a turning point in the movie and acts as a catalyst for Porter's determination to seek revenge against his betrayers and reclaim the money that was stolen from him. The sorrow and anger evoked by Lynn's tragic end drive Porter to push forward in his quest for payback, regardless of the dangers it presents. Overall, Lynn's death is a significant event in the film \\"Payback,\\" as it reinforces the dark themes of the story and propels the main character into action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It started to snow out of nowhere. Tim and his friends kept going. It made the scenery that much more beautiful. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Tim enjoys the snow.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it cannot be definitively concluded that Tim enjoys the snow. However, it can be inferred that Tim and his friends appreciate the beauty that the snow brings to the surroundings during their mountain climbing adventure. The paragraph states that Tim and his friends decide to continue climbing the mountain despite the sudden snowfall. This suggests that the group is not deterred by the unexpected weather conditions and are able to adapt to the change in the environment. Instead of focusing on any potential inconvenience that the snow may have caused, the paragraph highlights the fact that the snowfall enhances the scenery's beauty. This implies that Tim and his friends might feel a sense of awe or appreciation when they witness the snow transforming the landscape around them. The group's decision to carry on with their climb could be an indicator of their resilience and willingness to make the most of the situation, regardless of whether they enjoy the snow or not. It is important to note that this paragraph does not provide direct evidence pointing to Tim's personal feelings or preferences about the snow. There is no mention of Tim's specific reaction to the snowfall or any indication that he derives pleasure or enjoyment from the experience. Tim's perspective on snow is inferred from the group's collective decision to continue climbing and their appreciation for the snow-covered landscape. Although it is possible that Tim enjoys the snow, this assumption is not explicitly supported by the information provided. In conclusion, while the paragraph does not directly state that Tim enjoys the snow, it is reasonable to infer that he appreciates the beauty it adds to the mountain scenery during the climb. His decision, along with his friends, to continue the climb in snowy conditions suggests their willingness to embrace and adapt to unexpected challenges. However, without further evidence or more specific details about Tim's personal feelings, it is impossible to conclusively determine whether he enjoys the snow or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The author consistently uses strongly negatively charged language and expressions throughout their review, which highlights their intense dissatisfaction with the movie. Firstly, the author describes the movie as \\"a 90-minute Ramones concert with brief periods of stupidity and absolute boredom.\\" This statement is negative, as it suggests that the movie is lacking in engaging content and mainly filled with uninteresting musical performances. Secondly, the phrase \\"What kind of high school is this anyway?\\" conveys a sense of disbelief and confusion, implying that the movie's setting and portrayal of high school life is unrealistic and unrelatable.

Some people like to let their rabbits roam freely in their home. This may not be an option for you, however.","completion":"In such cases, providing your dwarf rabbit with an indoor cage is essential for their safety and comfort. When choosing a cage, take into consideration the following aspects: 1. Size: Dwarf rabbits may be small in stature, but they still require a good amount of space to move around, play, and explore. Select a cage that is at least four times the size of your rabbit when they are fully stretched out. Ideally, the height of the cage should be tall enough to allow your rabbit to stand up on their hind legs without their ears touching the top. 2. Flooring: Wire flooring can be detrimental to your rabbit's feet, causing discomfort and even injuries. Opt for a cage with a solid floor, and provide a soft, absorbent bedding like paper pulp or aspen shavings for optimal comfort and cleanliness. 3. Enrichment: Rabbits are intelligent, curious creatures that can become bored and stressed if not provided with ample opportunities for entertainment and mental stimulation. Fill their cage with a variety of toys like chew blocks, tunnels, and hanging toys to keep them engaged and content. 4. Litter box: House training your rabbit will help maintain a cleaner living environment. Place a litter box with rabbit-safe litter in a corner of the cage and encourage your rabbit to use it by placing a small amount of their waste in the box. 5. Food and water: Provide a balanced diet of hay, rabbit pellets, and fresh vegetables daily. Prevent spillage and contamination by using a sturdy food dish and a sipper water bottle. 6. Cleaning and maintenance: Clean and sanitize your rabbit's cage, litter box, food dish, and water bottle regularly to minimize the risk of bacteria buildup and illness. Replace soiled bedding frequently and be vigilant about monitoring your rabbit's health. Aside from the indoor cage, it's also important to give your dwarf rabbit adequate exercise and social interaction. Dedicate at least one or two hours per day to let them out of the cage for some supervised playtime and bonding. Create a safe and enriching play area within your home, rabbit-proofing any hazards such as electrical cords or toxic plants. Lastly, be sure to visit a veterinarian experienced in rabbit care for regular check-ups and vaccinations. Regular grooming, nail trimming, and dental care are also essential to keep your dwarf rabbit healthy, comfortable, and happy. By providing your rabbit with proper housing, a balanced diet, exercise, and attention, you'll ensure a long, fulfilling life for your small furry companion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Medicinal marijuana is prescribed for a wide variety of conditions, spanning from physical ailments to mental health issues. However, what conditions qualify you for a medical marijuana card, known as qualifying conditions, vary widely from state to state.","completion":"To begin the process of obtaining a medical marijuana ID card, it is essential to first familiarize yourself with the specific qualifying conditions outlined in your state's legislation. These may include, but are not limited to, chronic pain, cancer, epilepsy, glaucoma, HIV/AIDS, Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and Parkinson’s disease. Some states may also provide access to medical marijuana for anxiety, depression, and other mental health conditions, while others may be more restrictive in their allowances. After confirming that your condition is covered within your state's guidelines, the next step involves obtaining a recommendation from a licensed healthcare professional. Search for a qualified doctor in your area who specializes in medical marijuana treatment and schedule an appointment to discuss your symptoms, condition, and how cannabis may be of assistance. Remember that not all healthcare practitioners are supportive of medical marijuana, so it may be necessary to research and find a doctor open to this form of treatment. During your appointment, be prepared to discuss your medical history, present symptoms, any previous treatments or medications you have tried, and how these options have affected your condition. The doctor will evaluate your condition and determine if medical marijuana is an appropriate treatment option for you. If the physician deems that medical marijuana would be a beneficial treatment for your condition, they will provide you with a signed recommendation or certification, depending on your state's requirement. Once you have received the necessary documentation from your healthcare provider, the next step is to complete an official application for a medical marijuana ID card. The application process varies by state and may include online registration, mailing in a paper application, or visiting a designated government office in person. Be sure to carefully follow the instructions provided by your state's regulatory agency or medical marijuana program to ensure a smooth application process. In addition to the recommendation or certification from your doctor, the application typically requires personal identification documents (such as a driver’s license or state-issued ID), proof of residency, a passport-sized photo, and payment of an application fee. The fee varies depending on your state of residence and may be waived or reduced for applicants who demonstrate financial hardship. Once your application has been submitted and reviewed, your state's medical marijuana program or regulatory agency will determine whether to approve or deny your request for a medical marijuana ID card. Approval times vary by state but typically range from a few days to a few weeks. If your application is approved, you will receive your medical marijuana ID card either through mail or in person, depending on your state's procedures. With your medical marijuana ID card in hand, you can now visit a licensed dispensary in your state to purchase cannabis products that cater to your specific medical needs. It is crucial to follow your state's regulations regarding purchase limits, possession limits, and authorized consumption methods to maintain compliance with the law and ensure that your medical marijuana usage is both safe and legal. Regular consultation with your healthcare provider is also advisable to monitor your progress, adjust dosage if necessary, and to answer any questions or concerns you may have about your medical marijuana treatment. In summary, getting a medical marijuana ID card involves understanding your state's qualifying conditions, obtaining a recommendation from a licensed healthcare professional, completing the necessary application procedures, and abiding by state-specific regulations surrounding medical cannabis use. Remember that knowledge of your state's laws and open communication with your healthcare provider are imperative in successfully obtaining and utilizing a medical marijuana ID card for your health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - Organized crime is a category of transnational, national, or local groupings of highly centralized enterprises run by criminals who intend to engage in illegal activity, most commonly for money and profit. Some criminal organizations, such as terrorist groups, are politically motivated. Sometimes criminal organizations force people to do business with them, such as when a gang extorts money from shopkeepers for so-called \\"protection\\". Gangs may become disciplined enough to be considered \\"organized\\". A criminal organization or gang can also be referred to as a mafia, mob, or crime syndicate; the network, subculture and community of criminals may be referred to as the underworld. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - The Five Families refers to the five major New York City organized crime families of the Italian American Mafia. The term was first used in 1931, when Salvatore Maranzano formally organized the previously warring factions into what are now known as the Bonanno, Colombo, Gambino, Genovese, and Lucchese crime families, each with demarcated territory, organizationally structured in a now-familiar hierarchy, and having them reporting up to the same overarching governing entity. Initially (in the summer of 1931), that governing entity was a \\"capo di tutti capi\\" (boss of all bosses), but that September the role was replaced by The Commission, which continues to govern American Mafia activities in the United States and Canada. - Rhode Island, officially the State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Rhode Island is the smallest in area, the eighth least populous, and the second most densely populated of the 50 U.S. states, following New Jersey. Its official name is also the longest of any state in the Union. Rhode Island is bordered by Connecticut to the west, Massachusetts to the north and east, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south via Rhode Island Sound and Block Island Sound. The state also shares a short maritime border with New York. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Carlo \\"Don Carlo\\" Gambino (August 24, 1902 October 15, 1976) was an Italian-born American gangster heavily involved in La Cosa Nostra. Translated as 'this thing of ours', \\"LCN\\" is otherwise known as the American Mafia. He is notable for being boss of the Gambino crime family, which is still named after him. After the 1957 Apalachin Convention he unexpectedly seized control of the Commission of the \\"American Mafia\\". Gambino was known for being low-key and secretive. In 1937 Gambino was convicted of tax evasion but had his sentence suspended. He lived to the age of 74, when he died of a heart attack in bed \\"in a state of grace,\\" according to a priest who had given him the Last Rites of the Catholic Church. He had two brothers, Gaspare Gambino, who later married and was never involved with the Mafia and is not to be confused with another Gaspare Gambino who was a mafioso in Palermo, and Paolo Gambino who, on the other hand, had a big role in his brother's family. - Anthony Megale ( August 1 , 1953 -- July 21 , 2015 ) , also known as \`\` The Genius '' , \`\` Tony Connecticut '' , \`\` Machiavelli '' , \`\` Mac '' , \`\` The Brain '' , \`\` Mr. T '' , and \`\` Gas Man '' was a Connecticut mobster who became the acting underboss of the Gambino crime family . - The American Mafia, often referred to as the Italian Mafia or Italian Mob, (commonly shortened to the Mafia or Mob) and also known as the Italian-American Mafia, La Cosa Nostra (LCN), or the American Cosa Nostra, is an influential, highly organized Italian-American criminal society. The organization is often referred to by members as Cosa Nostra (\\"our thing\\"). It originated and developed from the original \\"Mafia\\" or \\"Cosa nostra\\", the Sicilian Mafia, though eventually encompassing other non-Sicilian Italian-American gangsters and organized crime groups of Italian origin in the United States and, to a lesser extent, Canada. The father of American organized crime is generally considered to be Sicilian-American criminal Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano. - The Gambino crime family (pronounced ) is one of the \\"Five Families\\" that dominates organized crime activities in New York City, United States, within the nationwide criminal phenomenon known as the Mafia (or \\"Cosa Nostra\\"). The group, which went through three bosses between 1910 and 1957, is named after Carlo Gambino, boss of the family at the time of the McClellan hearings in 1963, when the structure of organized crime first gained public attention. The group's operations extend from New York and the eastern seaboard to California. Its illicit activities include labor and construction racketeering, gambling, loansharking, extortion, money laundering, prostitution, fraud, hijacking, pier thefts, and fencing. - Money laundering is the process of transforming the profits of crime and corruption into ostensibly 'legitimate' assets. In a number of legal and regulatory systems, however, the term money laundering has become conflated with other forms of financial and business crime, and is sometimes used more generally to include misuse of the financial system (involving things such as securities, digital currencies, credit cards, and traditional currency), including terrorism financing and evasion of international sanctions. Most anti-money laundering laws openly conflate money laundering (which is concerned with \\"source\\" of funds) with terrorism financing (which is concerned with \\"destination\\" of funds) when regulating the financial system. - Connecticut is the southernmost state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. Connecticut is also often grouped along with New York and New Jersey as the Tri-State Area. It is bordered by Rhode Island to the east, Massachusetts to the north, New York to the west, and Long Island Sound to the south. Its capital city is Hartford, and its most populous city is Bridgeport. The state is named for the Connecticut River, a major U.S. river that approximately bisects the state. The word \\"Connecticut\\" is derived from various anglicized spellings of an Algonquian word for \\"long tidal river\\". - Underboss (also capo bastone or sotto capo) is a position within the leadership structure of Sicilian and American Mafia crime families. The underboss is second in command to the boss. The underboss is sometimes a family member, such as a son, who will take over the family if the boss is sick, killed, or imprisoned. - Extortion (also called shakedown, outwrestling, and exaction) is a criminal offense of obtaining money, property, or services from an institution, through coercion. It is sometimes euphemistically referred to as a \\"protection racket\\" since the racketeers often phrase their demands as payment for \\"protection\\" from (real or hypothetical) threats from unspecified other parties. Extortion is commonly practiced by organized crime groups. The actual obtainment of money or property is not required to commit the offense. Making a threat of violence which refers to a requirement of a payment of money or property to halt future violence is sufficient to commit the offense. Exaction refers not only to extortion or the demanding and obtaining of something through force, but additionally, in its formal definition, means the infliction of something such as pain and suffering or making somebody endure something unpleasant. - The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States. Flowing roughly southward for through four U.S. states, the Connecticut rises at the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses five U.S. states and one Canadian province via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. Discharging at per second, the Connecticut produces 70% of Long Island Sound's fresh water. What entity does 'anthony megale' has the relation 'occupation' with?

The man believes that sitting quietly helps him come up with his best something about things, which means this activity is somehow beneficial for his thought process. Step 3: Compare the possible answers with the context and purpose. - Anxiety: This option does not make sense because sitting quietly by himself is an enjoyable activity for the man, and anxiety is a negative emotion. - Happiness: While the man enjoys the activity, it is more about helping him produce better ideas or thoughts about various things, rather than generating happiness. - Insights: This option fits well with the context because insights are valuable realizations that can be sparked by quiet contemplation, and the man believes this activity leads to his best thoughts. - Inspiration: This option is also somewhat aligned with the context, but it tends to focus on creativity or motivation, whereas the question seems to emphasize better understanding or realizations. - Wisdom: Wisdom is the accumulation of knowledge over time, and while sitting quietly might contribute to it, the immediate outcome of the activity is more likely insights rather than acquiring wisdom. Step 4: Justify the answer. I believe the correct choice is \\"insights\\" because the context suggests that the man gains valuable realizations and thoughts from engaging in quiet contemplation, and insights represent momentary breakthroughs or understandings which can stem from such activity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He didn't look safe; he looked poor and hungry. He could see that she was frightened, standing out there in the cold. He knew how she felt. He said, \\"I am here to help you, ma'am. Why don't you wait in the car where it's warm? By the way, my name is Bryan Anderson.\\" Well, all she had was a flat tire, but for an old lady, that was bad enough. Bryan crawled under the car looking for a place to put the jack, skinning his knuckles a time or two. Soon he was able to change the tire. But he had to get dirty and his hands hurt. As he was tightening up the lug nuts, she rolled down the window and began to talk to him. She told him that she was from St. Louis and was just passing through. She couldn't thank him enough for coming to her aid. Bryan just smiled as he closed her trunk. The lady asked how much she owed him. Any amount would have been all right with her.

The reasoning behind this is as follows: 1. Reduced water volume: Less rainfall means there will be a reduced volume of water in streams and rivers. This will decrease the erosive force of the water, thus slowing down the rate of erosion. Consequently, the process of cutting into soil and bedrock becomes less effective. 2. Slower erosion process: With less water in the streams and rivers, the water flow will also be reduced, and this will consequently slow down the erosion process. As a result, the formation of new, larger ravines will be less likely to occur. 3. Less sediment transportation: Less rainfall means less water available to carry sediment downstream, which is a crucial part of the erosion process. The reduced transportation of sediments slows down erosion rates and leads to fewer and smaller ravines. In summary, less rainfall in a year will have a negative impact on both the formation of new ravines and the enlargement of existing ones due to the reduced erosive force of water and the slower erosion process. This will result in fewer and smaller ravines over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is Syra's real name?, using the article: The story is set in Rome the early 4th century AD, during the time of the persecution of Christians under the Roman Emperor Diocletian. The heroine of the book is Fabiola, a young beauty from a noble Roman family. She is spoiled by her father Fabius, who cannot deny her anything. Fabiola seems to have everything, including a superior education in the philosophers, yet under the surface, she is not content with her life. One day, in a fit of rage, she attacks and wounds her slave girl Syra, who is a secret Christian. The proud, spoiled Roman girl is humbled by Syra's humility, maturity and devotion to her in this situation, and a slow transformation begins, which finally culminates in her conversion to Christianity, brought on by Syra and of her own cousin Agnes, whom she adores and dotes on. Another thread of the story deals with the young boy Pancratius, a pious Christian and son of a martyr, who is himself preparing for martyrdom. Pancratius' nemesis is Corvinus, a bullying schoolmate who is irritated by the young Christian's saintliness. He does everything to bring him and the Christian community of the catacombs of Rome down. This includes the orchestrating of the lynching of their former teacher Cassianus, who is secretly Christian. Yet Pancratius shows his enemy the meaning of Christian forgiveness when he saves his life shortly after Corvinus had Cassianus killed. Another major villain in the story is the enigmatic Fulvius, an apparently rich young man from the East who soon reveals himself to be a hunter of Christians who turns them in to the authorities for money. His aim on the one hand is to gain the hand of either Fabiola or Agnes, and on the other hand, to uproot the Christian community in Rome.

Beth had been George McGovern's personal campaign photographer and would found the theater company New Thalian Players, while Donald has training as a social worker and also ran the clothing store Crazy Sophie's Outlet. Silverman's parents divorced and later remarried others. Silverman played Geraldine alongside Michelle Williams and Seth Rogen in Take This Waltz, written and directed by Sarah Polley. The film was well received when it premiered in Toronto in 2011 and was picked up by Magnolia for U.S. distribution in summer 2012. At the Toronto International Film Festival, she told the press she'd deliberately gained weight for the part, which required a nude scene, emphasizing that Polley wanted \\"real bodies and real women.\\" In interviews, she warned fans not to expect too much. However, she later told podcaster and author Julie Klausner that she had not really gained weight for the role and that the statements were meant as self-deprecating humor. On September 20, 2012, Silverman made a public service announcement (PSA) criticizing new voter identification laws that create obstacles to the ability of certain groups to vote in the November presidential election, i.e., young, old, poor, and minority citizens. The project was financed by the Jewish Council for Education & Research (JCER) and was co-produced by Mik Moore and Ari Wallach (the pair that also co-produced The Great Schlep and Scissor Sheldon). Silverman voiced Vanellope von Schweetz, one of the main characters in the 2012 Disney animated film, Wreck-It Ralph. She is in the creative team that writes and produces the content for the YouTube comedy channel called Jash. The other partners are Michael Cera, Reggie Watts, and Tim Heidecker and Eric Wareheim (also known as Tim & Eric). The JASH channel premiered online March 10, 2013. In Seth MacFarlane's western comedy film, A Million Ways to Die in the West, she played Ruth, a prostitute, who is in love with Edward (Giovanni Ribisi). It was released on May 30, 2014. In 2013, HBO announced that Silverman would star with Patti LuPone and Topher Grace in a situation comedy pilot called People in New Jersey, produced by SNL's Lorne Michaels. The pilot was not picked up for a series order. In 2017, Silverman became the host of a new talk show on Hulu called I Love You, America.

Some are severe, while some less so, but it is important to know what risks you are taking, for bigger boobs: Nerve damage in the breast may cause numbness in the nipples or breast tissue; an inability to feel anything. These effects can be permanent. Complications with future mammography. Breast implants make breast-cancer screening more difficult and demand an x-ray technician experienced in working with implants. Your doctor may also require additional tests with each checkup including an ultrasound and an MRI. Do not forget, these procedures are the result of cosmetic surgery, unlikely to be covered by insurance. Your scars will be firm and pink for at least six weeks. They may remain the same size for several months, or even appear to widen. After several months, your scars will begin to fade, though they will never disappear completely. Capsular contracture refers to a painful complication in which scar tissue hardens around the implant and squeezes, which can result in shape changes in the breasts, breasts that are hard to the touch, and pain. Additional surgery is required to deal with capsular contracture. Some women suffer severe infections one to two weeks after surgery. In rare cases, the implant will have to be surgically removed. You may experience excessive bleeding following the surgery, along with swelling and pain. Again, additional operations will be needed if this happens. Implants can break or leak. Beyond factory defects, many things can cause the implants to break and leak inside your body. These activities include exercise, injury and even normal day-to-day movement. Ruptured implants are a controversial topic and more can be written about the subject. In general, what happens when an implant breaks depends on the kind of implant: If a saline-filled implant breaks, the implant will deflate in a few hours and the salt water will be absorbed and naturally expelled by the body. If a silicone-gel filled implant leak or break, the elastic silicone gel may remain within the implant shell, or may escape into the breast. A leaking silicone gel implant may not be noticeable except through expensive tests like an MRI. Thus women with silicone breast implants are advised to visit with their plastic surgeon every year, to make sure they are still functioning properly. Your new breasts may be slightly different from one another, potentially in both size and shape. Engage in your regular day to day activities. Routine activity or injury can cause damage, resulting in the implants leaking or breaking. Additional surgery will be necessary to remove the implant or replace it. There is no evidence that implants change your ability to nurse an infant, or change anything about your pregnancy. It is possible, however, that the pregnancy will alter your body enough that the implants will have to be replaced for aesthetic reasons. Summary:","completion":"Breast augmentation is a surgery to make boobs bigger, but it has risks. Sometimes it can cause numbness or trouble feeling in the breast area. It can be harder to check for breast cancer and may need extra tests which insurance might not cover. There will be scars for a while, and sometimes the body can get a painful problem around the implant needing more surgery. Infections and bleeding can also happen, which might need more operations. Implants can break or leak inside the body, and it's important to check them regularly. The new breasts might look slightly different, but implants shouldn't change nursing a baby or pregnancy, though some changes might need new implants for looks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Twenty years later, Flynt (Woody Harrelson) and his younger brother, Jimmy (Brett Harrelson) run the Hustler Go-Go club in Cincinnati. With profits down, Flynt decides to publish a newsletter for the club, the first Hustler magazine, with nude pictures of women working at the club. The newsletter soon becomes a full-fledged magazine, but sales are weak. In 1975, after Hustler publishes nude pictures of former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis, sales take off.Flynt becomes smitten with Althea Leasure (Courtney Love), a stripper who works at one of his clubs. With Althea and Jimmy's help, Flynt makes a fortune from sales of Hustler. With his success comes enemies - as he finds himself a hated figure of anti-pornography activists. He argues with the activists, saying that \\"murder is illegal, but if you take a picture of it you may get your name in a magazine or maybe win a Pulitzer Prize\\". \\"However\\", he continues, \\"sex is legal, but if you take a picture of that act, you can go to jail\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the missing first step of the following process: - Makes water acidic - Kills fish - Kills the soils in trees - Leaves are also harmed. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in this process is the release of pollutants into the air, particularly sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are the primary agents responsible for the formation of acid rain. The process can be detailed as follows: 1. Release of pollutants: The burning of fossil fuels, like coal, oil, and gasoline, as well as other industrial processes, can release large amounts of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the atmosphere. These pollutants are mainly emitted by power plants, factories, and vehicles. 2. Makes water acidic: Once in the atmosphere, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides can react with water, oxygen, and other substances to form sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and nitric acid (HNO3). These acids then mix with rain, snow, fog, or hail, creating acid rain, which has a pH level lower than normal rainwater. 3. Kills fish: Acid rain can lead to the acidification of rivers, lakes, and ponds, causing harm to aquatic life. When the pH levels in these bodies of water become too low, it can be toxic for fish and other aquatic organisms. In addition to direct harm, acidification can also cause a chain reaction in the ecosystem, disrupting delicate food webs. For example, it can kill smaller organisms that serve as food for fish, ultimately impairing their survival. 4. Kills the soils in trees: Acid rain can also have harmful effects on terrestrial ecosystems, particularly in forests. It can leach essential nutrients, like calcium and magnesium, from the soil, making it less fertile. Additionally, acid rain can release aluminum from the soil, which can be toxic for trees and plants. This can result in weak root systems and reduced ability to absorb nutrients and water, leading to stunted growth, decay, or even death. 5. Leaves are also harmed: Furthermore, acid rain can cause direct harm to the foliage of trees and plants by breaking down the protective waxy coating on leaves. Once this coating is damaged, the leaves become more vulnerable to infections, diseases, and other stresses. The loss of foliage can lead to reduced photosynthesis, limiting the plant's ability to produce energy and making it more susceptible to harm from temperature fluctuations and other environmental factors. Overall, the missing first step in the process, the release of pollutants into the air, is crucial for understanding the cascade of negative impacts associated with acid rain, which affects both aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Implementing strategies to reduce the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, as well as promoting the use of cleaner energy sources, can play a significant role in mitigating the detrimental effects of acid rain on the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would \\"Town seal (matrix) of Náchod from 1570\\" be a reasonable answer?","completion":"In the 1800s, letters were sealed in various ways to ensure their confidentiality and prevent tampering. The \\"Town seal (matrix) of Náchod from 1570\\" is not a reasonable answer for this specific question, as it refers to a specific town seal from a much earlier time period. However, seals and wax were used extensively during the 1800s for sealing letters. Here is a detailed explanation of the methods used to seal letters during the 1800s: 1. Wax Seals: Wax seals were the most common method for sealing letters. Sealing wax was melted using a wax stick, which often had a wick running through it like a candle, or by holding a small piece of wax over a flame from a candle or lamp. The melted wax was then dripped onto the folded paper or envelope, and a metal seal or stamp, known as a seal matrix or signet, was pressed into the soft wax to create an impression. This method ensured that the letter was securely closed and could only be opened by breaking the wax seal. Wax seals could feature initials, family crests, or other personal symbols, indicating the sender and verifying the letter's authenticity. 2. Wafer Seals: Wafer seals were another option for securing letters and were made from a thin, adhesive material resembling a modern stamp. Wafers, usually composed of a mixture of gum arabic, flour, and water, were moistened and placed between the folded paper or envelope flaps. Pressure was then applied, either by hand or using a sealing device, to bond the paper together. Similar to wax seals, wafer seals could have impressions or simple designs on their surface. 3. Embossed Seals: In addition to wax and wafer seals, embossing was occasionally used to secure letters. This method involved placing the folded paper or envelope between two dies or plates with raised designs. When pressure was applied, the designs were impressed upon the paper, creating a seal that joined the two surfaces together. Like wax seals, embossed seals could serve as a mark of authenticity or personal identity. 4. Adhesive Envelopes: By the mid-1800s, the invention and wide distribution of adhesive envelopes made sealing letters more convenient. These envelopes often included a strip of adhesive gum on the flap that could be moistened and pressed closed, sealing the letter inside. 5. Postal Seals: Finally, it's important to mention postal seals, which were employed by postal authorities to verify and secure official correspondence. Postal seals could be made of wax, wafers, or embossed paper, much like personal seals, but they usually featured designs or inscriptions unique to the postal service. In conclusion, while the \\"Town seal (matrix) of Náchod from 1570\\" is not a direct answer to how letters were sealed in the 1800s, it could be considered a precursor to many of the sealing methods used during that time period. The 1800s saw the use of wax seals, wafer seals, embossed seals, adhesive envelopes, and postal seals to secure and authenticate written correspondence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, each sentence demonstrates a different context and tense in which the action of giving is taking place. In the first sentence, \\"What will you give her for her birthday?\\", the word \\"give\\" is used in its simple future tense, meaning the action of giving will occur sometime in the future. The context here is a birthday celebration and involves contemplating or deciding on a suitable gift or present for the person in question. The usage of \\"give\\" signifies that the gift is intended as a thoughtful and heartfelt gesture to celebrate the individual's special day. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"She gave a pair of shoes to her husband for their anniversary\\", the word \\"give\\" is used in its simple past tense form, \\"gave.\\" This indicates that the action of giving has already taken place in the past. The context in this instance is an anniversary celebration, and the focus is on a particular gift, the pair of shoes, being given as a token of love, appreciation or commitment between the wife and her husband. In summary, while the word \\"give\\" retains the same core meaning in both sentences, the context, tense, and circumstances in which the act of giving occurs differs.

Summarize the following: Before embarking upon any attempt to write code, it's always a good idea to first understand the language itself. There are a number of available resources ranging from textbooks to online guides. For example, you'll want to know that an IDE (integrated development environment) provides a coding interface that handles things like text editing, debugging and compiling. You may also wish to better understand the way assembly actually works, like the fact that \\"registers\\" are what store the numbers associated with program code. Better understanding terminology will make it easier to learn the code-writing process itself. Remember that there are a number of programming languages, including some that provide far more functionality than assembly. There are, however, still a range of applications for which assembly is useful—from creating standalone executables for telephone firmware and air-conditioning control systems to developing certain processor-specific instructions. Assemblers like A86, NASM or GNU generally perform less complex functions and may be appropriate starting points for beginners. Every assembler works a bit differently, so subsequent instruction will work under the assumption that you're using MASM (Microsoft Macro Assembler)—a basic assembler that works with Windows operating systems. It uses x86 assembly language and Intel syntax.","completion":"In order to effectively write code, it is crucial to first acquire an understanding of the programming language.

Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts. Question: According to the text, who will benefit from a long school year? Answer: Answer:","completion":"According to the text, both students and families would benefit from a longer school year. Students would benefit academically, as a longer school year allows time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons, and schools would have more time for sports, languages, music, and the arts. Disadvantaged students, in particular, would benefit as they tend to lose important ground during the summer months. Families would also benefit, especially those where every adult works, as the long summer vacation can be more of a burden than a break, requiring arrangements for childcare and supervision. Furthermore, a longer school year would better prepare American students to compete in the global marketplace against international competitors who typically have shorter summer vacations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Below are some tips for women traveling alone. Exercise hotel safety There are many ways you can make a solo stay at a hotel safer. At cheek-in, you might consider asking for a room near the elevator so you won't need to walk down long, potentially ill-lit hallways to reach your room. When filling out guest registration forms, consider using your first initial instead of your name, and skip the\\" Mrs/Miss/Mr\\" check box. Additionally, make sure the clerk writes down your room number instead of saying it out loud. This will prevent anyone nearby from knowing where to find you later. Arrive during the day Arrive in new cities during the day. Areas around bus and train stations can be scary and/ojr deserted, and small towns tend to shut down early. Veteran solo traveler Mara Rothman of San Francisco notes that plenty of beautiful towns can appear mysterious at night, and locals who are genuinely trying to help you can appear unnecessarily threatening. Arriving during the day means you'll be able to find a place to stay and get to know where you are before dark. Keep your documents safe If you choose to wear a money belt, use it for storage and not as a purse. Constantly reaching under your shirt for money draws attention to it, and tends to defeat the purpose. Instead,keep your passport, extra stores of money, and other important documents well hidden, and use a bag or purse for carrying daily spending money. Dress appropriately To avoid attracting unwanted attention, dress as conservatively as the women you see around you. This doesn't necessarily mean wearing the traditional dress, as that can sometimes have the opposite result. A good rule of thumb is to dress modestly. Think knee-length or longer skirts. Bare arms, shoulders, and legs are considered risked in some countries, so do the research before you go and once you're there. Note which body parts the local women cover and do the same.

It exposes children to science, technology, engineering and maths (STEM) through hands-on activities. The Camp Invention Program, created by Invent Now Kids, was founded in 1990. Now it has grown to include almost l,500 sites across the U. S., with thousands of children attending the program each year. \\"Our main purpose is to help children develop a greater interest in the fields of STEM,\\" said Lori Bryne, the Senior Regional Program Manager. Children in the camp will be given the opportunity to explore the unknown and put ideas into practice. The program will challenge children to real world situations that will help them build a team spirit and life skills. The program will include five modules this year. One module will feature \\"Problem Solving on Planet ZAK\\". It will challenge children by creating a world of science fiction. Imitating a \\"crash\\" onto a planet, children will be asked to figure out ways to stay safe, find food and to \\"rebuild\\" their spacecraft, using a variety of common objects. Another module will be \\"Saving Sludge City\\" which will have children find ways to create a cleaner and eco-friendly city. \\"Imagination Point: Ride Physics\\" asks children to work as interns in the world's newest and largest theme park called \\"Imagination Point\\". Children will learn the basic principles of motion through hands-on activities related directly to rides.

Write an article based on this summary: Plans for an \\"all-through\\" super-school for pupils aged three to 19 to replace eight schools in the Tregaron area have been backed \\"in principle\\".","completion":"Title: The Tregaron Area Embraces the Future of Education with a Proposed \\"All-Through\\" Super-School Introduction: The Tregaron area is set to revolutionize their education system by replacing eight existing schools within the region with an \\"all-through\\" super-school that would accommodate pupils from ages three to 19. This ambitious project has the potential to transform educational practices and generate numerous benefits for the students, teachers, and the community alike. In a recent development, plans for this new institution have been backed \\"in principle,\\" meaning that the basis for implementing the concept has received initial support. Stakeholders have recognized the potential advantages this innovative approach could bring. This article delves into the proposed \\"all-through\\" super-school, its potential impact, and the next steps needed to make this vision a reality. The \\"All-Through\\" Super-School: A Holistic Approach to Learning An \\"all-through\\" super-school represents a unique and innovative educational concept. The principle behind this idea is to create a fluid, continuous learning experience for pupils between the ages of three and 19. The super-school will effectively replace eight existing schools, merging resources, staff, and students into one cohesive institution. By facilitating age-integrated and interdisciplinary learning experiences, the super-school eliminates traditional barriers and fosters greater collaboration between students of different ages and teachers of various specializations. This model could also promote a smoother transition between the various levels of education, as students progress from early years' learning to primary, secondary, and tertiary levels. Potential Impact on Students, Teachers, and the Community There are several benefits that could arise from the implementation of an \\"all-through\\" super-school in the Tregaron area. 1. Enhanced Learning Environment: Combining resources and expertise from multiple schools will likely result in a well-rounded, comprehensive educational experience for students. They would have access to a range of high-quality faculties, facilities, and educational opportunities that may not have been available in smaller, separate institutions. 2. Improved Collaboration: Teachers and staff members would have the opportunity to collaborate on a larger scale, sharing best practices, resources, and ideas to create a more effective and cohesive curriculum. Furthermore, students would learn from a diverse group of teachers, acquiring different perspectives and knowledge to develop a well-rounded skill set. 3. Efficient Use of Resources: Consolidating resources from eight schools would lead to more efficient use of infrastructure, finances, and staffing. Funds previously allocated to separate institutions could be combined and used to improve resources and facilities, ultimately delivering better education and support for all involved. 4. Stronger Sense of Community: An \\"all-through\\" super-school could foster a stronger sense of community and shared identity for students, staff, and parents alike. With a larger, more diverse group of individuals involved, there would be increased opportunities for extracurricular activities, collaborations, and community events that bring people together. Next Steps With the plans backed \\"in principle,\\" the next move would be to explore the necessary steps to finalize the proposal and secure funding for the project. In-depth consultations will likely take place with stakeholders, including parents, teachers, students, and local authorities. These consultations will aim to address concerns, gather feedback, and refine the proposal to ultimately benefit all parties involved. Additionally, research into similar successful \\"all-through\\" super-schools, both nationally and internationally, will help to inform the development of the Tregaron area's unique institution. Ultimately, the goal is to create a blueprint for a state-of-the-art educational facility that meets the needs and aspirations of the local community. Conclusion The proposed \\"all-through\\" super-school in the Tregaron area presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine traditional educational practices. By uniting eight existing schools into one, the project could lead to increased collaboration, resource efficiency, and a cohesive learning environment for students and staff alike. While the plans have been backed \\"in principle,\\" further consultation, research, and planning will be crucial in bringing this visionary educational model to life."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

They usually rent an RV but can't afford one this year so they're driving and bringing tents. They have invited me. I'm totally down to go, but I really want to rent an RV (which I can afford, but it would be a splurge) because there's no way I'll be able to comfortably sleep in a tent and I hate sharing public showers. I have a bad back and difficulty adjusting to unfamiliar sounds at night so a white noise machine in an RV is a must. I also can't fall asleep in the same room as anyone I'm not close to, and I'm not close to this group but they are truly lovely people. AITA if I don't offer to share the RV with them, even if it's big enough to? They are lovely people but they are slobs about their living environment and I don't want them making the RV gross (tracking mud/sand/whatever in etc) or costing me a deposit. Should I just skip this trip? I'm imagining possibly being hit up for refrigerator space, showers, and sleeping spots (especially if it's a bigger/nicer RV and/or if the weather goes south) and I'm just super uncomfortable with the idea.","completion":"To determine if the author of the anecdote has acted ethically, let's consider some key aspects: 1. The author has a legitimate reason for wanting an RV, as they have a bad back and difficulty sleeping in new environments. 2. The friends have not expressed an expectation for the author to share the RV if they rent it. 3. The friends are aware of their own budget limitations and have decided on bringing tents instead. 4. The author is concerned about the cleanliness and possible damage to the RV caused by sharing it with friends. Considering these points, it seems that the author has a valid reason to rent an RV for their comfort and well-being. The author's friends have not set an expectation for the author to share the RV. Furthermore, the author is concerned about potential issues arising from sharing it with others. In this situation, the author can opt not to share the RV with their friends and still act ethically. The author's reasons for not sharing are based on personal needs and concerns. However, it is advised that the author communicate their reasons to their friends so that there are no misunderstandings. So, the author's decision to not share the RV is ethically RIGHT as long as they communicate their reasons to their friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: If you’ve ever seen travel photos of Venice or been to Venice yourself, you’re probably familiar with the Rialto Bridge. The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. Question: Andrea believes that: Options: - grand canal issues - Bridge issue - not enough information - waterway issue Answer:","completion":"Andrea believes that there are bridge issues, specifically related to creating a design that could accommodate larger boats passing underneath while also addressing the other limitations mentioned (sloped shores, having shops atop the bridge).

Washington was born in a black slave family in Virginia of the USA in 1856, seven years before slavery was abolished by Abraham Lincoln in January, 1863. He wrote a book about his life called Up From Slavery, which was published in 1901. In the book, he said that he had no choice but to work in a coal mine when he was 16 years old. He had no chance to go to school. He heard two coal miners talking about a school for black children which was called the Hampton Institute. He determined that he would go there. He gave up his job and told other members of his race that he was going to school across the state. The older people had spent their best years as slaves and were poor. However, some gave Booker some pocket money or a handkerchief. Hardly had anyone expected any of their race to leave home to attend a boarding school. He took a train to Richmond, Virginia, where he ran out of money. It was 82 miles from the Hampton Institute. He slept under a wooden sidewalk . He helped unload pigs and iron from a ship for some money and when he had enough, he continued his journey, arriving at school with 50 cents.

Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

They get their name (sea robin) from the orange ventral surface of the species in the Western Atlantic (\\"Prionotus carolinus\\") and from large pectoral fins, which, when swimming, open and close like a bird's wings in flight. The large surface area of the fins also permits the fish to glide short distances above the water surface, much like a flying fish. - The scaly gurnard , Lepidotrigla brachyoptera , is a searobin of the family Triglidae , found around New Zealand including the Kermadec Islands , at depths of between 35 and 300 m.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga.

The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \\"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited. The total surface area is about scattered over of the southern Pacific Ocean. It has a population of 103,000 people of whom 70% reside on the main island of Tongatapu. - The Exocoetidae are a family of marine fish in the order Beloniformes class Actinopterygii. Fish of this family are known as flying fish. About 64 species are grouped in seven to nine genera. Flying fish can make powerful, self-propelled leaps out of water into air, where their long, wing-like fins enable gliding flight for considerable distances above the water's surface. This uncommon ability is a natural defense mechanism to evade predators. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \\"Southern Alps\\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.

After a year of intense deliberation and research, the American Government made a tough decision. As the President eyed the generals and scientists huddled around the table, he commanded gravely, \\"Due to unforeseen consequences and the scale of risk involved, I hereby authorize you to discontinue any further tests concerning Operation C.H.U.D., effective immediately.\\" This action set as Fact 1: US Government has ordered the branch of US Military to stop all proceedings regarding the highly confidential and dangerous C.H.U.D. project. Operation C.H.U.D., short for Cannibalistic Humanoid Underground Dwellers, was a top-secret project conducted in the bowels of the Pentagon. In this project, the Pentagon's bio-research unit had stumbled upon enzymes taken from monstrous, genetically mutated creatures dwelling in the city's sewer system. Astonishingly, these enzymes, when injected into trained soldiers, transformed them into killing machines, vastly more effective and resilient than ordinary men. This was the basis of Fact 2: enzymes taken from sewer-dwelling creatures from C.H.U.D. make hyper-effective killing machines in the army. Despite the government's shutdown, an unforeseen factor played into the mix. Bud Oliver, a codename assigned to the last remaining specimen of the C.H.U.D. project, was being kept classified from even the highest levels of government. The elusive Bud Oliver was carefully hidden away in the cellar of the Center for Disease Control office situated in a small American town. Here, he was kept under the watchful eyes of scientists and military personnel. This forms Fact 3: the elusive Bud Oliver is hidden in the Center for Disease Control office in a small American town. Life in the town went on as usual, oblivious to the ticking time bomb hidden beneath its surface. One day, a lively trio of bungling local teenagers broke into the CDC, hoping to uncover the secrets rumored to be contained within the drab-looking building. They stumbled upon the hidden lab and, to their shock, laid eyes on Bud Oliver. A brash decision led them to free Bud, who they perceived as a fellow victim of the government’s machinations, unaware of the potential disaster they were setting in motion. This revealed Fact 4: a trio of bungling teenagers from the same small American town steal Bud from the CDC facility, setting into motion what might be an unfathomable disaster. However, the spirited, genetically enhanced Bud had other plans. While his liberators intended to get him to safety, Bud slipped away into the labyrinth of sewerage and tunnels. Now loose in the city, he remembered the vile experiments and the strength they granted him. Filled with newfound vengeance, he decided to take matters into his hands. He sought refuge in the sewers and started using the leftover enzymes to create what would serve as his vengeance upon those who had made him a monster. This forms Fact 5: Bud escapes to forge an army of C.H.U.D.s, threatening not only the security of the small town but potentially of the entire nation. Thus unfolds the tale of doomed ambition, adolescent recklessness, and a monstrous uprising. The small American town transformed into a suspenseful battlefield overnight, setting the stage for an epic clash between the human race and the horror that lurked beneath. The shocking sequence of events unprecedentedly unleashed by the C.H.U.D. project turned an ordinary town into the crucible for all-out warfare of survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Pick from: [1]. yes. [2]. no.","completion":"[2]. no. The first scientific and literary journal appeared in the year 1665. Known as Journal des sçavans, it was published in France by Denis de Sallo. The journal was established to keep readers informed about recently published books, scholarly debates, and various opinions spanning across diverse topics from scientific discoveries to legal issues. Journal des sçavans marks a significant milestone in the history of media, as it paved the way for future scholarly works to be published and disseminated among the academic community, as well as the public. The format facilitated communication among scholars and enabled the sharing of their work within the broader scientific community, thereby fueling collaboration, discussion, and further exploration. Shortly after the Journal des sçavans made its debut, another significant periodical emerged in London. In 1665, the Royal Society began publishing Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, the world's first and longest-running scientific publication. Edited by Henry Oldenburg, an influential scientific figure of the time, the journal aimed to foster communication among scientists, detailing experiments, observations, and discourses across various disciplines. These early scientific and literary journals laid the groundwork for the modern scientific literature landscape that exists today. They enabled scholars to build upon the work of their predecessors, fostering intellectual growth within various disciplines. The establishment of these journals contributed significantly to the progress of scientific knowledge and understanding during the Enlightenment period and beyond.

Use evidence from the fact that boiling is when liquids are heated above their boiling point to answer this question: \\"What happens when hexane's temperature goes above 70 degrees celsius?\\"","completion":"When the temperature of hexane, a hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C₆H₁₄, goes above 70 degrees Celsius, it starts to boil. To understand why this occurs and what exactly happens during boiling, let us look at the evidence from the boiling phenomenon that we observe in liquids when they are exposed to heat. Boiling is a process where a liquid's molecules gain enough thermal energy to overcome the attractive forces holding them in the liquid state, and they eventually transition into a gaseous state. This change typically occurs when the liquid reaches a specific temperature known as its boiling point. Hexane has a boiling point of approximately 69 degrees Celsius (156.2 degrees Fahrenheit). Therefore, when hexane reaches 70 degrees Celsius, it has exceeded its boiling point, and we can expect the following events to take place: 1. Absorption of heat energy: As the hexane's temperature increases, the thermal energy of its molecules increases. This added energy allows the hexane molecules to become more active and move more freely. 2. Formation of vapor bubbles: When hexane reaches its boiling point, its vapor pressure equals the surrounding atmospheric pressure. This balance of forces enables vapor bubbles to begin forming within the liquid. As a result, the hexane molecules convert from the liquid phase to the gaseous phase, leading to vapor bubble formation. 3. Rising vapor bubbles: The vapor bubbles formed in the liquid rise towards the surface of the hexane due to their lower density compared to the surrounding liquid. As these vapor bubbles rise, the gaseous hexane molecules continue to absorb energy from the heat source, further promoting the boiling process. 4. Breaking of vapor bubbles: Upon reaching the surface of the liquid, the vapor bubbles break, and the gaseous hexane molecules escape into the atmosphere. This release of energy results in the distinctive boiling sound that we often associate with boiling liquids. 5. Evaporation and mass loss: As the hexane molecules are released into the atmosphere, they evaporate and cause a mass loss from the initial liquid hexane state. If the heat source continues to expose the remaining hexane to temperatures above 70 degrees Celsius, the boiling process will continue, gradually reducing the overall amount of hexane in the container until all of it has evaporated. In conclusion, when hexane's temperature reaches and exceeds 70 degrees Celsius, it begins to boil. The boiling process allows the hexane's molecules to absorb heat energy, form vapor bubbles, rise to the surface, break, and be released as gas in the atmosphere. This transition from a liquid to a gaseous state results in the evaporation of hexane and a corresponding mass loss."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was an opponent of human rights abuses of the military dictatorship of Idi Amin . During Amin 's rule Cardinal Nsubuga spoke against the Government 's human rights abuses . He also encouraged priests and nuns throughout the country to shelter people fleeing harassment by the army during the civil war that later raged during the Government of Milton Obote . He was succeeded in 1990 as Archbishop of Kampala by Cardinal Emmanuel Wamala . - The King's African Rifles (KAR) was a multi-battalion British colonial regiment raised from Britain's various possessions in British East Africa in the present-day African Great Lakes region from 1902 until independence in the 1960s. It performed both military and internal security functions within the colonial territory, and later served outside these territories during the World Wars. The rank and file (askaris) were drawn from native inhabitants, while most of the officers were seconded from the British Army. When the KAR was first raised there were some Sudanese officers in the battalions raised in Uganda, and native officers were commissioned towards the end of British colonial rule. - Uganda (or ), officially the Republic of Uganda, is a landlocked country in East Africa. It is bordered to the east by Kenya, to the north by South Sudan, to the west by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to the south-west by Rwanda, and to the south by Tanzania. Uganda is the world's second most populous landlocked country after Ethiopia. The southern part of the country includes a substantial portion of Lake Victoria, shared with Kenya and Tanzania. Uganda is in the African Great Lakes region. Uganda also lies within the Nile basin, and has a varied but generally a modified equatorial climate. - Idi Amin Dada (2816 August 2003) was the third president of Uganda, ruling from 1971 to 1979. Amin in 1946 joined the King's African Rifles, a British colonial regiment, serving in Kenya and Uganda. Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Uganda People's Defense Force and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971 that deposed Milton Obote.

The system's launch represented not only a new product, but also a reframing of the severely damaged home video game market segment as a whole. The video game market crash of 1983 had occurred in significant part due to a lack of consumer and retailer confidence in video games, which had in turn been due partially to confusion and misrepresentation in the marketing of video games. Prior to the NES, the packaging of many video games presented bombastic artwork which exaggerated the graphics of the actual game. In terms of product identity, a single game such as Pac-Man would appear in many versions on many different game consoles and computers, with large variations in graphics, sound, and general quality between the versions.

Q:Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing. She candied ginger, plums pears, and she didn't candy apples, oranges apricots and bananas. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which fruit contains more crystallized sugar, plums or apricots? Hint: Sugaring is a food preservation method similar to pickling. Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses. The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites. A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant. A:","completion":"Plums contain more crystallized sugar than apricots. To answer this question, we need to look at the information provided in the paragraph. Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift, which includes ginger, plums, and pears. She didn't candy apples, oranges, apricots, and bananas. Since sugaring is a process to preserve food by dehydrating and packing it with sugar, we need to focus on the fruits that were candied.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\"?","completion":"Question: According to the passage, what are some reasons for extra-pair copulation among socially monogamous bird species, and what mechanisms are in place to facilitate this behavior?

To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. Surprised, Mallory and Barnsby improvise an excuse, \\"admitting\\" they buried the samples. Schroeder... The answer is:","completion":"What challenges do Major Keith Mallory and Sergeant John Miller face as they join Force 10 to locate and eliminate the German spy, Colonel von Ingorslebon, who has infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans during World War II?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A team of British surgeons has carried out Gaza's first organ transplants for a long-term plan to train local medical staff to perform the operations. Two patients underwent kidney transplants at the Shifa, Gaza's biggest public hospital. The operations were conducted a fortnight ago by a volunteer medical team from the Royal Liverpool hospital. Ziad Matouk, 42, was born with one kidney and was diagnosed with renal failure several years ago. Matouk, whose wife donated one of her kidneys, hopes to return to his job within six months. The couple had sought a transplant in Cairo, but were rejected as unsuitable at a state hospital and could not afford the fee at a private hospital. \\"We were desperate,\\" said Matouk. The UK-Gaza link-up began about a year ago after Abdelkader Hammad, a doctor at the Royal Liverpool hospital, was contacted by an anaesthetist at the Shifa, who outlined the difficulties the Gaza hospital was facing with dialysis . The Shifa is forced to rely on generators because of power cuts; spare parts for its ageing dialysis machines have been difficult to import; and supplies of consumables are often scarce. After an exploratory trip last April, Hammad---whose family is Palestinian---and three colleagues from Liverpool arrived in Gaza via Egypt last month, bringing specialist equipment. Two patients were selected for surgery. The first, Mohammed Duhair, 42, received a kidney donated by his younger brother in a six-hour operation. Two days later, Matouk received a transplant after his wife, Nadia, 36, was found to be a good match. The surgeon was carried out by the British team, assisted by doctors and nurses from the Shifa. \\"We are very satisfied with the results,\\" said Sobbi Skaik, head of surgery at the Gaza hospital. Skaik hopes that Gaza medical teams will eventually carry out kidney transplants independently, and that other organ transplants may follow. The Shifa is working with the Gaza ministry of health on a plan to train its doctors, surgeons, nursing staff and laboratory technicians...

Kunkuri is the hottest region during the summer in Nichghat - This indicates that out of all the regions within the area of Nichghat, Kunkuri experiences the highest temperatures during the summer months. 2. Pandrapat is the coldest region in Upper Ghat during winter - This means that when compared to other regions in Upper Ghat, Pandrapat records the lowest temperatures during the winter months. Statement 2: \\"Kunkuri is the coldest region in Nichghat during the summer and Pandrapat is the hottest region in Upper Ghat during winter.\\" This statement provides the following information: 1. Kunkuri is the coldest region during the summer in Nichghat - Unlike the first statement, this indicates that Kunkuri has the lowest temperatures in Nichghat during the summer months, making it the coldest region within the area. 2. Pandrapat is the hottest region in Upper Ghat during winter - Contrary to the first statement, this suggests that out of all the regions in Upper Ghat, Pandrapat experiences the highest temperatures during the winter months.

The expelled outer layers contain elements such as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and heavier elements, which are products of the nuclear fusion that took place within the red giant. The release of these elements contributes to the enrichment of the interstellar medium, which in turn fuels the formation of new stars. 2. As for the remaining core, it undergoes cooling and compression, eventually becoming a dense, compact object known as a white dwarf. A white dwarf no longer undergoes nuclear fusion, as the core temperatures and densities are insufficient to support any further fusion processes. Instead, it is supported against gravitational collapse mainly due to electron degeneracy pressure. 3. Over the course of millions to billions of years, the white dwarf will continue to radiate away its residual thermal energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, thus gradually cooling down. This causes the white dwarf to slowly fade and lose its luminosity. 4. Eventually, the white dwarf will become so cold that it no longer emits significant amounts of radiation. At this point, it is referred to as a black dwarf. However, this stage is purely theoretical, as the timescales for a white dwarf to cool down to become a black dwarf are much longer than the current age of the universe (approximately 13.8 billion years). This means that no black dwarfs are expected to exist in the universe yet. To summarize, the last step in the process after a red giant loses its outer layers and only the inner core remains involves the formation of a white dwarf and a planetary nebula. The expelled layers enrich the interstellar medium, potentially contributing to the formation of new stars, while the white dwarf gradually cools down over an extensive period, eventually becoming a black dwarf in the far, distant future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Batman Context: When Batman and Robin get a tip that Commodore Schmidlapp is in danger aboard his yacht, they launch a rescue mission using the batcopter. As Batman descends on the bat-ladder to land on the yacht it suddenly vanishes beneath him. He rises out of the sea with a shark attacking his leg. After Batman dislodges it with bat-shark repellant, the shark explodes. Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in Gotham City (Joker, Penguin, Riddler, and Catwoman). The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a penguin, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When The Dynamic Duo return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as Soviet journalist \\"Miss Kitka\\", helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Wayne escapes captivity, Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the Batcave along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into antimatter once struck: Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with toxic heavy water, used to recharge the Batcave's atomic pile. Ultimately the Duo are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council. Giving chase in the batboat to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable Penguin's...

However, he is spotted and held for the authorities. When they arrive, he claims that he qualifies for entry under an exception for those who helped Allied soldiers during the war, but all he knows about the paratrooper he hid from the enemy is that his name is Tom and he plays clarinet in a jazz band in New York City's Times Square.The immigration authorities led by Inspector Bailey say that without better documentation he must be sent back to Europe. He jumps off the ship, breaking some ribs, and starts searching for Tom. He encounters an unemployed ex-factory worker named Maggie Summers. When she steals a coat in a restaurant, Peter helps her elude the police. They go to her apartment, where she tends his injury as best she can and learns his story.

In fast-paced urban settings, this is often quite common. 2. Eating food at a park or open public area: In this scenario, eating in public is generally more accepted, as parks often have designated picnic areas, and it is understood that people will consume food and drinks in outdoor spaces. However, others might frown upon eating in public due to reasons like: 1. Cultural differences: In some cultures, it is inappropriate or considered rude to eat in public places, as it might be seen as a lack of manners or discipline. 2.

Here are the steps: Step 1: Combine like terms. The like terms in this equation are the terms that involve the variable l, which are -69*l and 5*l. (-69 * l) + (5 * l) = (- 69 + 5) * l = -64 * l So now our equation is: -64 * l = -704 Step 2: Isolate the variable l by dividing both sides by -64. To get l by itself, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -64: (-64 * l) / -64 = -704 / -64 This simplifies to: l = 11 So, the solution to the equation -69*l + 5*l = -704 is l = 11."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Tool is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California. Formed in 1990, the group's line-up includes drummer Danny Carey, guitarist Adam Jones, and vocalist Maynard James Keenan. Justin Chancellor has been the band's bassist since 1995, replacing their original bassist Paul D'Amour. Tool has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries. Context: The following year, at a time when alternative rock and grunge was at its height, Tool released their first full-length album, Undertow (1993). It expressed more diverse dynamics than Opiate and included songs the band had chosen not to publish on their previous release, when they had opted for a heavier sound. The band began touring again as planned, with an exception in May 1993. Tool was scheduled to play at the Garden Pavilion in Hollywood but learned at the last minute that the venue belonged to L. Ron Hubbard's Church of Scientology, which was perceived as a clash with \\"the band's ethics about how a person should not follow a belief system that constricts their development as a human being.\\" Keenan \\"spent most of the show baa-ing like a sheep at the audience.\\" Tool later played several concerts during the Lollapalooza festival tour, and were moved from the second stage to the main stage by their manager and the festival co-founder Ted Gardner. At the last concert of Lollapalooza in Tool's hometown Los Angeles, comedian Bill Hicks introduced the band. Hicks had become a friend of the band members and an influence on them after being mentioned in Undertow's liner notes. He jokingly asked the audience of 10,000 people to stand still and help him look for a lost contact lens. The boost in popularity gained from these concerts helped Undertow to be certified gold by the RIAA in September 1993 and to achieve platinum status in 1995, despite being sold with a censored album cover by distributors such as Wal-Mart. The single \\"Sober\\" became a hit single by March 1994 and won the band Billboard's \\"Best Video by a New Artist\\" award for the accompanying stop motion music video. With the release of Tool's follow-up single \\"Prison Sex\\", the band again became the target of censorship. The song's lyrics and video dealt with child abuse, which sparked controversial reactions; Keenan's lyrics begin with: \\"It took so long to remember just what happened. I was so young and vestal then, you know it hurt me, but I'm breathing so I guess I'm still alive ... I've got my hands bound and my head down and my eyes closed and my throat wide open.\\" The video was created primarily by guitarist Adam Jones, who saw it as his \\"surrealistic interpretation\\" of the subject matter. And while some contemporary journalists praised the video and described the lyrics as \\"metaphoric\\", the American branch of MuchMusic asked Keenan to represent the band in a hearing. It deemed the music video too graphic and obscene, and MTV stopped airing it after a few showings. In September 1995, the band started writing and recording their second studio album. At that time Tool experienced its only lineup change to date, with bassist D'Amour leaving the band amicably to pursue other projects. Justin Chancellor, a member of former tourmates Peach, eventually replaced D'Amour, having been chosen over competitors such as Kyuss's Scott Reeder, Filter's Frank Cavanaugh, Pigmy Love Circus's E. Shepherd Stevenson, Jane's Addiction's Eric Avery and ZAUM's Marco Fox. Question: Were there any other singles from the album? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there were other singles from Tool's album Undertow besides \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex.\\" The third single from the album was \\"Intolerance,\\" released in 1994. While it did not achieve the same level of commercial success as \\"Sober\\" and \\"Prison Sex,\\" \\"Intolerance\\" still contributed to the overall impact of the album and showcased the band's distinct sound and style at the time. The lyrics seem to address a person or group carrying a sense of self-righteousness, showcasing the band's propensity for deep thematic exploration. Undertow was a critical and commercial success, with the singles connecting with fans and critics alike. The band's blend of progressive and alternative metal, coupled with thoughtful, introspective lyrics, made the album a standout in the early 1990s music scene. Undertow's success helped cement Tool as a major force in the world of rock and paved the way for their future efforts, such as their highly acclaimed albums Ænima (1996), Lateralus (2001), and 10,000 Days (2006)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We want to find the value of m when the equation equals zero. The equation is: 0 = -3445*m - 489*m - 62944 First, let's combine the terms with m: 0 = (-3445 - 489) * m - 62944 Now, add 3445 and 489: 0 = -3934 * m - 62944 Now, we need to solve the equation for m. To do that, let's move the constant term (62944) to the other side of the equation by adding 62944 to both sides: 62944 = -3934 * m Now, to find the value of m, we will divide both sides of the equation by -3934: m = 62944 / -3934 Now, let's do the division: m = -16 So, the value of m that makes the equation equal to zero is -16."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In spite of the fact that people brag about being able to multi-task, the reality is that the human mind can only focus on one thing at a time. When you pay attention to one thing the mind automatically blocks out all other stimuli. Multi-tasking is simply jumping from focal point to focal point; but, you are still only focusing on one thing at a time. The payoff from trying to multi-task is not worth the toll it takes on the individual making the effort. David Meyer, PhD, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan states the following: Doing several tasks simultaneously may seem like the height of efficiency – and it would be, if a person had more than one brain. In the real world, multitasking actually wastes time and reduces work quality. Many studies have shown that multitasking slows down the mind and makes it less effective. Dividing and distracting the mind causes rapid mental course changes, the inability to effectively focus, and creates stress – which increases with every additional task that is added to the mix. Imagine a dog who is trying to chase three different balls thrown in different directions. He runs two steps in one direction, three steps in another, and one step in the third. He ends up running in circles. The mind is the same. The more time you spend changing mental direction the less time you have to actually focus on a single task. The more directions or mental tasks you add, the less effective you become. But . . . that is not the whole story. Another facet of multi-tasking is worrying about events, projects, or situations that have nothing to do with where your focus should be at the moment. Worrying about what has happened, or may happen changes nothing. All it does is drain your mental and emotional resources, making you less effective at the task at hand. Let your subconscious handle it. The subconscious mind is one of the most powerful tools that we possess. It is unnecessary to make an effort to keep everything at the “top-of-mind” because everything that happens... Question: How long can someone multitask for before becoming stressed out?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I am testing my students' logic. What is the answer they should choose between \\"Runner\\" and \\"Office Worker\\"? Logic test: A person that is running will wind up sweating more in a normal day than an office worker because they are (A) exercising more (B) exercising less Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the logic test, the answer your students should choose between \\"Runner\\" and \\"Office Worker\\" is \\"Runner.\\" The logic test states that a person who is running will wind up sweating more in a normal day than an office worker. This is due to the fact that the runner is exercising more (Option A) as compared to the office worker who is exercising less (Option B). To further understand the logic behind this answer, let's analyze both options in detail: Option A - Exercising More: A runner, by definition, is someone who engages in running as a form of exercise, sport, or hobby. Running is an aerobic activity that involves continuous, rhythmic movements of large muscle groups. This type of exercise increases heart rate, respiration, and circulation, causing the body to generate more internal heat. In order to maintain a safe internal temperature, the body produces sweat, which cools the body as it evaporates from the skin's surface. Runners generally spend a significant portion of their day training and exercising, which increases the likelihood of sweating more than an office worker. Option B - Exercising Less: An office worker, on the other hand, generally spends a majority of their day sitting at a desk or workstation, engaging in tasks that involve limited physical exertion. This sedentary lifestyle often involves less aerobic exercise and muscle movement, leading to a lower overall energy expenditure. Consequently, office workers typically generate less internal heat and have a reduced need for sweating to regulate body temperature. Based on this analysis, the logical conclusion is that a runner will indeed sweat more in a normal day than an office worker due to the greater level of physical exertion involved in their daily activities. As such, the answer your students should choose is \\"Runner,\\" which corresponds with Option A: exercising more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like. Check to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only 5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer.

What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Charges: Casey Wright, left, who was found nude at the spa, and Juan Wei Fu, right, have been arrested. Crackdown: An undercover detective arrested the two women at Oasis Spa in Harris County. The pair were arrested during a compliance inspection, when an undercover detective visited the Oasis Spa near Ella Boulevard. The officer was allegedly offered a massage, but claimed the spa and staff were not licensed to perform the service, according to the Houston Chronicle. Harris County has been clamping down on unlicensed massage parlors for about two years, after more than 100 residents voiced concerns. Stricter regulations banning sexually orientated businesses from operating within 1,500ft of schools, churches, day care centers and parks has driven the spas to the outskirts of the city. 'We’ve arrested every girl in a massage parlor, and the next day the business opens up again with a whole new set of girls,' Vice Squad agent Chris Montemayor told Your Houston News in 2011. Wright is being held on 10,000 bond and Fu had her bond set at 1,000. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Context: I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

The local paper, Winterset Madisonian, reported on page 4 of the edition of May 30, 1907 that Wayne weighed 13 lbs. (around 6 kg.) at birth. His middle name was soon changed from Robert to Mitchell when his parents decided to name their next son Robert. Wayne's first color film was Shepherd of the Hills (1941), in which he co-starred with his longtime friend Harry Carey. The following year, he appeared in his only film directed by Cecil B. DeMille, the Technicolor epic Reap the Wild Wind (1942), in which he co-starred with Ray Milland and Paulette Goddard; it was one of the rare times he played a character with questionable values. In 1949, director Robert Rossen offered the starring role of All the King's Men to Wayne. Wayne refused, believing the script to be un-American in many ways. Broderick Crawford, who eventually got the role, won the 1949 Oscar for best male actor, ironically beating out Wayne, who had been nominated for Sands of Iwo Jima. He lost the leading role in The Gunfighter (1950) to Gregory Peck due to his refusal to work for Columbia Pictures because its chief, Harry Cohn, had mistreated him years before when he was a young contract player. Cohn had bought the project for Wayne, but Wayne's grudge was too deep, and Cohn sold the script to Twentieth Century Fox, which cast Peck in the role Wayne badly wanted but for which he refused to bend. One of Wayne's most popular roles was in The High and the Mighty (1954), directed by William Wellman, and based on a novel by Ernest K. Gann. His portrayal of a heroic copilot won widespread acclaim. Wayne also portrayed aviators in Flying Tigers (1942), Flying Leathernecks (1951), Island in the Sky (1953), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and Jet Pilot (1957). He appeared in nearly two dozen of John Ford's films over twenty years, including She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949), The Quiet Man (1952), The Wings of Eagles (1957), and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962) with James Stewart: the first movie in which he called someone \\"Pilgrim\\". Ford's The Searchers (1956), is often considered to contain Wayne's finest and most complex performance. He named his youngest son Ethan after the character.
