Knox, who yesterday unveiled a dramatic new short haircut in Seattle, is being retried in her absence for the brutal killing of her former roommate in Perugia, Italy, in 2007. Italian judges at the appeal court have now retired to consider the evidence and are expected to announce their verdict later today. Knox, who was pictured with her new short bob leaving the downtown branch of Gene Juarez salons on Wednesday, has admitted her 'heart will be in her mouth' today as she awaits the latest verdict.

His two sons and a close business associate also face various charges for their alleged abuse of power to amass great wealth, the AP reports. Protesters had planned to hold a major march Friday calling for a public trial, among other reforms. “Every time the youth threaten to go to Tahrir Square again with a huge number of protesters, I think they make some concessions,” one political scientist tells Reuters. The decision puts to bed speculation that Egypt’s military rulers would spare the 83-year-old the indignity of a trial. Analysts have warned that trying Mubarak will make other Arab leaders more reluctant to step down peacefully. Mubarak is currently in custody in a Red Sea resort hospital, and his sons are in prison. Expand this summary.","completion":"Okay, let's break this down like a story. So, there was a man named Hosni Mubarak, who was a very important person in a country called Egypt. He was like the principal of a big school, but for the whole country! But some people were very, very unhappy with him, because they thought he was being unfair and hurting people who disagreed with him. These people were like the students in the school saying, \\"We don't like how things are run here!\\" and gathering in a big space called Tahrir Square to shout about it. So, the people in charge of making sure rules are followed in Egypt have said, \\"Mr. Mubarak, you have to come and explain your actions. You're going to stand trial, which is like a super serious talk where we find out if you were being mean and unfair on purpose.\\" It's a big deal and like being sent to the headmaster's office, but even bigger. Hosni Mubarak also has two sons, like two students who were part of the school where their dad was the principal. These sons and one of their friends might also have been doing some naughty stuff, like taking more than their fair share of lunch money, just because they were the principal's sons. They are also going to have to explain themselves. This trial is very important because it's like telling everyone in the school, and in other schools too, that even the principal and his family have to play by the rules. But some people are a bit worried that other principals might get scared that they could also be pulled up for not playing by the rules. Meanwhile, Mr. Mubarak is waiting in a very comfy place near the sea, though it's a bit like being in detention, while his sons are in prison, which is more like a really long, serious detention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Interesting one; while Clinton was still in office he was at a fund raising dinner at a restaurant I managed. I met his personal valet from the white house mess, Oscar, and he casually said, if you are ever in DC…. To which I replied, I sure can be! My husband and I made the trip a month or so later, we met up with Oscar for dinner on our first night there. We had just started planning all we wanted to see as it was our first visit there. We had no idea that Oscar would invite us for not one but two private tours of the White House. We saw the oval office, the situation room, the rose garden, the mess, the press room and the OEOB. We even heard Buddy bark! It was a trip I knew I’d never be able to repeat and was very grateful to have had the chance to take. For the fun one…My friend was turning 50 and she wanted a theme destination celebration. 18 of us went to Belize. She went all out. Two private villas that you could only access by boat, all the swag you can imagine. And plenty of booze. That alone is already a super special vacation but for me it had even more meaning. I’d never been invited to a group event like this before nor had I been to spring break, which this very much turned into. I know many people have plenty of over the top stories. And I’ve had some even more amazing trips than this. But those two had just enough special twists to make them really stand out. Thanks for asking. I too am a Disney fan! The narrator believes that their friend, for the friend's 50th birthday, was: - Willing to do something very special for the birthday celebration - Very scared of traveling to foreign countries - not enough information - Amidst a mid-life crisis","completion":"Based on the information provided, the narrator's friend was indeed willing to do something very special for their 50th birthday celebration by organizing a theme destination celebration in Belize. They planned two private villas only accessible by boat, filled with plenty of swag and booze, for a group of 18 people, transforming it into an unforgettable vacation that resembled a spring break trip. There is not enough information to determine whether the friend was scared or nervous about traveling to foreign countries. However, considering that they planned a trip to Belize and invited a large number of people, it is likely that they were comfortable with international travel. As for whether the friend was going through a mid-life crisis, we cannot make a definite conclusion based on the provided information. The excitement and grand scale of the birthday celebration may give the impression of a potential mid-life crisis. However, it is also possible that the friend genuinely wanted to have a fun and memorable time celebrating their 50th birthday with close friends without any crisis being involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following year, it chartered the Royal Niger Company under the leadership of Sir George Taubman Goldie. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British protectorate, and part of the British Empire, the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered Benin in 1897, and, in the Anglo-Aro War (1901–1902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Go online and search for beekeepers in your area. Call each beekeeper to see if they are interested in the hive, even if they don’t mention picking them up on their website. Beekeepers are experienced in safely removing bees without killing them and will happily relocate them. There are also nonprofit bee removal services that keep bees from becoming endangered in high-risk areas where their pollination skills are especially important. You normally won’t need to pay a beekeeper to remove a hive. If you do, the fee won’t be particularly high, although it depends on where you live. If there are no beekeepers or nonprofit groups in your area, call a bee removal service. You will have to pay to have the bees removed, but a bee removal service will remove the bees safely and thoroughly. Bee removal experts often sell or give away their hives and will not kill the bees unless absolutely necessary. If the hive is easily accessed and the swarm isn’t particularly big, bee removal will cost 75-200. If drywall needs to be removed or the hive is in a tricky location, like a roof, it may cost up to 1,500. If removing the bees is not an option because the colony is inaccessible, contact a local exterminator. This is the worst option, since bees are good for the environment and the chemicals in commercial bee pesticides can damage a home, but you can certainly hire an exterminator to kill the bees if it’s the only way to have them removed. An exterminator will cost roughly 200-300, but a new colony is more likely to return if the exterminator doesn’t remove the hive or handle it properly. Make sure that you hire an exterminator with experience removing bees. If a large number of bees die and their corpses are not removed, they will break down and leave a particularly funky odor behind that will take some time to get rid of. Summary:","completion":"To safely remove a beehive from your property, first search for beekeepers in your area and contact them to check their interest in the hive. Beekeepers are skilled in the safe removal and relocation of bees. Nonprofit bee removal services are another option, which help protect bees in high-risk areas. Typically, you won't need to pay a beekeeper for their services, but if you do, fees depend on your location. If no beekeepers or nonprofit groups are available, contact a bee removal service. There will be a fee for their service, but they will remove the bees safely and thoroughly. The cost of professional bee removal varies from 75 to 200 for smaller, easily accessible hives, and can go up to 1,500 for larger or more complex situations. If bee removal isn't an option due to an inaccessible colony, contact a local exterminator. This is the least desirable option because bees are beneficial to the environment, and commercial pesticides can damage your property. The cost of an exterminator is around 200 to 300, but keep in mind that a new colony may return if the hive is not dealt with appropriately. Ensure you hire an experienced exterminator. Be aware that if a large number of bees die and are not removed, a foul odor may linger for some time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - tiny - cellulose - photons - unique - messengers - chemicals - complex - similar A:","completion":"A: Complex To answer this question, let's break it down step-by-step. 1. The question says that plants use complex molecules to absorb light energy. We know this is referring to the process of photosynthesis, where plants convert light energy into chemical energy. 2. So, we are looking for the type of molecules that are responsible for absorbing light energy in plants. 3. To do this, let's examine the answer choices. - Tiny: The size of the molecules is not relevant in this context. - Cellulose: This is a structural component of plants, not involved in absorbing light energy. - Photons: These are particles of light, not molecules used by plants to absorb light energy. - Unique: This is too vague and doesn't specifically relate to the molecules used for light absorption. - Messengers: These are not related to absorbing light energy. - Chemicals: This is a broad term and doesn't specifically identify the molecules used for light absorption. - Complex: This is mentioned in the question and refers to the complex molecules used by plants to absorb light energy. - Similar: This term is too vague and doesn't specify the type of molecules used for light absorption.

A foreman is murdered during construction and Ellen and John's five year-old daughter mysteriously disappears without a trace. Later John himself commits suicide by throwing himself out a window at the top of Red Rose's tallest tower.Over the years a number of men are killed in the house and a larger number of women simply disappear. Ellen continues to add rooms to the rambling mansion throughout her life until she also disappears mysteriously in 1950s. The Rimbauer family continues to own the house, though their fortunes decline and they are forced to support it with public tours until too many of the tourists go mysteriously missing on the property.The film story starts properly in modern times when our academic, Professor Joyce Reardon, (Nancy Travis), decides that she is going to use Red Rose to prove that psychic phenomena is real. She is dating Steve Rimbauer (Matt Keeslar), the last of the family. He has decided to tear the place down and put up condos, but he will let Joyce have a weekend to prove her theories before the wrecking ball moves in on it.Reardon thinks that by bringing a collection of psychically active people to the house she can reactive what she calls a \\"dead cell\\" and get the readings she needs on her scientific equipment to prove her theories. To that end she recruits Emery...

Answer the above question based on the context below: The Goofy Gophers are about to harvest the vegetables on the farm when the farmhands beat them to the punch. Worried that their food source is being \\"vandalized,\\" they follow the truck to the barn so they can recover what they consider to be their food. However, they spot the guard dog and realize that if he were to awaken and spot them stealing the vegetables, he would cause them trouble. The Gophers spend most of the rest of the cartoon using psychological weardown tactics to drive Barnyard Dawg insane and remove him as a threat to their well-being. A deadpan pig watches as the dog is repeatedly the victim of the Gophers' pranks, and can only shake his head as the dog's psyche is broken down. Meanwhile, the pooch tries to convince himself that all that is going on is nothing but a bad dream (consulting Sigmund Fraud and using sleeping pills to laugh off each attempt). In the end, the Gophers get rid of their foe for good by tying a harness around the sleeping Barnyard Dawg's belly, then attaching it to a hot air balloon before launching it (getting a tear in at as it goes up), leaving them free to \\"raise their vegetables\\" into a long pipe leading from the barn to their burrow. Meanwhile, the balloon's hull leaks out completely, and the dog awakens atop a light pole. After he wakes up and realising his surroundings, Barnyard Dawg mentally snaps and begins to fly! The pig - confused about everything he has seen - goes to psychiatrist Dr. Cy Kosis for counseling. Kosis realizes he needs counseling (and joins his client on the couch) when he sees the Barnyard Dawg flying by the window. Answer:","completion":"In the given context, the client that Dr. Cy Kosis joins on the couch is the confused pig, who has witnessed the bizarre and inexplicable events involving the Goofy Gophers, Barnyard Dawg, and the various psychological tactics employed by the Gophers to drive the dog insane. The pig, unable to make sense of the surreal happenings and witnessing the dog eventually flying by the window, seeks counseling from Dr. Cy Kosis. As the pig shares the story of what has unfolded, Dr. Cy Kosis himself becomes baffled and affected by the uncanny nature of the events. The sight of Barnyard Dawg flying past the window pushes the psychiatrist to question his own mental stability, eventually leading him to join his client, the pig, on the couch for counseling and support. This highlights the absurd and psychologically unsettling impact of the situations that took place on the farm, as well as the comical nature of the cartoon in which both the pig and Dr. Cy Kosis find themselves struggling to cope with the implications of the events they've witnessed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write some highlights for the following article: His brief is clear: to inject some impetus into Reading’s ailing season before it becomes too late, to find some stability, solidity and momentum to rescue a campaign in danger of being tossed away. Yesterday, we started to see Steve Clarke’s blueprint emerge. This was not far off how the Royals boss would have pictured life when he took over from Nigel Adkins less than a fortnight ago. His team were purposeful, direct and pretty good to watch, certainly far too strong for a Norwich side whose performance was described by their manager Neil Adams as ‘chalk and cheese’ from recent weeks. Hal Robson-Kanu celebrates with his team-mate Oliver Norwood after he scores their side's first goal. Simon Cox doubles his side's lead with a finish past Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy.

Scorer: Johnson 71. Booked: Johnson, Martin. Referee: James Linington (Isle of Wight) Attendance: 19,340 (2,311 away) There was an end to their Madejski goal drought, dating back to November 4, with strikes from Hal Robson-Kanu, a penalty, and Simon Cox. That monkey is off their backs. And there was warm appreciation from the home crowd, who have noticed a swift improvement and seemingly taken Clarke (right) to their hearts. He already has a ‘Barmy Army’ in any case, singling lustily in the second half. Frustrations from the 1-0 home loss to Watford in his maiden match before Christmas and Inigo Calderon’s last-minute equaliser for Brighton on Boxing Day were replaced with cheer as 2014 ticks over into 2015. ‘It’s nice for me, I can enjoy a glass of red tonight, which always tastes a little bit better when you win,’ said Clarke. ‘I’m delighted with the players. Their application in the short time I’ve been at the club has been great. And I’m delighted for the fans.’ ‘Application’ was one of three qualities demanded by Clarke in his programme notes. The others were ‘attitude’ and ‘character’. The first two were in evidence from the off, as Reading set about their business energetically and incisively, gaining a two-goal lead by half-time. Reading's Chris Gunter gestures to referee James Linington after Norwich City's Bradley Johnson (not pictured) scores his side's only goal of the game before Reading had a chance to complete their substitutions. The ‘character’ part came towards the end, after Bradley Johnson’s thunderbolt in controversial circumstances gave Norwich, who had scored 13 in their three previous outings, hope of an unlikely revival. Johnson’s goal prompted howls of derision from the crowd as Reading were down to 10 men after Garath McCleary required treatment and about to make a double substitution. But just as the fourth official was about to illuminate his board, referee James Linington waved play on and Norwich scored. ‘The referee seemed to take the law into his own hands,’ said Clarke. ‘For some reason he wouldn’t let us make that change, it was extraordinary.’ Reading boss Steve Clarke celebrates after his side claim the three points against Norwich. Adams argued his players had technically done nothing wrong since the referee had allowed play to continue. In the end, it didn’t matter. The late Norwich onslaught never materialised and Clarke claimed his first victory in charge at the third attempt. They led on 25 minutes when Johnson got into a muddle and hauled down Michael Hector at a corner. Robson-Kanu sent John Ruddy the wrong way with his penalty. Nine minutes later, the lively Glenn Murray was played clear down the right following a neat passing move and crossed for Cox to finish. Clarke is keen on signing Crystal Palace striker Glenn Murray on a permanent deal. With time up on Murray’s temporary loan deal from Crystal Palace, this could be the last Reading see of him but Clarke is doing everything in his power to keep him. ‘It was hopefully not a farewell,’ he said. ‘He deserves the reception, he’s contributed with goals and good performances. There is a structure in place where we can do a deal.’ He added, as a caveat, that the dismissal of Neil Warnock as Palace boss had rather left negotiations ‘in limbo’. The same could be said of Reading’s season at times. Having missed out on the play-offs by a point last time, 16th was not where their fans expected them to be. But, with Clarke at the helm, the green shoots of recovery are starting to sprout.","completion":"Highlights of the article: - Steve Clarke's blueprint starts to emerge for Reading as his team showcases purposeful, direct, and entertaining play. - Reading ends their Madejski goal drought with goals from Hal Robson-Kanu and Simon Cox, receiving warm appreciation from the home crowd. - Manager Steve Clarke praises the players' application, attitude, and character, as they maintain their two-goal lead by half-time. - Reading claims three points with their win over Norwich, with signs of recovery beginning to show under Clarke's leadership."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Derrick paused, taking a moment to reconsider. He glanced back at Christopher, then at the coyote, and sighed deeply. \\"Alright,\\" he said hesitantly, \\"but if this thing becomes a threat, I won't hesitate to protect my family and our land.\\" Step 1: Briefly recap the current situation Derrick has decided not to kill the injured coyote, but he is still concerned about the safety of his family and property. Step 2: Introduce a new development that moves the story forward Suddenly, Christopher noticed a rustling in the bushes nearby, and the two men saw a group of baby coyotes cautiously emerging from the underbrush. It was clear that the injured coyote was a mother trying to care for her offspring. Step 3: Show the characters reacting to this new development Christopher's eyes widened with excitement, and Derrick couldn't help but soften his expression at the sight. Step 4: Involve the characters in a decision-making process considering the new development Derrick glanced at Christopher, who was already preparing to plead the case for the coyote family's safety. Before he could speak, Derrick said, \\"Okay, okay. We won't hurt them. But we have to do something to make sure they don't cause any trouble.\\" Step 5: Describe the plan they come up with to address the situation The two men decided to build a small barrier around a section of their property, providing a safe space for the coyote family to live in. They would make sure to leave enough room for the coyotes to hunt and find food, and they would also place a small shelter for the coyotes to take refuge in during harsh weather. Step 6: Implement the plan Over the next few days, Derrick and Christopher worked tirelessly to construct the barrier, using wooden posts and wire mesh to define the coyote family's new home. They also built a simple shelter out of plywood and old blankets that would keep the animals warm and dry. Step 7: Observe the response of the coyote family to the plan As the coyote family started to explore their new living space, they seemed to appreciate the safety it provided. While the mother coyote remained cautious, the baby coyotes gradually became more curious and playful, even approaching the fence to observe Derrick and Christopher as they worked on the final touches. Step 8: Show the impact of the plan on the main characters Derrick couldn't deny that the sight of the coyote family happily playing together in their new home warmed his heart a little. Christopher, on the other hand, couldn't have been prouder of their accomplishment, beaming with satisfaction as he surveyed their handiwork. Step 9: End the story by indicating growth or change in the characters Despite his initial skepticism, Derrick began to see the value in Christopher's insistence on protecting the coyote family. The two men found common ground in their desire to help these vulnerable creatures, strengthening their bond as they continued to work together on other projects to make their land a sanctuary for the many different creatures who called it home."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -12 = 706*c - 718*c for c.","completion":"To solve the equation -12 = 706*c - 718*c for c, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the like terms on the right side of the equation. To do that, subtract 718*c from 706*c: -12 = 706*c - 718*c -12 = (706 - 718)*c Now, subtract 718 from 706: -12 = (-12)*c Step 2: Solve for c. Now that we have simplified the equation, the next step is to isolate the variable c. Since the equation is -12 = (-12)*c, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -12 to get c by itself: -12 / -12 = (-12*c) / -12 This simplifies to: 1 = c So the solution to the equation -12 = 706*c - 718*c is c = 1."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you like Grey's Dr. McDreamy, you'll like Tom and the movie. If not? There are plenty of other nondescript romantic comedies out there from which to choose. 2. A film so dreadful and humiliating that it's reassuring to know Dempsey can keep his day job. 3. Movies like this make Cupid want to change careers. 4. At its best, a romantic comedy celebrates one of humanity's greatest yearnings: to give and to find the love of a lifetime. At its worst (and this is where Made of Honor comes in), it can leave you with a bad taste, not just in your mouth but in your soul 5. Certain formula-driven romantic comedies reach a point where the audience realizes it won't be much fun watching the main character get his way. Nor will it be much fun watching him get his comeuppance. This is not where you want your audience. 6. Not good, not bad, just there, the film faithfully crosses off one timeworn cliché after the next. 7. The plotting ranges from predictable to ridiculous and with the exception of a handful of laugh-out-loud moments, Dempsey's frequent shirtlessness is the film's main appeal. The rest is as unpalatable as stale wedding cake. 8. It's touching work that makes Dempsey's plastic sincerity look as thin as the film's posters. 9. Made of Honor is the kind of formulaic fare -- there's even that turn-the-car-around-and-get-me-back-to-the-church moment -- that depends on the wit of the script and the spark of its stars. In those departments, the film is just middling. 10. Overly familiar and predictable. Its debts to both When Harry Met Sally and My Best Friend's Wedding are considerable. Summary:","completion":"The movie Made of Honor is about love and has a main character named Tom played by Dempsey, who is also Dr. McDreamy in Grey's. Some people think that if you like Dempsey, you will like the movie, but others think it is not very good. It follows some usual romantic comedy ideas and has some funny parts but can also be boring. There are some nice moments, but overall, it might not be very special or different from other love stories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If not for the handful of song-and-dance routines, you would never have thought this was a kids movie, and this is why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent film, let alone for a kids' movie.

I'd be shocked to see any child under the age of 8 not completely terrified throughout a great deal of the latter half and some of the first half of the movie, and it all ends with one of the saddest endings you could ever come across (ala \\"Jurassic Bark\\", for those of you who are 'Futurama' fans), and this is what makes this movie so good. Just because the movie universally evokes emotions we don't normally like to feel and assume are bad does not make the movie itself bad; in fact, it means it succeeded. Good funny movies are supposed to make us laugh; good horror movies are supposed to make us scared; good sad movies are supposed to make us sad.

It's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, yet as absurd as much of the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded, keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here. This film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. That seems to be the heart of the film. For as insane and off the wall as things get, Leon, the 30 yr. old paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together. He's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best, so that everyone can have what they want. The acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive. Van Meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics. Just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath. Majkowski is a true genius here. He takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real. It is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat. It's a true testament to the skill of Majkowski and all involved that this film, with it's grating plot and characters, never once works our nerves.

Coming off their bye week, the Bears traveled to Lambeau Field to play the Green Bay Packers in the 189th meeting between the two rivals. The Bears had struggled regarding scoring against Green Bay in the last nine games between the two prior to 2013, and including the 2010 NFC title game, had scored 127 points, an average of 14.11 points. The two teams entered with among the top three scoring offenses, with Chicago and Green Bay ranked second and third, respectively, with 30.4 and 30.3 points per game, both of which rank behind the Denver Broncos. Among the weapons of the Packers offense that the Bears must attempt to hinder was the running game, as Green Bay's rookie running back Eddie Lacy has recorded over 100 yards per game in the previous six during the season, along with quarterback Aaron Rodgers. One of Rodgers' skills is passing balls longer than 20 yards, and was 16 of 32 on these attempts, which was tied with Russell Wilson of the Seattle Seahawks for the highest percentage in the league; the Bears allowed 57 percent of opponents to throw for the aforementioned distance, the second-worst score in the NFL. However, both teams ranked in the bottom five in the NFL in pass rush, with the Bears being in last with only nine sacks. For Chicago, Matt Fort&#233; had gained 533 yards along with averaging 4.6 yards per run, while Josh McCown filled in for Jay Cutler. Since 2009, Bears quarterbacks besides Cutler had thrown a combined eight touchdowns and 21 interceptions against the Packers; in McCown's last start in 2011 against the Packers, he threw for 242 yards, a touchdown and two interceptions in a 35-21 losing effort. On the Packers' first drive, Rodgers failed to recognize the Bears' zone defense, having expected a man-to-man defense, and Shea McClellin escaped Don Barclay's block and, along with Isaiah Frey, pulled Rodgers down, who landed on his shoulder and injured his left collarbone, and was replaced by Seneca Wallace for the remainder of the game. Afterwards, Mason Crosby kicked the 30-yard field goal to give the Packers the lead. On Chicago's first drive, McCown escaped pressure from Mike Neal and threw towards Brandon Marshall for the 7-3 lead. Once the Packers got the ball back, Wallace's pass for Jordy Nelson was tipped and intercepted by Julius Peppers, and was returned 14 yards to Green Bay's 45-yard line, but after the Bears failed to convert on third down, Adam Podlesh's punt was blocked by Jamari Lattimore. Eventually, James Starks ran 32 yards for the touchdown. However, the Bears traveled 60 yards on two plays, and Fort&#233; scored on the 1-yard run. The Bears ended the first half with Robbie Gould's 24-yard field goal to expand the lead to 17-10. In the third quarter, the Packers forced the Bears to punt, and Lacy ran 56 yards to the Bears' 1, and scored on the ensuing play. On the eventual kickoff, the Packers successfully attempted a surprise onside kick, which was recovered by Lattimore. Crosby kicked a 23-yarder on the drive. On the Bears' next drive, McCown threw a six-yard pass to Alshon Jeffery, whose size kept the ball from being knocked away by Davon House. After both teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, on the Bears' next drive, began attempting to run out the clock. On 4th and 1 at the Bears' 32 with 7:50 remaining, Fort&#233; ran three yards for the conversion and continuing the drive, which ended with Gould's 27-yard field goal. The drive lasted 18 plays and took up 8:58, leaving only 50 seconds remaining in the game. Despite a 15-yard pass by Wallace to Nelson, sacks by Corey Wootton and McClellin ended the game with a 27-20 victory for the Bears. McCown ended the night completing 22 of 41 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns, while Wallace completed 11 of 19 for 114 yards and an interception. The win marked the first time the Packers lost at home to an NFC North opponent since 2009, and the first win for the Bears at Lambeau Field since 2007.

In 1988, when Katrina \\"Kat\\" Connors was 17, her beautiful but mercurial mother, Eve, disappeared without a trace. The story weaves back-and-forth with flashbacks of Eve's past life and the present day. In the flashbacks, Eve was a wild girl who gradually changed into a domesticated housewife after marrying Brock, an ordinary man who leads an uneventful life. While Kat explores her blossoming sexuality with her handsome but dim-witted neighbor and schoolmate, Phil, Eve struggles to deal with aging and quenching her youthful wildness. She tries to be sexy when Brock is away, even luring Phil's attention. After Eve disappears, Kat deals with her abandonment without much issue, occasionally releasing her own wild side, seducing the detective investigating her mother's disappearance. The film then jumps forward three years to the spring of 1991. On a break from college, Kat returns home and seems unfazed to learn that her father is in a relationship with a co-worker. The detective Kat has been having an affair with informs her that Brock might have killed Eve after catching her cheating.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While oven cleaner can be effective in getting rid of scorch marks, it should be used as a last resort because it is extremely caustic and may discolor the pan. You should never use it on a pan with a non-stick or other protective coating, though, because it will strip off the coating and ruin the pan. Because oven cleaner has the potential to damage cookware, you should only use it if you’ve tried other methods of cleaning your scorched pan and they’ve failed. If you’re planning to toss the pan anyway, it’s a worth a try to use the oven cleaner. Oven cleaner contains caustic chemicals that give off very strong fumes, so it’s important to take safety precautions before you use it. Cover your hands with a pair of rubber gloves to keep your skin safe from the chemicals. You should also make sure that your kitchen is well-ventilated before spraying the oven cleaner, so open a window or two if possible. If you’re especially sensitive to fumes, you may want to wear a dust mask over your nose and mouth when you’re using the oven cleaner. Be sure to read all of the safety warnings on the oven cleaner’s packaging so you’re aware of any other safety precautions that you should take. Once you’re prepared to work with the oven cleaner, spray it over the scorched areas of the pan. Because the cleaner is so caustic, you don’t want to use any more than is necessary so cover the bottom of the pan with a light layer. You can use a brush to ensure that it’s spread over the entire pan. While spray oven cleaners formulas are usually the most common, you can also find cream and foam formulas that may work better when you’re cleaning a scorched pan. In order for the oven cleaner to fully penetrate the scorched areas and loosen the film and debris, you need to let it sit on the pan for at least a half hour. Because of the fumes, it’s best to place the pan outside while the cleaner on it. Cover the pan with a lid, and set it on a table or ledge outside your home. If you don’t have any area outside that you can set the pan, open a window and set it on the window ledge. After the cleaner has sat on the pan for approximately a half hour, use a scrub brush or sponge to scour the pan. The scorched film and debris should lift right off. Once you’ve cleaned the pan completely, make sure to rinse it extremely well to ensure that there’s no residue from the oven cleaner left on the surface. If you’re concerned about oven cleaner residue being left behind on the pan, wipe it down with a dry towel after you’ve rinsed it initially to see if anything comes off on the towel. You should definitely rinse it again if you notice any film, though you may want to rinse it again even if the pan is clean to be safe. Summary:","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to use oven cleaner as a last resort method for removing scorch marks from a pan, covering important safety and application procedures, highlighting the importance of ventilation, personal safety with gloves and masks, careful application and thorough post-cleaning rinse to ensure no cleaner residue remains."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Article: Everyone knows how the story of Cinderella ends, but did you ever really think about how she spent her days before she met the prince? Her daily routine was not fascinating.She did everything from sweeping the floor to cooking the meals.If someone had asked Cinderella, \\"Are there any kinds of household work that you particularly hate?\\" she probably would have answered, \\"Why, none, of course.Housework is my duty!\\" In the real world, however, most people have definite dislikes for certain sorts of household work.Two of these tasks are ironing clothes and washing dishes. Ironing clothes is most hated because it is not a task that can be completed quickly or thoughtlessly. Each piece of clothing must be handled individually, so ironing a basket of laundry can take hours! After ironing a piece of clothing with great caution, which-requires smoothing out the fabric, and following the seams ,you need to place it on a hanger as soon as possible.If you do not follow these directions carefully, it might become wrinkled and you have to start over.Perhaps that is why ironing is not a favorite thing to do.It calls for extreme attention to detail from beginning to end. Another household job that many people dislike is washing dishes.Of course, some people claim that this work is no longer a problem because we have dishwashers now! However, no one would argue that dishes, silverware, and especially pots and pans washed in a dishwasher don't come out as clean as they do when washed by hand.For this reason, many of us continues to wash our dishes by hand, but we are not necessarily happy doing it.Cleaning dishes is a job that not only takes a lot of energy but also requires the patience to wash and dry them.In addition, unlike ironing clothes, washing dishes is a thing that usually must be done every day.I don't know how Cinderella felt about this particular task, but I believe that most people hate it as much as I do.

Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... Question: When are supplements mainly of assistance to people?

The realization that powerful individuals, such as former presidents like Jacques Chirac, can be held accountable for their actions sends a strong message to other politicians and leaders that nobody is above the law. Legal immunity is often granted to high-ranking officials, particularly during their term in office, to protect them from lawsuits or legal actions related to their duties. However, once an individual leaves office, this immunity may no longer apply, as is the case with Jacques Chirac.

The desert lies at the heart of the Tarim Basin, which stretches for 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) from west to east and 400 kilometers (249 miles) from north to south, making it the largest basin in China. Surrounded by imposing mountain ranges, the Taklamakan Desert is bordered by the Tien Shan mountain range in the north, the Pamir and Karakorum mountains in the west, and the Kunlun Mountains in the south. The desert's name, \\"Taklamakan,\\" is derived from the Uyghur language and is interpreted to mean \\"the desert you enter but never leave\\" or \\"the place of no return,\\" emphasizing its treacherous nature. The desert landscape includes sand dunes that can reach as high as 200 meters (656 feet), rocky terrains, and occasional oasis towns. These towns serve as essential stops along the ancient Silk Road, which splits into two routes circumventing the desert – the northern route that includes cities such as Turpan, Korla, and Kuqa, and the southern route that passes through cities like Hotan, Yarkant, and Kashgar. Amongst these settlements on the fringes of the desert, agriculture, animal husbandry, and trading are the primary sources of livelihood. The climate in the Taklamakan Desert is characterized by extremely arid conditions with very little precipitation, ranging from 0.008 to 0.016 inches (0.2 to 0.4 millimeters) annually. Rainfall is sparse, and the minimal water in the desert is mainly derived from melting snow and ice from the surrounding mountains, forming sporadic rivers that flow into the basin. Temperatures in the desert can plummet to as low as -20°C (-4°F) in the winter months, while summer temperatures can soar up to 38°C (100°F). Due to its colossal size and remote location, the Taklamakan Desert is subjected to fierce windstorms, causing frequent sandstorms and influencing the climate of the entire Tarim Basin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the director's widow, G. G. Sparrow, the main benefactor to the church, believes she should have been given the position. As in previous years, the choir reaches the regional finals of the national amateur \\"Joyful Noise\\" competition, only to be disappointed when a rival choir beats them. Tough times in the town have led to budget problems that threaten to close down the choir, at the same time as the town needs the choir's inspiring music more than ever. Vi Rose has a son, Walter, who has Asperger syndrome, and a talented, pretty and ready-to-date daughter, Olivia. But Olivia is not ready to date under her mother's household rules. G. G. has recently begun caring for her rebellious, drifter grandson, Randy. A romance blossoms between Olivia and Randy, which is strongly opposed by Vi Rose. Olivia also has a rival suitor, Manny. At Randy's urging, G. G., Olivia and most of the choir come to believe that some more contemporary arrangements (prepared by Randy) would be more successful for the choir.

The mood around Independence Square in Ukraine's capital was very somber Sunday as thousands gathered, mourning the dozens of people killed in demonstrations during the past week and wondering who will take charge of the politically divided nation. They wondered where President Viktor Yanukovych, who reportedly tried to leave the country Saturday night, had gone. No one in the government appeared to know. There was a great uncertainty in the country after the rapidly moving events of the past 24 hours, which saw Parliament oust Yanukovych, free his political rival Yulia Tymoshenko from prison and schedule elections for May. It appeared that two political forces were trying to establish control of the country: the opposition and Yanukovych, who maintains that he is still President and still in control despite fleeing to the eastern part of the country. Clearly, though, his power has been greatly diminished. Oleksandr Yefremov, parliamentary leader of Yanukovych's Party of Regions, condemned the ousted President on Sunday in a video statement, blaming him for the \\"robbery and deception\\" of the nation. The former ruling party blamed Yanukovych for illegal orders that led to casualties, financial debt and shame in the eyes of the world, Yefremov said. It also remains to be seen how Russia -- Yanukovych's ally -- will respond with the Winter Olympics in Sochi closing on Sunday. Rapid changes to political scene. Tymoshenko, the former prime minister, was freed after 2Â½ years in prison Saturday and returned to the capital in a development many couldn't have imagined as dawn broke that day. She went to Independence Square and had strong words for Yanukovych. \\"Today, Ukraine has finished with this terrible dictator,\\" Tymoshenko told the cheering crowd. She served as prime minister from 2007 until she was forced out of office in 2010 after losing the election to Yanukovych. A year later, she was sentenced to seven years in prison after being convicted of abuse of authority over a natural gas deal negotiated with Russia. The West considers her case politically motivated and has called her \\"a political prisoner.\\" She is considered a hero of a 2004 revolution that forced the results of a presidential election won by Yanukovych to be thrown out. Where is the Presdent? Last we heard, Yanukovych was in Kharkiv, a pro-Russian stronghold near Ukraine's border with that nation. He tried to leave the country by plane but was turned away, authorities said. The country's acting interior minister said Sunday that government officials in Kiev don't know the whereabouts of Yanukovych and two of his top ministers. On Saturday, the President and his entourage attempted to board a charter flight without proper documentation in the eastern city of Donetsk, according to the head of Ukraine's Border Guard Service, Sergei Astakov. He was on the tarmac when he was turned back by security forces, Astakov said. But the President took to television airwaves, saying he's still the legitimate leader. He said he was forced to leave Kiev because of \\"vandalism, crime and a coup.\\" \\"I don't plan to leave the country. I don't plan to resign. I am the legitimate President,\\" he said from Kharkiv. May elections. Parliament voted to oust the President and hold new elections on May 25. It also appointed Oleksandr Turchinov, the speaker, to take on Yanukovych's duties until then. Lawmakers also fired several ministers, including the foreign and education chiefs. But who will lead the nation is still a big question. Tymoshenko announced Sunday that she doesn't want to be considered for the nomination for prime minister, according to a statement posted on the Batkivshchyna party website. The opposition coalition is a chaotic mix of voices, each working to assert dominance. Former world champion boxer Vitali Klitschko has been the most well-known opposition figure during the crisis. He heads the Ukrainian Democratic Alliance for Reforms party. But the opposition bloc goes well beyond Klitschko and his party. Then there's Arseniy Yatsenyuk, another opposition figure and former foreign minister. Last month, the President offered a package of concessions under which Yatsenyuk would have become the prime minister and Klitschko deputy prime minister on humanitarian issues. The opposition refused. Russia's influence. The series of concessions started Friday with Parliament overwhelmingly approving the return of the nation's 2004 constitution. Reinstating it gives the President less power -- a key demand of protesters who'd taken over Kiev City Hall for weeks -- and paves the way for lawmakers to appoint key ministers. Close ally Russia has been busy hosting the Winter Olympics, which end Sunday. But it's closely linked to the crisis, which started in November, when Yanukovych scrapped a European Union trade deal and turned toward Russia. Russia offered to lend money to Ukraine in a deal worth billions of dollars and lower its gas prices. The deal sent protesters to the streets as Russia pressured Yanukovych to crack down on demonstrators. On Saturday, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations, Vitaly Churkin, condemned what he called Western attempts to influence the outcome of the tumult in Ukraine. \\"Either they don't understand the consequences of what they're doing, or they're engaged in a very provocative game of destabilizing Ukraine and therefore Eastern Europe,\\" Churkin said in a post on his official Twitter account. Churkin has accused the opposition of wanting to take power by force. \\"If those so-called democratic opposition leaders come to power on the shoulders of thugs, that will not produce democracy in Ukraine,\\" he said. On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke about the situation in Ukraine. According to written statement from a senior State Department official, Washington strongly prodded Moscow to accept the results of the Parliament's decisions. Kerry also asked Russia to work with the United States and the European Union on enabling \\"critically needed reforms\\" and to not use military force in the country, which shares a border with western Russia.

CNN's Victoria Butenko, Phil Black and Ingrid Formanek reported from Kiev, and Steve Almasy, Faith Karimi and Chelsea J. Carter reported and wrote from Atlanta. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"In Ukraine's capital city, many people were very sad as they remembered those who had lost their lives during protests. They were also confused about who was in charge of their country. President Viktor Yanukovych had left the city and nobody knew where he was. Some important people were trying to take control, but it wasn't clear what would happen next. Yanukovych's political friend, Yulia Tymoshenko, was let out of prison and she spoke to a big crowd, saying Yanukovych was a bad leader. People didn't know where Yanukovych went but he tried to leave the country and was stopped. He said he's still the President and won't leave. But the Parliament, sort of like a big group of leaders, decided Yanukovych wasn't the President anymore and they planned to have a new election in May. This situation also involves Russia, a big country that is friends with Yanukovych. They had been helping Ukraine with money and some people think they influenced what happened in their country. Now, people from different countries, like the United States and the European Union, are trying to help Ukraine figure out what to do next and make important changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Paragraph: Amid increasing concern over the United States Postal Service’s efficiency leading up to the 2020 U.S. elections, a CBS News host’s tweet warned voters seeking to take part by mail.“USPS says you should give mail in ballots at least 14 days round trip,” Tony Dokoupil wrote on July 26 2020. “No guarantees. So if you plan to vote by mail, election day isn’t November 3rd. It’s October 20th. Or sooner. Don’t be one of the *tens of thousands* of people whose vote wasn’t counted in 2016.”. @USPS says you should give mail in ballots at least 14 days round trip. No guarantees.So if you plan to vote by mail, election day isn’t November 3rd.It’s October 20th.Or sooner.Don’t be one of the *tens of thousands* of people whose vote wasn’t counted in 2016.— Tony Dokoupil (@tonydokoupil) July 24, 2020The postal service has in fact made that statement to not only Dokoupil but other news organizations and reporters; the advisory appeared in a Washington Post story published on July 15 2020:Local elections offices are hiring temporary workers to process absentee ballots, and some local elections boards are adding options for voters to do curbside drop-offs of their mail ballots on Election Day.The Postal Service is also recommending that voters request their ballots at least 15 days before Election Day and mail their completed ballots at least one week before the due date.The advisory was also mentioned in a story republished on news sites for local Fox TV network affiliates on July 27 2020:“We recommend that jurisdictions immediately communicate and advise voters to request ballots at the earliest point allowable but no later than 15 days prior to election date,” USPS told FOX via email. “The Postal Service also recommends that voters contact local election officials for information about deadlines.”Dokoupil himself reported on the potential problem for mail-in ballots in a story for CBS This Morning; CBS created two batches of 100 mock mail-in ballots apiece from around several zip codes in Philadelphia and sent them to the same local P.O. box, which served as a stand-in for an actual election office.A week after sending his mock ballots from mailboxes around the city, Dokoupil went to retrieve them at the P.O. box to find that most of them were not inside. Postal staff later retrieved several of them, telling him that “they had them somewhere else.”However, Dokoupil did note that official mail-in ballots carry an official logo differentiating them from the regular mail CBS used for its reporting. According to the story:Out of the initial batch mailed a week earlier, 97 out of 100 votes had arrived. Three simulated persons, or 3 percent of voters, were effectively disenfranchised by mail by giving their ballots a week to arrive. In a close election, 3 percent could be pivotal.Four days after mailing the second batch of mock ballots, 21 percent of the votes hadn’t arrived.According to Postal Service recommendations, “voters should mail their return ballots at least one week prior to the due date.”However, nearly half of all states still allow voters to request ballots less than a week before the election.A USPS spokesperson, Martha Johnson, told us that the agency is asking both voters and election officials to be mindful of how long it takes postal workers to transport, process and deliver ballots as well as “the time that it takes for voters to consider and prepare their ballots, and the time that it takes for a ballot to be transported, processed, and delivered back to the election official.” The agency’s delivery standards, she said, have not changed. She also reiterated the agency’s guidance for requesting mail-in ballots:We recommend that customers who opt to vote through the U.S. Mail must understand their local jurisdiction’s requirements for timely submission of absentee ballots, including postmarking requirements. Voters must use First-Class Mail or an expedited level of service to return their completed ballots. In order to allow sufficient time for voters to receive, complete and return ballots via the mail, and to facilitate timely receipt of completed ballots by election officials, we strongly recommend that jurisdictions immediately communicate and advise voters to request ballots at the earliest point allowable but no later than 15 days prior to the election date. The Postal Service recommends that domestic, non-military voters mail their completed ballots back to the election officials at least one week prior to their state’s due date. The Postal Service also recommends that voters contact local election officials for information about deadlines.Tammy Patrick, a senior advisor for the advocacy group Democracy Fund, told CBS that her group estimated that between 80 million and 100 million United States voters would receive their ballots via mail in 2020. Prior to joining the non-profit organization, Patrick served on the Commissioner on the Presidential Commission on Election Administration under Barack Obama’s presidential administration.“States like Ohio, you can request your ballot on Saturday up until noon for Tuesday’s election,” said Patrick, who has also served as a former federal compliance officer for the elections department in Maricopa County, Arizona. “That is the worst possible thing. You are setting up the voters with false expectations, and you’re setting them up to fail.”A separate analysis published by NPR in July 2020 found that 65,000 absentee or mail-in ballots cast in primary elections until that point had been rejected because they arrived after the deadline.“That’s the sort of thing that makes me wary about what’s going to happen in November when we get an even larger influx of people who haven’t voted, or haven’t voted by mail in the past,” said Charles Stewart, a political scientist at the at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Obama himself added to the discussion about mail-in voting on July 28 2020, when he tweeted a graphic supplied by another group, Vote Save America, displaying the state-by-state deadlines for requesting a ballot. According to that graphic, the deadline for every state not exclusively voting by mail falls after the fifteen-day advisory issued by the U.S. Postal Service:The USPS told CBS in a statement:We employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail, including ballots. This includes close coordination and partnerships with election officials at the local and state levels. As we anticipate that many voters may choose to use the mail to participate in the upcoming elections due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are conducting and will continue to proactively conduct outreach with state and local election officials and Secretaries of State so that they can make informed decisions and educate the public about what they can expect when using the mail to vote. As part of these outreach efforts, we will discuss our delivery processes and will consult with election officials about how they can design their mailings in a manner that comports with postal regulations, improves mailpiece visibility, and ensures efficient and cost-effective processing and delivery.Dokoupil’s story also followed reported concerns over the appointment of Louis DeJoy — a businessman and fundraiser for U.S. President Donald Trump — to oversee the USPS as Postmaster General in June 2020.“On the surface, there’s a real worry about cronyism and patronage and whether someone is being put into place to carry out an agenda,” American Postal Workers Union president Mark Dimondstein told the Post. “We hope that’s not the case.”The newspaper also reported:DeJoy told employees to leave mail behind at distribution centers if it delayed letter carriers from their routes, according to internal USPS documents obtained by The Washington Post and verified by the American Postal Workers Union and three people with knowledge of their contents, but who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid retribution.“If the plants run late, they will keep the mail for the next day,” according to a document titled, “New PMG’s [Postmaster General’s] expectations and plan.” Traditionally, postal workers are trained not to leave letters behind and to make multiple delivery trips to ensure timely distribution of letters and parcels.Trump himself has repeatedly claimed — falsely — that voting by mail is inherently suspect and vulnerable to fraud, to the point that Twitter flagged two of his tweets on the issue in May 2020 for containing “potentially misleading information.”Update, July 29 2020 9:19 a.m. PST: Updated with comment from the US Postal Service.Comments Claim: The U.S. Postal Service has advised people hoping to vote by mail to request the required envelopes by October 20 2020. Solution:","completion":"The U.S. Postal Service's recommendation to request ballots at least 15 days before Election Day is supported by the fact that they have advised voters to mail their completed ballots at least one week before the due date. This recommendation is further emphasized by their guidance to request ballots at the earliest point allowable, no later than 15 days prior to the election date, as well as contacting local election officials for information about deadlines. Increased concerns regarding mail-in voting efficiency have led to a higher emphasis on timeliness in order to avoid issues as seen in the 2016 elections, where tens of thousands of mail-in votes were not counted. The appointment of Louis DeJoy as Postmaster General in June 2020 and changes to the USPS system in response to the COVID-19 pandemic have also raised concerns about the proper handling of mail-in ballots."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a title for this article: When many of us have a little cash to invest, we might buy a mutual fund or a stock â if we donât blow it on the latest tech gadget. Not the truly wealthy, however. They often put their money in property, art, businesses and other investments that the rest of us can only dream of owning. How this rarified group uses their cash differentiates them from the rest of us â and keeps them in the black. Take Joshua Coleman, for example. When his family sold their Chicago-based telecom company for 400m in 2004, they didnât run out and buy something extravagant. Instead, they began seeking advice on ways to save their newfound riches and help them grow. Their quest sparked an idea for Coleman, now 27. In 2011, he launched Momentum Advanced Planning â a firm that connects people to tax, legal and wealth experts. If the business one day sells, he could see a big return, just like his familyâs first business. If you think that starting a business is an odd way to invest your money, then you probably arenât among the ultra-wealthy. People who have at least 30m in assets â dubbed ultra high net-worth â invest in stocks and bonds, but they also grow their money by buying companies and investing in unusual securities, such as airline leasing funds. They also own art and cars that they hope will appreciate in value. âItâs called alpha risk,â said Coleman. âItâs this kind of stuff where there can be a lot of upside.â As for the downside, many of these investments are riskier than traditional investments, so thereâs a higher chance of losing a large chunk of change. As well, theyâre far less liquid than stocks and it could talk months or years for the wealthy to get their money out of an investment. Even if you donât have millions to invest, though, you can learn a thing or two about how the rich reap returns and apply it your own portfolios.

At the beginning of December 1910 Smoller, using the name Joe Levi, visited Exchange Buildings, a small cul-de-sac that backed onto the properties of Houndsditch. He rented No. 11 Exchange Buildings; a week later Svaars rented number 9 for a month, saying he needed it for storage. The gang were unable to rent number 10, which was directly behind their target, 119 Houndsditch, the jeweller's shop owned by Henry Samuel Harris. The safe in the jeweller's was reputed to contain between £20,000 and £30,000 worth of jewellery; Harris's son later stated the total was only around £7,000. Over the next two weeks the gang brought in various pieces of necessary equipment, including a 60-foot (18.25 m) length of India rubber gas hose, a cylinder of compressed gas and a selection of tools, including diamond-tipped drills.With the exception of Gardstein, the identities of the gang members present in Houndsditch on the night of 16 December 1910 have never been confirmed. Bernard Porter, writing in the Dictionary of National Biography, considers that Sokoloff and Peters were present and, in all likelihood, were two of those who shot the policemen who interrupted their burglary. Porter opines that Peter the Painter was probably not at the property that night, while the journalist J P Eddy suggests that Svaars was among those present. Donald Rumbelow, a former policeman who wrote a history of the events, considers that those present consisted of Gardstein, Smoller, Peters and Dubof, with a second group in case the work needed to continue into the following day, which included among their number Sokolow and Svaars. Rumbelow considers a third group on standby, staying at Hoffman's lodgings, to have comprised Hoffman, Rosen and Osip Federoff, an unemployed locksmith. Rumbelow also considers that present at the events—either as lookouts or in unknown capacities—were Peter the Painter and Nina Vassilleva.On 16 December, working from the small yard behind 11 Exchange Buildings, the gang began to break through the back wall of the...

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Given the following context: Dissatisfied with his first large-scale orchestral work, the D major Overture of 1848, Smetana studied passages from Beethoven, Mendelssohn, Weber and Berlioz before producing his Triumphal Symphony of 1853. Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

Shortly thereafter, he retires from the FBI and attends a family reunion at his father's oceanside home in Aguadilla Bay, Puerto Rico. Tampa crime boss Howard Saint is enraged by the death of his son, and with right-hand man Quentin Glass bribes the FBI for confidential information about \\"Krieg\\". Saint orders Castle murdered, and Saint's wife, Livia, demands Castle's entire family be killed as well to \\"settle the score.\\" At the reunion, gunmen including Glass and John Saint, kill most of the extended family. Castle and his father kill several of the attackers before Castle's father is killed. Castle's wife and son try to escape, but John Saint runs over them with a truck, killing them. Castle, shot in the chest and blown off a pier in an explosion set by Glass, survives and is nursed back to health by a local fisherman, Candelaria. Once recovered, Castle goes to Tampa and takes refuge in an old tenement where three young outcasts â Dave, Bumpo, and Joan â live. Castle abducts Duka, who fearfully gives up information about the Saints â whom he, too, hates, and so willingly becomes Castle's mole. Castle starts exacting revenge on the police and FBI agents who have been bribed to close the investigation of his family's murder. In the process, he sabotages Saint's money-laundering business and severs Saint's partnership with Cuban mobsters the Toro Brothers, and starts tailing Livia and Glass, learning in the process that Glass is a closeted homosexual.

She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: Neill was promoted to lieutenant colonel during his participation in the Siege of Béxar, and 10 days later Houston placed him in charge of the Texian garrison in the city. In January residents had begun evacuating ahead of Santa Anna's approaching forces. Neill pleaded with Houston for replenishment of troops, supplies and weaponry. The departure of Texians who joined the Matamoros Expedition had left Neill with only about 100 men. At that point Houston viewed Béxar as a military liability and did not want Santa Anna's advancing army gaining control of any remaining soldiers or artillery. He dispatched Bowie with instructions to remove the artillery, have the defenders abandon the Alamo mission and destroy it. Upon his January 19 arrival and subsequent discussions with Neill, Bowie decided the mission was the right place to stop the Mexican army in its tracks. He stayed and began to help Neill prepare for the coming attack. Lieutenant Colonel William B. Travis arrived with reinforcements on February 3. When Neill was given leave to attend to family matters on February 11, Travis assumed command of the mission, and three days later he and Bowie agreed to a joint command. Santa Anna crossed the Rio Grande on February 16, and the Mexican army's assault on the Alamo began February 23. Captain Juan Seguín left the mission on February 25, carrying a letter from Travis to Fannin at Goliad requesting more reinforcements. Santa Anna extended an offer of amnesty to Tejanos inside the fortress; a non-combatant survivor, Enrique Esparza, said that most Tejanos left when Bowie advised them to take the offer. In response to Travis' February 24 letter To the People of Texas, 32 militia volunteers formed the Gonzales Ranging Company of Mounted Volunteers and arrived at the Alamo on February 29.

Step 3: Compare remaining choices We are now left with three choices - big town, big city, and fraternity house. Let's analyze each choice: - big town: A big town could potentially have more than one college due to its population and infrastructure. - big city: A big city is more likely to have multiple colleges, as it typically possesses a higher population and more educational opportunities. - fraternity house: A fraternity house generally belongs to a single college. Although it's possible for a fraternity house to be located within an area with multiple colleges, it is not the most representative choice in this context. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate answer Considering the analysis above, we can choose \\"big city\\" as the most appropriate answer, since it is the choice that most likely has multiple colleges. The rationale to choose \\"big city\\" as the answer is that: - A big city has a larger population, resulting in higher demand for educational opportunities, leading to the existence of multiple colleges. - Big cities typically possess better infrastructure, resources, and facilities, making it more feasible to support multiple colleges. - Given the options, big cities are more likely to be hubs for higher education institutions, making it the best choice for finding multiple colleges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? how do you use blush?","completion":"Using blush as a part of your makeup routine can help enhance your natural features, create a healthy appearance, and add warmth to your complexion. It is important to select the right shade of blush and apply it correctly to achieve the desired results. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to use blush: 1. Choose the right shade: When selecting a blush color, consider your skin tone and undertone. Opt for a shade that complements your complexion and appears as a natural flush. For fair skin, choose soft pinks, peaches, or light corals. For medium skin tones, try warmer pinks, mauves, or deeper corals. For darker skin tones, select rich reds, warm browns, or deep berries. 2. Pick the right blush formula: Blush comes in various forms, such as powder, cream, or gel. Powder blush works well with most skin types and is easy to apply. Cream blushes are ideal for those with dry skin, and they create a dewy finish. Gel or liquid blushes work well for oily skin and have a longer-lasting effect. Consider your skin type, desired finish, and comfort when choosing the blush formula. 3. Gather the necessary tools: You will need a blush brush, preferably angled or dome-shaped with soft bristles, for applying your powder blush. For cream or gel blushes, a small stippling brush or your fingers can do the trick. It is essential to keep your brushes clean to ensure a hygienic and smooth application. 4. Prep your face: Start with a clean and moisturized face. Apply your foundation and concealer, and set them using a light layer of translucent powder. This provides a smooth, even base for your blush application. 5. Swirl your brush in the powder blush or dab a small amount of cream or gel blush: For powder blush, gently tap off the excess to avoid over-application. For cream or gel blushes, begin with a small amount and gradually build the intensity as needed. 6. Find the apples of your cheeks: Smile and locate the highest point of your cheeks, also known as the apples. This is the primary area where blush should be applied. 7. Apply the blush: For powder blush, use gentle strokes while starting from the apples of your cheeks and blending back towards the temples, following your cheekbones' natural curve. Focus on blending to create a natural and seamless look. For cream or gel blush, dab small dots along your cheekbones, then blend using either your fingers with a tapping motion, a stippling brush, or a damp makeup sponge. 8. Assess and adjust: Stand back and observe your blush application. If the color is too intense, use a clean, fluffy brush or a makeup sponge to blend and diffuse the color. If you want more intensity, gradually add more blush and blend well. 9. Seal the look with powder (if needed): If you have oily skin or if your blush has a tendency to shift throughout the day, apply a light layer of translucent setting powder over the finished blush application. This will help set your blush and maintain longevity. 10. Coordinate with other makeup: Complete your makeup look by applying complementary eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, and lip color. Your blush should create an overall balanced and harmonious appearance with the rest of your makeup. Remember, practice makes perfect. With time and experience, you will get more comfortable with the blush application process and learn what works best for your unique features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We don't want to compromise the quality of the conference or risk being overwhelmed by a larger audience than we are capable of handling. So, what do you propose in terms of setting a limit? A: I think we should consider the venue size, the number of available seats, and any restrictions imposed by local regulations. Perhaps we can consult with the venue management to determine the best course of action. B: Great idea. I'll get in touch with them and see what they recommend. In the meantime, we can assess the number of people we feel confident in managing based on our staffing and resources.

We've seen countless examples of them from Rihanna, Cara Delevingne, Lady Gaga, Katy Perry . . . and even the Pope. But as these pictures show, supermodel Yasmin Le Bon has added an extra-large helping of glamour to the ‘selfie’ fad – employing a lighting rig, a top-of- the-range camera and all the other trimmings of a fashion shoot – to take the ultimate self-portrait. The selfie – defined as ‘a photograph that one has taken of oneself’ – has taken off to such a degree in 2013 that the term was last week named Word of the Year by the Oxford English Dictionary. Yasmin does the ultimate selfie by styling and taking the photos herself with a professional camera. And as one of most photographed women in the world, Mrs Le Bon, wife of Duran Duran frontman Simon, was clearly determined to go one better than Lady Gaga and Co with her example of how it should be done. With a Vivienne Westwood cape draped around her shoulders in one shot, dramatic make-up and spotlights to accentuate her high cheekbones and seemingly never-ending legs, the 49-year-old still managed to press the button to take selfies that put all other smartphone and tablet efforts to shame. Mrs Le Bon is close friends with Miranda Hart who is the guest editor of the magazine's 200th edition. The supermodel organised the extravagant shoot after being asked to photograph herself by Miranda Hart as part of a feature in a special 200th edition of Stylist magazine, which the comedy star is guest-editing. Mrs Le Bon and Ms Hart are close friends, having attended a number of charity functions in recent years. Other celebrities who helped out for the milestone issue include TV chef Nigella Lawson, artist Tracey Emin and athlete Jessica Ennis-Hill. Last Tuesday ‘selfie’ beat other shortlisted words to become the defining word of 2013. It faced competition from ‘twerk’, the raunchy dance routine performed – to the fury of concerned parents – by singer Miley Cyrus at the MTV video awards in August, and the online-only currency ‘bitcoin’. Others considered by editors included ‘showrooming’, the practice of browsing in shops before leaving and buying the same products online, and ‘binge-watch’, a term used to describe viewing all episodes of a television series in one sitting. Previous winners of the defining word title include ‘chav’ in 2004 and ‘credit-crunch’ in 2008. Richard Holden, editor of Oxford Dictionaries Online explained: ‘Like a lot of words, selfie has got a much longer history than you might imagine. ‘The first evidence we could find of it was from 2002 in an internet forum post in Australia. Someone posted a pictures of themselves after a drunken fall and wrote, “Apologies for the quality, it’s a selfie.” Miranda Hart has roped in 28 famous friends to help her guest edit the latest edition of Stylist Magazine. ‘Although it has been around for a few years in social media, in the past year we have found a 17,000 per cent increase in usage in our monitoring, as it’s gone from being something mainly used in social media to something that hits the mainstream. Word of the Year is not just about pure frequency, it’s about whether it captures something about the year – whether it’s iconic.’ Editors are now considering including ‘selfie’ in the next print edition of the Oxford English Dictionary after adding it to the web version.

Nearby a man named Mark, a thief, escapes from four other thieves. He is planning on heading to London with a bag of gold coins, but for the time being must take refuge in a mansion, looked after by two bisexual chambermaids, Elizabeth and Eva, who are awaiting the arrival of the Marchioness and her servants. The women are not at all scared believing Mark is taking them hostage, in fact, they find him attractive. Elizabeth gets jealous when Eva sleeps with Mark. The thieves wait outside to kill Mark, so Eva goes out to hand over the gold, but while two of them count, the woman takes Eva's dress and the man sleeps with her in the stables, so Eva kills them all. The Marchioness later arrives with her servants and they hold a party in which Mark is the only male, so he gets all the attention. When midnight comes, it is revealed that the women habitually lure people into the castle and drink their blood.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Haiti , officially the Republic of Haiti, is a sovereign state located on the island of Hispaniola in the Greater Antilles archipelago of the Caribbean Sea. It occupies the western three-eighths of the island, which it shares with the Dominican Republic. Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - Sylvain Salnave ( 1827 -- 1870 ) was a mulatto Haitian general . He was the President of Haïti from 1867 to 1869 . In 1867 he was elected president after he led the overthrow of President Fabre Geffrard . During his term there were constant civil wars between the various factions . - Faustin-Élie Soulouque (15 August 1782 6 August 1867) was a career officer and general in the Haitian Army when he was elected President of Haiti in 1847. In 1849 he was proclaimed Emperor of Haiti under the name \\"Faustin I\\". He soon purged the army of the ruling elite, installed black loyalists in administrative positions, and created a secret police and a personal army. In 1849 he created a black nobility in the country. However, his unsuccessful attempts to reconquer the neighbouring Dominican Republic undermined his control and a conspiracy led by General Fabre Nicolas Geffrard forced him to abdicate in 1859. - Guillaume Fabre Nicolas Geffrard (September 19, 1806 December 31, 1878) was a mulatto general in the Haitian army and President of Haiti from 1859 until his deposition in 1867. After collaborating in a coup to remove Faustin Soulouque from power in order to return Haiti back to the social and political control of the colored elite, Geffrard was made president in 1859. To placate the peasants he renewed the practice of selling state-owned lands and ended a schism with the Roman Catholic Church which then took on an important role in improving education. After surviving several rebellions, he was overthrown by Major Sylvain Salnave in 1867. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'position held' with 'president of haiti'.

The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns.

Given the question: Process: - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less receptors use it like a factory happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of fewer receptors using the host cell like a factory does have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. Step 1: Acknowledge the perturbation In the given hypothesis, we have a reduction in the number of receptors using the host cell as a production factory. This means that fewer viral particles are produced actively within infected cells. Step 2: Direct effect of the perturbation on the process Since fewer receptors are using the host cell like a factory, the number of new viral particles produced within the host cell is less. Consequently, the number of infected cells will decrease as there are fewer viral particles available to infect other cells. This leads to a reduction in the overall damage caused by the virus. Step 3: Indirect effects of the perturbation on the process The indirect effect of fewer receptors using the host cell as a factory is that the immune system of the host might respond more efficiently. With a reduced viral load, the immune system has a greater chance of combating the infection before it spreads further. As a result, fewer cells may be damaged overall during the course of the infection. Step 4: Assess the overall impact of the perturbation In summary, the perturbation of fewer receptors using the host cell like a factory results in a decrease in viral particle production, thereby lowering the extent of damage caused to the cells within the body. Additionally, a reduced viral load allows the immune system to respond more effectively, which may further limit cell damage and the infection's severity. Thus, the supposed perturbation does have both direct and indirect effects on the process."},{"prompt":"Teacher:In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

Q:I can use this background: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states. Now, I have a new situation: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city.

Question: Information: - Superleague Formula was an open wheel single seater motor racing formula, which started in 2008, at Donington Park in the United Kingdom. The league introduced team sponsorship by association football clubs. It used the slogan 'The Beautiful Race: Football at 300 km/h'. By 2011 the link with football was fading with more than half the teams no longer associated with football teams. It was founded by businessmen Alex Andreu and Robin Webb. On 19 May 2010, Andreu stepped down in his role as series president, with his successor named as Alfredo Brisac not many weeks later. The season ran between April and November at the same time as most other European race series. Every team used identical cars and 750-horsepower V-12 engines. The Sonangol Group was the series' title sponsor from June 2009 until the end of the 2010 season. - Donington Park is a motorsport circuit located near Castle Donington in Leicestershire, England.

The Xbox One gaming console has received updates from Microsoft since its launch in 2013 that enable it to play select games from its two predecessor consoles, Xbox and Xbox 360. On June 15, 2015, backward compatibility with supported Xbox 360 games became available to eligible Xbox Preview program users with a beta update to the Xbox One system software. The dashboard update containing backward compatibility was released publicly on November 12, 2015. On October 24, 2017, another such update added games from the original Xbox library. The following is a list of all backward compatible games on Xbox One under this functionality.","completion":"Yes, it is indeed true that the Xbox One gaming console has compatibility with certain games from its predecessor, the Xbox 360. Microsoft, the developer of these consoles, has issued updates over the years that allow this inter-generation game playability. The concept employed here is referred to as \\"backward compatibility,\\" which means that newer technology can support and function with older versions of similar technology. For gaming consoles, this means the ability of a newer console to play games designed for its predecessors. According to the text, the first significant date for this feature implementation was on June 15, 2015. Backward compatibility with supported Xbox 360 games was made available to eligible members of the Xbox Preview program when a beta update to the Xbox One system software was released. The Xbox Preview program was a user-centered program where a select group of Xbox One users had the chance to opt-in to preview and provide feedback on new features, improvements, and future updates before they were released to the general public. Therefore, these select users were the first to enjoy playing supported Xbox 360 games on their Xbox One consoles. Then, on November 12, 2015, backward compatibility with Xbox 360 games was released publicly. This implies that all Xbox One owners were able, from this date, to play a selection of Xbox 360 games on their consoles. Further expanding Xbox One's gaming library, on October 24, 2017, another update added games from the original Xbox library. This suggests that on this date, Xbox One gained compatibility with selected games from the first-generation Xbox console, making it a console that supports select games from two generations of predecessors. It's important to note that the phrase \\"select games from its two predecessor consoles\\" indicates that not all games from Xbox 360 (or the original Xbox) can be played on the Xbox One console. Only games for which backward compatibility has been specifically developed and made available through these updates can be played on the Xbox One console. To ascertain whether a specific Xbox 360 game can be played on Xbox One, users would have to refer to the list of all backward compatible games on Xbox One under this functionality. This list would provide them with a comprehensive view of which games from the Xbox 360 (and the original Xbox) have been made playable on the Xbox One."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: If attention isn't paid, the government will continue to spy. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"The premise and hypothesis presented connect the idea that a lack of attention towards governmental monitoring of our data streams may lead to further invasions of privacy. In order to comprehensively analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, it is essential to examine each element of the argument and break down the possible implications and scenarios. First, let's dissect the premise: \\"Attention must be paid lest the government further encroach on the privacy of our data streams.\\" This statement implies that a lack of vigilance or monitoring efforts could result in the government expanding its access to private data. It could encompass various forms of data, such as personal communications, browsing history, financial transactions, among others. This premise calls for an awareness of the risks and potential consequences tied to the invasion of privacy by the government. It suggests that by not addressing this issue, individuals put themselves in a vulnerable position, where their privacy could be compromised. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"If attention isn't paid, the government will continue to spy.\\" This statement proposes that if people do not pay attention to the government's potential overreaching into private data, the government will continue to surveil, monitor, and access the personal information of individuals without consequences. The hypothesis asserts a rather deterministic outcome, implying that government monitoring will persist if the issue is not addressed. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must consider the logical connection between the two. The primary link between the premise and the hypothesis is the idea of attention or awareness of the problem: with the premise emphasizing the necessity of attention to prevent further governmental encroachment, and the hypothesis suggesting that it will continue if the issue remains unaddressed. Consequently, the natural corollary would be that paying attention is critical to putting a halt to the unwanted invasion of privacy. However, it is worth noting that the premise alone does not guarantee the government will stop encroaching on privacy. It may only create resistance or spark a discussion regarding the issue. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis suggests that if awareness is raised and the societal concern is voiced, it may increase the likelihood of impeding government monitoring. In conclusion, the premise and the hypothesis are related but not completely inseparable. While the premise calls for attention to be paid to thwart the extension of government surveillance, the hypothesis suggests that governmental spying will persist if the matter remains ignored. Thus, it can be inferred that the premise entails the hypothesis to an extent, with the logical connection between the two emphasizing the need for vigilance and awareness in order to confront the issue of encroachment on privacy by the government and potentially hinder further invasions. Nonetheless, the premise by itself does not provide any guarantees, and a more comprehensive approach to curbing the invasive tendencies of the government should involve not just attention but also decisive actions by citizens and legislative efforts to create protective boundaries for personal data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Skyline lofts is a great building with some cool features; however, the management of the complex is unprofessional in their business tactics. I greatly enjoyed the complex under Mark Taylor, but as soon as Weidner Properties took over the building, the professionalism of Mark Taylor went out the door. It took days to get items fixed while living there; however, it took them no time to do an invasive walk through the week before we moved from the complex. In the walk through, the managing director told us that the paint was not the special order paint they use to paint and therefore they would be charging us to repaint the moonlight white with the \\"Weidner\\" moonlight white color. They offered to sell us the paint and we could paint it to cut costs, which I jumped at. For a second time in a week I repainted the rooms and hall to their specifications with three coats only to then again be charged an additional 200 at move out for painting. In addition, the complex will charge you tax, administration fees, and cleaning costs that are more expensive than the professional maid services we have always used. These charges are present no matter how much you leave the property in good condition. To prevent you from contesting the charges, they give you 10 days to pay the charges or they send it to collections, even though the mailed letter with the charges took 4 to 5 business days to reach me through standard mail. The short payment time is unprofessionally done purposely to prevent you from contesting these fees. In other words, your money will not go far will living here with the service you get, but complex management will do everything they can to nickel and dime you when they get the chance. With the recent expansion, growth, and other options in downtown Phoenix, I seriously recommend looking at other complexes until Weidner reevaluates how they run their properties. Hope this helps those looking into Skyline Lofts. Is this review positive or negative? Available choices: 1). negative. 2). positive. Answer:","completion":"1). negative. This review is negative because the person is complaining about the unprofessional management of the complex, issues with getting items fixed, being charged for unnecessary things, and being forced to pay extra fees without much time to contest them.

Mideast peace talks stir hope but few illusions Direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians broke down in December 2008, shortly before Israel launched an offensive against Hamas in Gaza. Israel said it was responding to shelling from Hamas militants in Gaza. The offensive killed between 1,100 and 1,400 Palestinians, according to various reports. Palestinian health officials said the dead were mostly civilians; the Israeli military said they were mostly combatants. Thirteen Israelis also were killed in the three-week armed conflict. Why the talks might work: Meeting points to progress A move to direct talks has to be a positive development whichever way you look at it. During his election campaign, Obama said he would deal with the issue from Day One of his presidency. On his third day in office, Obama appointed former Sen. George Mitchell as his envoy to try to bring the two sides closer.

Drawing from such concepts as the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European, linguists[who?] developed a theory that the modern Western languages were actually dialects of a hidden or latent language.[citation needed] Researchers at the International Auxiliary Language Association extracted words and affixes that they considered to be part of Interlingua's vocabulary. In theory, speakers of the Western languages would understand written or spoken Interlingua immediately, without prior study, since their own languages were its dialects. This has often turned out to be true, especially, but not solely, for speakers of the Romance languages and educated speakers of English. Interlingua has also been found to assist in the learning of other languages. In one study, Swedish high school students learning Interlingua were able to translate passages from Spanish, Portuguese, and Italian that students of those languages found too difficult to understand. It should be noted, however, that the vocabulary of Interlingua extends beyond the Western language families. What is the answer to this question: Along with Standard Average European, from what concept was Interlingua derived?","completion":"Interlingua was derived from two main concepts: the international scientific vocabulary and Standard Average European. The international scientific vocabulary provided a significant source for technical and scientific terms, which are commonly shared among Western languages, while Standard Average European supplied the linguistic framework for the creation of Interlingua.

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"vibrating matter can cause music through what?\\" is \\"absence\\", given that vibrating matter can cause music through energy? Answer:","completion":"No, the right answer to the question \\"vibrating matter can cause music through what?\\" is not \\"absence.\\" This is due to the fact that music is created by the vibrations of matter, but these vibrations need to be conveyed through a medium, and this medium is typically the air. Vibrations themselves are a form of energy, so it could be said that vibrating matter can cause music through energy, but this is really just restating the same concept in different words. The vibrating matter's energy causes the air molecules to vibrate and these vibrations move as waves through the air until they reach our ears. Once in our ears, these vibrations are converted back into electrical signals that our brains interpret as sound or music. Therefore, a more accurate answer to the question would be \\"Vibrating matter can cause music through the medium of air (or any other material medium), by transmitting the energy of the vibrations as sound waves.\\" Absence is not a correct answer because without a medium to transfer the energy of the vibrations, we will not hear the resulting sound or music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bermuda and Newfoundland were not originally included in the agreement, but both were added to it, with no war material received by the UK in exchange.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? the humanity of its people","completion":"The phrase \\"the humanity of its people\\" can be considered both positive and negative, depending on the context it is being used in. The meaning of the phrase lies in how it is intended, the tone of the sentence, and the overall message being conveyed. On the positive side, the phrase can be perceived as a celebration of the inherent goodness and compassion of people. In this context, humanity implies the inherent qualities that make us human, which include empathy, kindness, and understanding. When used to highlight these virtues, the phrase conveys an appreciation of the admirable characteristics of people that contribute to their ability to connect with others emotionally, demonstrate compassion, and create an inclusive environment. For instance, when people work together to provide support during a tragedy or a natural disaster, you might say that the humanity of the people was touching and uplifting, which is a positive reflection of their actions and character. At the same time, the phrase can also be used in a negative sense, referring to the dark and destructive aspects of human nature. In this context, humanity may emphasize the inherent flaws that exist within people, such as selfishness, greed, and the capacity for cruelty. Consequently, the phrase could point towards the unfortunate but undeniable truth that people are capable of enacting violence or causing suffering. For example, you might say that \\"the humanity of its people\\" was evident in a situation where individuals showed an appalling lack of empathy or engaged in cruel acts that harmed others. Here, the phrase casts light on the negative aspects of human nature, which can potentially lead to unfortunate outcomes. In conclusion, the phrase \\"the humanity of its people\\" is neither inherently positive nor negative. It is open to interpretation based on the context in which it is used, the intended meaning, and the tone or purpose of the sentence. Both positivity and negativity can be derived from its usage, with the potential to emphasize the best or worst of human nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Which fictional ‘super heroine’ is the alter-ego of Barbara Gordon?","completion":"The fictional 'super heroine' who is the alter-ego of Barbara Gordon is Batgirl. Batgirl is a character from the DC Comics Universe and was first introduced in Detective Comics #359 in 1967. Barbara Gordon, the daughter of Gotham City Police Commissioner James Gordon, was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino. She becomes Batgirl to fight crime and injustice alongside Batman and Robin, establishing herself as a prominent female figure within the comic book world. Barbara Gordon's journey to becoming Batgirl is quite interesting. She originally donned the Batgirl costume as a mere way to attend a costume party. However, on her way to the event, she ends up saving the life of billionaire Bruce Wayne (Batman's alter-ego) from the villainous Killer Moth. Taking inspiration from Batman and the impact she made in saving Wayne, Barbara decides to continue her crime-fighting journey as Batgirl. Batgirl has a strong background in martial arts, acrobatics, and detective work, making her a formidable superheroine. As the daughter of a police commissioner, she possesses insight into law enforcement and police procedures. Moreover, Barbara Gordon is highly skilled in hand-to-hand combat and is an expert markswoman. She utilizes various Bat-themed gadgets, such as a custom utility belt, as well as a specialized motorcycle known as the Batcycle. Batgirl had her own struggles and challenges throughout her crime-fighting career. One significant and controversial moment was in the notorious 1988 graphic novel \\"The Killing Joke\\" by Alan Moore and Brian Bolland. In the story, she is brutally attacked and paralyzed by the Joker, forcing her to abandon her Batgirl persona. Nevertheless, this personal tragedy leads her to create a new identity as Oracle, a computer expert and information broker who aids superheroes worldwide. As Oracle, Barbara Gordon plays a vital role in providing intelligence, tactical guidance, and logistical support to Batman and his allies. She also forms and leads the superhero team Birds of Prey, which features other female heroes like Black Canary and Huntress. Throughout the years, DC Comics has introduced various other characters who have taken on the Batgirl mantle. These characters include Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown. Additionally, there have been different interpretations of Batgirl in other media forms such as television series, animated shows, and movies. One notable portrayal is by actress Yvonne Craig in the popular 1960s Batman TV series. In conclusion, Batgirl is a well-established and iconic character in the DC Comics Universe. The character's evolution, resilience, and commitment to fighting crime continue to inspire fans and readers worldwide. Barbara Gordon's journey from Batgirl to Oracle and the various personas that have taken up her mantle demonstrate the power and importance of female superheroes in the comic book landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Many years ago in a small German town, a Jewish businessman had the misfortune of owing a large sum of money to the moneylender. The moneylender, who was old and ugly, fancied the businessman's beautiful daughter. So he proposed a bargain. The moneylender told them that he would put a black pebble and a white pebble into an empty bag. The girl would then have to pick one pebble from the bag. If she picked the black pebble, she would become the moneylender's wife and he would _ her father's debt. If she picked the white pebble, she need not marry him and her father's debt would still be forgiven. But if she refused to pick a pebble, her father would be thrown into jail. They were standing on a pebble-strewn path. As they talked, the moneylender bent over to pick up two pebbles. The sharp-eyed girl noticed that he had picked up two black pebbles and put them into the bag. He then asked the girl to pick a pebble from the bag. No doubt she was caught in a dilemma. What would you have done if you were the girl? Careful analysis would produce three possibilities: 1.The girl should refuse to take a pebble. 2.The girl should know that there were two black pebbles in the bag and expose the money-lender as a cheat. 3.The girl should pick a black pebble and sacrifice herself in order to save her father from his debt and imprisonment.

Answer the following question: Information: - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world. - Turkey, officially the Republic of Turkey (Turkish: ), is a transcontinental country in Eurasia, mainly in Anatolia in Western Asia, with a smaller portion on the Balkan peninsula in Southeast Europe. Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Lucius Licinius Lucullus (118 57/56 BC) was an \\"optimate\\" politician of the late Roman Republic, closely connected with Lucius Cornelius Sulla. In the culmination of over twenty years of almost continuous military and government service, he became the main conqueror of the eastern kingdoms in the course of the Third Mithridatic War, exhibiting extraordinary generalship in diverse situations, most famously during the siege of Cyzicus, 73-72 BC, and at the Battle of Tigranocerta in Armenian Arzanene, 69 BC. His command style received unusually favourable attention from ancient military experts, and his campaigns appear to have been studied as examples of skillful generalship. - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - There were three Mithridatic Wars between Rome and the Kingdom of Pontus in the 1st century BC. They are named for Mithridates VI who was King of Pontus at the time. - The Kingdom of Pontus or Pontic Empire was a state founded by the Persian Mithridatic dynasty, which may have been directly related to Darius the Great and the Achaemenid dynasty. The kingdom was proclaimed by Mithridates I in 281BCE and lasted until its conquest by the Roman Republic in 63BCE. It reached its largest extent under Mithridates VI the Great, who conquered Colchis, Cappadocia, Bithynia, the Greek colonies of the Tauric Chersonesos, and for a brief time the Roman province of Asia. After a long struggle with Rome in the Mithridatic Wars, Pontus was defeated; part of it was incorporated into the Roman Republic as the province Bithynia et Pontus, and the eastern half survived as a client kingdom. - Mithra (\\"Mira\\", \\"Miça\\") is the Zoroastrian angelic Divinity (\\"yazata\\") of Covenant and Oath. In addition to being the Divinity of Contracts, Mithra is also a judicial figure, an all-seeing Protector of Truth, and the Guardian of Cattle, the Harvest and of The Waters. - Hegemony (or , or \\"leadership, rule\\") is the political, economic, or military predominance or control of one state over others. In ancient Greece (8th century BCE 6th century CE), \\"hegemony\\" denoted the politicomilitary dominance of a city-state over other city-states. The dominant state is known as the \\"hegemon\\". - The Roman Kingdom was the period of the ancient Roman civilization characterized by a monarchical form of government of the city of Rome and its territories. - A consul was the highest elected political office of the Roman Republic, and the consulship was considered the highest level of the \\"cursus honorum\\" (the sequential order of public offices through which aspiring politicians sought to ascend). - Lucius Licinius Murena was Roman consul in 62 BC. His father had the same name. - Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus (29 September 106 BC 28 September 48 BC), usually known in English as Pompey or Pompey the Great, was a military and political leader of the late Roman Republic. He came from a wealthy Italian provincial background, and his father had been the first to establish the family among the Roman nobility. Pompey's immense success as a general while still very young enabled him to advance directly to his first consulship without meeting the normal requirements for office. His success as a military commander in Sulla's Second Civil War resulted in Sulla bestowing the nickname \\"Magnus\\", \\"the Great\\", upon him. He was consul three times and celebrated three triumphs. - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek: , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic. - The Second Mithridatic War ( 83 -- 81 BC ) was one of three wars fought between Pontus and the Roman Republic . The second Mithridatic war was fought between King Mithridates VI of Pontus and the Roman general Lucius Licinius Murena . At the conclusion of the First Mithridatic War , Sulla had come to a hasty agreement with Mithridates that allowed the latter to remain in control of his Kingdom of Pontus , but relinquishing his claim to Asia Minor and respecting pre-war borders . Murena , as Sulla 's legate , was stationed in Asia as commander of the two legions formerly under the command of Gaius Flavius Fimbria . Murena invaded Pontus on his own authority claiming that Mithridates was re-arming and posed a direct threat to Roman Asia Minor . After several inconclusive skirmishes , Mithridates inflicted a minor defeat on Murena and forced his withdrawal from Pontus . Peace was restored on the orders of Sulla . This was followed by the Third Mithridatic War . - Mithridates VI or Mithradates VI, from Old Persian \\"Miradta\\", \\"gift of Mithra\\"; 13563 BC, also known as Mithradates the Great (Megas) and Eupator Dionysius, was king of Pontus and Armenia Minor in northern Anatolia (now Turkey) from about 12063 BC. Mithridates is remembered as one of the Roman Republics most formidable and successful enemies, who engaged three of the prominent generals from the late Roman Republic in the Mithridatic Wars: Lucius Cornelius Sulla, Lucius Licinius Lucullus and Gnaeus Pompey Magnus. He is often considered the greatest ruler of the Kingdom of Pontus. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'instance of' with 'conflict'.

I'd like to know about Kyrgyzstan please It is a landlocked country in central Asia. Eighty percent of the country is located within the Tian Shan mountain chain. Four percent of that area is permanently covered with ice and snow. What can you tell me about their climate action? The mountains of course are a big factor in their climate. There are glaciers there. They were being monitored but operations ended in the early 1990's with the collapse of the USSR. Wow anything else on climate? Over the last five decades, there has been more mass loss in the glaciers than mass gain. Hydro power is used there but output is expected to decrease because climate change projections suggest that water flow will be reduced beginning in 2030 which will cause energy supply problems.

In this dialogue, your task is to find the geographical or critical location that holds the most importance or was the most discussed during the conversation. Let's follow these simple steps: 1. Read the dialogue carefully, understanding the context and content of the discussion. 2. Find any mention of specific places or locations within the conversation. 3. Determine the importance of each mentioned location based on how central it is to the discussion. By following these steps, you navigate through the dialogue. Looking at the dialogue, we can see two locations mentioned directly, \\"Kyrgyzstan\\" and \\"Bishkek,\\" the country's capital. Analyzing the dialogue's context, Kyrgyzstan is the place mostly addressed, including discussions about its geographical features, climate change effects, and also partial information on its education system. Bishkek is mentioned, but its significance in the conversation seems lesser.

Mary drops out of college (with 6 months to go) to marry Fred. Their perfect wedding mirrors the happy endings of the films Mary loves. 1969: It is the Wilsons' 16th wedding anniversary. On his way to work, Fred, a successful tax consultant, tells their maid Agnes that he has found vodka hidden in Mary's wardrobe and asks Agnes to keep an eye on his wife. Mary sets out for the beauty parlour. At an airline office, however, Mary buys a one-way ticket to Nassau, Bahamas looking for an escape from her dull and unhappy suburban life. On the flight she recalls the horrors of last year's anniversary party, when Fred had drunkenly flirted with a blond divorcee, and she had taken refuge in the bottle and a rerun of Casablanca. At a stop-over, she calls home and learns this year's anniversary party has been a different sort of disaster. Her teenage daughter Marge is scared by Mary's call, as it reminds her of the time she had found her mother unconscious after an overdose. En route to Nassau, Mary meets Flo, an old college friend she has not seen since 1953. While Mary settled down to married life, Flo has been the mistress of a series of married men and lives a rather carefree and hedonistic lifestyle and has fully embraced the sexual revolution.

Earth’s atmosphere exerts pressure because gravity acts on the huge number of gas particles contained in the atmosphere, holding it in place. Pressure is also exerted by a small sample of gas, such as that which is contained in a balloon. Gas pressure is the pressure that results from collisions of gas particles with an object. Inside the balloon, the gas particles collide with the balloon’s inner walls. It is those collisions which keep the balloon inflated. If the gas particles were to suddenly stop moving, the balloon would instantly deflate. The Figure below is an illustration of gas particles exerting pressure inside a container.

Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose it is not as cool happens, how will it affect a thundercloud will be larger. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If we consider the perturbation hypothesis and assume that the temperature inside the cloud remains warmer than expected, thus preventing ice from forming, the effect on the formation of a thundercloud will likely be significant. I will analyze this step-by-step. 1. Ice fails to form inside the cloud (due to the warmer temperature): In this case, the process of generating electrostatic charges within the cloud due to the movement of ice particles would be disrupted. 2. Insufficient electrostatic charges: Without ice particles bumping around and generating electrostatic charges, the cloud might not acquire enough charge to transform into a thundercloud. 3. Limited formation of thunderclouds: As a result of insufficient electrostatic charges, there may be fewer thunderclouds or weaker ones with reduced charge accumulation. 4. Weaker electrostatic energy buildup: A smaller or weaker thundercloud will likely experience a weaker electrostatic energy buildup, which impacts the formation of strong negative charges. 5. Reduced positive energy attraction: With weaker negative charges within the cloud, positive energy on the ground might not be as strongly attracted. 6. Difficulty in forming lightning: If positive energy from the ground connects to the weaker negative energy within the cloud, there may be a decrease in the likelihood of lightning formation, or potentially weaker lightning events. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis would likely have a significant, indirect effect on the process of forming a thundercloud and, subsequently, lightning. The inability to form ice within the cloud would disrupt the entire process, potentially resulting in weaker or fewer thunderclouds and lightning events."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

This means that the country's political framework is primarily based on the principles of democracy, with the government being elected by the people through regular, free, and fair elections. The Canadian government is divided into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The executive branch consists of the monarch (currently Queen Elizabeth II), represented by the Governor General at the federal level, and by Lieutenant Governors at the provincial level. The Prime Minister, who is the head of government, leads the ruling party or coalition and is responsible for the day-to-day governance of the country. The legislative branch includes the Parliament of Canada, which is a bicameral institution composed of the House of Commons and the Senate. The House of Commons consists of 338 members, known as Members of Parliament (MPs), who are elected by citizens in their respective constituencies, while the Senate currently has 105 appointed members who are chosen by the Prime Minister. Canada's political landscape at the federal level is characterized by a multi-party system, with the major parties being the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, and the New Democratic Party (NDP). There are also smaller parties such as the Bloc Québécois and the Green Party of Canada, which focus on regional or environmental issues. The judicial branch is independent of the other branches, and it is responsible for interpreting and upholding Canadian laws and the Constitution. The Supreme Court of Canada is the highest court in the country, led by nine judges appointed by the Governor General on the recommendation of the Prime Minister. Additionally, Canada is a federal state, which means that the powers and responsibilities are divided between the central (federal) government and the provincial and territorial governments. Each province and territory has its own government, led by a Premier and consisting of a legislative assembly or legislature. These governments are responsible for matters such as education, health care, and natural resource management, while the federal government is in charge of matters such as national defense, foreign policy, and monetary policy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: a plate of fruits and a crepe on a white dish","completion":"To fully comprehend and analyze the importance of words in a sentence, one must understand the context, the details, and the subject matter. However, irrespective of context, the important words in the sentence, \\"a plate of fruits and a crepe on a white dish,\\" can be deduced as: 1. \\"Plate\\" - This word suggests that the items subsequent to it—fruits and a crepe—are gathered on it. It indicates the platform holding these components. 2. \\"Fruits\\" - This is the first element mentioned on the plate, making it a significant part of the sentence. 3. \\"Crepe\\" - The crepe is the second component sitting on the plate alongside the fruits. This term is significant since it, along with the fruits, forms the core element on the plate. 4. \\"White Dish\\" - This refers to the setting in which the plate sits. It's relevant because it portrays the hue and possibly the design of the dish that contains the plate of fruits and a crepe. In summary, the importance of the words mainly relies on the elements within the sentence that provide essential information. The most meaningful nouns here are the items that are on the plate— \\"fruits\\" and \\"crepe\\". These words describe what's on the plate, which is the main focus of the sentence. The words \\"plate\\" and \\"white dish\\" still serve significance as they detail the scene and setting.

If you're always walking around the halls by yourself, dreading your next class, or frowning all the way through gym class, you won’t make a good impression and people will think that it’s a drag to be around you. The secret to making people want to be around you is to let them see you laughing and having a great time so they want to spend time with you too. When you’re hanging out with friends, make an extra effort and smile and have fun so people know you enjoy your time in school. Even when you're alone in the halls, smile at people and give off a positive vibe so that people want to get to know you. d reason. Having a pink mohawk or showing up to school in only your bathing suit will certainly make you stand out, but that may not be the kind of attention you want. To stand out in a good way, you have to let people know who you are and think positively of you when your name does come up. Here are some ways to get noticed: You could be the guy who is always spotted with a guitar – and who actually knows how to play it. You could have a really great laugh that people can hear from anywhere in the building. You could stand out for your knockout sense of fashion. You could also rock a unique style, like looking like a hipster chick or a rocker guy, so that everyone knows who you are. Maybe you have a really low, throaty voice that sounds completely unique. Whatever your quirks are, don't try to hide them. Remember that you want to be noticed for what makes you special. Joining a team and playing a sport is not only a great way to get some exercise and feel happier, but it’s also an excellent way to meet new people and make yourself known. You don’t have to be the star of your soccer team to play the sport, just have fun and get a great workout after school. Whether your school has a team or you’re playing an intramural league, make an effort to play at least one sport so you’ll be more likely to meet a variety of interesting people. You may not end up liking the sport or sticking to it. But if you spend at least a year of middle school pursuing a sport, you’ll be more likely to make friends and open up your social circle. Playing a sport also teaches you teamwork and how to deal with a variety of different talents and personalities, which can also help you manage people in your daily life and gain the skills that can help you become more popular.

Become a leader in the club and use your position to improve the club and to get to know a wide variety of people. Don’t think it’s uncool or nerdy to join a club. You’re just getting a leg up on the people who will be joining clubs in high school when they realize it is cool to be involved. Joining a club and playing a sport, if you have time for it, will be a great way to meet an even larger variety of people. You may not meet the same people in clubs that you’ll meet on your sports team. The more things you do, the more people you know. And the more people you know, the more likely you are to get noticed and for people not to have a blank look on their faces when your name comes up. You should play soccer, be in the drama club, and be a student aide in the library – do whatever you find interesting and use your position to meet new people. If you only pursue one interest, you’ll only be surrounded by one type of person. The key to truly being popular is being able to please a variety of different people. You may think it’s not cool to participate or even talk at all in class, and that you’re better off hanging out in the back of the room, looking like you have something better to do. Instead, you should participate in class, and do your homework so you actually look like you know what you’re talking about. You don’t have to be the teacher’s pet or anything, but you should talk enough so that all of the students in the class know who you are and like what you’re saying.

Information: - Toulouse is the capital city of the southwestern French department of Haute-Garonne, as well as of the Occitanie region. The city lies on the banks of the River Garonne, from the Mediterranean Sea, from the Atlantic Ocean, and from Paris. It is the fourth-largest city in France with 466,297 inhabitants in January 2014. The Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux. - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France. - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \\"cult\\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \\"ad hominem\\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations. It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775. - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands. The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about . - French Guiana (pronounced or ), officially called Guiana, is an overseas department and region of France, located on the north Atlantic coast of South America in the Guyanas. It borders Brazil to the east and south, and Suriname to the west. Its area has a very low population density of only 3 inhabitants per km, with half of its 244,118 inhabitants in 2013 living in the metropolitan area of Cayenne, its capital. By land area, it is the second largest region of France and the largest outermost region within the European Union. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Genocide is intentional action to destroy a people (usually defined as an ethnic, national, racial, or religious group) in whole or in part. The hybrid word \\"genocide\\" is a combination of the Greek word \\"génos\\" (\\"race, people\\") and the Latin suffix \\"-cide\\" (\\"act of killing\\"). The United Nations Genocide Convention defines genocide as \\"acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group\\". - Nice (; Niçard , classical norm, or \\"\\", nonstandard, ) is the fifth most populous city in France and the capital of the Alpes-Maritimes \\"département\\".

It comprised delegates appointed by the legislatures or assemblies of the several states. It was preceded by the Second Continental Congress (17751781) and governed under the newly adopted \\"Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union\\", which were proposed 17761777, adopted by the Continental Congress in July 1778 and finally agreed to by a unanimous vote of all thirteen states by 1781, held up by a long dispute over the cession of western territories beyond the Appalachian Mountains to the central government led by Maryland and a coalition of smaller states without western claims. The newly reorganized Congress at the time continued to refer itself as the Continental Congress throughout its eight-year history, although modern historians separate it from the earlier bodies, which operated under slightly different rules and procedures until the later part of American Revolutionary War. The membership of the Second Continental Congress automatically carried over to the Congress of the Confederation when the latter was created by the ratification of the Articles of Confederation. It had the same secretary as the Second Continental Congress, namely Charles Thomson. The Congress of the Confederation was succeeded by the Congress of the United States as provided for in the Constitution of the United States, proposed September 17, 1787, in Philadelphia and ratified by the states through 1787 to 1788 and even into 1789 and 1790. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about .

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict. - The Continental Army was formed by the Second Continental Congress after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War by the colonies that became the United States of America. Established by a resolution of the Congress on June 14, 1775, it was created to coordinate the military efforts of the Thirteen Colonies in their revolt against the rule of Great Britain. The Continental Army was supplemented by local militias and troops that remained under control of the individual states or were otherwise independent. General George Washington was the commander-in-chief of the army throughout the war. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing. - Lyon or (more archaically) Lyons (or ) is a city in east-central France, in the Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region, about from Paris and from Marseille.

The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre.

Though this is dismissed by Rosa Newmarch as \\"an epithalamium for a Habsburg Prince\\", Smetana's biographer Brian Large identifies much in the piece that characterises the composer's more mature works. Despite the symphony's rejection by the Court and the lukewarm reception on its premiere, Smetana did not abandon the work. It was well received in Gothenburg in 1860, and a revised version was performed in Prague in 1882, without the \\"triumphal\\" tag, under Adolf Čech. The piece is now sometimes called the Festive Symphony. Smetana's visit to Liszt at Weimar in the summer of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a material reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than by simple musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (Richard III, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts. From 1862 Smetana was largely occupied with opera and, apart from a few short pieces, did not return to purely orchestral music before beginning Má vlast in 1872. In his introduction to the Collected Edition Score, František Bartol brackets Má vlast with the opera Libuše as \\"direct symbols of [the] consummating national struggle\\". Má vlast is the first of Smetana's mature large-scale works that is independent of words, and its musical ideas are bolder than anything he had tried before.

They found that almost all of the categories showed a drop in these \\"mood words\\" over time.Only in the category of fear was there an increase in usage. \\"It is a steady and continuous decrease,\\" said Dr Alberto Acerbi.He assumed that the result might be explained by a change in the position occupied by literature, in a crowded media landscape.\\"One thing could be that in parallel to books the 20th century saw the start of other media.Maybe these media -- movies, radio, drama, had more emotional content than books.\\" Although both joy and sadness followed the general downwards trend, the research, published in the journal PLOS One, found that they also exhibited another interesting behaviour:the ratio between the two varied greatly, apparently mirroring historical events. During the Roaring Twenties the joy-to-sadness ratio reached a peak that would not occur again until before the recent financial crash.But the ratio plunged at the height of the Second World War.Nevertheless, the researchers held a reserved opinion about their claim that their result reflected wider social trends.In the paper, they even argue that the reverse could be true. \\"It has been suggested, for example, that it was the suppression of desire in ordinary Elizabethan English life that increased demand for writing 'filled with romance and sex'... perhaps,\\" they conclude, \\"songs and books may not reflect the real population any more than catwalk models reflect the average body.\\" Question: A study of more than five million books indicated a decrease in \\"mood words\\" over time except _ .

With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs. The band made its first appearance on national television during the tour when they were featured on Late Night with Conan O'Brien.

Question: Who finds the basket set adrift on the Nile by Yoshebel? Movie title: The Ten Commandments Movie plot: Despite its epic scale, the Moses story takes up only about the first third of the film. After that, the story changes to a modern setting involving living by the lessons of the commandments. Two brothers make opposite decisions, one, John, to follow his mother's teaching of the Ten Commandments and become a poor carpenter, and the other, Danny, to break every one of them and rise to the top. The film shows his unchecked immorality to be momentarily gainful, but ultimately disastrous. A thoughtful contrast is made between the carpenter brother and his mother. The mother reads the story of Moses and emphasizes strict obedience and fear of God. The carpenter, however, reads from the New Testament story of Jesus's healing of lepers. His emphasis is on a loving and forgiving God. The film also shows the mother's strict lawful morality to be flawed in comparison to her son's version. Danny becomes a corrupt contractor who builds a church with shoddy concrete, pocketing the money saved and becoming very rich. One day, his mother comes to visit him at his work site, but the walls are becoming unstable due to the shaking of heavy trucks on nearby roads. One of the walls collapses on top of the mother, killing her. In her dying breath, she tells Danny that it is her fault for teaching him to fear God, when she should have taught him love. This sends Danny on a downward spiral as he attempts to right his wrongs and clear his conscience, but he only gets into more trouble. To make money, he steals pearls from his mistress, and when she fights back, he kills her. He attempts to flee to Mexico on a motorboat, but rough weather sends him off course and he crashes into a rocky island, where he is presumably killed. Throughout the film, the visual motif of the tablets of the commandments appears in the sets, with a particular commandment appearing on them when it is relevant to the story.

And, in exchange, you could have a cheap vacation anywhere in the world. Just picture the scene: you're watching the sunset from the balcony of a Caribbean island house. It's large. And it's free as long as you don't mind the owners living in your home at the same time. All you need to be a home-swapper is the Internet and a rough idea of when and where you want to go on holiday. When you find someone whose dates match yours, and who wants to visit your area, you're all set to swap. The advantages are numerous: you can save a fortune in accommodation cost. You could get to use the owners' car, boat, bikes, pool or gym. You might even be able to come to an arrangement about looking after each other's pets! You also get to live like a local, and you might be invited around to neighbors' homes for tea, barbecues and tips on the area. People say that these cultural experiences are the memories that last. Plus, instead of one tiny hotel room, you have an entire house where you can make yourself at home. And it's not cold and impersonal like a hotel room. Of course, there are disadvantages. A lot of effort and communication are needed before the arrangements are finalized. Nobody wants a stranger living in their house, sleeping in their bed and using their bathroom, so you have to get to know each other well beforehand. Some people are concerned about theft or property damage, but in reality this is very rare. Most home-exchangers have the view that \\"If they can trust me with their house, I can trust them with mine.\\" The worse complaint people have is the difference in standards of cleanness.

That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago.

Movie title: The Bad and the Beautiful Movie plot: In Hollywood, director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan), movie star Georgia Lorrison (Lana Turner), and screenwriter James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) each refuse to speak by phone to Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) in Paris. Movie producer Harry Pebbel (Walter Pidgeon) gathers them in his office and explains that Shields was calling them because he has a new film idea and he wants the three of them for the project. Shields cannot get financing on his own, but with their names attached, there would be no problem. Pebbel asks the three to allow him to get Shields on the phone before they give their final answer. As they await Shields' call, Pebbel assures the three that he understands why they refused to speak to Shields. The backstory of their involvement with Shields then unfolds in a series of flashbacks. Shields is the son of a notorious former studio head who had been dumped by the industry. The elder Shields was so unpopular that his son had to hire \\"extras\\" to attend his funeral. Despite the industry's ill feelings toward him because of his father, the younger Shields is determined to make it in Hollywood by any means necessary. Shields partners with aspiring director Amiel, whom he meets at his father's funeral. Shields intentionally loses money he does not have in a poker game to film executive Pebbel, so he can talk Pebbel into letting him work off the debt as a line producer. Shields and Amiel learn their respective trades making B movies for Pebbel. When one of their films becomes a hit, Amiel decides they are ready to take on a more significant project he has been nursing along, and Shields pitches it to the studio. Shields gets a 1 million budget to produce the film, but betrays Amiel by allowing someone with an established reputation to be chosen as director. The film's success allows Shields to start his own studio, and Pebbel comes to work for him there. Amiel, now independent of Shields, goes on to become an Oscar-winning director in his own right. Shields next encounters alcoholic small-time... Answer:","completion":"In the film \\"The Bad and the Beautiful,\\" Jonathan Shields lets Georgia Lorrison believe that he loves her for several reasons that ultimately serve his personal and professional ambitions. Firstly, Shields recognizes Lorrison's potential as a talented, yet undiscovered actress and sees a chance to use her as a key component in his future film projects. By allowing her to believe that he loves her, he establishes a close bond with her, which he can then leverage to secure her commitment to those projects. This exploitation of her emotional vulnerability ensures that he has control over her professional decisions, which benefits his own career in the process. Secondly, by leading her to believe in his love, Shields is able to manipulate Lorrison into changing her personal habits and lifestyle to meet the expectations of an A-list movie star. Lorrison is an alcoholic who is reluctant to embrace the limelight, yet these changes are necessary for her to become a successful actress and, in turn, an asset to Shields. This manipulation safeguards his investment in her as an actress while contributing to his own reputation as a successful producer. Additionally, it is important to remember that, given the nature of the film industry and the competitive environment of Hollywood, maintaining the loyalty and trust of talented professionals is crucial for success. By appearing to be romantically involved with Lorrison, Shields ensures that she will not easily cooperate with other producers or directors, thus keeping her talents exclusively for projects under his control. This exclusivity allows him to further capitalize on her success as an actress, solidifying his own success as well. Lastly, Shields's deception may reflect his own shortcomings and insecurities as a person. Shields might be compelled to manipulate others because of the undeserved reputation he inherited from his father and his need to prove himself. By deceiving Lorrison and others, Shields demonstrates his control, cunning, and determination to succeed at all costs, qualities he likely believes are necessary to survive in the ruthless industry that is Hollywood. In summary, Shields's decision to let Georgia Lorrison believe that he loves her is driven by his ambition and desire to manipulate her talents and loyalty for his professional benefit. This deception allows him to control her career, shaping her into a successful actress that can contribute to his own success as a producer. Furthermore, his manipulation may be rooted in his personal insecurities and the harsh competitiveness of the film industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Process: - Minerals fill spaces between bits of sediment - The sediments become glued together - The glued together parts become hard like cement - The sediment becomes a big rock - The rocks erode slowly - The rocks come apart - The rocks become smaller rocks - The rocks continue to erode into smaller rocks - The process starts again. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more large rocks formed happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis, in this context, involves the formation of more large rocks, and its potential effect on the subsequent formation of sedimentary rocks. Sedimentary rocks are formed through the accumulation, deposition, and cementation of mineral and organic particles on the Earth's surface, within bodies of water, and in the atmosphere. To discuss the potential effects of this perturbation, we can examine each stage of the sedimentary rock formation process and evaluate the direct and indirect impacts that could occur. 1. Minerals fill spaces between bits of sediment: If more large rocks form, this could lead to increased weathering and erosion over time, producing additional mineral sediments. This may contribute to an increased supply of mineral particles available to fill spaces between sediments. 2. The sediments become glued together: As more large rocks break down and release mineral particles, the abundance of available \\"cementing agents\\" (such as silica, calcium carbonate, and iron oxide) could also increase. These substances help bind sediment particles and facilitate sedimentary rock formation. Since a larger proportion of cementing agents may be present, the rate of sediment cementation could be enhanced, leading to an increased formation of sedimentary rocks. 3. The glued-together parts become hard like cement: With increased proportions of cementing agents and mineral particles from the breakdown of large rocks, we could expect correspondingly stronger and harder sedimentary rock formations. 4. The sediment becomes a big rock: As sedimentary rocks harden through chemical and physical processes, the increased prevalence of large rocks and accompanying erosion could lead to more opportunities for sedimentary rocks to develop and grow in size. This may result in a faster or more substantial sedimentary rock formation process. 5. The rocks erode slowly: With a higher prevalence of large rocks, it is possible that erosion rates could be affected. Increased erosion might cause the sedimentary rocks to disintegrate faster, releasing more sediment back into the environment. 6. The rocks come apart: As erosion of large rocks continues, the influence of this perturbation may extend to the rate at which sedimentary rocks break apart. This process could accelerate and lead to a faster breakdown of sedimentary rocks, which would then release even more sedimentary materials. 7. The rocks become smaller rocks: An increased prevalence of large rocks could lead to more rocks available for the weathering and erosion processes. This could extend the impact of the perturbation to the stage where sedimentary rocks become smaller rocks, once again contributing to a higher rate of sediment production. 8. The rocks continue to erode into smaller rocks: As sedimentary rocks continue to break apart, the release of sediment into the environment will increase, promoting the sedimentary rock formation process. To sum up, the proposed perturbation of increasing the number of large rocks could have direct and indirect effects on the sedimentary rock formation process. On the one hand, it could potentially accelerate the formation of sedimentary rocks by increasing the amount of sediment and cementing agents available. On the other hand, the process could also be negatively impacted if the increased prevalence of large rocks leads to more rapid erosion and disintegration of sedimentary rocks. Overall, the complex interplay between these various factors would likely result in variable outcomes, depending on the specific geological context and environmental conditions. However, it is evident that the perturbation would indeed have an effect on the process of sedimentary rock formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Firebrand: Omar Bakri has been arrested in Lebanon after authorities in the country cracked down on radical Salafist preachers. The radical Islamist cleric Omar Bakri who is said to have once described the July 7 bombers as the Fantastic Four was arrested in Lebanon yesterday. Bakri, 54, was the spiritual leader of banned extremist group Al-Muhajiroun and lived in London where he was known as the Tottenham Ayatollah. He went on the run in Lebanon last month following a raid on his house in a crackdown on radical clerics following a spate of car bombs, shootings and assassinations. He was arrested by security forces in the eastern town of Aley. Bakri was sentenced to life in Lebanon in 2010 following a terrorism conviction, but was released on bail after witnesses recanted their testimony. The 54-year-old sparked controversy in UK over his inflammatory language including calling for young British Muslims to take up arms and join Al Qaeda. After travelling to the Lebanon nine years ago he was refused re-entry to the UK. Since then he has faced repeated investigation by the Security Services in that country. He went on the run last months following a raid on his house in the wake of a crackdown on radical clerics in the country. Local media reports on Saturday suggested intelligence officers raided a house on a retreat in the early hours on Mount Lebanon. In March he told The Daily Mail when speaking of the troubles in Tripoli ‘only jihad salafi can save it and save Lebanon’. He added: ‘This country needs to be made an Islamic state, obviously ... but I know the security services are getting ready to nab me soon’. Tottenham ayatollah: Omar Bakri on stage with Abu Hamza at the Rally for Islam in Trafalgar Square in 2002. The radical Islamic cleric was placed under house arrest after he was released from jail shortly after arriving in war-torn Lebanon in 2005. It was reported that Bakri referred to the four suicide bombers who killed 56 people on July 7 as ‘the fantastic four’. He said the British people were to blame for the terror attacks on the capital because they ‘did not make enough effort to stop its own government committing its own atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan’. He also sparked outrage when he said on TV that he would not inform police if he knew Muslims were planning a bomb attack on a train in the UK and supported Muslims who attacked British troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. More recently there were reports he issued a ‘fatwa’ against Pakistani schoolgirl Malala Yousafzai who he said ‘should be sentenced to death’. Bakri denies being an Al Qaeda leader, while openly praising the terrorist organisation including its leadership. He came to attention in 2004 when he led a demonstration outside the US Embassy in London in which protesters chanted the name of Osama bin Laden and torched an American flag.

Daniel Bullocks Introduction: In the world of football, every yard counts, and players push themselves to the limit to score for their team. Two such players that have made history with their memorable touchdowns are Ronde Barber and Daniel Bullocks. This article aims to take a closer look at their respective touchdowns and answer the question, \\"How many yards longer was Ronde Barber's touchdown than Daniel Bullocks's touchdown?\\" Step 1: Gathering the Facts Before we make a comparison, it's essential to gather the information related to the touchdowns made by both players. Ronde Barber, who played his entire career for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, is known for various notable achievements. Daniel Bullocks played for the Detroit Lions, making significant contributions to his team. Step 2: Identifying the Specific Touchdowns In order to compare the yardage of the touchdowns, we need to identify which specific touchdowns we're evaluating. Ronde Barber made numerous touchdowns throughout his career. However, his most famous touchdown was a 92-yard interception return against the Philadelphia Eagles in the 2002 NFC Championship Game, which led the Buccaneers to victory and their Super Bowl appearance. Daniel Bullocks played as a safety for the Detroit Lions, and his touchdown in reference is most likely his 34-yard fumble return against the Atlanta Falcons in 2007. Step 3: Comparing Yardage Now that we know the length of the respective touchdowns in question, we can proceed to calculate the difference between the two: Ronde Barber: 92-yard touchdown Daniel Bullocks: 34-yard touchdown To calculate the difference in yardage, subtract Daniel Bullocks's touchdown length from Ronde Barber's touchdown length: 92 - 34 = 58 yards Conclusion: Ronde Barber's 92-yard touchdown in the 2002 NFC Championship Game was 58 yards longer than Daniel Bullocks's 34-yard touchdown in 2007.

Given the question: This article: Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them.

Background: Rajinikanth was born on 12 December 1950, in a Maratha family in Bangalore, Mysore State (present day Karnataka). His mother was a housewife, and his father Ramoji Rao Gaekwad, a police constable, He was named Shivaji Rao Gaekwad after Chhatrapati Shivaji, a Maratha warrior King, and was brought up speaking Marathi at home and Kannada outside. Rajinikanth's ancestors hailed from Mavadi Kadepathar, Maharashtra and Nachikuppam, Tamil Nadu. He is the youngest of four siblings in a family consisting of two elder brothers (Satyanarayana Rao and Nageshwara Rao) and a sister (Aswath Balubhai). Context: In January 2011, Rajinikanth was slated to appear in Rana, a period film to be produced by Soundarya Rajinikanth and directed by K. S. Ravikumar, who would work with the actor for a third time. During the principal photography of the film on 29 April 2011, he suffered a mild foodborne illness on the sets, which led to vomiting, dehydration, and exhaustion. He was treated at St. Isabel's Hospital for a day before being discharged. Five days later, he was rushed to the same hospital again after suffering from breathlessness and fever. He was diagnosed with bronchitis and was kept at the hospital for a week, while also spending a few days in an intensive care unit. Several conflicting reports of discharge dates arose, as well as claims of Rajinikanth's health deteriorating. Two days after his last discharge, Rajinikanth was admitted to the Sri Ramachandra Medical College and Research Institute on 16 May 2011 for recurring respiratory and gastrointestinal problems. The hospital maintained that Rajinikanth was in stable condition and showed positive response to treatment. It was widely reported that he required a kidney transplantation, which was later denied by Dhanush. On 21 May 2011, Aishwarya Rajinikanth released a photo of her and Rajinikanth in his hospital ward, both posing with a thumbs signal, responding to fans' negative reaction to news reports. The hospital restricted unauthorised visitors. Rajinikanth's brother, Sathyanarayana Rao Gaekwad, reported that the cause of the sudden illness was due to stress from rapid weight-loss and changes in diet, as well as withdrawal of alcohol consumption and smoking cessation. After addressing fans in a 4-minute digitally recorded voice message to the media, Rajinikanth, under the advice of Amitabh Bachchan, travelled from Chennai to Singapore with his family on 21 May 2011, where he was to undergo further treatment for nephropathy at Mount Elizabeth Hospital. After spending over two weeks at the hospital, he was finally discharged on 15 June 2011 and continued to recuperate in Singapore, before returning to Chennai on 13 July 2011. Despite several failed attempts to restart Rana upon his return, Rajinikanth reprised his Enthiran character, Chitti, in the Bollywood science-fiction film Ra.One (2011) in a guest appearance alongside Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. In November 2011, it was decided that Rana would be shelved in favour of a new project with Rajinikanth, titled Kochadaiiyaan. The motion capture film, which is the first of its kind in India, was released in 2014 to positive reviews. Kochadaiiyaan, and the 3D release of Sivaji in 2012, made Rajinikanth the first Indian actor to have appeared in four different forms of world cinema: black-and-white, colour, 3D and motion capture. Following the completion of Kochadaiiyaan, Rajinikanth began work in Ravikumar's next directorial venture, titled Lingaa alongside Anushka Shetty and Sonakshi Sinha. The film was released on 12 December 2014, coinciding with his birthday, and received mixed reviews from critics. Rajinikanth's next film was director Pa. Ranjith's crime drama Kabali, produced by S. Thanu. The film was released in July 2016. Rajinikanth is filming for 2.0, a spiritual successor to Enthiran, that is scheduled for release in 2017. In August 2016, it was announced that he would work with Ranjith again for a new film produced by Dhanush. Question: Why was Rajinikanth hospitalized.

Match of the Day pundits Danny Murphy and Martin Keown have been hit with tax bills of up to £2.5million after investing in a suspected tax avoidance scheme. A string of celebrities and sports stars each paid a minimum £100,000 to invest in a movie venture that promised to combine box office hits with tempting tax breaks. Former England and Liverpool midfielder Danny Murphy, 38, has been told to pay back £2.5million while ex-Arsenal centre back Martin Keown, 48, also faces a seven-figure bill.

Answer based on context: After battling the Super Bowl champions in Week 9, the winless Raiders went back home for Week 10 to take on their divisional rival and the defending AFC Champion Denver Broncos for the first time all year. Broncos QB Peyton Manning was immediately picked off by cornerback D.J. Hayden on his second pass of the game 30 seconds in. Taking over near midfield, the Raiders got down to the Denver 23, but were forced to kick a 41-yard field goal, which Janikowski was successful on. Broncos kicker Brandon McManus responded with a field goal of his own, and the game was tied at 3 apiece. In the second quarter, McManus added another field goal and, later in the period, the Raiders intercepted Manning again; this time, it was Justin Tuck. Oakland scored a touchdown off the turnover and took a 10-6 lead on a Derek Carr 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brice Butler. However, after 2 unsuccessful drives for each team, Carr was intercepted by Denver cornerback Bradley Roby and the Broncos stormed back with two quick touchdowns. Both touchdowns were passes by Manning to C.J. Anderson and Emmanuel Sanders of 51 and 32 yards, respectively. Denver led 20-10 at the half. In the second half, Oakland's offensive miscues continued as Khalif Barnes fumbled at his own 13-yard line, and the Broncos wasted no time as Manning's 10-yard pass to Julius Thomas put Denver up by 17. Oakland's next possession ended in a punt, and Manning went right back to Thomas for another touchdown, Peyton's fourth of the day and second from 32 yards out. Carr was picked off again, the Broncos scored yet another touchdown on Manning's fifth of the game and second to Emmanuel Sanders, and the visitors took a commanding 41-10 lead. Down 31 points, the Raiders headed into the 4th quarter getting embarrassed by the potent Denver offense, and were unable to do much more than score an insignificant touchdown with 53 seconds left. The Broncos left Oakland with a 41-17 win and moved to 7-2 on the season. Meanwhile, the Raiders' woes continued as their record fell to 0-9.

Governments have instituted these tax hikes, assuming that the presence of a more significant number of tourists under open boarding would translate to increased revenue for casinos. However, this belief overlooks several critical factors and challenges faced by these operators amid the booming tourism sector. Higher Operating Costs Casino operators have cited higher operating costs as one of the primary reasons behind their grievances. The influx of tourists under open boarding policies has resulted in increased expenses across the tourism sector, including accommodations, logistics, and transportation. As casinos expand their operations to accommodate and attract a more significant number of patrons, the operational costs associated with new hiring, training, and infrastructure development have skyrocketed. Consequently, the higher taxes imposed on these businesses place additional strain on their financial resources, leaving thin profit margins for casino operators. Competition and Market Saturation The open boarding policy has stimulated competition in the casino industry. As governments get enticed by the prospect of increased revenues generated by casino taxes, they often issue more licenses, thereby making the market more competitive. With the proliferation of casinos, businesses are pushed to expand their facilities, provide more gaming options, and experiment with pricing strategies to stay afloat. This stiff competition also implies that increased taxes imposed on casino operators are split across a larger pool of businesses, further diminishing their financial gains. Increased Regulation and Compliance Alongside higher taxes, casino operators also complain about increased regulation and compliance requirements stemming from open boarding policies. With more tourists flocking to their establishments, businesses have had to deal with additional regulation and scrutiny geared towards responsible gambling and the prevention of money laundering efforts. While these measures are essential for maintaining the integrity of the gaming industry, they present further operational costs for casino operators, who must now invest in legal counsel and auditing services. This increased regulation adds to their tax burden, complicating the already challenging equation. The Balance Between Taxation and Growth For the casino industry to continue thriving in an era of open boarding, it is crucial to strike a balance between taxation rates and business growth. Governments must reassess the potential impact of over-taxation on casino businesses to prevent long-lasting implications on the growth, sustenance, and profitability of these establishments. Excessively high taxes may stifle the casino industry, leading to job losses, reduced tourism appeal, and an economic downturn. Governments must design tax policies that carefully consider the casino operators' challenges and account for their financial risks. It is necessary to establish a tax environment that promotes growth, encourages innovation, and maintains the competitiveness of the casino industry. Often, an open boarding policy could work against its very objective of embracing globalization, let alone fostering close ties with neighboring countries. Therefore, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders to address the casino operators' concerns and create a sustainable future where everyone prospers. Conclusion Casino operators face multiple challenges brought about by open boarding policies, with increased taxation being a pressing concern. As countries continue to embrace globalization, it is crucial to adapt tax frameworks and regulations to address the realities faced by businesses in the casino industry. Striking a balance between taxation and growth, along with understanding the unique challenges of the industry, will foster a more inclusive, prosperous, and robust casino market for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), is the brand used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark when it provides humanitarian aid and development assistance to other countries, with focus on developing countries. There is no distinct Danida organisation within the Ministry. Can we draw the following conclusion? DANIDA provides developing country with food and clothing.","completion":"Based on the information provided about the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA), it is an initiative used by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark to provide humanitarian aid and development assistance to countries, particularly those that are developing. While it does not explicitly mention that DANIDA provides food and clothing, it can be inferred that these could be part of the support offered by the agency, but it is important to understand that their assistance would encompass a broader range of development initiatives. To draw a more nuanced and accurate conclusion, we must first dive into the different sectors and the broader role DANIDA plays in the international development sphere. The primary objective of DANIDA is to contribute to poverty reduction and sustainable development in developing countries. It works in partnership with these countries to promote initiatives that can help them achieve their development goals. Some of the focus areas of DANIDA's development assistance include: 1. Sustainable economic development: DANIDA supports activities that promote economic growth, decent employment opportunities, and economic self-sufficiency, such as investment in infrastructure, trade development, and private sector growth. 2. Governance and human rights: DANIDA works on strengthening democratic processes, promoting human rights, and improving the delivery of public services in recipient countries. 3. Humanitarian assistance: In times of disasters or conflict, DANIDA provides emergency relief supplies and support to affected populations, which may include food and clothing as part of the essential items necessary for immediate survival. 4. Social development: DANIDA engages in initiatives that improve the quality of life for individuals in developing countries by increasing access to education, healthcare, and social protection services. 5. Environment and climate change: DANIDA supports projects that protect the environment, tackle climate change, and promote sustainable use of natural resources. 6. Gender equality: DANIDA aims to promote gender equality, empowering women and girls, and ensuring their equal contributions to and benefits from development efforts are prioritized. From this in-depth look at DANIDA's various focus areas, it becomes evident that while the provision of food and clothing may be a part of the agency's humanitarian assistance, DANIDA's broader mission goes beyond that and encompasses an extensive range of developmental initiatives. Therefore, it would be more accurate to conclude that DANIDA's role is to provide comprehensive humanitarian aid and development assistance, which may include, but is not limited to, providing food and clothing to developing countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. resistance available: 1.8, 2.4 and 2.8 ohms Make this proper case.","completion":"Resistance Available: 1.8, 2.4, and 2.8 Ohms When working with electrical circuits and components, it is crucial to understand the resistance values of the different elements involved. In this given scenario, we have three distinct resistance values: 1.8 Ohms, 2.4 Ohms, and 2.8 Ohms. Before we delve deeper into the significance of these values, let's first provide a brief overview of resistance and its importance in electrical circuits. Resistance is a fundamental property of any conductor or electronic component that opposes the flow of electric current through it. It is measured in the unit of Ohms (symbolized by the Greek letter Omega, Ω). In essence, resistance is the force that tries to slow down electric current, converting some of it into heat energy in the process. The main factors that influence a material's resistance properties are its length, cross-sectional area, temperature, and inherent resistivity. The three available resistance values in this case - 1.8, 2.4, and 2.8 Ohms - indicate that we are working with components that possess low to moderate levels of resistance. In a practical application setting, selecting the appropriate resistance value for use in a specific circuit would depend on various factors, such as the desired current flow, voltage drop, or power dissipation limits. One common application involving resistors with these values entails employing them in circuits designed for voltage division, current limiting, or setting the operating points of other semiconductor devices, such as transistors or operational amplifiers. Combining these resistors in series or parallel configurations allows users to attain even more resistance values, thereby enabling the fine-tuning of circuit parameters. For example, in a series connection, the total resistance would be the sum of the individual resistances: 1.8 + 2.4 + 2.8 = 7 Ohms. Conversely, in a parallel connection, the overall resistance is derived from the reciprocal of the sum of the reciprocals of individual resistances: 1/R_total = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 1/R_total = 1/1.8 + 1/2.4 + 1/2.8 R_total ≈ 0.96 Ohms If required, adjusting the selection of resistors in your circuit design can facilitate a vast array of applications, directly impacting the circuit's performance. Ultimately, utilizing the provided resistance values—1.8, 2.4, and 2.8 Ohms—can prove advantageous in creating optimized, energy-efficient circuits with various functionalities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The suspected ringleader of the deadly terror attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, will remain jailed until trial, a federal magistrate ruled on Wednesday. Ahmed Abu Khatallah appeared at a brief detention hearing in federal court in Washington where he's accused of providing material support to terrorists. Court documents released on the eve of the hearing allege he \\"conspired to participate and then participated\\" in the September 11, 2012, attack on the American outpost in eastern Libya that killed Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. He previously pleaded not guilty to the charge that carries a maximum life prison sentence. More are charges are possible. Abu Khatallah, who is thought to be in his early 40s, was captured earlier this month in Libya and transferred to the United States last weekend. Authorities contend that he's a senior leader of Ansar al Sharia, whose members were among several militias that participated in the two-pronged armed assault. Assailants armed with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades first blasted through the main diplomatic mission before setting it ablaze, the court papers said. Stevens and State Department information officer Sean Smith died there. A coordinated mortar assault on a nearby annex killed security officers Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty. \\"The defendant's participation in the attack was motivated by his extremist ideology,\\" prosecutors said in the documents, which also alleged that Abu Khatallah \\"voiced concern and opposition to the presence of an American facility in Benghazi\\" days prior to the attack.

The search for alternative energy is nothing new, but the current trend of innovators is focusing on the goal of making clean and sustainable power a mainstream commodity. For example, the fuel cell, which produces electricity from the chemical reaction between oxygen and hydrogen, has been around for about 150 years, though its commercial development did not begin until the 1960s and then only as part of NASA spacecraft. Today this technology is coming down to Earth in places like Tokyo; in nine European cities, from Stockholm to Porto, each operating three hydrogen-fuel-cell buses; and in Iceland, which is trying to create the first fuel free hydrogen economy by 2030. When hydrogen and oxygen molecules combine, the reaction produces heat and water. Fuel cells use this reaction to generate electricity.

Question: The woman is the spirit of what? Movie title: Sundo Movie plot: The film opens with Vanessa (Iza Calzado) who was killed when she was visited by her long dead husband as her companion. The film then cuts to Romano (Robin Padilla), a retired military operative who goes into seclusion after being seriously wounded in battle and almost died, discovers that he has the uncanny ability of seeing ghosts around people who will soon encounter sudden, disastrous deaths. Worried of his brother, Romanoâs blind sister Isabel (Rhian Ramos) persuades him to return to Manila with the help of Louella (Sunshine Dizon), Romanoâs childhood friend who harbors affection for him. An aspiring actress, Kristina (Katrina Halili), a widow, Lumen (Glydel Mercado), and her nephew, Eric (Hero Angeles) hitch a ride with Romano, Isabel and Louella along with Louellaâs driver, Baste (Mark Bautista). On their way back to the city, the group manages to avoid a fatal accident on the road and their respective âsundoâ or ghost companion by a twist of fate. After surviving, the group took their supper in a local eatery somewhere in Baguio. Lumen, who was eager to pee, went into the bathroom where she died as a rail spike pins her head. Soon, Eric died in a series of odd reactions similar to Final Destination happened as he was electrocuted. The group realized that there is a way to cheat death as Baste and Romano nearly survives a large explosion in a public market killing a large populace. Then the group starts to die in gruesome ways and Kristina, Baste and Isabel died in mysterious ways.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity,\\" according to Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee? , can you please find it? Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative. How the few things of his stick in one's mind.\\" For Canadian artists Roy Kiyooka and Dennis Lee, he is a \\"haunting presence\\" and \\"embodies the Canadian artistic identity\\".As of 2015, the highest price achieved by a Thomson sketch was Early Spring, Canoe Lake, which sold in 2009 for CAD2,749,500. Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.

Please write a short summary for the following article: A Therapist Is Better at Handling Emotions Than You Are Impressive findings from the other side of the therapy couch: your therapist is better at regulating her emotions than you are, according to a small new study in the journal Psychotherapy. The authors wanted to see if psychotherapists are better at regulating emotion than the rest of us, so they tested experienced therapists as well as non-therapists by showing them pictures designed to elicit negative emotional reactions, ranging from slightly negative images like sad people to very intense images like corpses and people with severe injuries. After each image, they rated how negative the image made them feel. Both groups reacted the same way to the negative images. But differences emerged during the second part of the study, when people were shown the pictures again and told to use one of two techniques that regulates emotion: either positive reappraisal, in which you reinterpret emotional information in a positive light, or distraction—thinking about something unrelated and neutral in order to disengage from the negativity. Both have been shown to be effective against negative emotions. Therapists, the researchers found, were better at calming their emotional response by using these emotion regulation strategies than the non-therapists, regardless of which technique they chose. “It’s something they need for that job and something that makes them be effective in what they do,” says study author Jan Pletzer, a graduate student in business administration at Jacobs University Bremen in Germany and in social and organizational psychology at the VU University Amsterdam in the Netherlands. Next, Pletzer hopes to find out whether therapists come into their profession equipped with these emotional skills, or whether they hone them on the job. “I suspect maybe it’s a little bit of both,” says psychologist Mary Karapetian Alvord, PhD, adjunct associate professor at Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences, who was not involved in the study. But just because non-therapists have less training doesn’t mean they’re doomed to be less emotionally intelligent than the professionals sitting across from them. We regulate our emotions through our thoughts, Alvord says—a key skill every good therapist learns how to do. “What lay people can do is really learn to catch your thoughts, be aware of your thoughts and recognize that those thoughts then lead to an emotional reaction and a physiological reaction,” she says. “Recognizing those connections is absolutely critical, and most people don’t. We think about emotions, but we don’t think about the thoughts and reframing and getting a different perspective.” When we do, she says, the effects can be huge on both our mind and body. Reframe a speedbump into a positive, and “immediately you recognize that your body relaxes, your muscles aren’t as tense, you feel better and you have a better outlook for the rest of the day,” Alvord says. “It’s something that therapists learn, to catch themselves.”","completion":"Imagine you and a therapist are looking at some pictures. Some of these pictures are a little bit sad, and some are very sad, with hurt people or even dead bodies. After looking at the pictures, both you and the therapist feel sad. But here's the interesting part: therapists are better at making themselves feel better after looking at sad pictures. They do this by using two techniques: one is thinking about the sad picture in a positive way, and the other is thinking about something else that's not sad at all. This helps them not to feel sad anymore. It's important for therapists to be good at making themselves feel better, because that helps them do their job of helping other people feel better too. So, even though therapists may be better at making themselves feel better than we are, we can still learn how to do it too. One way is to be more aware of our thoughts and how they make us feel. If we can do that, we can learn to change the way we think about things, and that can help us feel better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Burges died, aged 53, in his Red Bed at the Tower House, at 11.45 p.m. on Wednesday 20 April 1881. While on a tour of works at Cardiff, he caught a chill and returned to London, half-paralysed, where he lay dying for some three weeks. Among his last visitors were Oscar Wilde and James Whistler. He was buried in the tomb he designed for his mother at West Norwood, London. On his death, John Starling Chapple, Burges's office manager and close associate for more than twenty years, wrote \\"a constant relationship ... with one of the brightest ornaments of the profession has rendered the parting most severe. Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God. Under the inscription \\"Architect of this cathedral\\" is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name. Legal complications obstructed Burges's wish to be buried in the cathedral he had built. Burges's own words on Saint Fin Barre's, in his letter of January 1877 to the Bishop of Cork, sum up his career, \\"Fifty years hence, the whole affair will be on its trial and, the elements of time and cost being forgotten, the result only will be looked at. The great questions will then be, first, is this work beautiful and, secondly, have those to whom it was entrusted, done it with all their heart and all their ability.\\" A:","completion":"The last name of the person who caught a chill and returned to London is Burges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm. It was Warm's secret that the majority of his time outside of the company, he also spent behind a desk.

Aaliyah Dana Haughton was born on January 16, 1979, in Brooklyn, New York, and was the younger child of Diane and Michael \\"Miguel\\" Haughton (1951–2012). She was of African-American descent, and had Native American (Oneida) heritage from a grandmother. Her name has been described as a female version of the Arabic \\"Ali\\", but the original Jewish name \\"Aliya (Hebrew: אליה)\\" is derived from the Hebrew word \\"aliyah (Hebrew: עלייה)\\", meaning \\"highest, most exalted one, the best.\\" The singer was highly fond of her Semitic name, calling it \\"beautiful\\" and asserting she was \\"very proud of it\\" and strove to live up to her name every day.

When Aaliyah was five years old, her family moved to Detroit, Michigan, where she was reared along with her older brother, Rashad. She attended a Catholic school, Gesu Elementary, where in first grade she was cast in the stage play Annie, which inspired her to become an entertainer. In Detroit, her father began working in the warehouse business, one of his brother-in-law Barry Hankerson's widening interests. Her mother stayed home and raised Aaliyah and her brother.Throughout Aaliyah’s life, she had a good relationship with Rashad, who recalled Aaliyah having a beautiful voice as a child. Aaliyah's family was very close due to the struggles of her grandparents and when they moved to Detroit, the Hankersons were ready to take them in if necessary. These same bonds led to ties in the music industry, under the Blackground Records label.Aaliyah's mother was a vocalist, and her uncle, Barry Hankerson, was an entertainment lawyer who had been married to Gladys Knight.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is there 500 acres of on Upper Table Rock?, using the article: Starting approximately 40 million years ago in the middle Eocene, a braided river system called the \\"Ancestral Rogue River\\" flowed through the region where the Rogue Valley is now carved. For about 2.1 million years, the river deposited what is now known as the Payne Cliffs Formation by laying down a thin conglomerate, followed by arkosic sandstone and siltstone. Between 10 and 20 million years ago, the uplift that created the nearby Klamath Mountains caused an incision that formed the Rogue River valley. Vertical erosion, or downcutting of the Rogue River continues to keep pace with the recent uplift, with about 690 feet (210 m) of erosion occurring in the past seven million years.Approximately seven million years ago in the upper Miocene, a 44-mile (71 km) long trachyandesitic lava flow that likely came from Olson Mountain near present-day Lost Creek Lake flowed down the Ancestral Rogue River and its tributaries and spread throughout the valley. This lava formed a hard cap over the Payne Cliffs Formation. At Lost Creek Lake, the lava attained its maximum thickness of 730 feet (220 m) and thinned to about 100 to 200 feet (30 to 61 m) to the north of Medford. Since the Olson eruption, the Rogue River has eroded 90 percent of the solidified lava. Though the andesite prevented much erosion to the caps of the Table Rocks, the andesite-capped cliffs eroded from the side as the softer sedimentary units of the Payne Cliffs Formation gave way. This erosion created expansive talus fields which surround the plateaus on all sides, creating slopes capable of supporting abundant plant and animal life. Upper and Lower Table Rock both stand 800 feet (240 m) above the valley floor, and just over 2,000 feet (610 m) above sea level. There are approximately 300 acres (120 ha) of level ground on Lower Table Rock, and 500 acres (200 ha) on Upper Table Rock.The Table Rocks offer an example of inverted relief, in which previous topographic lows are filled with a resistant rock and become new topographic highs after the erosion..., what would be the answer ?

During the Iraq War, U.S. Army Staff Sergeant Shane Matthews is a sniper who is sent to investigate a pipeline construction site in the desert of the country, with his spotter, Sergeant Allen Isaac. The pair patiently wait 22 hours on overwatch before determining that the site is clear. Matthews proceeds to investigate the site, but is shot by an Iraqi sniper. Isaac tries to rescue the dying Matthews, but he is also wounded in the right knee and has his radio damaged and his water bottle destroyed in the process. Alone, Isaac takes cover behind an unsteady wall and tends to his wounds. The sniper has a radio tuned into the American channel, and uses it to communicate with Isaac under the pretense of being a high ranking allied soldier at another site. The deception allows the sniper to get other useful information from Isaac. Throughout their various one-sided attempts at conversation, we learn that the sniper does not claim to be the mythical Juba mentioned earlier in the film, a nom de guerre for various Al Qaeda snipers notorious for filming their attacks on American soldiers. Isaac's attempts to call headquarters for help are stymied by the loss of his radio antennae. He attempts to repair this item with one from a dead contractor's radio, only to discern that the sniper had used the earlier response team as a ruse to call for help and lure another response force into his jaws. Matthews regains consciousness and subtly gets Isaac's attention that he's still alive. Matthews slowly crawls towards his rifle in the midst of the dusty wind along with Isaac distracting Juba with small talk. Matthews believes that the sniper is hiding at the top of some rubble nearby and fires in that direction. The dusty wind settles quickly.

Given the question: Information: - A graduate school (sometimes shortened as grad school) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree with a high grade point average. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute, as various professional schools offer graduate degrees (e.g., some nursing schools offer a master's degree in nursing). Also, some graduate degrees train students for a specific profession (e.g. an MSc or a PhD in epidemiology trains a person to be an epidemiologist). - The Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, located in Baltimore City, Maryland, U.S. It was founded in 1889 using money from a bequest by philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins Hospital and the school of medicine are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous medical traditions including rounds, residents and housestaff. Many medical specialties were formed at the hospital including neurosurgery, by Harvey Cushing; cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock; and pediatrics and child psychiatry, by Leo Kanner. - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. - The Johns Hopkins University (commonly referred to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His 7 million bequestof which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospitalwas the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States. - John Lewis Holland (October 21, 1919 November 27, 2008) was an American psychologist and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. He was the creator of the career development model, \\"Holland Occupational Themes,\\" otherwise known as The Holland Codes. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - Daniel Coit Gilman (July 6, 1831 October 13, 1908) was an American educator and academic. Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and subsequently served as the third president of the University of California, as the first president of Johns Hopkins University, and as founding president of the Carnegie Institution. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale's Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark \\"the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.\\" - Heidelberg University (informally Heidelberg) is a public research university located in the town of Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities. It was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire. - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank. - A psychologist is a professional who evaluates and studies behavior and mental processes (see also psychology). Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services. - The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes ( RIASEC ) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice ( based upon personality types ) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland ( 1919 - 2008 ) , Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University . The US Department of Labor ETA has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the \`\` Interests '' section of its free online database , The Occupational Information Network ( O * NET ) , since its inception during the late 1990s . - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

When Louise goes below deck, a large, strange cloud on the horizon passes over the craft, leaving a reflective mist on Scott's bare skin. The couple are puzzled by the phenomenon, which disappears as quickly as it had shown up. However, one morning six months later, Scott, who is 6Â ft 1Â in (1.85Â m) tall and 190 pounds (86Â kg), notices that his shirt and slacks seem to be too big, but blames it on the laundry service. As this trend continues, he believes he is shrinking and sees his physician, Dr. Bramson (William Schallert), who reassures him that he is in perfect health and that \\"people just don't get shorter.\\" Louise also dismisses his fears as silly, stating that he has simply been losing weight, but he continues to lose height and weight. His wedding ring falls off his finger. Louise becomes concerned when Scott points out that she no longer needs to stand on tiptoe to kiss him. Finally, there is x-ray proof that Scott is getting smaller. His doctor refers him to the prominent laboratory, the California Medical Research Institute, and after nearly three weeks of sophisticated tests, Scott and his team of new doctors learn that the mist to which he was exposed was radioactive. This, combined with an accidental exposure to a large amount of common insecticide four months later, has set off a chain reaction that has rearranged Scott's molecular structure, causing his cells to shrink. Scott continues to shrink proportionately. His story hits the headlines, and he becomes a national curiosity. He can no longer drive a car and has to give up his job working for his brother, Charlie (Paul Langton), who encourages him to make some money off his story by selling it to the national press.

A roof is an integral part of a building's structure, providing protection from the elements, such as wind, rain, and snow. Typically, roofs are made of different materials that offer varying levels of durability and resistance to environmental conditions. In this case, the original roof tiles were likely damaged due to their inability to withstand the forces of the windstorm. With this in mind, the decision to replace the damaged tiles with heavier ones is a wise one. Heavier roof tiles are often more durable and better at resisting the forces of nature, such as high winds and heavy snow loads. Furthermore, they can offer improved insulation, leading to a more energy-efficient home. In some cases, heavier tiles might also have a longer life expectancy, reducing the need for regular maintenance and replacement costs. However, it is important to note that installing heavier roof tiles should be done with caution. The existing structure of the roof must be able to support the additional weight, and an evaluation by a structural engineer or a qualified roofing contractor may be necessary to ensure that the roof can adequately handle the new tiles. In conclusion, given the context of the question - the need for a more durable and robust solution following the windstorm - the best-suited answer from the provided options would be \\"roof.\\" This choice reflects the need to enhance the resiliency of the building envelope and provides a stronger defense against the elements."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Movie title: Still Crazy Movie plot: \\"History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on.

At the start of the 1910s, the decade would begin with the Panic of 1910–1911 stifling economic growth for a lengthy period of time. History would later take its course on July 30, 1914; as the average stood at a level of 71.42 when a decision was made to close down the New York Stock Exchange, and suspend trading for a span of four and a half months. Some historians believe the exchange closed because of a concern that markets would plunge as a result of panic over the onset of World War I. An alternative explanation is that the Secretary of the Treasury, William Gibbs McAdoo, closed the exchange to conserve the U.S. gold stock in order to launch the Federal Reserve System later that year, with enough gold to keep the United States on par with the gold standard. When the markets reopened on December 12, 1914, the index closed at 74.56, a gain of 4.4 percent. This is frequently reported as a large drop, due to using a later redefinition. Reports from the time say that the day was positive. Following World War I, the United States would experience another economic downturn, the post-World War I recession. The Dows performance would remain unchanged from the closing value of the previous decade, adding only 8.26%, from 99.05 points at the beginning of 1910, to a level of 107.23 points at the end of 1919.

The Dow closed at 107.23 points at the end of 1919 and at 99.05 points at the beginning of 1910. Step 1: Subtract the starting value from the ending value. 107.23 (end value) - 99.05 (start value) = 8.18 points So, the closing of the Dow was 8.18 points higher at the end of 1919 compared to the beginning of 1910."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film opens with long lines of tired and grim soldiers and civilians moving through a congested town away from the advancing Japanese (who are not shown but the hopelessness of the situation hangs heavy). Sergeant Bill Dane (Robert Taylor) of the 31st Infantry and his companion Corporal Jake Feingold (Thomas Mitchell) are seen manning a defensive position. They casually discuss the possibility that they will be ordered to retreat again back toward the presumed safety of Bataan.Their commander orders them to report to a Captain Lassister for a special assignment. The town then suffers a violent Japanese air attack with civilians and soldiers caught in the open and killed. Dane and Feingold reach Lassiter. A pretty American nurse boards the last ambulance out while casting a long, soulful look back at Lassier (Lee Bowman). Lassiter puts Dane in charge of a group of 13 men, all of whom had been separated from their commands, with orders to hold a a strategic bridge after the last refugees cross. Lassiter makes it clear they are to demolish the bridge, stop the \\"Japs\\", and hold until MacArthur can consolidate in Bataan. They are given such equipment and supplies as is available and left alone.After the army and some civilians cross the bridge, Dane, Feingold, and a group of eleven hastily assembled soldiers from different units is assigned to blow it up and delay Japanese rebuilding efforts as long as possible. In addition to Sgt. Dane, Cpl. Feingold and Captain Lassier, the rear guard is a mixed lot, making up of:Corporal Barney Todd (Lloyd Nolan), who claims to be a signalman;Private Felix Ramirez (Desi Arnaz), a Mexican American California National Guardsman;Private Wesley Epps (Kenneth Lee Spencer), a black demolitions expert;Private Matthew Hardy (Phillip Terry), a conscientious objector in the Medical Corps;Private Francis X. Matowski (Barry Nelson), an engineer;Private \\"Yankee\\" Salazar (Alex Havier), a Philippine Scout;Private Sam Molloy (Tom Dugan), a cook;Seaman Leonard Purckett (Robert Walker), a... Answer:","completion":"Considering the movie plot described, a possible question to generate could be: \\"How does the diverse background of the rear guard soldiers contribute to their collective struggle to accomplish their mission, and how do their individual strengths and weaknesses impact the overall success of holding the strategic bridge?\\" This question encourages an exploration of the dynamics among the group of 13 soldiers from varying backgrounds and experiences. It prompts an analysis of their collaboration and the development of personal growth within each character as they face a seemingly hopeless task, ultimately demonstrating the resilience of the human spirit. Throughout the film, Sergeant Bill Dane, Corporal Jake Feingold, Captain Lassier, and the other members of the rear guard come from a wide array of backgrounds and possess a range of skills and abilities. The unique richness of this diverse group allows for a more profound exploration of human nature and the capacity to unite in the face of adversity. Corporal Barney Todd, the signalman, is able to contribute through his crucial knowledge of communication systems, while Private Felix Ramirez, the Mexican American National Guardsman, brings his resourcefulness and military experience to the team. Private Wesley Epps, the black demolitions expert, is instrumental in carrying out the main objective of blowing up the bridge and delaying the Japanese forces, and Private Matthew Hardy, the conscientious objector, provides medical assistance caring for the wounded soldiers. As an engineer, Private Francis X. Matowski plays a vital role in strategic planning, while Private \\"Yankee\\" Salazar, the Philippine Scout, offers his local knowledge and survival skills. In contrast, Private Sam Molloy, the cook, and Leonard Purckett struggle to prove their value as soldiers in a military setting, but their contrasting backgrounds and unique perspectives also enhance the group's overall ability to adapt and manage the challenges they face. Each participating soldier's unique skills, beliefs, and experiences contribute differently to the ultimate success or failure of holding the strategic bridge. Furthermore, exploring how both the soldiers' individual strengths and weaknesses affect the group dynamic and the overall mission provides an opportunity to delve deeper into themes of loyalty, self-discovery, sacrifice, and perseverance. The story demonstrates that when individuals come together to achieve a common goal, their varied abilities can complement each other, resulting in a more robust and effective outcome. In conclusion, the question generated from the movie plot aims to analyze the impact of the rear guard soldiers' diverse backgrounds on their collective struggle to complete their mission and how this dynamic influences the overall success or failure of stopping the Japanese forces at the strategic bridge. By exploring these aspects, the film's core themes of unity, resilience, and hope emerge more vividly, providing a compelling narrative and a deeper understanding of the human spirit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: German dialectology traditionally names the major dialect groups after Germanic tribes from which they were assumed to have descended.[citation needed] Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","completion":"Answer: German dialects are traditionally named after the Germanic tribes or linguistic regions from which they were assumed to have descended or originated. The major German dialect groups have features that can be geographically as well as historically linked to the early Germanic tribes that populated the areas. These tribes had their own distinct languages and cultural identities, which later evolved into the various dialects we recognize today. The main German dialect groups are: 1. Low German (Plattdeutsch or Niederdeutsch): This group of dialects is traditionally associated with the Saxon tribes, which inhabited the lowlands of Northern Germany and the eastern Netherlands. Low German dialects share phonetic and grammatical features with Old Saxon, the historical language of these tribes. Low German dialects are further divided into West Low German and East Low German. 2. High German (Hochdeutsch): These dialects originated in the southern and central German-speaking regions. High German dialects are named after various Germanic tribes that inhabited the highlands, such as the Alemanni, Bavarians, and Franks. High German dialects are divided into two main groups: a. Upper German (Oberdeutsch): Associated with the Alemanni and Bavarians, Upper German dialects include Alemannic, Swabian, East Franconian, South Franconian, and Bavarian-Austrian dialects. These dialects are spoken in the areas that were inhabited by the Alemanni and Bavarians, including southern Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Alsace region in France. b. Central German (Mitteldeutsch): This group of dialects is associated primarily with the tribes of the Franks and Thuringians, who lived in the central region of Germany. Central German dialects include Ripuarian, Moselle Franconian, Rhine Franconian, Thuringian, and Upper Saxon. These dialects are spoken in areas stretching from the Rhineland in the west to Saxony-Anhalt in the east. 3. East Middle German (Ostmitteldeutsch): This group of dialects is associated with the Slavic settlement in Eastern Germany, mainly populated by the Sorbs, who currently still speak the Sorbian language in some parts of Eastern Germany. The influence of their language and culture is apparent on the regional dialects of East Middle German group. Apart from these main dialect groups, there are several smaller dialects that are spoken in specific regions or communities within Germany. Some of these dialects are highly localized and may only be spoken by a small fraction of the population. Examples of these smaller dialects include Silesian, Luxembourgish, and Yiddish. In conclusion, German dialects are traditionally named after the Germanic tribes or linguistic regions where they originated. However, it is essential to recognize that while these historical associations offer a useful starting point for understanding the development of German dialects, languages and dialects are constantly evolving and influenced by various socio-historical factors. This means that the dialects spoken today are not simply direct descendants of the languages spoken by these tribes but rather an intricate fusion of various linguistic and cultural influences over the centuries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, with a smile on my lips, I follow him outside to the beautifully sunlit patio where a light breeze is enough to bring the smell of freshly bloomed flowers. As we settle down in the comfortable patio chairs, he carefully places his guitar on his lap and starts tuning it. As he adjusts each string to perfection, his fingers skillfully dance across the fretboard, producing sounds that are both harmonic and ethereal. I can't help but feel captivated by the sight and feel a sense of anticipation for the music he's about to share with me. He looks up at me and says, \\"All right, I've got a couple of ideas I'd like you to listen to, and I need your opinion on which one to use for the song I'm working on for Brennan.\\" He explains that Brennan's favorite kind of music is alternative rock with a touch of acoustic, so he's trying to create a track that seamlessly blends both elements. I nod in understanding and take a deep breath, mentally preparing myself for the task ahead. He starts playing the first idea, strumming the chords effortlessly. The melody is smooth, rhythmic, and full of emotion, evoking a sense of nostalgia and carrying me away to a place of memories and self-reflection. It's enchanting, to say the least. As he moves on to the second idea, I notice a shift in the mood. This time, the melody has a playful rhythm that makes me want to tap my foot in sync with the beat. The chords swell and contract, making it feel like we're riding an emotional wave that is equal parts exhilarating and calming. He finishes playing both ideas and looks at me expectantly. I take a few moments to gather my thoughts, appreciating the uniqueness of each melody. Unable to choose one over the other, I finally suggest that he combines elements from both compositions, creating a dynamic piece that is infused with feelings of nostalgia, love, and youthful energy. He ponders over my suggestion and nods in agreement, saying that I might have just unlocked the perfect blend he was searching for. We spend the rest of the afternoon experimenting and refining the song, feeding off of each other's creative energy to craft something that we feel would truly resonate with Brennan. As the sun begins to dip below the horizon, we wrap up our jam session, both of us feeling a sense of fulfillment from the day's collaboration. The music we've created today is not just a product of our individual talents, but rather it is a testament to the power of working together and drawing inspiration from one another. I look over at him, still holding his guitar, and smile. \\"Pun intended,\\" I say with a laugh, elbowing him gently. Me: \\"I think we've created something truly special here.\\" We both know it's time to send our masterpiece off to Brennan, confident in our creation and in the knowledge that we've given it our all. The sun sets on the day, the shadows lengthening, and our spirits lifted by the birth of a new song that we hope will touch Brennan's soul as much as it has touched ours."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, \\"the Prince\\" – the head of the Russian Mafia – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London. Answer:","completion":"Dima gives the information to Hector through Perry MacKendrick. In the story, Dima gives Perry a USB stick that contains information linking corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. After returning to London, Perry then hands over the USB stick to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: How can someone listen to vinyl? Possible A: record store, car, omlinr, wallpaper, record albums Why is \\"record albums\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"\\"Record albums\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the question of how to listen to vinyl. Vinyl records, also known as phonograph records, are a type of physical storage media for recorded music. They were especially popular before the rise of CDs and digital music, and have recently seen a resurgence among audiophiles and collectors. Record albums refer to collections of vinyl records that typically consist of multiple tracks, often arranged in a particular order by the artist or record label. These albums are stored in covers that usually feature artwork, liner notes, and other information about the music. To listen to vinyl, one needs a record player (also known as turntable or phonograph), which works by spinning the vinyl and having a stylus (needle) follow the grooves etched on the record's surface. The stylus picks up vibrations from the grooves and translates them into electrical signals, which are then amplified and converted back into sound by the speakers. In the context of the question, \\"record store\\" is also a common sense answer since it is a place where vinyl records, including record albums, can be purchased. People can then acquire the desired records and play them on their turntables to listen to the music. The other three options provided – car, omlinr (which seems to be a typo, possibly meant to say \\"online\\"), and wallpaper – do not align with human common sense as they do not have a direct connection to listening to vinyl.

Information: - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country (with over 1.2 billion people), and the most populous democracy in the world. It is bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast. It shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Myanmar (Burma) and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives. India's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. Its capital is New Delhi; other metropolises include Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore, Hyderabad and Ahmedabad. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe. The aquatic Cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) evolved from even-toed ungulate ancestors, and therefore modern taxonomic classification combines Artiodactyla and Cetacea into Cetartiodactyla. - Whales are a widely distributed and diverse group of fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), are thought to have split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the gray whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales). - The common dolphin is the name given to two species ( and possibly a third ) of dolphin making up the genus Delphinus . Prior to the mid- 1990s , most taxonomists only recognised one species in this genus , the common dolphin Delphinus delphis . Modern cetologists usually recognise two species -- the short - beaked common dolphin , which retains the systematic name Delphinus delphis , and the long - beaked common dolphin Delphinus capensis . The common dolphin is not the dolphin of popular imagination despite its name ; that distinction belongs to the bottlenose dolphin due to its widespread use in marine parks and its appearance in the television series Flipper . However , this dolphin was the most frequently represented in the art and literature of ancient Greece and Rome . - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Oceanic dolphins or Delphinidae are a widely distributed family of dolphins that live in the sea. Thirty extant species are described. They include several big species whose common names contain \\"whale\\" rather than \\"dolphin\\", such as the killer whale and the pilot whales. Delphinidae is a family within the superfamily Delphinoidea, which also includes the porpoises (Phocoenidae) and the Monodontidae (beluga whale and narwhal). River dolphins are relatives of the Delphinoidea. - River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. - Iniidae is a family of river dolphins containing one living and four extinct genera. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Porpoises are a group of fully aquatic marine mammals that are sometimes referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible difference between the two groups is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged from them about 40 million years ago. - Cetacea are a widely distributed and diverse clade of aquatic mammals that today consists of the whales, dolphins, and porpoises. Cetaceans are carnivorous and finned. Most species live in the sea, some in rivers. The name is derived from the Latin \\"cetus\\" \\"whale\\" and Greek \\"ketos\\" \\"huge fish\\". - Dolphins are a widely distributed and diverse group of aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Their closest living relatives are the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago. 'common dolphin' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - The coal is broken down to a smaller material - The coal particles mix with hot air and move in to a boiler - Water in the boiler is pumped and produces steam with the coal - Steam powers turbine blades, which magnetically charge wire coals - The water returns back in to its chamber and the process is repeated - Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the following process is the extraction and transportation of coal from a coal mine to the coal-fired power plant. Here is the revised and detailed process: 1. Extraction and transportation of coal: Coal is extracted from underground and surface mines using various mining techniques, including both manual labor and highly mechanized methods such as surface mining, underground mining, mountaintop removal, and open-pit mining. Once extracted, the coal is then transported to the coal-fired power plant by means such as conveyor belts, trucks, trains, or barges, depending on the distance, terrain, and available infrastructure. 2. Coal processing and preparation: Upon arrival at the power plant, the coal undergoes processing and preparation to remove impurities and obtain the required size of coal particles. This may involve techniques such as washing, crushing, and screening, which help to improve the combustion efficiency of the coal and reduce pollutant emissions during the burning process. 3. Breaking down the coal: The coal is crushed or pulverized into smaller particles, generally less than 2mm in size, to ensure an efficient and complete combustion process. By breaking it down, the coal can be more easily mixed with hot air and sent into the boiler. 4. Mixing coal particles with hot air: The pulverized coal particles are then mixed with hot air, which is pre-heated to a high temperature. This mixture enables the coal to burn more efficiently and helps transport it into the boiler. 5. Combustion in the boiler: As the coal and hot air mixture enters the boiler, it ignites and burns intensely. This combustion process generates significant heat, which is absorbed by the water-filled boiler tubes that surround the combustion chamber. 6. Steam generation: The heat from the combustion process is transferred to the water in the boiler, causing it to heat up and convert into steam. This high-pressure steam is forced through the boiler and directed toward the turbine blades. 7. Power generation: The high-pressure steam flows over the turbine blades, causing them to spin and drive the generator. As the blades rotate, they create a rotating magnetic field, which induces an electric current in the wire coils within the generator. This generates electricity that can be transmitted to the power grid. 8. Condensing the steam: After passing through the turbine, the steam loses its heat and condenses back into water. This condensed water is collected and returned to the boiler, where it undergoes the same process of heating and turning into steam again. 9. Recirculation of water and process repetition: The water is continuously recirculated through the system to maintain a steady supply of steam, ensuring that the power plant can continue to generate electricity. This closed-loop process repeats continuously as long as there is a supply of coal and the necessary conditions are maintained within the power plant. In summary, the missing first step involves the extraction and transportation of coal from its source to the coal-fired power plant, which precedes the series of steps required to convert coal into electricity efficiently and safely."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Florida Teen Charged with Statutory Rape: A Case of Homophobia or Justice? The recent case of a Florida teen charged with statutory rape and expelled from school has stirred up controversies worldwide, with many speculating about whether this case is based on homophobia. As reported by the Raw Story, Kaitlyn Hunt, an 18-year-old girl, has been accused by the parents of the alleged victim, a girl three years younger than her, of having a non-consensual sexual relationship. Kaitlyn's mother, Kelly Hunt Smith, has claimed that the charges are primarily driven by the bigoted and homophobic attitude of the younger girl's religious parents. The controversy began when Kaitlyn and the other teen started dating and were involved in what Kaitlyn's mother describes as a \\"mutual consenting relationship.\\" However, the younger girl's parents, allegedly offended by their daughter being in a relationship with another girl, reported Kaitlyn to the authorities. According to Smith, the parents blamed her daughter for \\"making\\" their child gay, leading them to push for Kaitlyn's expulsion from school. Following the charges and expulsion, Kaitlyn was forced to finish her school year at another institution. The plea deal offered by the prosecution now has her facing two years of house arrest and a year's probation. Her mother, Kelly Hunt Smith, firmly believes that these severe consequences are a result of the hatred and discrimination harbored by the alleged victim's parents. In a Facebook post, Smith claims that the parents \\"see being gay as a sin and wrong\\" and that \\"they were out to destroy my daughter.\\" As news of the case began to garner widespread attention, public support for Kaitlyn's plight has grown exponentially. A Facebook group advocating for Kaitlyn has now amassed nearly 20,000 members, while an online petition urging the prosecutors to drop the charges has gathered over 53,000 signatures. Despite the rising support for Kaitlyn, the prosecution maintains that the charges against her are not motivated by discrimination or homophobia. Instead, they argue that the case strictly revolves around the legal issue of statutory rape, as the younger girl was below the age of consent in their state. Arguments have been made on behalf of Kaitlyn, claiming that the legal prosecution in this scenario is unjustly harsh, given that the relationship was said to have been consensual and driven by love. Many argue that the backlash and consequences Kaitlyn is facing are a direct result of the pervasive discrimination against LGBTQ individuals. On the other hand, those who believe the charges are justified argue that law enforcement should apply the law consistently and dispassionately, regardless of the sex or orientation of the individuals involved. They argue that failing to do so would create a dangerous precedent that may expose the youth to abuse by individuals who seek to evade legal consequences simply because they identify as LGBTQ. In conclusion, the Kaitlyn Hunt case is a deeply polarizing and complicated issue, with many unanswered questions surrounding the merits of the prosecution's charges and the influence of homophobia. While public opinion appears to be overwhelmingly in favor of Kaitlyn, it is ultimately up to the legal system to determine the truth of this case and to uphold the principles of justice and fairness for all, regardless of sexual orientation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (; 11 December 1918 - 3 August 2008) was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer. He was an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its Gulag forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. Solzhenitsyn was born in Kislovodsk, RSFSR (now in Stavropol Krai, Russia). His mother, Taisiya Zakharovna (nee Shcherbak) was of Ukrainian descent. Her father had risen from humble beginnings to become a wealthy landowner, acquiring a large estate in the Kuban region in the northern foothills of the Caucasus. During World War I, Taisiya went to Moscow to study. While there she met and married Isaakiy Solzhenitsyn, a young officer in the Imperial Russian Army of Cossack origins and fellow native of the Caucasus region. The family background of his parents is vividly brought to life in the opening chapters of August 1914, and in the later Red Wheel novels. In 1918, Taisia became pregnant with Aleksandr. On 15 June, shortly after her pregnancy was confirmed, Isaakiy was killed in a hunting accident. Aleksandr was raised by his widowed mother and aunt in lowly circumstances. His earliest years coincided with the Russian Civil War. By 1930 the family property had been turned into a collective farm. Later, Solzhenitsyn recalled that his mother had fought for survival and that they had to keep his father's background in the old Imperial Army a secret. His educated mother (who never remarried) encouraged his literary and scientific learnings and raised him in the Russian Orthodox faith; she died in 1944. As early as 1936, Solzhenitsyn began developing the characters and concepts for a planned epic work on World War I and the Russian Revolution. This eventually led to the novel August 1914; some of the chapters he wrote then still survive. Solzhenitsyn studied mathematics at Rostov State University. At the same time he took correspondence courses from the Moscow Institute of Philosophy, Literature and History, at this time heavily ideological in scope. As he himself makes clear, he did not question the state ideology or the superiority of the Soviet Union until he spent time in the camps.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Tell all: Sharon Savoy has written a book about her life as a professional ballroom dancer. On the popular BBC series Strictly Come Dancing, the professional dancers and their celebrity partners are often seen to become the best of friends, supporting one another throughout the competition. The reality of competing on the ballroom dance circuit is somewhat different, according to three times world champion, Sharon Savoy, who is lifting the lift on the sequin-filled world in a new book. She told MailOnline: 'It's a competition, not a performance. So the normal tension and rivalries are heightened. It is rare to. develop a true friendship with your competitors, like you would see in a. dance company. 'Backstage is an interesting dichotomy. Beneath the. seemingly calm and composed exterior is a cauldron bubbling with nerves,. anxious tension and pent up energy. Most of the dancers pace until. their event is called and remind me of the energy of thoroughbred horses. at the starting gate.' Chicago-born Sharon, who trained at the School of American Ballet, said despite the fierce rivalry, attempts to sabotage the performance of a fellow competitor are thankfully rare. 'I have never heard of anything so. terrible and tragic as the acid incident at the Bolshoi,' she said, referring to the time in 2013 when tensions at Russia's rival ballet companies turned violent and dancer Pavel Dmitrichenko threw acid on the face of artistic director, Sergei Filin. Sharon said a dancers' worst enemy can often be the judge, rather than their competitor, as 'politics' means the best performer doesn't necessarily win. 'Many. talented ballroom dancers leave the competition circuit when they tire. of the politics. My book speaks about the politics in ballroom dance,. which has been a taboo subject. Anytime you. have a decision based on human opinion there will be controversy,' she said. 'The. winner of a ballroom competition is not defined by who crosses the. finish line first. What opens the door for \\"politics\\" to exist in. ballroom dance competitions is the fact that our current system allows. the coaches to also judge. It would be akin to allowing a barrister to. also preside as judge of a legal case.' Champ: Sharon, performing one of her routines, has won national and international titles. Politics aside, Sharon said she loves every aspect of the dance world - but success has not been easy. She's worked hard to become a U.S. and World champion, making sacrifices along the way. 'To become a top ranked professional. ballroom dancer, you must live, breath, eat dance 24/7,' she explained. 'Nothing else. can matter more, not relationships, family or comforts. Your passion. must be all consuming and borderline obsessive to make it through the. eye of the needle. 'George Balanchine, one of my early mentors, and. director of the New York City ballet said it best, \\"I don't want dancers. who want to dance, I want dancers that need to dance.\\"' But Sharon said the sacrifices are worth it to reap the rewards of being a professional ballroom dancer. 'The lifestyle of a top ranked ballroom. dancer is a page out of the \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\",' she said. 'If you \\"make it\\" and become the champion, you travel all over the world to. compete, perform and teach. It's a very glamorous way to see the world. and get paid to do what you love most - dance! Glamorous: The dancer, pictured in her youth, said she never gets tired of the sequins or elaborate make-up. 'I have had the pleasure to. perform in China, Japan, Taiwan, Russia, Australia, North and South. America, Europe, The Royal Albert Hall and in Hollywood movies.' Of course, the make-up and outfits all add to the glamour and Sharon said as a professional dancer, you can never have too much sparkle, tassles or fake tan. 'There's a saying that \\"you can never be too rich or too thin\\" - in the ballroom dance world, you can never be too tan!' she joked. She added: 'Hair color is usually extreme - platinum blonde, flaming red or jet black. Make-up is exaggerated; eyelashes, eyebrows and lips are all accentuated. In a sea of competitors it's important to stand out and be the most exotic or colourful fish.' As for the costumes, they are always 'exquisite'. Political: Sharon said being the best dancer doesn't always guarantee victory. 'The amount of time and attention to detail that goes into designing these lavish creations is similar to the fashion world's obsession with every facet of a piece of clothing,' she said. As well as looking lavish, the costumes must allow the performers to have freedom to move. Sharon says she never gets fed up of the sparkly costumes or make-up that are necessary for a ballroom or Latin dance routine. 'It's part of the fun and fantasy - to become larger than life, to be sexier or more provocative or more elegant than you can be in normal daily life,' she said. Ballroom!

He says that the Eskimos called the creature \\"bushman,\\" the Colville Indians \\"Sasquatch,\\" and the Hoopas \\"Om-mah,\\" but is most commonly known as Bigfoot. Marx's brother-in-law takes him to the land of petrified wood, showing him rock carvings of creatures with big hands and feet. The carvings tell the story of the creature stealing children, causing a village to be abandoned. Marx finds large tracks in the snow and later a dead bear with similar tracks nearby. He finds strange hair between the bear's teeth and sets out to track the creature. He finds tracks in the mud beside a river and something moving nearby. He intends to inform others but rain washes the tracks away. Marx investigates tracks in several states only to find they're not bigfoot tracks. He visits the Oh-mah bigfoot redwood statue in northern California and the Oregon coast, continuing to search. Marx takes a job in Washington state to film a Cinnamon bear. While there, he films Bigfoot walking through a field. He mentions that his footage of Bigfoot has been questioned by science and used by others on lecture circuits to make money. Marx shows footage of an injured squirrel, goats eating dirt, and glaciers melting. He mentions the Trans-Alaska Pipeline and visits Yukon Frida, who paints pictures of Bigfoot.

In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county. - Commuter rail, also called suburban rail, is a passenger rail transport service that primarily operates between a city centre, and the middle to outer suburbs beyond 15 km (10 miles) and commuter towns or other locations that draw large numbers of commuterspeople who travel on a daily basis.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

Plot title: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea Movie plot: 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea is a film by Richard Fleischer based on the famous Jules Verne novel written in the 19th century. The film begins with the first page of the book, talking about rumors of a mysterious sea monster that prowled the South Seas in 1868. The camera switches to an old-fashioned ship sailing through apparently calm seas. A long, dark object with glowing lights like eyes at its head appears a short distance away from the ship. It drives straight toward the ship, making a loud whirring noise of a motor. It collides head-on with the ship, sinking it, and sails off. A man standing before a crowd in San Francisco offers a bonus to any man who will ship with an expedition to hunt the mysterious \\"monster\\". Another man interrupts him, warning the crowd not to sign; they will never make it back to collect their pay. He brings up an elderly seaman who tells a dramatic story of how the \\"monster\\" sunk the ship he was on, and proceeds to give a vivid description of the monster. A young sailor, Ned Land, challenges the old sailor's claim and makes fun of the way his breath smells. His companion, Casey, hits him over the head with the sailor's cane and a fight breaks out. The police arrive and drag Ned Land away. Farther down the street, French professor Pierre Aronnax and his apprentice, Conseil, are trying to find a ship that will take them to Saigon, but are told that no one will sail through the South Seas. Three reporters ask for a statement from the professor about the monster, but he gives them an ambiguous answer.

Chris is working in a lab that handles radioactive materials. Today he is working with Element A and Element B. When measuring element A he notes that is has a shorter wavelength than element B. Will an element with a long wavelength have more or less energy when compared to an element with a short wavelength? Hint: Electromagnetic radiation is energy that travels in waves across space as well as through matter. Most of the electromagnetic radiation on Earth comes from the sun. Like other waves, electromagnetic waves are characterized by certain wavelengths and wave frequencies. Wavelength is the distance between two corresponding points on adjacent waves. Wave frequency is the number of waves that pass a fixed point in a given amount of time. Electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy.","completion":"Based on the given hints, electromagnetic waves with shorter wavelengths have higher frequencies and more energy. In this case, Chris noted that Element A has a shorter wavelength than Element B.

At the moment, he is trying to bring down his former partner Gabriel Callahan, who has become a drug kingpin. Callahan is trying to, and slowly succeeding at, taking over the New Orleans underworld. Stowe botches a sting operation against Callahan, resulting in the death of fellow cop Maria Ronson, whose fiancée, fellow cop Van Huffel, nearly comes to blows with him over it. Chief Mac Baylor has a very blunt chat with Stowe, who is dismissive. Stowe is approached by fellow cop Walter Curry to help his nephew beat a drug-dealing charge; he instead turns Curry over to Baylor, who fires him. After barricading himself in the station bathroom, Walter confronts an unrepentant Stowe and condemns him for betraying his fellow officers. That night Stowe meets with his estranged wife, Valerie, who tells him that she's pregnant, but that he's not the father. Valerie, whose marriage with Stowe is close to collapse, has been seeing a man named Mark Rossini, the gym teacher at the school she is principal of. But he may not be the father either. Stowe brashly accuses Valerie of being impregnated by Callahan, and she tells him she never wants to see him again. The only thing keeping Stowe from total collapse is his dogged pursuit of Callahan. But he drunkenly stumbles into an ambush masterminded by Callahan, and is shot in the head by Callahan's right-hand man Jimmy. Stowe undergoes emergency surgery, and ends up in a coma.

Article: Everybody knows that colors are connected with certain feelings. For example, why do some people paint the walls of their rooms yellow and others pink? The same is true in stores. They want us to feel something when we look at their products. Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of. Consumers are aware that certain foods must have certain colors. When Pepsi brought out a crystal clear cola in 1992, it thought that consumers would buy it because clear meant pure and healthy. After a few months Pepsi found out that a cola had to be dark-colored. Crystal Pepsi failed and the company pulled it off the market. Advertising professionals often need to look at a product through the consumers' eyes when choosing a color. The right packaging colors can truly improve the sales of a product but choosing...

Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said today he could be the man who took Madeleine on May 3, 2007, and that tracing him was of 'vital importance'. Detectives say the suspect is white, aged 20 to 40 with short brown hair, medium height. and build, and clean-shaven. The images, based on statements from two key witnesses, differ – but each shows him with an intense stare and a hint of a smile. Scroll down for video. Suspect: The two e-fit images of the same man seen in Praia da Luz on the night Madeleine disappeared. Scotland Yard detectives released the computer generated images ahead of a BBC1 Crimewatch appeal tonight, which they hope will result in a major breakthrough. The programme features a reconstruction of the events leading up to Madeleine’s disappearance in Praia da Luz on Thursday, May 3, 2007. Madeleine is portrayed gathering tennis balls in echoes of one of the photographs used during the search for her. A short clip released ahead of the broadcast shows Gerry and Kate McCann drawing the curtains to their apartment before joining friends in a tapas restaurant. The reconstruction shows the moment Madeleine was taken from her bed. Prime Minister David Cameron gave his support to the investigation. 'I'm very pleased that Scotland Yard are doing this work,' he said. 'The Government has helped to fund the work that is being done. 'This was a crime that touched the heart of everyone in the country and everyone would like to see it resolved, so I hope Scotland Yard continue with their work and I wish them success.' Likeness: A three-year-old actress reenacts a game of tennis for the reconstruction (left) and a picture of Maddie on the court in 2007. TV reconstruction: Actors portray Kate and Gerry McCann having dinner with their friends in the resort. Night: Another scene shows Maddie's parents closing the curtains in their room on the night their daughter disappeared. The devastated couple – who found themselves suspects in the initial inquiry by Portuguese police – talk about how her disappearance has left a ‘huge hole’ in their family’s life. In a moving interview with Kirsty Young, Kate McCann says: ‘We’re not the ones that have done something wrong here. It’s the person who’s gone into that apartment and taken a little girl away from her family.’ Gerry McCann says: ‘When it’s a special occasion, when you should be your happiest and Madeleine’s not there, that’s when it really hits home.’ His wife adds: ‘It’s when you have big family occasions really. That’s it isn’t it? Family occasion and you haven’t got your complete family.’ Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood, the senior investigating officer, will announce ‘a revelation moment’ in Scotland Yard’s £5million investigation. Officers will also release further e-fits – electronic facial identification technique images – of other potential suspects. They are keen to trace at least two German-speaking men who were seen in the Algarve resort that day. Emotional: An interview with Kate and Gerry McCann will also be shown during the special episode of Crimewatch tonight. Witnesses reported the sightings to Portuguese police, but little importance was placed on them at the time. Now Scotland Yard says tracing the man in the two e-fits is ‘one of the main priorities for the investigation’ after scrutinising the time frame when the abduction could have taken place. They are the first to be issued in relation to the Home Office-funded inquiry into the case. Detectives say their timeline and version of events surrounding Madeleine’s disappearance has ‘significantly changed’, making the two witness sightings far more significant than previously thought. Officers are keeping an open mind as to whether more than one person was responsible for the abduction, which they think may be linked to a series of break-ins at the resort. Disappeared: Madeleine went missing from the Portuguese holiday apartment in 2007 when she was three years old. Mr Redwood said: ‘Whilst this man may or may not be the key to unlocking this investigation, tracing and speaking to him is of vital importance to us. We have witnesses placing him in the resort area around the time of Madeleine’s disappearance. ‘This is far from our only line of inquiry and there will be e-fits released of other sightings as well, who we are equally keen to trace. These people were seen on the day of Madeleine’s disappearance and the days leading up to it.’ The focus of the hunt for Madeleine, from Rothley, Leicestershire, who would now be ten years old, will move to Germany this week when her parents are expected to travel there to make a TV appeal. On Wednesday the German channel ZDF will feature the BBC Crimewatch reconstruction and release sketches of two German-speaking men in their programme Aktenzeichen XY... Ungelost [File Reference XY... Unsolved]. Publicity for that programme says detectives are now going on the ‘offensive’, with inquiries focusing on Germany. It adds: ‘This is the reason why XY will show sketches of two men who appear to speak German and who have so far been paid little or no importance.’ The e-fits will also be shown on Dutch TV as the two ‘German speakers’ may have been Dutch – the accents sound similar. Tonight’s Crimewatch reconstruction will give the most detailed sequence ever made public of the events that led to Madeleine’s disappearance. Detectives believe her kidnappers may have been lurking in or near the McCanns’ holiday apartment as her father went to check on his children. Earlier inquiries focused on the period after that, but they now believe the 45 minutes before that could hold the key. Mr Redwood said: ‘Our work has significantly changed the accepted version of events and it has allowed us to highlight very specific appeal points. I hope that when the public see our investigative strands drawn together, it will bring in new information that moves our investigation forward.’ It emerged yesterday that Greater Manchester Police arrested a man who bragged about seeing Madeleine on a Mediterranean island weeks ago. The man claimed the missing girl had been ‘introduced’ to him. Police were informed after a barrister, who had a conversation with the man at a party in a Manchester suburb in August, reported his concerns. The man was arrested last month on suspicion of possession of drugs and conspiracy to distribute indecent images of children. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police refused to comment yesterday, but sources played down the significance of the arrest. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"- British detectives are searching for Madeleine McCann, who disappeared in Praia da Luz, Portugal, on May 3, 2007. - Two e-fits of a suspect carrying a little blonde girl near the location on the night she disappeared have been issued. - The suspect is described as white, aged 20 to 40, with short brown hair, medium height and build, and clean-shaven. - Scotland Yard is working on a £5 million investigation, with their timeline and version of events having 'significantly changed.' - Officers are now focusing on two German-speaking men seen in the Algarve resort on the day of Madeleine's disappearance. - Madeleine's parents, Gerry and Kate McCann, are expected to travel to Germany to make a TV appeal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Neptune's more varied weather when compared to Uranus is due in part to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune lies over 50% further from the Sun than Uranus, and receives only 40% its amount of sunlight, the two planets' surface temperatures are roughly equal. The upper regions of Neptune's troposphere reach a low temperature of 51.8 K (−221.3 °C). At a depth where the atmospheric pressure equals 1 bar (100 kPa), the temperature is 72.00 K (−201.15 °C). Deeper inside the layers of gas, the temperature rises steadily. As with Uranus, the source of this heating is unknown, but the discrepancy is larger: Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun; whereas Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Neptune is the farthest planet from the Sun, yet its internal energy is sufficient to drive the fastest planetary winds seen in the Solar System. Depending on the thermal properties of its interior, the heat left over from Neptune's formation may be sufficient to explain its current heat flow, though it is more difficult to simultaneously explain Uranus's lack of internal heat while preserving the apparent similarity between the two planets.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"Question: What factors contribute to Neptune's more varied weather compared to Uranus, and how does its distance from the Sun affect its surface temperature and internal heating? Answer: Neptune's more varied weather compared to Uranus is attributed to its higher internal heating. Although Neptune is over 50% farther from the Sun than Uranus and receives only 40% the amount of sunlight, their surface temperatures are almost the same. This is because Neptune radiates about 2.61 times as much energy as it receives from the Sun, while Uranus only radiates 1.1 times as much energy as it receives.

Mr Trump tweeted: \\"Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than 4 billion. Cancel order!\\" The government has a contract with Boeing to build two or more new planes. The White House appeared to cast doubt on the figures quoted by Mr Trump. \\"Some of the statistics that have been cited, shall we say, don't appear to reflect the nature of the financial arrangement between Boeing and the Department of Defence,\\" White House spokesman Josh Earnest said. The new planes would enter service around 2024. Boeing shares fell more than 1% after the president-elect's tweet, but recovered most of their losses in afternoon trading. Mr Trump would not fly on the new planes unless he won a second term in the 2020 election. The president-elect also announced on Tuesday that Japan's SoftBank has agreed to invest 50bn (Â£39.4bn) in the US aimed at creating 50,000 new jobs. Mr Trump revealed the plan after meeting SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son at Trump Tower. \\"Masa said he would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!\\" he tweeted. In other developments: As president and commander-in-chief, Donald Trump will have the power to cancel the contract with Boeing for the new planes. But if he does, it could cost the US taxpayer even more as the new president tries to save money. The US government has already signed a contract with Boeing for 170m (Â£134m; â‚¬158m). Additional funding has also been earmarked for the two new planes. The Government Accountability Office - an independent government auditor - estimates the final cost will be 3.2bn. The planes are still in early design phases, though - much of the money has yet to be spent and has not had a chance to overrun the cost estimates. Negotiation between Boeing and the US government could cut some of the costs, but if Mr Trump pulls out of the Boeing contract entirely the country may lose the money it is already contracted to pay. Mr Trump now uses his own plane, but as president he would travel aboard Air Force One, which is equipped with special safety, defensive and communications equipment. He is known for his admiration of his Trump-branded Boeing 757 jet, boasting to Rolling Stone last year that his aircraft was \\"bigger than Air Force One, which is a step down from this in every way\\". \\"Did you know it was featured on the Discovery Channel as the world's most luxurious jetliner?\\" he said at the time. The president-elect told reporters on Tuesday at Trump Tower in New York that Boeing was \\"doing a little bit of a number\\" and the cost was \\"ridiculous\\". \\"We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money,\\" he added. Mr Trump's remarks came after the Chicago Tribune published a column early on Tuesday in which Boeing chief executive Dennis Muilenburg suggested the president-elect roll back his anti-trade rhetoric. \\"If we do not lead when it comes to writing these [trade] rules, our competitors will write them for us,\\" Mr Muilenburg told the newspaper. The Government Accountability Office estimates that the project's overall cost will be 3.2bn, a figure that is expected to rise. The US Air Force said it had budgeted 2.7bn for the project, \\"but expects this number to change\\". Boeing spokesman Todd Blecher, in a statement, said: \\"We are currently under contract for 170m to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the president of the United States. \\"We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme, allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer.\\"","completion":"President-elect Donald Trump criticized Boeing's costs for the new Air Force One planes, calling for the cancelation of the order; while the White House cast doubt on the 4bn costs cited by Trump and the US Air Force budgeted 2.7bn, the Government Accountability Office estimates the total cost at 3.2bn."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One of her ancestors, Reverend Edmund Hawthorne, sealed away his own soul in a cursed artifact, the Hawthorne Amulet, to gain immortality and uttered a prophecy that his soul will be expelled by the last of his lineage. However, if the prophecy does not come true, it threatens to unleash a dark and malevolent force upon the world. Meanwhile, Mary starts noticing a series of strange and unexplained events happening around town. Locals begin to act strangely, detached and in some cases, violent.

Question: What is the song that plays every morning? Movie plot title: Groundhog Day Movie plot: On February 1, self-centered and sour TV meteorologist Phil Connors (Bill Murray), news producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) and cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) from fictional Pittsburgh television station WPBH-TV9 travel to Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, to cover the annual Groundhog Day festivities with Punxsutawney Phil, the Groundhog. Having grown tired of this assignment, Phil grudgingly gives his report during the festival and parade.After the celebration concludes, a blizzard develops that Connors had predicted would miss them, closing the roads and shutting down long-distance phone services, forcing the team to return to Punxsutawney. Connors awakens the next morning, however, to find it is February 2 again, and his day unfolds in almost exactly the same way. Connors can change his behavior, but other people do and say the same things they did and said the previous day, unless Connors changes something. He is aware of the repetition, but everyone else seems to be living February 2 for the first time. This recursion repeats the following morning and the one after that, and over and over again. For Connors, Groundhog Day begins each morning at 6:00 A.M., when he wakes up in his room in a Victorian bed and breakfast. His clock radio is always playing the same song, Sonny & Cher's \\"I Got You Babe.\\" His memories of the \\"previous\\" day are intact, but he's trapped in a seemingly endless time loop, repeating the same day in the same small town.After briefly trying to rationalize his situation, and then thinking he is insane, Connors takes advantage of learning the day's events and the information he is able to gather about the town's inhabitants, and finds that his actions have no long-term consequences for himself. He revels in this situation for a time: seducing beautiful women, stealing money, even driving drunk and experiencing a police chase.

The term was first used in print in 1957 by P. Schuyler Miller in a review of John W. Campbell, Jr.'s \\"Islands of Space\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\". The complementary term soft science fiction, formed by analogy to hard science fiction, first appeared in the late 1970s. The term is formed by analogy to the popular distinction between the \\"hard\\" (natural) and \\"soft\\" (social) sciences. Science fiction critic Gary Westfahl argues that neither term is part of a rigorous taxonomy; instead they are approximate ways of characterizing stories that reviewers and commentators have found useful. - Technology (\\"science of craft\\", from Greek , \\"techne\\", \\"art, skill, cunning of hand\\"; and , \\"-logia\\") is the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines which can be operated without detailed knowledge of their workings. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. - Stephen Reeder Donaldson ( born May 13 , 1947 ) is an American fantasy , science fiction and mystery novelist , most famous for The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant , his ten - novel fantasy series . His work is characterized by psychological complexity , conceptual abstractness , moral bleakness , and the use of an arcane vocabulary , and has attracted critical praise for its \`\` imagination , vivid characterizations , and fast pace . '' He earned his bachelor 's degree from The College of Wooster and a Master 's degree from Kent State University . He currently resides in New Mexico . In the United Kingdom he is usually called \`\` Stephen Donaldson '' ( without the \`\` R '' ) . - A bachelor's degree (from Middle Latin \\"baccalaureus\\") or baccalaureate (from Modern Latin \\"baccalaureatus\\") is an undergraduate academic degree awarded by colleges and universities upon completion of a course of study lasting three to seven years (depending on institution and academic discipline). In some institutions and educational systems, some bachelor's degrees can only be taken as graduate or postgraduate degrees after a first degree has been completed. In countries with qualifications frameworks, bachelor's degrees are normally one of the major levels in the framework (sometimes two levels where non-honours and honours bachelor's degrees are considered separately), although some qualifications titled bachelor's degrees may be at other levels (e.g. MBBS) and some qualifications with non-bachelor's titles may be classified as bachelor's degrees (e.g. the Scottish MA and Canadian MD). - Kent State University (KSU) is a public research university in Kent, Ohio, United States. The university also includes seven regional campuses in Northeast Ohio and additional facilities in the region and internationally.

It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting in a fictional universe or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot. The term \\"high fantasy\\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \\"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\\". - The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant is a series of ten high fantasy novels written by American author Stephen R.

Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Innovation can be defined simply as a \\"new idea, device, or method\\". However, innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. This is accomplished through more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are readily available to markets, governments and society. The term \\"innovation\\" can be defined as something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that \\"breaks into\\" the market or society. It is related to, but not the same as, invention. Innovation is often manifested via the engineering process. The exnovation is the opposite of innovation. - Mexico (, modern Nahuatl ), officially the United Mexican States, is a federal republic in the southern half of North America. It is bordered to the north by the United States; to the south and west by the Pacific Ocean; to the southeast by Guatemala, Belize, and the Caribbean Sea; and to the east by the Gulf of Mexico.

These as-yet-hypothetical life forms may range from simple single-celled organisms to beings with civilizations far more advanced than humanity. Although many scientists expect extraterrestrial life to exist, there is no unambiguous evidence for its existence so far. The science of extraterrestrial life is known as exobiology. - Analysis is the process of breaking a complex topic or substance into smaller parts in order to gain a better understanding of it. The technique has been applied in the study of mathematics and logic since before Aristotle (384322 B.C.), though \\"analysis\\" as a formal concept is a relatively recent development. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages.

Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Florence is the capital city of the Italian region of Tuscany and of the Metropolitan City of Florence. It is the most populous city in Tuscany, with 383,083 inhabitants, expanding to over 1,520,000 in the metropolitan area. - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - An academic degree is a qualification awarded on successful completion of a course of study in higher education, normally at a college or university. These institutions commonly offer degrees at various levels, typically including bachelor's, masters and doctorates, often alongside other academic certificates, and professional degrees. The most common undergraduate degree is the bachelor's degree, although in some countries lower qualifications are titled degrees (e.g. associate degrees in the US or foundation degrees in the UK) while in others a higher-level first degree is more usual. - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.

The Magna Carta: A Brief History Signed in 1215 on the banks of the River Thames by King John of England, the Magna Carta sought to establish fair governance and limit the monarch's power. Initially an agreement between the king and angry barons, the document laid the foundation for the concept of justice and rule of law in a time when the king's rule was arbitrary. While many of the original clauses have since been revoked, the Magna Carta remains an icon of civil rights and democracy and is considered the cornerstone of modern constitutionalism. Celebrating with Commemorative Stamps In an attempt to commemorate this momentous occasion, postal authorities have teamed up with historical organizations to design and issue an exclusive set of stamps that mark the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta.

The Design and Elements of the Stamps The commemorative stamps are adorned with intricate designs that exude the historical weight of the Magna Carta. Each stamp in the set features a unique aspect of the document, capturing the essence of this long-standing symbol of justice and fairness. One stamp presents a replica of King John's royal seal, used to authenticate the original document. Another features an illustration of the barons, highlighting their pivotal role in the drafting and implementation of the Magna Carta. Yet another stamp showcases the critical quill pen and inkwell, symbolizing the essential tools used in creating this enduring historical relic. The stamps also delve into the Magna Carta's lasting effects, with one stamp portraying an image of the United States Constitution, emphasizing the document's influence on the formation of the U.S. democratic system. Finally, a stamp with an image of the iconic document itself serves to remind us of the humble beginnings of modern-day governance. The Meaning and Impact of the Commemorative Stamps The release of these commemorative stamps offers a unique way for individuals to participate in the celebration of the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta. They provide a tangible reminder of the longstanding impact this document has had on the principles and development of democracy in Western societies. Through the medium of stamps, this important milestone is made accessible to a broader audience, enabling us to honor the past while reflecting on our responsibility to uphold justice, fairness, and accountability in the present. Conclusion As the world celebrates the 800th anniversary of the Magna Carta, the release of these commemorative stamps contributes to the understanding and appreciation of this vital historical monument. As we pay tribute to this groundbreaking document, we must remember its purpose in shaping the human rights and democratic values that we cherish today. With these stamps, we take part in a global celebration that encourages reflection on our collective history and motivates us to continue pursuing the ideals established by this iconic decree."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"VA-873 was an attack squadron of the U.S. Navy Reserve, operating as a part of the military's aviation branch. The squadron was primarily responsible for carrying out offensive missions against enemy targets, as well as providing air support to other units when necessary. It is essential to mention that it falls under the legacy of the Reserve Attack Squadron VA-873, which was an essential component of the reserve forces in the past. The squadron VA-873 was based at a station located near a bay called \\"San Francisco Bay.\\" San Francisco Bay is a large, shallow estuary along the northern California coast in the United States. It is an incredibly important geopolitical and economic region, serving as a strategic hub for both military and civilian purposes due to its location near the Pacific Ocean and to the bustling city of San Francisco. San Francisco Bay offers a natural deepwater harbor, serving as a critical base for naval and maritime operations. As a result, the U.S. Navy Reserve established a base at the bay to secure the presence of the military and to maintain operational readiness. The Naval Air Station Alameda (NAS Alameda) was once the primary base for VA-873, situated on the western shore of San Francisco Bay, east of San Francisco and just south of Oakland. NAS Alameda, originally commissioned in 1940, was a vital Naval Air Station throughout World War II, the Korean War, and the Cold War era. The main purpose of this military installation was to support Navy and Marine Corps aviation units, as well as to conduct anti-submarine warfare operations. In summary, VA-873 was a critical attack squadron of the U.S. Navy Reserve. It was based at a station near San Francisco Bay, specifically at the Naval Air Station Alameda. The bay and its strategic location provided invaluable support to the Navy and Marine Corps aviation operations. Furthermore, positioning the VA-873 squadron in this area allowed for swift and efficient response capabilities in times of need, thus ensuring the continued operational readiness of the U.S. Navy Reserve."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the October Tour, U2 decamped to a rented cottage in Howth, where they lived, wrote new songs, and rehearsed for their third album, War. Significant musical breakthroughs were achieved by the Edge in August 1982 during a two-week period of independent songwriting, while the other band members vacationed and Bono honeymooned with his wife Ali. From September to November, the group recorded War at Windmill Lane Studios. Lillywhite, who had a policy of not working with an artist more than twice, was convinced by the group to return as their producer for a third time. The recording sessions featured contributions from violinist Steve Wickham and the female singers of Kid Creole and the Coconuts. For the first time, Mullen agreed to play drums to a click track to keep time. After completing the album, U2 undertook a short tour of Western Europe in December. War's lead single, \\"New Year's Day\\", was released on 1 January 1983. It reached number 10 in the UK and became the group's first hit outside of Europe; in the US, it received extensive radio coverage and peaked at number 53. Resolving their doubts of the October period, U2 released War in February. Critically, the album received favourable reviews, although a few UK reviewers were critical of it. Nonetheless, it was the band's first commercial success, debuting at number one in the UK, while reaching number 12 in the US. War's sincerity and \\"rugged\\" guitar were intentionally at odds with the trendier synthpop of the time. A record on which the band \\"turned pacifism itself into a crusade\\", War was lyrically more political than their first two records, focusing on the physical and emotional effects of warfare. The album included the protest song \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\", in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of the 1972 Bloody Sunday shooting with Easter Sunday. Other songs from the record addressed topics such as nuclear proliferation (\\"Seconds\\") and the Polish Solidarity movement (\\"New Year's Day\\"). War was U2's first record to feature...

While he is very excited about trading I get the impression he feels a little overwhelmed and he is a very concerned about how much trading will limit his vacation time. He said that he and Darren (the guy he works with) had been meeting with consultants all week to get up to speed and therefore the week had pretty much just been one long meeting. It is around this time that he brings up the vacation thing and how, to his dismay, as a trader you work when the markets are open and you're only off when they're closed. As a result, he's decided to get in his long visit home ASAP, i.e. \\"I'm leaving tomorrow (Friday) to go to California for a week.\\" I make sure I heard him correctly and yes he said leaving, tomorrow and 1 whole week (7 days) AND at no point does he ask to get together before he leaves.

They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

To do this, we will add 25 to both sides of the equation. 0 + 25 = -5w - 25 + 25 This simplifies to: 25 = -5w Step 3: Solve for 'w'. Finally, we need to find the value of 'w'. To do this, we will divide both sides of the equation by -5. 25 / (-5) = -5w / (-5) This simplifies to: -5 = w So, w = -5 is the solution to the equation 0 = -3w - 2w - 25."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the background: Chemists look at the world in two ways, often simultaneously. The two worlds of the chemist are the macroscopic world and the microscopic world. Macroscopic refers to substances and objects that can be seen, touched, and measured directly. Microscopic refers to the small particles that make up all matter. Chemists must observe matter and do experiments macroscopically and then make generalizations and propose explanations that are microscopic in nature. For example, anyone can observe the physical change in appearance that occurs as an iron object such as a tractor that is left out in the elements gradually turns to rust. However, a chemist looks at the rusting tractor and thinks about what is going on with the individual atoms that make up the iron and how they are changing as a result of exposure to oxygen in the air and water from rain. Throughout your study of chemistry, you will often switch back and forth between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds. and the situation: Two cousins went to college to get a B.S. Greg studied Biology, and his younger cousin Dawn decided to study chemistry. They both graduated Summa Cum Laudae. Answer the following question: Which cousin studied less about the macroscopic world of chemistry? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Greg, the cousin who studied Biology, studied less about the macroscopic world of chemistry. While both Biology and Chemistry involve the study of matter and natural processes, they each place a different emphasis on the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of these processes. In their studies, both Greg and Dawn would have been exposed to both the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, but to varying extents. Biology primarily focuses on living organisms, their structures, functions, growth, origin, evolution, and distribution. Although biological studies incorporate a certain level of chemistry, the focus is generally more on the macroscopic aspects, such as entire organisms, organ systems, and ecology, rather than the microscopic aspects involving atoms and molecules. On the other hand, Chemistry is the science that deals with the composition, structure, and properties of substances (matter), the transformations they undergo (reactions), and the energy that is released or absorbed during these reactions. Chemists often study both macroscopic and microscopic aspects of matter, with a strong emphasis on the microscopic level. In chemistry, the macroscopic observations and measurements often serve as a basis to form hypotheses, create models, and explain phenomena at the atomic and molecular level. In her Chemistry studies, Dawn would have frequently switched between the macroscopic and microscopic worlds, using her knowledge of both to explain and understand chemical reactions, properties of substances, and chemical bonding. Greg, as a Biology major, would have spent more time studying the macroscopic aspects, focusing on larger scales such as organ systems and ecosystem interactions. Therefore, it is clear that Greg, the cousin who studied Biology, studied less about the macroscopic world of chemistry compared to Dawn, who pursued a degree in Chemistry."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Botany Systematic botany is part of systematic biology, which is concerned with the range and diversity of organisms and their relationships, particularly as determined by their evolutionary history. It involves, or is related to, biological classification, scientific taxonomy and phylogenetics. Biological classification is the method by which botanists group organisms into categories such as genera or species. Biological classification is a form of scientific taxonomy. Modern taxonomy is rooted in the work of Carl Linnaeus, who grouped species according to shared physical characteristics. These groupings have since been revised to align better with the Darwinian principle of common descent – grouping organisms by ancestry rather than superficial characteristics. While scientists do not always agree on how to classify organisms, molecular phylogenetics, which uses DNA sequences as data, has driven many recent revisions along evolutionary lines and is likely to continue to do so. The dominant classification system is called Linnaean taxonomy. It includes ranks and binomial nomenclature. The nomenclature of botanical organisms is codified in the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (ICN) and administered by the International Botanical Congress. Q: How did Darwin change the grouping pioneered by Linnaeus?","completion":"Imagine you have a big box of toys and you want to organize them. Linnaeus, a scientist long ago, started organizing living things (like plants) in groups based on how they looked. He put plants that looked similar together, just like you would put all your toy cars together in one box. Later, another scientist named Darwin discovered that living things change over time, and that these changes happen because they have common \\"parents\\" or ancestors. Think about how all your toy cars have wheels and can roll on the floor because they were made to do the same thing. Darwin changed how we group living things, like plants, by looking at their shared history or family tree instead of just how they look. This is like grouping your toys based on who made them or what they are used for, rather than just their color or shape. Now, scientists use Darwin's ideas to better understand how living things are related and share a common history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

They use the Internet for no other purposes than to send or receive emails. It's all very easy. You prepare the message, log onto the Internet, and send it. The message first goes to your Internet Service Provider's mail server, which in turn sends it to the recipient's mail server. On the way your message may go through several servers, each reading the name in order to send it to the right server. The message then remains in the recipient's mail email server until he requests it by \\"checking his mail\\". The benefits of emails are obvious: mostly it's quick. Also, many people feel that the rules for regular mails don't apply to email, making it less formal, which in turn make email easier to write and send. It's not just friends and coworkers that are receiving emails. Wherever you look, the Web is providing email addresses. This has made communication between strangers easier than ever.

My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen.

After receiving his conviction by the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \\"Tick-tock, Doc.\\" Nine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar torture murders with very similar circumstances occur. Gramm is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as FBI Special Agent Frank Parks (William Forsythe) about his connection to the latest victim, Dale Morris, a former psychology student of Gramm's with whom he was at a party the night before, just hours before her death. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using software to distort their voice, threatening he has 88 minutes to live. He later reports the call to his secretary Shelly (Amy Brenneman) and has her put together a risk assessment profile of potential perpetrators. Gramm receives another threatening phone call while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKenzie).

Question: is gilley's in pasadena texas still open?","completion":"No, the original Gilley's nightclub located in Pasadena, Texas is no longer in operation. Gilley's was a renowned country and western nightclub that opened its doors in Pasadena, Texas in 1971. Its owners, country music star Mickey Gilley and his business partner Sherwood Cryer, transformed what was initially a simple bar into one of the country's most famous honky-tonk bars. The club was especially recognized for its large mechanical bull, El Toro, which was famously featured in the 1980 film \\"Urban Cowboy\\", starring John Travolta. Gilley's Pasadena club was not only the largest honky-tonk bar in the US but also held a significant place in popular culture. However, amid several business disagreements between the owners and a series of legal battles, the club was eventually closed in 1989. In 1990, the vacant building tragically burned to the ground under mysterious circumstances and was never rebuilt. On October 2, 2003, Gilley's was rebooted and reopened. However, this time it was not in Pasadena, Texas, but in a different location in the Cedars neighborhood of Dallas, Texas.

Currently, ultra-deepwater drilling platforms can operate at depths of up to 12,000 feet (3,660 meters), while specialized drilling vessels and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) can perform drilling tasks at even greater depths. Advances in technology are continually expanding drilling capabilities, but as of now, 12,000 feet is considered the maximum limit for typical offshore drilling operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery. Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it. Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance.

The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic. Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis. In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back. Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter. All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis. Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods. Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them. They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth. Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence. Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.

Please answer the following question: Article: A group of old classmates, who have succeeded in their work, got together to visit their old university professor. The conversation soon turned to complaining about the stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many cups-china , plastic and glass, some plain looking, some expensive and some lovely. The professor told them to help themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said, \\"Can you notice all the nice looking expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones? While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress.\\" \\"What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups.\\" \\"Now think about this: life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups. They are just tools to hold and contain life, and do not change the quality of life. Sometimes, by concentrating only on the cups, we fail to enjoy the coffee. So don't let the cups drive you, enjoy the coffee instead.\\" Question: What can we learn from the old professor's words? Yes or no, is the answer \\"We should concentrate on life itself but not other unimportant things\\"? A:","completion":"From the old professor's words, we can learn a valuable lesson about focusing on what truly matters in life, rather than being preoccupied with superficial, materialistic things. The professor's analogy of coffee cups representing jobs, money, and social positions highlights the fact that these are merely tools to help contain and manage our lives, but they do not determine the quality and contentment of life. The coffee, symbolizing life itself, is what we should be cherishing and enjoying. So, yes, the answer is \\"We should concentrate on life itself but not other unimportant things.\\" By placing too much emphasis on the \\"cups,\\" we can lose sight of the importance of enjoying the \\"coffee\\" or the essence of life. It is essential to remember that while material success and achievements do play a role in our well-being, they should not define our self-worth or happiness. Instead, we should appreciate and focus on what truly enriches our lives, such as relationships, experiences, personal growth, and overall well-being. The professor's wisdom serves as a reminder that one's fulfillment in life does not solely depend on external factors, but rather on our attitude and perspective towards what is genuinely significant. By re-evaluating our priorities and emphasizing the more profound aspects of life, we can gain a greater sense of inner peace, happiness, and contentment. In conclusion, the old professor's analogy conveys a lesson about the importance of focusing on the essence of life, rather than allowing external, materialistic factors to dictate our happiness and well-being. By recognizing that the \\"cups\\" are only tools that help contain and manage our lives, we can shift our attention to what truly matters, enabling us to enjoy the \\"coffee\\" or the true richness life has to offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Who wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: Bush starred in the 1990 black comedy film Les Dogs, produced by The Comic Strip for BBC television. Bush plays the bride Angela at a wedding set in a post-apocalyptic Britain. In another Comic Strip Presents film, GLC, she produced and sang on the theme song \\"Ken\\". The song was written about Ken Livingstone, the leader of the Greater London Council and future mayor of London, who at the time was working with musicians to help the Labour Party garner the youth vote.Bush wrote and performed the song \\"The Magician\\", using a fairground-like arrangement, for Menahem Golan's 1979 film The Magician of Lublin. The track was scored and arranged by Michael Kamen. In 1986, she wrote and recorded \\"Be Kind to My Mistakes\\" for the Nicolas Roeg film Castaway. An edited version of this track was used as the B-side to her 1989 single \\"This Woman's Work\\". In 1988, the song \\"This Woman's Work\\" was featured in the John Hughes film She's Having a Baby, and a slightly remixed version appeared on Bush's album The Sensual World. The song has since appeared on television shows, and in 2005 reached number-eight on the UK download chart after featuring in a British television advertisement for the charity NSPCC.In 1999, Bush wrote and recorded a song for the Disney film Dinosaur, but the track was not included on the soundtrack. According to the winter 1999 issue of HomeGround, a Bush fanzine, it was scrapped when Disney asked her to rewrite the song and she refused. Also in 1999, Bush's song \\"The Sensual World\\" was featured prominently in Canadian filmmaker Atom Egoyan's film \\"Felicia's Journey\\".In 2007, Bush was asked to write a song for The Golden Compass soundtrack which made reference to the lead character, Lyra Belacqua.

The sentence appears to convey both appreciation and criticism, using opposing tones to create a balanced viewpoint. On one hand, the sentence reflects a positive sentiment through the use of the words \\"lovely\\" and \\"cuteness.\\" These words express appreciation for the object being described, suggesting that there are attractive, endearing, and even charming qualities about it. The word \\"trifle\\" also adds a sense of playfulness and lightness to the description, supporting the idea that the subject is enjoyable to some extent. On the other hand, the sentence also introduces a negative sentiment with the phrase \\"unfortunately, is a little too in love with its own cuteness.\\" This part signifies a form of criticism, as the author implies that an excessive focus on or obsession with being cute detracts from the overall appeal of the object in question. The use of \\"unfortunately\\" functions as a softening or disapproving modifier, further acknowledging that there is an issue or shortcoming with the subject being discussed. Overall, the sentiment of this sentence is perceived as a blend of positive and negative emotions, with a leaning towards a more critical or disappointed tone. The author acknowledges the enjoyable aspects of the subject but finds the overemphasis on cuteness to be problematic.

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","completion":"Ayam penyet is a popular and traditional dish originating from the Southeast Asian region, particularly in Malaysia. This culinary delight, which consists of flattened, deep-fried chicken, has gained significant prominence not only in Malaysia but also among food enthusiasts worldwide. The term \\"ayam penyet\\" can be broken down into two words: \\"ayam\\" means chicken, while \\"penyet\\" essentially translates to \\"flattened\\" or \\"smashed.\\" The process of flattening the chicken is a crucial aspect of the dish, as it enhances the absorption of the diverse and aromatic spices, ultimately leading to a richer flavor profile. The flavorful marinade typically consists of a blend of spices and herbs such as garlic, shallots, turmeric, galangal, coriander, and lemongrass. The marinade penetrates the chicken, ensuring that each piece is equally infused with an array of piquant flavors. After being marinated, the chicken is then coated in a seasoned flour mixture, commonly made from rice flour and tapioca starch. This unique combination gives the chicken the desired golden-brown, crispy texture once it's deep-fried. As a traditional cooking method in Malaysian cuisine, deep-frying imparts depth and intensity to the chicken's flavors, creating an irresistible dish that diners can't resist. Complementing the vibrant tastes of the dish, ayam penyet is typically served with a fiery sambal, a chili paste that raises its heat level to new heights. Sambal often includes ingredients such as red and green chilies, shrimp paste, garlic, vinegar, and sugar. The accompanying sambal elevates the ayam penyet experience, adding a tangy, savory dimension to contrast and bring out the best in the chicken's flavors. In Malaysia and other parts of the region, ayam penyet is often presented on a banana leaf or a woven plate called a tampah, with a side of warm rice and an assortment of fresh vegetables, such as cucumber and long beans. These accompaniments create a harmonious medley of textures and tastes on the plate, providing a wholesome and satisfying meal. Given the dish's cultural significance in Malaysia and its growing reputation outside the region, it is no wonder that ayam penyet has become a gastronomic symbol of unity. The delicious fusion of spices, the tender yet crispy chicken, and the combination of flavors make ayam penyet an all-time favorite among both locals and tourists alike. This quintessential Malaysian dish represents not only the regional flavors but also the vibrant and diverse culture of the nation's culinary heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer:","completion":"His eye pain could be attributed to a combination of factors, rather than a single one among the options provided. Based on the context, potential causes for his eye pain include: 1. Not removing his contacts: Continuously wearing contact lenses without taking them out can lead to a buildup of protein deposits and other debris on the lenses. This can cause irritation, discomfort, and even infections in the eyes. It is essential to take out contact lenses as recommended by the lens manufacturer and eye care professional. This allows the eyes to breathe and helps maintain proper eye hygiene. 2. Lack of sleep: Insufficient sleep might not only make the individual feel tired but can also negatively affect their eyes. Sleep is essential for the overall health of the eyes, as it provides necessary rest and allows the eyes to repair and recover from daily strain. A lack of sleep can lead to eye fatigue, dryness, strain, and other forms of discomfort. 3. Dry eyes: Both not taking out contact lenses and not getting enough sleep can contribute to dry eyes. Dry eye syndrome occurs when there is an imbalance in the tear system and the eyes are not adequately lubricated. This can result in itching, burning, redness, and a feeling of grittiness in the eyes. It is essential to address the root cause of dry eyes and follow appropriate treatment recommendations given by an eye care professional. 4. Eye strain: Additionally, his eyes might be experiencing strain due to excessive exposure to digital devices, insufficient lighting while reading or working, or even improper vision correction through his contacts. Prolonged eye strain can result in discomfort and tiredness in the eyes, exacerbating the eye pain. Based on these factors, the most accurate answer to why he is experiencing eye pain is not limited to a single option listed above. Instead, it appears to be a combination of not removing his contact lenses, not getting enough sleep, dry eyes, and potential eye strain, which should be addressed through proper eye care and consultation with an eye care professional."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New Legitimacy: Organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control Las Vegas — corporate cash. Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage — which became an instant success. Question: \\"What did Howard Hughes purchase during his Vegas buying spree?\\" Response: \\"Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question.

You should remove all vowels from the given string. Vowels are: i,e,a,u,o. The character 'y' or 'Y' does not count as a vowel. Q: mMXGUoueMY A:","completion":"To solve this task, we need to iterate over the string, checking each character to see whether it is a vowel or not. If it isn't, we will add it to a new string that will be our result. If it is a vowel, we simply skip it and move to the next character. Also, it's important to remember that vowels can be both lower case and upper case. Step by step process: 1. Initialize an empty string, we will append non-vowels to this string. 2. Iterate over the given string, character by character. 3. Check if the character is a vowel or not. In both lower case and upper case. (vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U') 4. If the character is a vowel, do nothing and move to the next character. 5. If the character is not a vowel, append the character to our new string. 6. Continue this process until we have iterated over all of the characters in the original string. 7. The new string now contains the original string but without any vowels. Let's go through this process with the given string 'mMXGUoueMY': 1. The new string is currently empty: '' 2. The first character of the string is 'm', 'm' is not a vowel, so we add it to the new string. 3. Proceed to the next character 'M', 'M' is also not a vowel, add it to the new string. 4. Proceed to the next character 'X', 'X' is not a vowel, add it to the new string. 5. Proceed to the next character 'G', 'G' is not a vowel, add it to the new string. 6. Proceed to the next character 'U', 'U' is a vowel, do not add to the new string. 7. Proceed with this process, adding 'M' and 'Y' to the new string, but skipping 'o', 'u', and 'e' as they are vowels. 8.

US stock futures pointed to a slightly lower open on Tuesday as investors take a step back after last week #39;s three-day rally, with shares of drug maker Merck amp; Co. What is this text about?","completion":"This text is about the United States (US) stock market, specifically the anticipation of a slightly lower open for stock futures on a particular Tuesday. The mentioned activity in the market comes after a three-day rally during the previous week. The text also highlights Merck & Co., a pharmaceutical company, possibly indicating that the company's shares could be of interest to investors in the context of the market's trending behavior. Stock futures refer to contracts that obligate the buyer to purchase a specific number of shares of the underlying stock at a predetermined price, typically for delivery at a future date. These futures provide an indication of where the market is expected to open, based on various factors, including the global market, economic data, and company news. In this case, investors are expecting a slightly lower open for stock futures, which insinuates the possibility of a slight decline in the market after a three-day rally. A three-day rally refers to continuous growth in the stock market for three consecutive days. In this case, the rally from the previous week could have driven up stock prices and made investors more cautious about entering the market at this point, prompting them to take a step back to assess the situation. This behavior is common in stock markets, as they can experience periods of fluctuation where investors are constantly analyzing trends to anticipate potential changes and determine if it is an appropriate time to buy or sell stocks. Lastly, the text mentions shares of the pharmaceutical company Merck & Co. While it does not provide specific information, this could imply that the company's shares might be influenced by the anticipated lower opening of the US stock market. It could also indicate that Merck & Co. is a company to watch, possibly due to recent developments or news related to the company that could affect its stock price."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"No, the suggested answer does not directly address the question of \\"how deep can be drill for deep underwater.\\" Instead, it provides information about the market size of the industry, which is unrelated to drilling depths. To answer the original question, drilling depths for deep underwater operations can vary depending on technology and specific drilling projects. However, in general, deepwater drilling typically refers to drilling activities at water depths between 1,000 and 7,500 feet (300 to 2,300 meters) or even beyond. Ultra-deepwater drilling can reach depths of 7,500 feet (2,300 meters) or more. These depths are subject to change with the advancement of drilling technology, and the actual depth will always depend on the specific project and available technology.

Please answer the following question: Information: - \\"Help Me Make It Through The Night\\" is a country music ballad written and composed by Kris Kristofferson and released on his 1970 album \\"Kristofferson.\\" - Kristoffer \\"Kris\\" Kristofferson (born June 22, 1936) is an American singer, songwriter, musician and actor. He wrote and recorded the songs \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\", \\"For the Good Times\\", \\"Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down\\" and \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night\\". Kristofferson composed his own songs and collaborated with Nashville songwriters such as Shel Silverstein. In 1985, Kristofferson joined fellow country artists Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash in forming the country music supergroup The Highwaymen. In 2004, Kristofferson was inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame. He is also known for his starring roles in \\"Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore\\" and \\"A Star Is Born\\", the latter for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor. - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. - Johnny Cash (born J. R. Cash; February 26, 1932 September 12, 2003) was an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, actor, and author. He was widely considered one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century and one of the best-selling music artists of all time, having sold more than 90 million records worldwide. Although primarily remembered as a country music icon, his genre-spanning songs and sound embraced rock and roll, rockabilly, blues, folk, and gospel. This crossover appeal won Cash the rare honor of multiple inductions in the Country Music, Rock and Roll, and Gospel Music Halls of Fame. - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist. - \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\" is a song written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster, originally performed by Roger Miller. Others performed the song later, including the Grateful Dead, Kristofferson himself, Kenny Rogers and The First Edition and most famously by Janis Joplin, whose posthumously released version topped the U.S. singles chart in 1971, making the song the second posthumously released No. 1 single in U.S. chart history after \\"(Sittin' On) The Dock of the Bay\\" by Otis Redding. \\"Billboard\\" ranked Joplin's version as the No. 11 song for 1971. - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins. - Sings Kristofferson is a studio album recorded by Willie Nelson in 1979 consisting of all covers of Kris Kristofferson songs . It reached # 5 on the US Country albums chart , # 42 on the US Pop albums charts , and was certified gold in Canada and platinum in the US . The cover is very simple , a single picture of Nelson 's face against a black background , with the song titles to the right of his face . The back cover is the same background with both Nelson and Kristofferson 's faces together . - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'record label'.

Washington (CNN) Jared Kushner met earlier this month with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team as part of the investigation into Russia's meddling in the election, according to two people familiar with the meeting. Mueller's team specifically asked Kushner about former national security advisor Michael Flynn, who is under investigation by the special counsel, two sources said. Flynn was the dominant topic of the conversation, one of the sources said. \\"Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so,\\" Abbe Lowell, Kushner's lawyer, told CNN. The conversation lasted less than 90 minutes, one person familiar with the meeting said, adding that Mueller's team asked Kushner to clear up some questions he was asked by lawmakers and details that emerged through media reports.

(Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner has been questioned by special counsel Robert Mueller's team of investigators about former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a person familiar with the investigation confirmed to The Associated Press. The person said Wednesday that the questioning of Kushner earlier this month took about 90 minutes or less and was aimed in part at establishing whether Kushner had any information on Flynn that might be exculpatory. The person said multiple White House witnesses have been asked about their knowledge of Flynn, who was forced to resign from his national security adviser job at the White House in February after officials concluded he had misled them about his contacts with the Russian ambassador. The confirmation of Kushner's interview came as prosecutors working for Mueller postponed grand jury testimony related to Flynn's private business dealings. The reason for the postponement was not immediately clear, but it comes one week after attorneys for Flynn alerted Trump's legal team that they could no longer share information about the case. That discussion between lawyers was widely seen as a possible indication that Flynn was moving to cooperate with Mueller's investigation or attempting to negotiate a deal for himself. An attorney for Flynn, Robert Kelner, did not immediately respond to email and phone messages Wednesday afternoon. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined comment. In a statement, Kushner's attorney, Abbe Lowell, said, \\"Mr. Kushner has voluntarily cooperated with all relevant inquiries and will continue to do so.\\" The details of Kushner's questioning and the postponement of the grand jury testimony were confirmed by people familiar with Mueller's investigation. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to publicly discuss the ongoing investigation. The grand testimony that had been scheduled for the coming days related to Flynn's firm, Flynn Intel Group, its work with a public relations firm and interactions with congressional staff, one of the people said. Mueller and the FBI have been interested in hearing from employees at the public relations firm, SGR LLC, because of the firm's work with Flynn Intel Group. SGR LLC, which does business as Sphere Consulting, did public relations work on a film Flynn Intel Group was working on about Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen. The film was never completed. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department in May to oversee an investigation into potential coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential election. The investigation, which produced its first criminal charges last month against three former Trump campaign officials, incorporated an earlier FBI inquiry into Flynn's lobbying and investigative research work on behalf of a Turkish businessman. Flynn's firm was paid 530,000 for the work. Sphere employees have cooperated for months with Mueller's investigation, including by turning over documents requested by investigators and sitting for voluntary interviews. An October 2016 meeting that was expected to be the subject of the grand jury testimony has been described as a bait-and-switch carried out on behalf of Flynn's firm. As the AP reported in March , Flynn's business partner, Bijan Kian , invited a representative of the House Homeland Security Committee to Flynn Intel's offices in Alexandria, Virginia, to discuss secure communications products. But after discussing the products, the session quickly turned into a lobbying pitch that mirrored Turkish government talking points. Kian and others involved were particularly interested in pushing for congressional hearings to investigate Gulen, whom the Turkish government has blamed for a botched coup and who has been living in exile in Pennsylvania. Gulen has denied any involvement. Flynn Intel Group's requests for congressional hearings went nowhere. Flynn disclosed some of the details of the meeting in a filing with the Justice Department earlier this year. According to that filing, an employee of Sphere consulting was present during the meeting. CNN first reported the postponement. ___ Follow Eric Tucker and Chad Day on Twitter: https://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP and https://www.twitter.com/ChadSDay ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Jared Kushner, President Trump's son-in-law, has been interviewed by Special Counsel Robert Mueller's team as part of the ongoing investigation into Russia's involvement in the 2016 election.

The origins of the Presbyterian churches are in Calvinism. Many branches of Presbyterianism are remnants of previous splits from larger groups. Some of the splits have been due to doctrinal controversy, while some have been caused by disagreement concerning the degree to which those ordained to church office should be required to agree with the Westminster Confession of Faith, which historically serves as an important confessional document – second only to the Bible, yet directing particularities in the standardization and translation of the Bible – in Presbyterian churches.\\"?

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Supercritical Fluids If we place a sample of water in a sealed container at 25 °C, remove the air, and let the vaporization-condensation equilibrium establish itself, we are left with a mixture of liquid water and water vapor at a pressure of 0.03 atm. A distinct boundary between the more dense liquid and the less dense gas is clearly observed. As we increase the temperature, the pressure of the water vapor increases, as described by the liquid-gas curve in the phase diagram for water (Figure 10.31), and a two-phase equilibrium of liquid and gaseous phases remains. At a temperature of 374 °C, the vapor pressure has risen to 218 atm, and any further increase in temperature results in the disappearance of the boundary between liquid and vapor phases. All of the water in the container is now present in a single phase whose physical properties are intermediate between those of the gaseous and liquid states. This phase of matter is called a supercritical fluid, and the temperature and pressure above which this phase exists is the critical point (Figure 10.35). Above its critical temperature, a gas cannot be liquefied no matter how much pressure is applied. The pressure required to liquefy a gas at its critical temperature is called the critical pressure. The critical temperatures and critical pressures of some common substances are given in Table 10.3. Substance.

Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email A creepy clown, whose strange appearances have spooked a town and intrigued the world, is today unmasked by the Sunday People. We have succeeded in tracking down the man who has become a global ­sensation after dressing like horror writer Stephen King’s character Pennywise from the movie It. His odd antics have appeared on TV news as far afield as the US, Australia, India, Canada and Japan, since he first turned up in Northampton on Friday, September 13th. Journalists from across Europe have tried to identify him and a US couple holidaying in the UK even went to the town hoping to meet him. Like King’s homicidal creation, the clown has been spotted standing, motionless, clutching balloons; waving or staring at disconcerted passers-by. The only thing he says is: “Beep beep”, Pennywise’s catchphrase. Photos of the sinister figure at the National Lift Tower, posing on Elm Street, next to a town statue and in a lake have been posted on Facebook and attracted more than 180,000 likes from all over the world. He often teases fans about where he will turn up next by posting clues hidden in riddles on his Facebook page. He told a local paper anonymously: “I just want to amuse people. Most people enjoy being a bit freaked out, then they laugh about it afterwards.” Some followers are entertained but those with coulrophobia – an abnormal fear of clowns – do not see the funny side and have begged him to stop. Today we can exclusively reveal the clown is Northampton University ­student and budding film maker Alex Powell, 22. (Image: Matt Sprake Photography) Following a tip off, we snapped him and Elliot Simpson, also a wannabe movie maker, and Luke Ubanski, who runs the Spot Northampton’s Clown Facebook page, walking into a town flat in their normal clothes. Later Powell emerged dressed in the clown suit, while flanked by the pair, who checked the coast was clear before taking photos of him in a deserted car park just yards away. Previously Powell, who was linked to a YouTube clip of a short film featuring an almost identically dressed clown, had denied he was the character. He wrote on his own Facebook page: “There’s been lots of rumours that I’m the Northampton Clown but I am NOT! But thanks for all the interest as it’s shot my views right up.” And he added falsely: “And I don’t live in Northampton any more.” Yesterday the sleepy-looking joker opened the door in his pyjamas and, at first, insisted: “I am not the clown”. But when we showed him our photos he changed his tune. He confessed: “OK, I am the clown but I’ve been trying to keep it as ­mysterious as possible. To be discreet so people didn’t find out. “Your pictures are from the day I went to meet a little girl who only has six months to live. “Her mum messaged me saying she really wants to meet you before she dies. I took a picture with her and gave her a clown teddy and stuff. “On Facebook I’ve had over a thousand death threats. It was just a bit of fun at first and a lot of people seem to enjoy it but it gets a bit hard sometimes with the death threats.” Powell, who grew up in Paignton, Torbay, claimed a man threatened to knife him at Sixfields, Northampton Town FC’s ground. He said: “I swear he had a knife and told me he would stab me if there were not so many people around.” Powell said the police were initially interested in his activities but were now protective and looked out for him. He said the death threats would not put him off dressing as the clown but added: “I had a call last night from someone who knew my name and asked if I was the clown and said if they saw me they would run me over.” A string of fake online profiles have emerged claiming to be the clown and a vigilante rival, called The Clown Catcher, has even launched a campaign to try to track him down. Encouraged by his fame, Powell has started handing out branded Northampton Clown T-shirts and bags. Fans have demanded that he donate all the proceeds from his merchandise to charity and he has insisted he would not keep any of the profits. “I’m not doing this for money,” he posted on Facebook. “None of it will come to me. “I know this will have upset a few of you. If I get anything out of this it is going towards travel and charity! See you all soon! Beep Beep!” ||||| Fans of the Northampton Clown have reacted angrily to the apparent ‘outing’ of his identity. Several national newspapers and other online news sites have identified University of Northampton student Alex Powell as the man behind the mask. With his identity now seemingly uncovered, it is unclear whether the Northampton Clown will carry on making appearances in the town. The Chron learnt the identity of the Northampton Clown before running an exclusive interview with him - however, agreed not to reveal it to maintain the mystery of the character. Many fans have criticised the national press for the stories about Mr Powell, saying it has put his safety at risk and ruined the mystery of the clown’s appearances. A man with a knife is believed to have threatened to stab the Northampton Clown after he appeared at Sixfields. Louise Rose, commenting on The Mirror story, said: “Hope you’re happy with yourselves, why can’t you just leave things alone.. In a world full of dome and gloom this was a little light hearted fun, but oh no you journalist just have to spoilt it.. Well done!” Luke Wood wrote: “Way to go you bunch of killjoys, a bit of harmless and LEGAL fun again ruined by the media. What’s next, a kids only issue of the paper spilling the truth about Santa, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy?” Matthew Buckley wrote: “It’s a shame.. now you’ve identified him the people who want to kill him are going to be able to find him a lot easier now. Bit silly, no?” A comment on the Mail Online story about the unmasking read: “Miserable newspaper unmasking him. Why spoil something funny?” However, on the Spot Northampton’s Clown Facebook page the clown has told his 185,000 followers his identity is “safe”. The clown has also told people “not to believe everything they read in the papers”, leading to the suggestion Alex Powell may not be the Northampton Clown after all. |||||Summary:","completion":"The Northampton Clown, a mysterious figure who dressed like the character Pennywise from Stephen King's movie \\"It,\\" gained global attention for his strange appearances in Northampton, England.

Step 2: Consider the force required to accelerate the objects A greater force would be required to accelerate the huge snowball (with a higher mass) as compared to the smaller snowball with less mass. Step 3: Evaluate the effect of the force applied on the acceleration Both the snowballs are being pushed by kids, and the number of kids applying force on each snowball may be different, however, the force applied would still likely be directly proportional to the mass. Step 4: Analyze the time taken to reach fast speed As we know, the time taken to reach a certain speed is directly dependent on the force applied and the mass of an object. More force is required to set an object with a higher mass into motion, so the huge snowball would take more time to reach a fast speed as compared to the smaller snowball, assuming the speed is similar for both. Therefore, the \\"huge snowball\\" takes longer to get up to a fast speed, making answer (B) the most sensical choice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Question: James's parents felt that he was wasting his money, but they still let him put a coin where every weekend? Choices: - wishing well - piggy bank - eat cake - change purse - parking meter The rationale to choose \\"wishing well\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"A. The question provides the following clues for the correct answer: 1. James is spending money every weekend. 2. His parents feel that he is wasting his money. 3. The activity still occurs. We need to find the choice that best fits these clues. Now, let's evaluate each choice: - \\"Wishing well\\": It involves spending money (coins), and many people might see this as wasting money since wishes might not come true. Since his parents allow him to do this every weekend, they might find it harmless or charming. - \\"Piggy bank\\": This choice doesn't work, as placing money in a piggy bank doesn't waste money but saves it. - \\"Eat cake\\": Eating cake every weekend would mean spending money, but this choice doesn't specify that James would spend money on cake every weekend. Also, eating cake doesn't involve putting a coin anywhere. - \\"Change purse\\": This option refers to a container where people keep their coins, but it doesn't necessarily imply that money is being wasted. - \\"Parking meter\\": This choice involves spending money, but it's not a waste if James needs to park his car. Also, the question states that the parents feel the money is wasted, which doesn't necessarily apply to parking meters. Based on the given clues and the analysis of each choice, the rationale for choosing \\"wishing well\\" as the answer is: A. It best fits the description of the activity James engages in every weekend: spending money (coins), which his parents think is a waste but still allow him to do. Additionally, the wishing well is a common place where people throw coins with the purpose of making wishes, which can be perceived as a waste of money since wishes might not come true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Given the below context: Travis W. Redfish is a beer-drinking, bar-brawling, fun-loving distributor of Shiner beer. He also helps his father, Corpus C. Redfish with the family salvage company, whose motto is \\"Everything will work if you let it!\\" B.B. Muldoon is his best friend and business partner. While B.B. and Travis are making deliveries in their Shiner beer truck, they notice an RV that has broken down on the side of the road. At first, they laugh at the thought of helping the stranded motorists, but then Travis sees wannabee groupie Lola Bouliabaise smile at him through the rear window of the RV. Travis slams on the brakes and decides to help, hoping to get a closer look at Lola. Lola is a big Alice Cooper fan and Travis has never heard of \\"her\\". Road manager Ace and his assistant George try to talk Travis into driving them to Austin for a show to be played by Hank Williams Jr., produced by music mogul Mohammed Johnson. He meets Bird Lockhart, a hippie and lifelong roadie in the music business. After repairing the RV, Lola talks Travis into coming along where he ends up becoming the \\"greatest roadie that ever lived\\" with his unusual techniques on fixing things. On the road, Travis gets into a bar fight with \\"Tiny\\" Thompson after Lola accidentally ruins his little sister's hair by dumping beer on it in an attempt to meet Roy Orbison. After head butting Tiny, Travis ends up with \\"Brain-Lock\\", a condition he developed in the war, for which chugging a pitcher of beer is the only cure. Lola convinces him to drive them to Hollywood for another show. He drives like a maniac and ends up with B.B in hot pursuit and the police right behind them all. Soon Travis passes out and wakes up the next day in the back of a trailer carrying musical equipment.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests. Hint: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the information given in the paragraph: 1. Forest A is a tropical forest in Brazil. 2. Forest B is a temperate forest in Germany. 3. Tropical forests receive more insolation and rainfall than any other environment on earth. 4. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Given these points, we can deduce that Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would see higher rates of chemical weathering due to the elevated temperatures and larger amounts of water it receives."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Rania Al-Abdullah (Arabic: rny l\`bd llh, Raniya al-\`Abd Allah; born Rania Al-Yassin on 31 August 1970) is the queen consort of Jordan. Born in Kuwait to a Palestinian family, she later moved to Jordan for work, where she met the then prince Abdullah. Since marrying the now King of Jordan in 1993, she has become known for her advocacy work related to education, health, community empowerment, youth, cross-cultural dialogue and micro-finance. She is also an avid user of social media and she maintains pages on Facebook, YouTube, Instagram and Twitter. In November 2000, in recognition of her commitment to the cause of children and youth, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) invited Queen Rania to join its Global Leadership Initiative. The Queen worked alongside other world leaders, including former South African President Nelson Mandela, in a global movement seeking to improve the welfare of children. In January 2007, Queen Rania was named UNICEF's first Eminent Advocate for Children. In August 2009, Queen Rania became Honorary Global Chair of the United Nations Girls' Education Initiative (UNGEI). As a longtime supporter of the Global Campaign for Education (GCE), Queen Rania met with children and inspirational women in South Africa, both in the cities of Johannesburg and Soweto, in March 2009. Queen Rania and the women took turns reading a short story out of The Big Read to the children, in an effort to encourage literacy. One of the stories in the book, \\"Maha of the Mountains\\", was contributed by Queen Rania. In Soweto, she was the first to write her name in the back of the Big Read, before passing it on to everyone else to write their name. During her April 2009 US trip, Queen Rania joined leading education advocates Congresswoman Nita Lowey and Counsellor to the Secretary of the Treasury Gene Sperling to launch \\"The Big Read\\" as part of Global Campaign for Education's global action week calling for quality basic education for all children. She was also hosted by first lady of the United States, Michelle Obama, during that same trip. On 20 August 2009, Queen Rania co-founded and led the launch of the \\"1GOAL: Education for All\\" campaign alongside Gary Lineker, and with the help of top international footballers at Wembley Stadium, London. Queen Rania is co-founder and global co-chair of the 1GOAL campaign to rally World Cup 2010 fans together during the world's biggest single sporting event and call on world leaders to give 75 million children out of school an education. On 6 October 2009, Queen Rania was joined by Prime Minister Gordon Brown of the UK, the President of FIFA, Sepp Blatter, President Jacob Zuma of South Africa, and other heads of state, for the Global Launch of 1GOAL, which took place across six locations worldwide. Queen Rania spoke of the need to turn this \\"tragedy into triumph\\" and called on political leaders to stand by their aid commitments. In 2008, Queen Rania participated in YouTube's In My Name campaign. She appeared alongside The Black Eyed Peas member will.i.am in the video, \\"End Poverty - Be the Generation,\\" which urged world leaders to keep the promises they made in 2000 at the United Nations Millennium Summit.","completion":"This text is about Queen Rania Al-Abdullah, the queen consort of Jordan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Karly is studying two rivers and how they are affecting the rock around them. If the 2nd river she looks at is twice as big as the first river she is studying, then Karly would expect to see more or less erosion caused by the 2nd river? Paragraph : The bigger the waves are and the more sediment they carry, the more erosion they cause. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that the size and sediment-carrying capacity of a river significantly impact the amount of erosion it causes. Given that the 2nd river Karly is studying is twice as big as the first river, we would expect it to have greater wave and water volume. The paragraph mentions that when the waves are bigger and carry more sediment, they cause more erosion. Therefore, if the 2nd river is twice as big as the first river, it is reasonable to assume that the 2nd river would have larger waves and a higher sediment-carrying capacity due to its size. As a result, the 2nd river would have the potential to erode more rock material compared to the first, smaller river. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, Karly would expect to see more erosion caused by the 2nd river (the larger one) compared to the first river, due to its greater size, larger waves, and increased sediment-carrying capacity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: \\"A photograph that one has taken of oneself, typically with a smart phone or webcam and uploaded to a social media website\\" is the definition of \\"selfie\\" in the Oxford English Dictionary. In fact, it wasn't even in the dictionary until August of last year. It earned its place there because people are now so obsessed with (......) selfies - we take them when we try on a new hat, play with our pets or when we meet a friend whom we haven't seen in a while. But is there any scientific explanation for this obsession? Well, you should probably ask James Kilner, a neuroscientist at University College London. Through our lifetime we become experts at recognizing and interpreting other people's faces and facial expressions. In contrast, according to Kilner, we have a very poor understanding of our own faces since we have little experience of looking at them - we just feel them most of the time. This has been proved in previous studies, according to the BBC. Kilner found that most people chose the more attractive picture. This suggests that we tend to think of ourselves as better-looking than we actually are. To further test how we actually _ our own faces, Kilner carried out another study. He showed people different versions of their own portrait - the original, one that had been edited to look less attractive and one that was made more attractive - and asked them to pick the version which they thought looked most like them. They chose the more attractive version. But what does it say about selfies? Well, isn't that obvious? Selfies give us the power to create a photograph - by taking it from various angles, with different poses, using filters and so on - that better matches our expectations with our actual faces. \\"You suddenly have control in a way that you don't have in non-virtual interactions,\\" Kilner told the Canada-based CTV News. Selfies allow you \\"to keep taking pictures until you manage to take one you're happy with\\", he explained. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Yes or no, is the answer \\"How taking selfies influences people's daily lives.\\"? A:","completion":"The passage is mainly about the scientific explanation for people's obsession with taking selfies and how it relates to our understanding and perception of our own faces.

BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTS Enron Industrial Markets Enron Industrial Markets announced the signing of definitive agreements with Huntco, Inc. under which over a 15-year period Enron will provide inventory price risk management services and will eventually provide more than 600,000 tons per year of hot-rolled, cold-rolled and galvanized steel products to Huntco Steel. The agreements provide Enron access to Huntco's network of steel distribution centers nationwide. The agreements also provide for Enron's acquisition of Huntco's cold rolling and certain coil pickling operations in Blytheville, Arkansas. These transactions with Huntco have the potential to fundamentally change the way steel is bought and sold in the United States. It gives Enron immediate access to physical steel and positions Enron geographically to serve the steel industry in a variety of ways. In addition to providing physical products on both a spot and term basis, EIM's goals for the steel industry include developing commodity risk management products, providing structured finance products and establishing the market-making capabilities that Enron has brought to the natural gas, power and other commodity markets. Enron North America-Upstream Products Upstream Products has partnered with Duke Energy Field Services (DEFS) to close a 20-year NGL exchange and transportation deal with Formosa Hydrocarbons and Williams Energy Field Services to handle raw make product from the Williams Markham plant. Formosa Hydrocarbons is building a 40,000 BPD fractionator to handle this and other Gulf Coast NGL production. The accompanying pipeline will be known as the Seabreeze pipeline system and will be constructed by DEFS. Texas Brine LLC will provide NGL storage services for Formosa Hydrocarbons on this system. Primary production for this system is coming from the Boomvang Nansen field in the deepwater GOM and will be the first deepwater GOM production to come onshore in Texas. Upstream Products has also worked to arrange a 20-year transportation lease agreement on the Dean Pipeline (owned by TEPPCO) for refinery grade propylene service to be utilized by Formosa Plastics. Coupled with this transaction, Enron Clean Fuels has entered into a propylene storage agreement with Formosa Plastics to utilize ECF's Mt. Belvieu storage facilities. In addition, Enron Global Markets has been able to amend its current transportation agreement with TEPPCO to prematurely terminate a take-or-pay obligation and realize additional transportation revenues from interim NGL production coming from the Williams Markham to be delivered to Mt. Belvieu. Upon close, Upstream Products was monetized out of its initial position by DEFS and retained a risk-free net profits position on the Seabreeze Pipeline going forward for an additional 20,000-40,000 BPD of excess capacity on the system.

Right from the moment we walked in, the delightful ambiance, friendly staff, and mouthwatering menu made it an unforgettable evening. The restaurant's design is an impressive blend of modern sophistication and rustic charm, with tastefully exposed brick walls, soft lighting, and elegant table settings. The black-and-white photos of iconic landmarks adorning the walls added a touch of class. We chose a table near the open kitchen, from where we could enjoy the melodic sounds of clinking pots and pans and appetizing aromas wafting from the chefs at work. The waitress greeted us with a warm smile, promptly provided us with menus, and patiently answered our questions about the dishes. We appreciated her honest and thoughtful suggestions, which helped us make our selections. I opted for the seared scallops appetizer, followed by the slow-cooked lamb shank as my main course. My dining companion went for the garden-fresh tomato and mozzarella salad and the sumptuous pan-seared chicken breast. Our appetizers arrived in no time, beautifully presented and bursting with vibrant colors. The seared scallops were cooked to perfection, delicately caramelized on the outside, tender on the inside, and served atop a silky cauliflower purée that tied everything together harmoniously. My companion's salad featured heirloom tomatoes, locally-sourced mozzarella, fragrant basil, and a flavorful balsamic glaze. The main courses were equally exquisite, showcasing the chef's expert talent and passion for crafting phenomenal dishes. My lamb shank was fall-off-the-bone tender and accompanied by a velvety red wine reduction that elevated every bite. The accompanying garlic mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables were the perfect complements. My dining companion's chicken breast was juicy and succulent, pairing wonderfully with the bright lemon herb sauce and sautéed vegetables. For dessert, we shared the heavenly chocolate lava cake topped with a scoop of velvety vanilla ice cream. The decadent warm cake encased a molten chocolate center that flowed like a river of happiness when we sliced into it, a fantastic conclusion to our meal. I cannot recommend The Gourmet Bistro enough for its top-tier food, impeccable service, and inviting atmosphere. The staff, from the hostess to the chefs, genuinely cared for their customers' enjoyment and went above and beyond to create a memorable dining experience.

With him is his teenage daughter from his first marriage, Marti, his second wife Carol, and Marti's half brother Andy. On their way to the base, they stop at a gas station. In the restroom, Marti is threatened by an MP member with a knife. When he notices her fear, he lets go of her, satisfied that she shows an emotional response. Before she leaves the room, he warns her, \\"they get you when you sleep\\". Steve and his family move into their new home on the base, and Marti makes friends with the base commander's daughter Jenn. On his first day in day care, Andy runs away because he is recognized as an outsider among the other somehow conformist children. He is picked up and brought home by helicopter pilot Tim. Marti and Tim quickly feel attracted to each other. Meanwhile, while examining soil samples, Steve is approached by medical officer Major Collins, who asks him about psychological effects, particularly narcophobia (the fear of sleep), and their possible relation to toxication of the environment.

Write an article with the title: \\"Evictions Soar in Hot Market; Renters Suffer\\"","completion":"Title: Evictions Soar in Hot Market; Renters Suffer Introduction In recent years, the housing market has experienced a significant surge in demand due to various factors such as low mortgage rates, job growth, and increased migration to urban areas. While this might have resulted in a boon for some homeowners and real estate investors, many renters are facing an increasingly precarious situation as they grapple with the unrelenting rise in rent costs, housing shortages, and the growing threat of eviction. This article examines the reasons behind the soaring evictions in the hot housing market and the devastating impact it has on affected renters. The Underlying Factors of Rising Evictions 1. A Hotter Housing Market The housing market's upward trajectory has significantly impacted rental prices, with demand for rental units outpacing supply in many metropolitan areas. This has led to a rise in rents, making it increasingly difficult for tenants to find affordable housing options. Landlords seeking to capitalize on the booming market may push out existing tenants to either upgrade their properties or accommodate tenants willing to pay higher rents. 2. Economic Imbalance While wages have experienced sluggish growth in recent years, the cost of living, including housing, has skyrocketed. The widening gap between income and expenditure has left many renters struggling to make ends meet. Consequently, they often find themselves unable to keep up with rising rents, putting them at risk of eviction. 3. The Impact of COVID-19 The ongoing pandemic has further exacerbated housing instability, with job losses and reduced work hours disproportionately affecting low-income households and renters. Moreover, with the expiration of pandemic-related eviction moratoriums, many tenants now face the risk of eviction with no financial safety net in place. Effects on Renters 1. Homelessness One of the most devastating consequences of evictions is homelessness. Without adequate financial resources or access to sustainable housing alternatives, those evicted often find themselves on the streets or in overcrowded shelters, which, especially during a pandemic, pose significant health risks. 2. Mental and Physical Health Evictions can trigger a myriad of mental and physical health issues for those affected. The stress of losing one's home and coping with the uncertainty of finding alternative shelter can lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders. Furthermore, the precarious living conditions resulting from evictions, such as overcrowding or exposure to the elements, can exacerbate existing health problems or lead to new ones. 3. Impact on Children Evictions often have a harmful impact on children, as the resulting instability can disrupt their education, social support networks, and emotional development. In addition, children from evicted families are more likely to suffer from chronic health issues, malnutrition, and developmental delays. Possible Solutions 1. Affordable Housing Initiatives Governments and cities must prioritize the creation of affordable housing to alleviate the rental crisis. Increase funding for construction and renovation projects aimed at increasing the supply of affordable rental units can help stabilize rents and reduce eviction rates. 2. Rental Assistance Programs Expanding rental assistance programs for low-income families can make housing more accessible and prevent eviction. These programs can provide financial aid or subsidies for eligible renters, helping them keep up with rising rents and maintain a stable living situation. 3. Tenant Protection Laws Strengthening tenant protection laws can shield renters from unjust evictions and provide them with tools to exercise their rights. This involves enacting rent control measures, implementing a legal eviction process, and ensuring that tenants have access to legal representation. Conclusion As eviction rates soar in the hot housing market, it is crucial for governments and communities to address the root causes and mitigate the consequences for affected renters. By focusing on affordable housing initiatives, rental assistance programs, and tenant protection laws, society can begin to provide the support and security needed to prevent a worsening housing crisis. Ultimately, a collective effort is required to safeguard the well-being and dignity of the millions of renters facing the threat of eviction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Word Choices: The phrase \\"very talented\\" is a clear indicator of praise or admiration.

This age factor can evoke sentiments of awe, inspiration, or even optimism about the future prospects of these actors. 3. The Overall Context: If this sentence is used in the context of discussing up-and-coming actors or recognizing the accomplishments of budding performers, the overall sentiment will undoubtedly be perceived as positive.

While at work his work computer does not need modern capabilities. So, he still uses Windows 2000 at his office computer. At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he installed the latest version of Windows. Now, there is no lag in his system. Hint: In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods.

First, the reviewer states that the novel focuses solely on the hardships of being female, which they perceive as an \\"excuse to complain.\\" This implies that the reviewer believes the subject matter is not well-handled or engaging, and perhaps even trivializes the real-world challenges that women face. Second, the reviewer points out that the writing is \\"weak\\" and fails to capture the reader's interest. This critique speaks to the quality of the prose and storytelling, suggesting that the author is not successful in crafting a compelling narrative.

Summarize the following: Your foal will be more comfortable being weaned in an environment that it is familiar with. About 3 to 4 days before you wean your foal, move it and its mother into a large pen. Keep them in this pen as much as possible, only moving them inside to sleep if need be. It’s best to wean 2 or more foals at the same time, so the foals can keep each other company as they are weaned. Remove 1 mare from its foal at a time, waiting at least 1 day before removing the next mare. This will prevent your foals from panicking at the same time and stressing each other further. Once the foal has adjusted to the pen, lead its mother to a new pen or stable far away. Make sure that they cannot hear or see each other, otherwise, the foal will attempt to find its mother and may end up hurting itself. It may help to feed your foal with some hay or creep feed while you move its mother to a different pen. This will keep it distracted and may stop it from panicking as much once it realises it is being weaned. Each foal will respond to being weaned differently. Some may panic for only a few minutes, where others may take up to a day to calm down. Watch your foal to make sure it cannot escape from the pen or hurt itself on the fence. Feed it as you normally would and allow it to calm down naturally before introducing its companion to the pen. Check the edge of the fence for loose nails or anything else that could hurt your foal before weaning it. It will likely spend a lot of time near the edges of the pen trying to find its mother. Once the mother and foal have been separated from each other, it will take around 1 month for the mother to stop lactating and the foal to adjust to being on its own. Give both horses plenty of time to adjust to their new living style before reintroducing them. If you bring the mother and the foal back together before the foal has been properly weaned, you’ll just need to wean them again. Make sure the mother has stopped lactating and the foal has adjusted to being apart from its mother before reintroducing them. Summary:","completion":"To ensure a smooth weaning process, familiarize the foal with a large pen alongside its mother 3-4 days before weaning. Ideally, wean two or more foals simultaneously for companionship. Remove one mare at a time, with at least a day's gap between removals to minimize stress. After the foal adjusts, move the mother to a distant pen, out of the foal's sight and hearing. Distract the foal with hay or creep feed during this process. Monitor the foal's reaction and ensure its safety in the pen. Introduce its companion once it calms down. Check the fence for hazards beforehand. Allow a month for the mother to stop lactating and the foal to adjust before reintroducing them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Went straight from a facility that deals with homeless children (492 1st Ave, Manhattan, New York) to the extreme outskirts of Queens near Kennedy Airport about 20 miles away. It was winter and I had no coat. I had my book bag and my sole Trader Joe’s bag of clothing and was loaded into a van with three social workers. During the long drive in traffic, I fell asleep, so waking up at my new home, I couldn’t make out any street signs and the numbering on the houses did not indicate whether I was in a home in the Bronx or Eastern Queens (which share the same street numbering in certain instances). My foster parents showed me my room and left a plate of food on the table. They barricaded themselves in their bedroom quite like how pilots barricade themselves behind the fortified cockpit door. However, my room didn’t have a lock, and neither did the bathroom. There were bars on my windows with a view of a church parking lot. I took great care to avoid waking a significantly older teen (I was 14, so he must have been 19–20) sleeping on the other bed. I heard two other kids (my foster siblings) in the other room playing music and giggling loudly at 3 in the morning. At 4 in the morning, my foster father started reading the Quran pretty loudly, and then he goes back to bed. In the morning, my foster parents are gone. My foster siblings are all sleeping. I got up at 7, but I don’t know how far I am from my high school, what buses/train will take me there, and still don’t know anything about anything about my new home. I don’t even know the names of those I’m relegated to living with.

Context: A long time ago, when humans still lived in cities, on a cold morning near the end of a long, cruel winter, in magnificent Central Park in the middle of magnificent New York City, a young squirrel named Patch was awakened very early by the growls of his empty stomach. A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns. But what marvels, what miracles, what mysteries are hidden inside those simple words! Question: What kind of animal is Patch?

Process: - The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell - The copies infect other cells to make more viruses, or they escape from the body and infect a new victim - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the person got a antibiotic shot happens, how will it affect MORE cells being damaged. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the process of virus infection. In the flu virus infection process, the virus uses its surface receptors to attach to target cells. It then enters the cell, takes control, and uses the cell to replicate itself. Newly produced viruses are released from the cell to infect more cells or to leave the body and infect new victims. Step 2: Consider the introduction of antibiotic shot. An antibiotic shot is given to the person with the flu virus. Antibiotics are medicines that are primarily used to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections like the flu. Step 3: Evaluate the direct effect of the antibiotic shot on the flu virus infection process. As antibiotics are specifically designed to target bacteria and not viruses, the antibiotic shot is unlikely to directly affect the flu virus receptors or the virus' ability to infect and replicate within the cells. Step 4: Consider any potential indirect effects of the antibiotic shot on the flu virus infection process. Although antibiotics do not directly target viruses, they can help in preventing or treating bacterial infections that might occur as a complication of the flu. By addressing these bacterial infections, the body's immune system can be more focused on fighting the flu virus. However, this effect would be an indirect impact on the flu virus process and not on the virus receptors or replication process itself. Step 5: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis, considering the introduction of an antibiotic shot, does not seem to directly affect the process of flu virus infection, damage to the cells or replication of the virus. The antibiotic shot may have some indirect effects on the overall health of the infected person by addressing potential bacterial infections, but it will not directly impact the virus process itself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring.

Уклонение от уплаты налогов является распространенным проблемным вопросом, на который правительства следует сосредоточить внимание. Обычно это противодействие предполагает использование двух методов, в основе которых лежат проверки налоговых органов (аудиты) и введение строгих санкций. Проверки налоговых органов или аудиты представляют собой процесс, в рамках которого специалисты налоговых служб проводят анализ налоговых деклараций зарегистрированных физических и юридических лиц. Это позволяет определить, являются ли предоставленные данные точными и полными. В случае выявления ошибок или уклонения от уплаты налогов проверяющие могут предъявить уведомление о необходимости доплаты или исправления сведений. Сей же подход служит удерживающим фактором для предотвращения попыток прямого уклонения от уплаты налогов. Такая система предотвращает намеренное понижение налогооблагаемой базы, а также создает стимул для соблюдения законодательства и правил в области налогов. Строгие санкции за уклонение от уплаты налогов являются другим важным фактором. Помимо возможности получить сообщение о корректировке налоговых обязательств или доплате, налогоплательщики, которые сознательно уклоняются от уплаты налогов, могут столкнуться с серьезными финансовыми штрафами, а также уголовным преследованием. В зависимости от степени нарушения, это может привести к большим штрафам или даже к тюремному заключению.

But they have also returned, again and again, to a much closer source of clues: The house next door to the boyhood home of killer Syed Rizwan Farook Their efforts there are focused on a bespectacled former Walmart employee, Enrique Marquez, and his purchase of a pair of rifles used in the attack that claimed 14 lives Marquez has acknowledged that he bought the two AR-15s for Farook several years ago.He's also told investigators about a 2012 attack plot that he says he and Farook conceived but did not carry out , U.S. officials told CNN. Marquez told investigators that part of the reason the two abandoned their plans was that around that time, they were spooked by unrelated FBI arrests of four people charged with attempting to travel abroad to carry out jihad. Investigators are still trying to corroborate information provided by Marquez and haven't verified details of the alleged plot. Officials caution that Marquez's claim of a 2012 attack could turn out to be false and an attempt to deflect his role in helping buy weapons that Farook later used in the San Bernardino shootings last week. Marquez, 24, has not been charged with any crime and has told investigators he didn't know about the plans for the San Bernardino attack. Since the shootings, he has waived his Miranda rights, cooperated with investigators and provided information, according to the officials. Marquez could not be reached for comment. No attorney has come forward. Mother: He is a good person Marquez's mother, Armida Chacon, told reporters outside her home Thursday she had no knowledge of her son's involvement in events leading up to the shooting. A sobbing Chacon said: \\"He was a good person. How would I know? I didn't know,\\" adding that she has not been interviewed by investigators. \\"He was a good young man. Whatever I asked him to do he would do. He watched over his brothers. He helped me a lot. He was my right hand around the house,\\" she said after requesting that journalists turn off their cameras before she would speak. \\"I want to be left in peace. When I am ready, I will sit down and talk to you. My life changed since Wednesday,\\" Chacon said. \\"My son is a good person. A good person. The rest, I don't know how it happened. I want to see him.\\" Authorities initially said they did not believe Marquez had any involvement in the San Bernardino shooting plot carried out by Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik , law enforcement officials said. But his role is continuing to be evaluated as he cooperates with investigators and they assess his information, officials said. FBI Assistant Director David Bowdich was tight-lipped when asked about his status in the investigation at a news conference earlier this week. \\"I'm not prepared to discuss Mr. Marquez at this point,\\" Bowdich said. Related by marriage According to county records, Marquez and Farook are related by marriage, and the address on his marriage license is the current address of Farook's father. Marquez was married last year with Farook's brother as a witness. He converted to Islam several years ago and attended the same mosque as other members of the Farook family. Marquez, who was a state licensed security guard until his license expired last year, checked himself into a mental health facility in the wake of the attacks, according to law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity. According to officials, Marquez told investigators that he and Farook were on the path to radicalization as early as 2011. That same year, Marquez bought the first of two rifles for Farook. Marquez gave the rifles to Farook shortly after purchasing them but did not report the transfer of ownership, two law enforcement officials said Tuesday. Such transactions could be a violation of California law, the officials said. Home raided, job terminated Heavily armed FBI agents descended on his home on Tomlinson Avenue in Riverside early Saturday to serve a search warrant, waking neighbors with a bullhorn announcement for the occupants to come to the door. Agents ultimately forced entry through the garage. They returned a day later for a consensual search to retrieve items not covered in the scope of the warrant, according to a law enforcement official. Agents also visited the Walmart store in Corona where Marquez worked. A spokesman for the retailer said Marquez has worked for Walmart since May, but \\"the decision has been made to terminate him.\\" A co-worker who asked not to be named said she was twice interviewed by FBI agents earlier this week. They asked about Marquez's personality and interests, the co-worker said. In a brief interview with CNN, she said she told investigators she had no knowledge of Marquez using weapons or of having any link to the killers, whom she did not know. She did not associate with Marquez outside of work, she said. Neighbors and car-work buddies JUST WATCHED Where were San Bernardino suspects trained? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Where were San Bernardino suspects trained? 02:30 Neighbors of the Tomlinson Avenue homes where Marquez and Farook lived next door to one another recalled the two working on cars together but did not know whether their relationship extended beyond that shared interest. One neighbor, who asked not to be named, said Marquez seemed like a nice young man. \\"He was a good guy,\\" the neighbor said. Another neighbor, Freddy Escamilla, said he'd recently run into Marquez on the street and that he was typically subdued, nodding hello but not saying much. \\"He never really talked to anyone,\\" Escamilla said, adding that he was \\"really introverted. Very introverted.\\" Marquez converted to Islam and attended mosque sermons on and off for a couple years, said Azmi Hasan, who has served as facility manager of the Islamic Society of Corona-Norco since 2000. Hasan said Marquez acted goofy, describing one instance when he saw him outside the mosque laughing out loud to himself. When approached by Hasan about what was so funny, Marquez said he wasn't laughing. Hasan said Marquez attended sermons by himself but stopped coming about two years ago. He said he ran into Marquez, who he recalled as quiet and introverted, at a party and asked why he hadn't been coming to sermons more often. When questioned about why he wasn't coming to sermons, Marquez would say he was busy, according to Hasan. At one point, Hasan said, Marquez responded that Islam was not working for him. Hasan said Syed Rizwan Farook's sister and brother-in-law also attended the mosque but that he'd never seen Marquez in their company. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"This is a news article about a man named Enrique Marquez who bought two rifles used in a terrorist attack in San Bernardino by Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves, is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Florida Hurricanes pose a severe threat each year during the June 1 to November 30 hurricane season, particularly from August to October. Florida is the most hurricane-prone state, with subtropical or tropical water on a lengthy coastline. Of the category 4 or higher storms that have struck the United States, 83% have either hit Florida or Texas. From 1851 to 2006, Florida was struck by 114 hurricanes, 37 of them major—category 3 and above. It is rare for a hurricane season to pass without any impact in the state by at least a tropical storm.[citation needed] Q: How many storms hit Florida from 1851 to 2006","completion":"From 1851 to 2006, Florida was hit by a total of 114 hurricanes. Out of these hurricanes, 37 were classified as major hurricanes, indicating that they were category 3 or above in terms of intensity. Hurricanes, a type of violent storm known as tropical cyclones, form over tropical or subtropical waters and sustain wind speeds of 74 miles per hour or greater. Among the hurricanes that hit Florida, the ones categorized as major hurricanes are typically the most destructive because of their extreme winds, heavy rainfall, and potential to cause severe coastal and inland flooding. Major hurricanes, referring to Category 3 or above, have wind speeds of at least 111 miles per hour. For a hurricane to be categorized as such, it not only needs to display powerful winds but also deliver a significant storm surge and catastrophic damage. These major hurricanes have the potential to cause devastating effects to lives and infrastructure, including housing, transportation, and various industries, leading to major economic impacts. The data mentioned describes how vulnerably positioned Florida is regarding hurricanes. The state's extensive coastline and its geographical location make it a prime target for these storms. This risk is especially prevalent during the hurricane season, which traditionally runs from June 1 to November 30 each year. The period from August to October is considered the peak of this season due to the warmer waters, which hurricanes use as fuel, reaching their highest temperatures. This frequency underscores the necessity for a robust hurricane preparedness strategy in Florida. Such a plan includes continual monitoring of weather updates, enforcement of building codes that can withstand high hurricanes, evacuation plans, flood zone mapping, and supporting residents in setting up emergency kits and insurance coverage. The state also plays a crucial role in conducting and supporting research related to hurricane forecasting and monitoring, participating in various programs and partnerships with national and international weather organizations to improve the accuracy and timeliness of hurricane predictions. These efforts help the state prepare adequately for hurricanes and minimize damage to property and loss of lives. Even with these measures in place, it is pivotal that residents take hurricanes warnings seriously and take all the necessary precautions to safeguard their lives and their properties. After all, preparedness often makes a crucial difference between recovery and catastrophe during extreme weather events like hurricanes."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: \\"Which happened first, the United States declared independence or the decisive defeat at Yorktown?\\" Context: \\"During the 1760s and early 1770s, relations between the Thirteen Colonies and Britain became increasingly strained, primarily because of resentment of the British Parliament's attempts to govern and tax American colonists without their consent. This was summarised at the time by the slogan \\"No taxation without representation\\", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen. The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

Choose a church or meeting to attend, or choose several and visit a new one each week. See where you fit in and feel comfortable. While some religions have strict rules about which church you can attend, most do not. Look around, visit different churches, and meet with different clergymen to find the right fit for you. Groups run the gamut, from Young Republicans to book clubs. Evaluate your interests and search for a local group of people who enjoy similar hobbies or interests. Social groups often have chapters worldwide. If you are already a member of any type of group, meet with the group’s leader to see if there is a branch in your new community, or a similar organization you can join. Some apps are intended for this exact purpose. Meetup, iGon, Weave, and Majikal are just a few that offer groups, events, and local business opportunities. A word of caution, however: any time you meet strangers, be wary of divulging contact information, and always meet in a public place. Many towns have message boards and Facebook groups designed to keep people in touch with one another. Search to see if your town has a message board or Facebook group, and join in the conversation. Some towns have Facebook groups specifically for selling or buying items, much like Craigslist. Although this might not seem like the ideal way to make friends, selling or searching for certain items could connect you to people in similar lifestyle situations, such as people with young children, or people who love to garden. Visit your city’s website for information about message boards. Many cities will have these groups posted directly to the city’s website. If you are working or going to school, you have a built-in network of people. While not every person you work or go to school with will be an instant connection, make yourself known and familiar around the office or school. If your colleagues are grabbing dinner after work, or having a drink, tag along. This will allow you to socialize without the pressure of getting work done, and will provide a low-key means of getting to know your coworkers. Make use of after-school programs or extracurricular groups to meet more people in a setting they are familiar or comfortable with. If you're not currently in school, you can even consider taking a course at a community college or joining an intramural sports group to meet people with similar interests. If you need help, ask for it. If you need help moving, find a moving service. If cleaning out your new home is drastically outside of your comfort zone, find a cleaning service and utilize their skills. You can meet some wonderful people by simply inviting them to perform a service for you. While this may not be a great way to make friends, it is a great way to get an idea of what types of people and activities you have in your new town. You can ask the people you’ve hired what they like to do for fun, where they like to eat, etc. Always treat people helping you with kindness. If they are providing a service, offer a tip. If they are helping for free (such as a neighbor helping you move in), give baked goods or a gift card in exchange.","completion":"This article is about different ways you can make friends and build connections when you move to a new place.

First question: Why do I forget things that I read so easily? Second question: Why do I usually forget things that I have just read? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First, let's address each question individually and then determine if they are asking the same thing. First question: Why do I forget things that I read so easily? Forgetting things you read easily can be attributed to several factors. These factors can be categorized into three main areas: 1. Cognitive factors: a. Limited attention: Our brain's ability to pay attention to a limited amount of information at a time can affect how well we retain information. If you're not focusing while reading, you're more likely to forget the material. b. Encoding: Our brain encodes information based on its perceived importance and relevance. If the material is not deemed important, it may not be encoded effectively, leading to reduced retention. c. Interference: New information can interfere with your memory of previously learned material. This can happen in two ways: proactive interference (when old information makes it difficult to remember new information) and retroactive interference (when new information makes it difficult to remember old information). 2. External factors: a. Distractions: Your environment plays a major role in your ability to remember what you read. A noisy or disruptive environment can affect your focus and subsequent retention of material. b. Lack of interest: If you have little interest in the topic you're reading about, it will be more challenging for you to retain that information. 3. Personal habits and techniques: a. Lack of repetition: Research has shown that repeated exposure to information can actively improve memory retention. If you are only reading material once, it could explain why you easily forget it. b. Absence of active learning strategies: Active learning strategies like summarizing, asking questions, or teaching the material to someone else can help improve retention. If you are not using these techniques, it might result in a higher likelihood of forgetting the material. Second question: Why do I usually forget things that I have just read? This question seems to be closely related to the first question, but it emphasizes the immediate lapse in memory after reading something. Reasons for forgetting things right after reading them can also be linked to the factors mentioned above. However, there is an additional factor that could shed light on this particular issue: 4. Short-term vs. Long-term Memory: When you read, the information is first stored in your short-term memory. If you don't invest enough time and effort to move the information from short-term to long-term memory, it will rapidly disappear. This transition can be facilitated by using spaced repetition, elaboration, and engaging in active learning strategies. Now, to address if these two questions are asking the same thing: Overall, it can be said that both questions are similar and largely address the same concern, which is forgetting things that have been read. However, the second question focuses more on the immediacy of the memory loss after reading, while the first question refers to a general tendency to forget what is read. Both questions share common causes rooted in cognitive factors, external factors, and personal habits and techniques. The key difference between them is the emphasis on short-term memory in the second question."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A council is to include the title 'Mx' on its official forms to be more accommodating to the trans-community. Campaigners say that 'Mx', short for 'Mixter', is a gender neutral alternative to Mr, Mrs, Ms and Miss. Brighton and Hove city council's trans-equality panel previously pointed out that the gender part of forms allows people to say if they are male, female or other. It said the lack of options in the title field does not provide for people who do not identify as male or female. Brighton and Hove city council is to offer 'Mx' as a title option on official forms following a review of services for trans people. Yesterday the council's policy and. resources committee approved a series of measures, including the removal of the need for patients to choose from male or female options when they check in at electronic screens on arrival at a GP surgery. Other recommendations include ensuring. all councillors and police staff undertake trans awareness training and. introducing gender neutral toilets and changing rooms, suggested by the council's trans-equality scrutiny panel. Brighton has a gay, lesbian, bisexual and trans population of about 40,000. The recommendations will now be passed on to the full council. Ruth Rose, 79, of Newhaven, Sussex, who was born male, said: 'It can be difficult in GP surgeries - I am not recognised. 'If I put in female I am not found if I put in male - which I am not - I am not found. 'You have to decide between one sex or the other depending on what stage of your transition you are at. 'And in some situations, for example, when you are getting your bins collected, does it matter if you are male or female?' The recommendation follows the suggestions from Brighton and Hove city council to introduce gender neutral toilets and send councillors and police to trans awareness training. The report noted: 'The Trans Equality Scrutiny Panel was ground-breaking, being the first in the country to carry out, in a sensitive and effective way, a detailed investigation into the experiences and needs of trans individuals and community in the city. 'It provides a firm and clear foundation for all public services to build on in terms of improving their understanding of and service provision to the trans community. 'For example, during the panel process housing officers committed to commissioning trans awareness training and city services committed looking at the introducing more flexibility on honorific titles (such as Mr, Ms) within online forms.' The clinical commissioning group made up of GPs across the county said it would implement the changes. Green Party councillor Phelim MacCafferty, chairman of the trans-equality and scrutiny panel which was set up in May 2012, said: 'Our transgender community is one of the most disadvantaged and marginalised groups in Brighton and Hove. 'There has been inadequate awareness of lives of trans people for too long. 'The recommendations of our cross party panel will make the city a fairer place for trans people to live, work, study or visit here.'

She carried a small bundle of matches in her hand, and a good many more in her tattered dress. No one had bought any of them the live long day; no one had given her a single penny. Trembling with cold and hunger crept she on, the picture of sorrow: poor little child! The snow-flakes fell on her long, fair hair, which curled in such pretty ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, or of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor of roast goose reached her from several houses;it was New Year's eve, and it was of this that she thought. In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the other. She sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in vain, she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat her,besides her home was almost as cold as the street,it was an attic; and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up with straw and rags. The wind and snow often penetrated through. Her hands were nearly dead with cold; one little match from her bundle would warm them. Perhaps, if she dared light it, she drew one out, and struck it against the wall, bravo! It was a bright, warm flame, and she held her hands over it.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found does not accurately define a boutique bank. Let me provide a detailed explanation of what boutique banks are. A boutique bank, also known as a boutique investment bank or boutique advisory firm, is a small and specialized financial institution that offers a narrow range of services, primarily focusing on investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and financial advisory services. These banks generally cater to specific industries or market segments and differentiate themselves by offering personalized services, deep industry knowledge, and a high level of expertise in their specific field. Unlike large, full-service investment banks, boutique banks usually have a smaller team of professionals who work closely with clients to provide more tailored and individualized solutions. The term \\"boutique\\" in this context highlights their specialized focus and smaller size compared to large, global financial institutions. Boutique banks often charge higher fees for their services due to their specialized knowledge and personalized approach, but clients may be willing to pay a premium for these specialized services. Many boutique firms can also compete with larger banks in terms of deal-making and advisory services by leveraging their expertise, nimble structure, and strong relationships within their respective industries or sectors. In summary, a boutique bank is a small, specialized financial institution that offers a limited range of services, mainly focused on investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and financial advisory, targeting specific industries or market segments.

Which country declared war on Japan - the day before the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki ?","completion":"The Soviet Union declared war on Japan on August 8, 1945, a day before the United States dropped the atomic bomb on Nagasaki on August 9, 1945. This declaration came at a critical moment in World War II as the conflict was nearing its end. During the Yalta Conference held in February 1945, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin had discussed their respective roles in the war's final stages. In those discussions, Stalin promised to join the war against Japan within three months after Germany's surrender, a commitment he upheld. Following Nazi Germany's defeat on May 8, 1945, the Soviet Union began shifting its resources and attention towards the Pacific front. Preparations were made to transfer large numbers of troops and equipment to the Far East in order to launch an offensive against Japanese-held territories in Manchuria, northern Korea, and other strategic locations. In the meantime, on July 26, 1945, the Allied forces issued the Potsdam Declaration, which called for Japan's unconditional surrender. The Japanese government declined to accept these terms, leading to the United States' decision to drop the atomic bomb on Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. The Soviet Union saw the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima as an opportunity to act swiftly, lest Japan surrender before they claimed the territories they desired. Thus, on August 8, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan and launched a massive military offensive in the Far East, known as the Soviet–Japanese War or the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation. The Soviets quickly advanced through Japanese-held territory, capturing large areas of Manchuria and parts of northern Korea. The combination of the Soviet declaration of war and the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki placed immense pressure on the Japanese government, ultimately leading to their unconditional surrender on August 15, 1945, and the formal signing of surrender documents on September 2, 1945. In conclusion, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan a day before the atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki, which played a significant role in shaping the final stages of World War II and the subsequent division of influence in the post-war world, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Before you start your dog on a diet, check with the vet. Many clinics run a dog weight loss program where your pet is weighed and you can get specific instructions about how much to feed your dog. These regular weigh-ins, firm target, and moral support can make you more likely to succeed in putting your dog on an effective diet. Your vet may recommend one of the following diets: High Fiber/Low-Fat Diet: These contain fiber which expand in your dog's stomach, making him feel full. The package instructions should clearly state how much to feed your dog based on a target (goal) weight. Metabolic diets: These are more high tech and feed the genes that improve your dog's metabolism. Increasing metabolism can make your dog burn more calories, causing him to lose weight. Pay attention to how much you're currently feeding your dog. If your dog is fed twice a day, weigh out the total amount so you know how much he's eating. However, if your dog has food constantly available, it's harder to determine how much he's eating. This makes it more difficult to know how much to cut down. If this is the case, look at the food package and see how much it advises feeding a dog at your dog's target rate. For most dogs, the package will advise a weight range. For example, 300 to 350 grams of food a day. You'd want to choose the lower amount of 300 grams. Once you've determined how much your dog needs to eat a day, reduce the amount by 5 to 10%. For example, if you are feeding 300g of kibble a day, 10% of this is 30g, so the new amount is 270g. Feed this reduced amount for one or two weeks and weigh your dog. Hopefully, he loses weight, but if he hasn't, deduct another 5 to 10% from his daily food amount. Weigh your dog again after feeding the reduced amount for another week or two. Don't be upset or worried if the portion size looks small or your dog pesters you for food. This is a normal concern when putting a dog on a diet. If you're really unsettled, you may want to feed a prescription weight loss diet instead. Since you'll be cutting back on your dog's food and increasing exercise, you'll need to offer positive encourage every so often. While you can praise your dog, you can also give him the rare treat. Just be sure to offer something healthy that will also make him feel full and satisfied. Some good options include: Bran or grated vegetable mixed with his food French or runner beans, raw Apples (in moderation) Bananas (in moderation) Get your dog involved in earning his food, rather than just set it out in front of him. Buy a puzzle or activity feeder that you can fill with food. Your dog then moves shapes around or rolls balls around to get the food inside to fall out. This can make your dog more active and mentally engaged. Try to prevent boredom while your dog's on a diet. Keeping his mind occupied will prevent him from thinking about food. Training is also a great way to keep a dog active and prevent boredom. Of course training depends heavily on rewards, so take some of his dinner kibble and set it aside for rewards or give him lots of praising. Weigh your dog once every week or two so you can track any weight loss. This will also indicate whether your diet and routine are working. If he isn't losing, then you can reevaluate what you're doing. Make sure your goals are reasonable and that you're consistent with the regimen. Don't expect sudden drops in weight. Instead, look for slow and steady weight loss which is more sustainable. Smaller dogs should aim to lose no more than four ounces a week while larger dogs can aim for one pound per week. If you have a large dog or do not have access to scales, use a tape measure. Chose a point on the dog such as his girth or his waist and measure around it. Make a note of any landmarks the tape passes over, such as a particular pattern or spot, so you place the tape in the same place each time. Summary:","completion":"Consult a veterinarian before starting your dog on a diet, as they can provide guidance on appropriate weight loss programs, feeding amounts, diet types, and offer moral support, while monitoring your dog's progress through regular weigh-ins and adjustments to ensure slow, steady, and healthy weight loss."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What part of the constitution are affirmative action programs based in? Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

(H). russia. Answer:","completion":"Answer: (G). middle latitudes. Based on the hints provided by your teacher, we can conclude that the best answer to the question is 'middle latitudes'. Here's a detailed explanation: Unequal heating of Earth's surface by the Sun is a primary factor in the creation of global wind patterns. Due to Earth's spherical shape and the tilt of its axis, some parts of the planet receive more direct sunlight and are therefore warmer. In contrast, the poles receive less direct sunlight, causing them to be colder. Differences in temperature between the warm equator and the cold poles create pressure gradients that, in turn, drive the movement of air. This results in the development of global wind patterns, which are influenced by Earth's rotation and the unequal heating of its surface. Large cyclonic systems, also known as mid-latitude cyclones or extratropical cyclones, are weather systems that arise within the middle latitudes of the Earth (roughly between 30° and 60° latitude). These systems are responsible for many of the storms and severe weather events in the mid-latitude regions. In summary, the unequal heating of Earth's surface by the Sun causes large cyclonic systems to form in the middle latitudes, influencing the wind patterns observed within these regions. Therefore, the best answer to the question is 'middle latitudes' (G)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Doncaster were in control throughout the first period with Blackpool keeper Sam Slocombe producing fine saves from efforts by Joe Wright, Alfie May and Tommy Rowe. But the pattern of the game changed entirely on 52 minutes when Matty Blair was sent off for Doncaster for two bookable offences.

The South Korean air carrier said that KTVU-TV has already apologized for using fake names for four pilots on a plane that crashed in San Francisco on July 6. It will no longer sue, as it had said it would do. Asiana says it wants to focus on supporting passengers and families. The crash killed three and injured dozens. Last week, an anchor for KTVU-TV read the fake names _ apparently someone's idea of a prank to use fake Asian-style names that sounded out distress calls and curse words _ on air and then apologized after a break. Asiana earlier said the report seriously damaged its reputation. It said Monday that it would sue the TV station to respond to the racially discriminatory report that disparaged Asians. ||||| Two passengers aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crashed while landing in San Francisco have sued the carrier, claiming they suffered \\"extreme and catastrophic injuries and emotional distress\\" as a result of the accident. The suit is believed to be the first following the July 6 crash. A lawyer for Asiana didn't respond to a request for comment. Asiana flight 214 hit a sea wall in front of a runway at San Francisco International Airport and skidded to a stop before catching fire. Three passengers died and dozens more were injured. In their initial probe, National Transportation Safety Board investigators didn't find evidence of equipment malfunctions, agency Chairman Deborah Hersman said last week. The agency was looking into whether the pilots had received adequate training, according to people familiar with the investigation. Asiana officials have repeatedly said the pilots were both highly experienced and the airline's training programs meet all international and South Korean requirements. The lawsuit was filed in San Francisco federal court by Younga Jun Machorro and her son, Benjamin Hyo-Ik Machorro. Also joining the suit was Hector Machorro, the husband of Younga and father of Benjamin, who wasn't aboard the flight. He claims losses stemming from his wife's injuries. \\"The conduct of Asiana's flight crew was egregiously reckless and negligent,\\" said Michael Verna of Bowles & Verna LLP, the Walnut Creek, Calif., lawyers for the plaintiffs. \\"These pilots were unable to do the most basic task—land on a runway in the middle of a clear day with no wind.\\" Mr. Verna said that both Ms. Machorro and her son were treated at San Francisco General Hospital after the crash. X-rays revealed no broken bones, said Mr. Verna, but both suffered injuries to their backs and were still undergoing treatment. Under an international treaty, Asiana, of South Korea, is liable for up to 150,000 in damages per injured passenger—damages that likely would be paid by the airline's insurers, legal experts said. Passengers might recover more if they can show the airline was at fault for the crash, as the Machorros allege. The crash \\"occurred due to the gross negligence and recklessness of the Asiana flight crew on Flight 214,\\" reads the complaint, \\"in woeful violation of numerous international and United States airline industry standards and established flight rules.\\" The Montreal Convention allows victims of the crash to sue Asiana in U.S. courts if they are permanent U.S. residents, purchased tickets in the U.S. or were flying into the U.S. as a final destination. All three plaintiffs are U.S. citizens, according to the suit. Litigation over air disasters typically takes months or longer to unfold. Often, lawsuits are consolidated and handled by a single federal judge, a process known as multidistrict litigation. Ladd Sanger, an aviation lawyer and commercially rated pilot in Dallas, said this would likely happen to any suits related to the Asiana incident. \\"We're going to see a lot of these filed in the weeks to come,\\" he said. \\"This is probably the first of many.\\" The crash has stoked a long-running debate over how aggressively plaintiff attorneys are permitted to seek out clients after an aviation tragedy. Federal law mandates what is effectively a 45-day moratorium, during which lawyers are barred from directly soliciting to represent commercial air-crash victims or their families. The restrictions often aren't enforced effectively, and veteran lawyers are replete with stories about how the rules have been skirted. But in the case of the Asiana crash, federal accident investigators and local law-enforcement appear to have tried particularly hard to make lawyers toe the line. James Kreindler, a veteran aviation litigator with the New York law firm Kreindler and Kreindler LLP, said he has never experienced such a show of force by local police to keep certain lawyers from entering the hotel where many family members were staying after the Asiana crash. \\"I've never seen such tight controls,\\" he said. \\"You couldn't get through the front door unless you had a prearranged meeting with a specific hotel guest.\\" Mr. Kreindler said he supports such restrictions because it prevents lawyers from trying to land clients with unfounded or exaggerated promises. The NTSB also stepped up its game. Several days after the crash, the agency's general counsel's office sent out a mass email to members of the San Francisco Bar Association about the 45-day rule. \\"We are closely following the activities of attorneys,\\" the message said, \\"and will immediately notify state bar ethics officials and other appropriate authorities if impermissible activity is suspected.\\" A spokeswoman for the NTSB said \\"it is typical for local law enforcement to secure the family center,\\" or hotel where family members are housed. —Joe Palazzolo and Jon Ostrower contributed to this article.

Kwon Yong Bok, director general of aviation safety policy at the transport ministry, said the government informed Asiana on April 30 it should hire more pilots, engineers and cabin crew as the airline planned to increase its fleet of airplanes by 20 percent by 2017. It currently has 80 planes. \\"We asked the company to review its safety policies once again,\\" Kwon said by phone. He said the ministry also recommended that Asiana centralize its safety management system and set up an oversight team for aircraft maintenance. The recommendations were made as part of a safety consulting program that the ministry set up for the airline industry to minimize the risk of accidents. Asiana Flight 214 crash-landed at San Francisco's international airport on July 6, killing three people and injuring dozens. Twelve people are still hospitalized including five cabin crew, South Korea's transport ministry said Monday. The crash of the Boeing 777 was Asiana's first accident since a cargo plane landed in waters near South Korea's Jeju island in 2011, killing two pilots. Its deadliest plane accident was in 1993 when a domestic flight crashed south of Seoul, killing 66 people. The cause of the San Francisco accident is still being probed but investigators have so far found no evidence of mechanical problems with the plane. ||||| A Chicago law firm has taken steps to sue Boeing Co. on behalf of 83 people who were aboard the Asiana Airlines flight that crash-landed in San Francisco earlier this month, alleging that a malfunction of the plane's autothrottle may have caused the crash. Ribbeck Law Chartered on Monday filed a petition for discovery, which is meant to preserve evidence, in Cook County Circuit Court in Chicago, where the aircraft manufacturer is headquartered. The firm said in a news release that additional pleadings will be filed against Asiana Airlines and several component parts manufacturers in coming days. In addition to potential problems with the Boeing 777's auto throttle, some emergency slides reportedly opened inside the plane, injuring passengers and blocking their exit, and some passengers had to be cut out of their seatbelts with a knife, the firm contends. Three Chinese teenage girls were killed when the airplane, carrying 307 passengers and crew on a flight from South Korea to San Francisco International Airport on July 6, approached the runway too low and slow. The plane clipped a seawall at the end of a runway, tearing off the tail and sending the plane spinning down the runway. The impact caused the plane to catch fire. \\"We must find the causes of the crash and demand that the problems with the airline and the aircraft are immediately resolved to avoid future tragedies,\\" attorney Monica R. Kelly, head of Ribbeck's aviation department, said in a written statement. Boeing spokesman John Dern said the company had no comment. The petition asks a judge to order Boeing to identify the designer and manufacturer of the airplane's autothrottle and its emergency evacuation slides. It also seeks information on the systems that indicate the airplane's glide slope and that warn how close it is to the ground. Kelly said the firm wants to protect the wreckage \\"from destructive testing\\" and to obtain maintenance records, internal memos and other evidence. A passenger filed a lawsuit against Asiana in San Francisco federal court on Monday, saying the airline showed \\"wanton and willful disregard for the rights and safety of all passengers,\\" the San Francisco Chronicle reported. Younga Jun Machorro and her 8-year-old son, Benjamin Machorro, were seated toward the front of the plane and both suffered back and neck injuries, their lawyer, Michael Verna, told the newspaper. The pilots of Asiana Flight 214 have told investigators they were relying on automated cockpit equipment to control their speed. Inspectors found that the autothrottle had been \\"armed,\\" or made ready for activation, but investigators are still determining whether it had been engaged, the National Transportation Safety Board has said. Two of the plane's eight slides malfunctioned, opening inside the cabin and pinning two flight attendants underneath. ||||| The wreckage of Asiana Flight 214, which crashed on Saturday, July 6, 2013, seen at San Francisco International Airport, in San Francisco, Friday, July 12, 2013.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? well , i 'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop","completion":"Analyzing the sentiment of a sentence can depend on various factors such as context, specific words, phrases, or even punctuation used. However, based on the sentence provided \\"Well, I'm not exactly sure what -- and has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop\\", the sentiment appears to be negative. One of the crucial elements in determining this is the phrase \\"has all the dramatic weight of a raindrop\\". This phrase suggests that whatever is being referred to lacks significance or impact; comparing it to the \\"dramatic weight of a raindrop\\" insinuates it's light, minimal, or inconsequential. Typically, such weightlessness or minimal impact is not regarded as a positive aspect, especially when referring to things needing substantial weight or impact (like a dramatic performance, a statement, an argument, a discovery, etc.). Hence, this shows a clear expression of dissatisfaction, disappointment, or criticism, which inherently are negative sentiments. Additionally, the first part of the sentence \\"Well, I'm not exactly sure what–\\" creates an undercurrent of uncertainty or confusion, which is another indicator of negativity. Although not directly negative, this uncertainty in context juxtaposes the subsequent part of the sentence, reinforcing the negative sentiment. The use of the filler word \\"well\\" is also typically employed to express hesitation, another marker towards a negative sentiment. However, it's important to note that sentiment analysis is not always an exact science and can vary based on additional context, dialect, or personal interpretation. Also, the negativity here is mild and not intense, provided the language used is more suggestive and metaphorical rather than overtly critical. Still, the general lean would be towards a negative sentiment based on these considerations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The worst mistake you can make is to walk into a comedy set completely cold. This sets you up for nervously laughing at your own jokes! Even the best comedians need to spend some time preparing what they are going to say. Create a set list for yourself. Make a list of each joke you will tell. Think about transitions. How does one joke flow into the next? Is there some kind of logical progression? Keep in mind what kind of people you expect to see in the audience. Certain demographics will be more or less likely to enjoy certain types of jokes. An open mic at a church, for example, may not be the best place to try out very dirty material. Whether you’re the type of comic who follows a script or one who tends to free-style, rehearsal will always make your set better. Plus, it is the most effective way to stop yourself from laughing at your own jokes. Set aside time to run through your entire set 2-3 times before you take the stage. The more times you rehearse your jokes, the more normalized they become, and the less likely you are to laugh. Be sure to time yourself. This way you’ll ensure that you have the right amount of material, and you can move through your set without concerning yourself with time. before taking the stage. Taking the stage cold sets you up for nervous laughter. Before you take the stage, find a way to warm yourself up, and release any “silly energy.” Put on your favorite song and dance around making funny noises and goofy faces in the mirror. Laugh at yourself. Move your body, use your voice, and wiggle the muscles in your face. All of these actions dispel nervous energy and prepare you to tell jokes on stage effectively, without bursting into laughter. If you do a good job of making the people around you laugh, you won’t need to laugh to fill the silence. Prevent yourself from laughing at your own jokes by making other people laugh. Use vocal variation. Don’t fall into a monotone delivery. Signal the punchline. Pause for a moment to let the audience know it’s coming. Use a call-back. Reference something funny you said near the beginning of your set near the end. Audiences love this. If you really want to strengthen your comedy and prevent yourself from laughing at your own jokes, the only true remedy is spending as much time as you can telling jokes on stage. You can’t perform once a month (or less) and expect to improve at your craft. Try to make it out 1-3 times per week. Begin by seeking out comedy open mics. You can find these advertised at coffee shops or bars, or in a local entertainment paper. Open mics are where you can practice, connect with other comics, and gain exposure. If you do well at open mics, you will be invited to perform at more regular gigs.

Cooper was born on May 7, 1901, in Helena, Montana to Alice (nee Brazier, 1873-1967) and Charles Henry Cooper (1865-1946). His father had emigrated from Houghton Regis, Bedfordshire and was a prominent lawyer, rancher, and (later) a Montana Supreme Court justice. His mother had emigrated from Gillingham, Kent and married Charles in Montana. In 1906, Charles purchased the 600-acre (240 ha) Seven-Bar-Nine cattle ranch about fifty miles (eighty kilometers) north of Helena near the town of Craig on the Missouri River. In early 1925, Cooper began his film career in silent pictures such as The Thundering Herd and Wild Horse Mesa with Jack Holt, Riders of the Purple Sage and The Lucky Horseshoe with Tom Mix, and The Trail Rider with Buck Jones. He worked for several Poverty Row studios, including Famous Players-Lasky and Fox Film Corporation. While his skilled horsemanship led to steady work in Westerns, Cooper found the stunt work--which sometimes injured horses and riders--\\"tough and cruel\\". Hoping to move beyond the risky stunt work and obtain acting roles, Cooper paid for a screen test and hired casting director Nan Collins to work as his agent. Knowing that other actors were using the name \\"Frank Cooper\\", Collins suggested he change his first name to \\"Gary\\" after her hometown of Gary, Indiana. Cooper immediately liked the name. Cooper also found work in a variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood survivor in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, he began to land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, he began to attract the attention of major film studios. On June 1, 1926, Cooper signed a contract with Samuel Goldwyn Productions for fifty dollars a week. Cooper's first important film role was in The Winning of Barbara Worth (1926) with Ronald Colman and Vilma Banky, in which he plays a young engineer who helps a rival suitor save the woman he loves and her town from an impending dam disaster. Cooper's experience living among the Montana cowboys gave his performance an \\"instinctive authenticity\\", according to biographer Jeffrey Meyers. The film was a major success. Critics singled out Cooper as a \\"dynamic new personality\\" and future star. Goldwyn rushed to offer Cooper a long-term contract, but he held out for a better deal--finally signing a five-year contract with Jesse L. Lasky at Paramount Pictures for 175 a week. In 1927, with help from Clara Bow, Cooper landed high-profile roles in Children of Divorce and Wings, the latter being the first film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. That year, Cooper also appeared in his first starring roles in Arizona Bound and Nevada--both films directed by John Waters. In 1928, Paramount paired Cooper with a youthful Fay Wray in The Legion of the Condemned and The First Kiss--advertising them as the studio's \\"glorious young lovers\\". Their on-screen chemistry failed to generate much excitement with audiences. With each new film, Cooper's acting skills improved and his popularity continued to grow, especially among female movie-goers. During this time, he was earning as much as 2,750 per film and receiving a thousand fan letters a week. Looking to exploit Cooper's growing audience appeal, the studio placed him opposite popular leading ladies such as Evelyn Brent in Beau Sabreur, Florence Vidor in Doomsday, and Esther Ralston in Half a Bride. That year, Cooper also made Lilac Time with Colleen Moore for First National Pictures, his first movie with synchronized music and sound effects. It became one of the most commercially successful films of 1928.","completion":"This text is about Gary Cooper, an actor who began his film career in silent pictures and gradually gained prominence, attracting the attention of major film studios and earning starring roles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who is Norma Desmond's butler? Movie title: Sunset Boulevard Movie plot: At a Sunset Boulevard mansion, the body of Joe Gillis floats in the swimming pool. In a flashback, Joe relates the events leading to his death. Six months earlier, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe tries selling Paramount Pictures producer Sheldrake on a story he submitted. Script reader Betty Schaefer harshly critiques it in Joe's presence, unaware that he is the author. Later, while fleeing from repossession men seeking his car, Joe turns into the driveway of a seemingly deserted mansion. After concealing the car, he hears a woman calling him, apparently mistaking him for someone else. Ushered in by Max, her butler, Joe recognizes the woman as long-forgotten silent film star Norma Desmond. Learning he is a writer, she asks his opinion of a script she has written for a film about Salome. She plans to play the role herself in a comeback. Joe finds her script abysmal, but flatters her into hiring him as a script doctor. Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe resents but gradually accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses to face the fact that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max, who tells him Norma is subject to depression and has made suicide attempts. Norma lavishes attention on Joe and buys him expensive clothes. At her New Year's Eve party, he discovers he is the only guest and realizes she has fallen in love with him. He tries to let her down gently, but she slaps him and retreats to her room. Joe visits his friend Artie Green to ask about staying at his place. At Artie's party, he again meets Betty, who he learns is Artie's girl. Betty thinks a scene in one of Joe's scripts has potential, but Joe is uninterested. When Joe phones Max to have him pack his things, Max tells him Norma cut her wrists with his razor. Joe returns to Norma.

The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. When can the National Guard be deployed to the border of US and Mexico? - after approval from Trump only - not enough information - before approval from the states - after approval from the states and Trump The answer is:","completion":"- after approval from the states and Trump"},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a passage and a question regarding that passage.

You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Problem:Passage: In the China of the Yuan, or Mongol era, various important developments in the arts occurred or continued in their development, including the areas of painting, mathematics, calligraphy, poetry, and theater, with many great artists and writers being famous today. Due to the coming together of painting, poetry, and calligraphy at this time many of the artists practicing these different pursuits were the same individuals, though perhaps more famed for one area of their achievements than others. Often in terms of the further development of landscape painting as well as the classical joining together of the arts of painting, poetry, and calligraphy, the Song dynasty and the Yuan dynasty are linked together. In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show. Another important consideration regarding Yuan dynasty arts and culture is that so much of it has survived in China, relatively to works from the Tang dynasty and Song dynasty, which have often been better preserved in places such as the Shōsōin, in Japan.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Magma is formed when rock melts inside the Earth&#x27;s crust - Magma rises - Collects inside magma chambers underneath a volcano - Pressure builds in the magma chambers as they fill - Gain energy for eruption - Some of the energy is converted into seismic activity (earthquakes) - If the magma building in the volcano is thick and sticky it will trap gases - Results in an explosive eruption when the pressure becomes too intense - If the magma is thin and runs - The magma results in a low-pressure, slow-moving flow of magma instead of a violent eruption - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the magma rises less happens, how will it affect the magma building in the volcano is thinner. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of magma rising less in the process can have both direct and indirect effects on the process. If the magma does not rise as much as usual, it can lead to a change in the type of magma built up in the volcano, resulting in thinner magma. The impact of this perturbation on the eruption process can be analyzed through various aspects. 1. Magma composition: The composition of magma plays a crucial role in determining its viscosity (thickness). If the perturbation causes the magma to rise inadequately inside the Earth's crust, it can potentially lead to a change in the magma's composition. A thinner and less viscous magma primarily consists of a higher percentage of basaltic components, which generally have a lower melting point and are runnier. 2. Magma chamber filling: As magma rises less in the perturbed scenario, the magma chambers underneath the volcano might fill up slower or not fill up completely. Consequently, this could result in either a delayed eruption or a lower intensity eruption as the pressure build-up might be insufficient to trigger a massive eruption. 3. Seismic activity and pressure release: With less magma rising, the associated seismic activity (earthquakes) might be reduced, indicating lesser energy conversion. It could also lead to a gradual release of pressure, which might prevent an explosive eruption. 4. Eruption style and intensity: Thinner magma has a lower gas content, making it less explosive. In the perturbed situation, where the magma is thinner, the likelihood of a violent, explosive eruption decreases, leading to a more effusive, slow-moving flow of lava. This change in eruption style and intensity directly results from the perturbation in the magma rising process. 5. Landscape formation: With thinner magma, the lava flows will be more fluid and runny, potentially altering the landscape formations created by the eruption. Slower-moving flows could lead to a more gentle topography, shaping the surrounding terrain differently from a more explosive eruption. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of magma rising less can have significant direct and indirect effects on the volcanic eruption process. These effects may vary depending on the specific volcano and its geological setting, but the overall consequence of the perturbation can result in a change in eruption style, intensity, and landscape formation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this: The six Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe, while nominally independent, were widely recognized in the international community as the Soviet satellite states. All had been occupied by the Soviet Red Army in 1945, had Soviet-style socialist states imposed upon them, and had very restricted freedom of action in either domestic or international affairs. Any moves towards real independence were suppressed by military force – in the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring in 1968. Gorbachev abandoned the oppressive and expensive Brezhnev Doctrine, which mandated intervention in the Warsaw Pact states, in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of allies – jokingly termed the Sinatra Doctrine in a reference to the Frank Sinatra song \\"My Way\\". Other than being expensive what was wrong with the Brezhnev Doctrine? What is the answer? (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"The Brezhnev Doctrine, developed under Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, was a policy that justified the Soviet Union's intervention in the affairs of its Eastern European satellite states in order to prevent any deviation from Soviet-style socialism. While its primary issue, as you've mentioned, was the financial burden it imposed on the Soviet Union, there were several other problems with the doctrine: 1. Suppression of individual autonomy and sovereignty: By adhering to the Brezhnev Doctrine, the Soviet Union effectively undermined the sovereign rights of its Eastern European satellite countries. The doctrine gave the Soviet Union the authority to impose its will onto its satellite states, thereby stripping them of their ability to exercise their own autonomy in both domestic and international affairs. The use of force during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Prague Spring in 1968 demonstrated the extent to which the doctrine suppressed these nations' rights to self-determination. 2. Human rights violations: Due to the influence of the Brezhnev Doctrine, Eastern European countries were subjected to numerous human rights abuses. As the Soviet Union sought to quell any movements toward independence, it resorted to the use of force, political repression, and curtailing of civil liberties, resulting in many fatalities and the suffering of the general population. 3. Damage to the Soviet image and diplomatic relations: The doctrine not only aggravated tensions between the Soviet Union and the West but also eroded the Soviet Union's international reputation. The aggressive enforcement of the Brezhnev Doctrine fueled mistrust and opposition from other global powers, particularly the United States and its NATO allies, further exacerbating Cold War tensions. 4. Hindrance to internal reforms: The Brezhnev Doctrine promoted the maintenance of the status quo in the Soviet Union and its satellite states, making it difficult for these countries to introduce significant political, social, or economic reforms as they feared reprisals from the Soviet Union. In summary, while the financial burden of the Brezhnev Doctrine was a major issue, the policy also had several other negative consequences, including the suppression of the Eastern European countries' autonomy and sovereignty, human rights abuses, a damaged international image, and a hindrance to necessary internal reforms. By replacing the Brezhnev Doctrine with the Sinatra Doctrine, Gorbachev essentially gave these nations greater freedom to pursue their internal affairs without fear of Soviet intervention, ultimately pushing for more openness and reforms in the Eastern Bloc."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Mike is studying for his physics exam. He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. The answer is:","completion":"Scenario D To justify my answer, let's go step-by-step: 1. The question asks us to compare Scenario A and Scenario D in terms of their likelihood of being used in the everyday world. 2. Scenario A uses Pascals, which is an SI unit, and is more common in scientific contexts. 3. The hint provided mentions that Torr and psi are not SI units, and psi is specifically mentioned as a pressure unit commonly used in the everyday world. 4. Scenario D uses psi (pounds per square inch), which, as per the hint, is commonly used in everyday situations, such as measuring tire pressure or air pressure in various applications. 5.

It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1922 the British Empire held sway over about 458 million people, one-fifth of the world's population at the time, and covered more than 13,000,000 sq mi (33,670,000 km2), almost a quarter of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I'll start by apologizing to filmmakers everywhere for using the terms \\"filmmaker\\", \\"film\\", or \\"movie\\" in connection with this, but \\"criminal\\" and \\"crime against humanity\\" seem a bit harsh. The writing: pathetic. The directing: pathetic. The acting: pathetic. The cinematography: too inept for words. The technical skills used to assemble this atrocity: NONE WHATSOEVER. This lump of waste could hardly be called cinema. The majority of family home movies come closer to earning that distinction than Revenge Quest. No, this is just a 10 car pile-up caught on video. We'll skip the plot in this review, because there are far too many holes to be covered at once. Let's just say that it stinks worse than the rest of this movie. To call the acting one-dimensional would be giving them credit. What little there is, is atrocious to begin with, and made much worse by the terrible video and editing. The worst part of this atrocity, though, apart from the plot, would have to be the effects... or rather the disturbing lack thereof. There are no blanks in the guns, no flashpots, and what few sound effects existed were either stock \\"gun\\" sounds, or they were generated by mouth (yeah, you read that right). The filmmaker actually had the audacity to record a \\"shh\\" sound for the elevator doors; I guess he felt it made them sound more futuristic. This is supposed to be set in the year 2031, after all. That doesn't explain the sounds he created by mouth for the fist-fight scenes, however. If it wasn't bad enough that the sound quality is terrible (he just used the microphone that was mounted on the video camera, and it shows), the use of stock gun sounds was almost worse than not using any sounds at all. The sound effects stand out from the rest of the soundtrack like a drunken yak in a herd of sheep, and they're just as clumsy. Picture this: The bad guy enters an office building searching for his prey. A lady starts to run in fear. He raises his gun (an uzi), and shakes it. We hear a sound that is clearly not an uzi. The woman runs away from camera, and suddenly a single blood pack (only 1) explodes on her back (looked like she was hit by a paintball), and she falls flat on her face. Bear in mind that my description does far too much justice to the ineptitude of the actual sequence. In another sequence, one which almost- but not quite- makes the movie funny enough to watch, takes place in a stairwell. The bad guy chases the good guy and the lady he's protecting down the stairs, shaking his plastic uzi all the way. You may wish to duck; there are badly timed sound effects flying all over the place. I supposed Alan DeHerrera can't be locked away for conceiving of this train wreck, but he did follow through all the way to editing and releasing it. If there's any justice, there's bound to be some karma out there with his name on it. Should you decide to watch this lump of industrial waste- and I would strongly advise against it- be sure to watch for the entire scenes lifted nearly verbatim from Bladerunner, and the AM radio that doubles as a walkie-talkie.

They go out for a night on the town, where the Tramp inadvertently causes much havoc. Early the next morning, they return to the mansion and encounter the Flower Girl en route to her vending spot.

Formed in 1997 in Houston, Texas, Destiny's Child members began their musical career as Girl's Tyme, formed in 1990, comprising Knowles, Rowland, LaTavia Roberson, and LeToya Luckett among others. After years of limited success, the quartet were signed in 1997 to Columbia Records and Music World Entertainment as Destiny's Child. Destiny's Child was launched into mainstream recognition following the release of their best-selling second album, The Writing's on the Wall (1999), which contained the number-one singles \\"Bills, Bills, Bills\\" and \\"Say My Name\\". Destiny's Child reunited for a farewell performance at the 2006 NBA All-Star Game on February 19, 2006 in Houston, Texas; however, Knowles commented, \\"It's the last album, but it's not the last show.\\" Their final televised performance was at the Fashion Rocks benefit concert in New York a few days later. On March 28, 2006, Destiny's Child was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the 2,035th recipient of the coveted recognition. At the 2006 BET Awards, Destiny's Child won Best Group, a category they also earned in 2005 and 2001. After their formal disbandment, all members resumed their solo careers and have each experienced different levels of success. Since then, Knowles, Rowland and Williams have continued to collaborate on each other's solo projects through song features, music video appearances, and live performances. Both Rowland and Williams, along with Knowles' sister Solange, appeared in Knowles' music video for her single \\"Get Me Bodied\\" (2007).

In 2008, Knowles recorded a cover of Billy Joel's \\"Honesty\\" for Destiny's Child's compilation album Mathew Knowles & Music World Present Vol.1: Love Destiny, which was released only in Japan to celebrate the group's tenth anniversary. Rowland made a cameo appearance in Knowles' music video for her single \\"Party\\" (2011), and the group's third compilation album, Playlist: The Very Best of Destiny's Child, was released in 2012 to mark the fifteenth anniversary since their formation. The fourth compilation album, Love Songs, was released on January 29, 2013, and included the newly recorded song \\"Nuclear\\", produced by Pharrell Williams. \\"Nuclear\\" marked the first original music from Destiny's Child in eight years. The following month, Rowland and Williams appeared as special guests for Knowles' Super Bowl XLVII halftime show, where they performed \\"Bootylicious\\", \\"Independent Women\\" and Knowles' own song \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\".

Consider the theme you chose to write your piece around and chose an event related to it. It could be part of an everyday routine or something large that changes your character’s life. For example, if your theme is about loss, you may write your flash fiction piece about how someone’s daily routine changes the day after someone they loved passed away. Exposition and backstory take up a lot of words when you’re writing a flash fiction piece. Instead of explaining how your character got into a situation, start right when the event occurs. That way, you hook the reader to your story and don’t include boring or unnecessary information. For example, you may write something like, “Jess walked out into the rain after midnight, thinking of ways she could win back all of the money she had lost at the poker table that night.” If you need to include exposition about your character, work it into their dialogue. The conflict is what causes tension and creates your story. Use your antagonist to challenge your main character so they have something to overcome. That way, your reader will feel satisfied as your character finishes their arc. For example, if you were writing a story about a boxing match, you may have your antagonist wound your main character so it’s more challenging for your protagonist to win the fight. Don’t use multiple conflicts in a flash fiction piece since it can get confusing and wordy. Many flash fiction pieces end with a surprise ending that the reader doesn’t expect. Make the ending is a resolution to the conflict you told throughout your writing but done in a surprising way. That way, your readers will feel satisfied with the story and want to read it again. Make sure the surprise fits with the rest of the story. For example, readers would be unsatisfied if a meteor fell out of the sky and stopped a monster from attacking. Do your best to avoid jokey twist endings since they’re overused. Summary:","completion":"Writing flash fiction is about picking one moment or event in your character's life and building your short story around it. This could be about a happy or sad day, or a big life change. Instead of telling your reader lots of information about your character, you want to jump right into the action. This makes your story much more interesting! If your story is about a problem or conflict, it should be something that gives your main character a challenge, but not too many problems because that can be confusing. Flash fiction often ends with a surprise. The surprise should make sense with the story and make your readers happy and want to read your story again. Ending your story with a silly or overused twist might not make your readers happy, so it's best to avoid that."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee.

Question: How did Jefferson avoid Virginia's possible provision of theology at UVA? Context: Jefferson's opponents said his position was the destruction and the governmental rejection of Christianity, but this was a caricature. In setting up the University of Virginia, Jefferson encouraged all the separate sects to have preachers of their own, though there was a constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity, arising from his own Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom. Some have argued that this arrangement was \\"fully compatible with Jefferson's views on the separation of church and state;\\" however, others point to Jefferson's support for a scheme in which students at the University would attend religious worship each morning as evidence that his views were not consistent with strict separation. Still other scholars, such as Mark David Hall, attempt to sidestep the whole issue by arguing that American jurisprudence focuses too narrowly on this one Jeffersonian letter while failing to account for other relevant history","completion":"Jefferson avoided Virginia's possible provision of theology at the University of Virginia (UVA) by encouraging all separate sects to have their own preachers, despite the constitutional ban on the State supporting a Professorship of Divinity.

Because LEDs produce less waste heat than incandescent lamps, their use in freezers can save on refrigeration costs as well. However, they may be more susceptible to frost and snow buildup than incandescent lamps, so some LED lighting systems have been designed with an added heating circuit. Additionally, research has developed heat sink technologies that will transfer heat produced within the junction to appropriate areas of the light fixture.\\"? The answer is:","completion":"A suitable question for the passage: \\"Explain how LED technology is beneficial for supermarket freezer lighting and describe the challenges faced when using LEDs in such environments. Discuss the solutions that have been implemented to overcome these challenges.\\" The answer to this question could be: LED technology is advantageous for supermarket freezer lighting primarily because its efficacy is inversely proportional to operating temperature. This means that LEDs function more effectively in colder environments like freezers. Moreover, LEDs produce less waste heat compared to incandescent lamps, leading to savings on refrigeration costs for the supermarket. However, LEDs face certain challenges when used in freezer lighting. They are more susceptible to frost and snow buildup compared to incandescent lamps, which, if not addressed, can affect their performance. To tackle this issue, some LED lighting systems have been designed with an added heating circuit to help melt the frost and snow that accumulate on the LEDs. Furthermore, research has led to the development of heat sink technologies, which play a crucial role in ensuring the optimal performance of LED lighting in freezers. These heat sink technologies transfer the heat produced within the junction of the LEDs to appropriate areas of the light fixture, preventing overheating and maintaining the efficiency of the LED lighting system. In conclusion, LED technology offers numerous benefits for supermarket freezer lighting. Despite the challenges faced, innovative solutions have been developed to make them a suitable option for efficient and cost-effective lighting in these temperature-controlled environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: There are many travel destinations across the globe. What confuses a person most is which travel destination to choose. When choosing a destination for a vacation or a trip, you need to decide what that destination has to offer to you. Meanwhile, you should also take many factors into consideration, so that the decision-making will get easy. The amount of money you want to spend is an important factor and plays an important role in deciding a destination. For example, cities like London, New York, Vegas etc are expensive. On the other hand when you travel to Asia, the cost is generally lower and you don't need to spend much on traveling, lodging or shopping. Therefore, it is important to estimate your budget before selecting a destination. When you plan your vacation, another important thing to plan is the number of the days you want to spend. There are many travel destinations in the world that can be covered in a week's time. Some destinations like Africa, or Maldives beaches can be planned in a week's time. Some other destinations like New York, Thailand may require more than a few weeks to enjoy completely. Vacations are also planned according to the company you have. For example, if you travel with your family, then you'll need a place where you can enjoy with your family members. Similarly, if you are going with friends, a city full of amusement parks, museums, shopping centers will be an ideal destination.

A new study of more than 260,000 people has found a link between sweetened soft-drinks and depression, and diet sodas may be making matters worse. Americans drink far more sodas than people in other countries-- as much as 170 liters per person per year. But the impact of this study isn't limited to the United States. \\"Sweetened drinks, coffee and tea are commonly consumed worldwide and have important physical consequences.

Researchers followed their consumption of drinks like soda, tea coffee, and other soft drinks from 1995 to 1996 and then. 10 years later, asked them if they had been diagnosed with depression since the year 2000. More than 11,3000 of them had. Participants who drank more than four servings of sodas per day were 30 percent more likely to develop depression than participants who did not drink sodas at all.

Freedom from Want was published with an essay by Carlos Bulosan as part of the Four Freedoms series. Bulosan's essay spoke on behalf of those enduring domestic socioeconomic hardships rather than sociopolitical hardships abroad, and it thrust him into prominence. As he neared his thirtieth birthday, the Philippine immigrant and labor organizer Bulosan was experiencing a life that was not consistent with the theme Rockwell depicted in his version of Freedom From Want. Unknown as a writer, he was subsisting as a migrant laborer working intermittent jobs. Post editors tracked down the impoverished immigrant to request an essay contribution. Bulosan rose to prominence during World War II when the Commonwealth of the Philippines, a United States territory, was occupied by Japan. To many Americans, Bulosan's essay marked his introduction, and his name was thereafter well recognized. The essay was lost by The Post, and Bulosan, who had no carbon copy, had to track down the only draft of the essay at a bar in Tacoma.Freedom From Want had previously been less entwined in the standard liberalism philosophies of the western world than the other three freedoms (speech, fear, and religion); this freedom added economic liberty as a societal aspiration. In his essay, Bulosan treats negative liberties as positive liberties by suggesting that Americans be \\"given equal opportunity to serve themselves and each other according to their needs and abilities\\", an echo of Karl Marx's \\"from each according to his abilities, to each according to his needs\\". In the final paragraph of the essay, the phrase \\"The America we hope to see is not merely a physical but also a spiritual and intellectual world\\" describes an egalitarian America. In a voice likened to Steinbeck's in works such as The Grapes of Wrath, Bulosan's essay spoke up for those who struggled to survive in the capitalist democracy and was regarded as \\"haunting and sharp\\" against the backdrop of Rockwell's feast of plenty.

However, some scholars have referred to the Vinaya Pitaka and the first four Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka as the common core of all Buddhist traditions.[page needed] This could be considered misleading, as Mahāyāna considers these merely a preliminary, and not a core, teaching. The Tibetan Buddhists have not even translated most of the āgamas (though theoretically they recognize them) and they play no part in the religious life of either clergy or laity in China and Japan. Other scholars say there is no universally accepted common core.

Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to...","completion":"Bedřich"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Your job is to pick the two options that seamlessly connect with the rest of the story and their positions in the sentence order of the story; note that the selected choices may fit into the story at any point. Your answer must be in the form of '2a, 5b', where '2a' means the candidate sentence 'a' will be inserted as the 2nd sentence in the story. The answer must also be in the order of the selected choices, i.e., '2a, 5b' is allowed, and '5b, 2a' is not allowed. If options are equally plausible, pick the ones that make more sense.

Title: I went to my company's elevator. 1. I need to get to the second floor. 2. I then realize I was already on the second floor. 3a. I push the second floor button. 4b. The button didn't light up. Reasoning: The option c \\"It got him out of a lot of trouble\\" does not fit the context of this story. The story is about going to the elevator and needing to get to the second floor.

Does break mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"break\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In English, the word \\"break\\" can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In these sentences, \\"break\\" is used as a verb, but its meaning varies. In the first sentence, \\"I had to break a 100 bill just to buy the candy,\\" the word \\"break\\" refers to the act of changing a larger-denomination banknote (in this case, a 100 bill) into smaller units of currency (such as ten 10 bills or twenty 5 bills). This is usually done so that one can spend the money more easily for smaller purchases, like buying candy. In this context, \\"break\\" is used in the sense of exchanging or dividing money, and it carries a neutral connotation. In the second sentence, \\"Someone broke in while I was on vacation,\\" the word \\"break\\" is part of the phrasal verb \\"break in.\\" The phrase \\"break in\\" means to forcibly enter a place, usually for the purpose of committing a crime, such as burglary or vandalism. Here, \\"break\\" is associated with the act of gaining unauthorized entry, often by damaging or bypassing locks, doors, or windows. In this context, \\"break\\" carries a negative connotation, as it is linked with criminal activities and illicit behavior. In conclusion, the verb \\"break\\" demonstrates semantic versatility, as its meaning changes based on context and the words it is associated with. While the two sentences both use \\"break\\" as a verb, the meanings are distinct: the first sentence pertains to the exchange of money, and the second sentence concerns illegal entry into a property."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Exported to Australia he was an outstanding sire, being the leading sire for five seasons, the leading sire of two-year-olds seven times as well as heading the broodmare sires' list three times. - Sweet Embrace was a notable Australian thoroughbred racehorse . She was a chestnut daughter of Todman from the Port Vista mare Miss Port . She was owned by Jack and Bob Ingham . She is best remembered for winning the 1967 STC Golden Slipper Stakes as a maiden at long odds of 40/1 . The Sweet Embrace Stakes run annually at Randwick Racecourse is named in her honour . - or \\"cultivars\\" of an animal species, achieved through the process of selective breeding. When the lineage of a purebred animal is recorded, that animal is said to be \\"pedigreed\\". - The Australian Racing Hall of Fame is part of the Australian Racing Museum which documents and honours the horseracing legends of Australia. The museum officially opened in 1981 and created the Hall of Fame in 2000. - The Thoroughbred is a horse breed best known for its use in horse racing. Although the word \\"thoroughbred\\" is sometimes used to refer to any breed of purebred horse, it technically refers only to the Thoroughbred breed. Thoroughbreds are considered \\"hot-blooded\\" horses that are known for their agility, speed and spirit. - Todman (7 October 1954-1976) was one of the greatest Australian Thoroughbred racehorses and an important sire. He was perhaps best known as the winner of the inaugural STC Golden Slipper in 1957, being the first of Star Kingdoms five successive winners of the race. He was inducted into the Australian Racing Hall of Fame in 2005. - A breed is a specific group of domestic animals having homogeneous appearance (phenotype), homogeneous behavior, and/or other characteristics that distinguish it from other organisms of the same species. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Zoran Milanovic, the candidate with the youngest age and shortest time party candidacy, has become the new general director of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), the main opposition in Croatia. This sentence tells us about a person named Zoran Milanovic who has attained a significant position in Croatian politics. He is characterized as the youngest and having the shortest party candidacy, suggesting that he has achieved this position at a relatively early stage in his career. Moreover, his ascent to this position is even more notable because the SDP is the main opposition party in Croatia, implicating an active and perhaps challenging role in the national politics. Furthermore, becoming the general director of a major political party such as the SDP is a significant achievement. The position would require a broad knowledge of political affairs, strong leadership skills, diplomacy, and strategic decision-making abilities. Given the party's status as the main opposition, Milanovic's role would be pivotal in challenging government policies and providing alternative solutions for the betterment of the country. His role may involve uniting the party members towards a common goal, overseeing the party's operations, drawing up crucial strategies, and leading national and international negotiations. His young age and quick rise to such a high-profile role may symbolize a new generation of political leadership representing youth interests or indicate a fresh perspective in political strategies and operations.
