Write a text based on \\"kohl and challenger see gizmos but not each other at german\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Kohl and Challenger Encounter Gizmos at German Event, but Miss Each Other In a remarkable turn of events, political figures Helmut Kohl and a prominent challenger found themselves sharing the same space at a German event, surrounded by innovative gadgets and gizmos. However, to the surprise of onlookers, the two influential individuals never crossed paths or acknowledged each other's presence. The event, which showcased cutting-edge technology and creative devices, drew a massive crowd of enthusiasts and professionals eager to discuss the future of German innovation. Among these attendees were Kohl, a notable political leader, and his challenger, a respected figure in the competing political camp. Step 1: Identify Key Points The key points to consider in this text include: the presence of Kohl and his challenger at the same German event, the focus on innovative gadgets and gizmos, and the fact that the two political figures did not interact. Step 2: Focus on Elaboration and Description To give the readers a better understanding, the text should provide more details about the event, such as its name, purpose, and the types of gadgets and technologies on display. Additionally, it should emphasize the significance of these two renowned political figures attending the same event. Step 3: Discuss the Lack of Interaction The text must explore the potential implications of Kohl and his challenger not meeting or acknowledging each other at the event. This could involve discussing their past interactions, political context, and the potential consequences of their decision to remain aloof. As the bustling event unfolded with technological enthusiasts demonstrating their latest inventions, Kohl and his adversary, both influential personalities in the political arena, navigated through the crowd independently, apparently oblivious to each other's presence. Attendees and onlookers eagerly anticipated a possible encounter between the two, curious to see if tensions would arise or if they'd share a rare moment of camaraderie. However, the much-anticipated interaction never came to fruition as the two leaders moved in different directions, ultimately leaving those present with a lingering sense of what might have been. While it remains unclear if this lack of encounter was intentional or by chance, the absence of a public exchange between the two rivals speaks volumes about the current state of political discourse. In the age of advancing technology and growing possibilities, the silent near-encounter of Kohl and his challenger highlights the gulf that continues to widen between political camps. As German innovators present their latest \\"gizmos\\" with hopes of a brighter future, the unresolved personal and political tensions between these two formidable figures remain a sobering reminder of what challenges lie ahead in the real world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If you're a parent who spends long hours on the job, you probably feel sorry for spending so much time away from your kids. But the results of a new study show that a mother's voice alone can be just as comforting to an anxious child as physical contact . In an experiment, researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison asked a group of girls between the age of 7 and 12 to solve math problems in front of judges --- a stressful situation for anyone. Before the girls were set to solve math problems, the researchers measured their levels of two hormones : cortisol, which goes up during stressful periods, and oxytocin, the \\"love\\" hormone. After they were finished, some of the girls got to meet up with their mothers right away. The mums came in and hugged the girls. Another group of the girls didn't see their mothers, but received phone calls from them, in which their mothers told them how well they'd done. The final group had no contact with their mothers, but watched an animal movie, March of the Penguins instead. Finally, the girls' hormone levels were measured again. Although the movie was interesting, it did nothing to ease the children's anxiety ---- but, surprisingly, both the physical contact and phone calls from their mothers had the same effect on easing the girls' stress levels. So, no matter how old you are, if you're feeling stressed about something in your life, a phone call to Mom might be just the key to help you feel better.

Goal: The question is seeking to understand the influential development (technology, event, or strategy) that led to the emergence of the first large fleet ships. Provided Answer: As a result of the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922, which limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships, most early aircraft carriers were conversions of ships that were laid down (or had served) as different ship types: cargo ships, cruisers, battlecruisers, or battleships. Considerations: 1. The provided answer talks about the Washington Naval Treaty and how it limited the construction of new heavy surface combat ships. 2.

The film tells the story of a Roman military commander, Marcus Vinicius (Robert Taylor), who is also the legate of the XIV Gemina, returning from the wars, who falls in love with a devout Christian, Lygia (Deborah Kerr), and slowly becomes intrigued by her religion. Their love story is told against the broader historical background of early Christianity and its persecution by Nero (Peter Ustinov). Though she grew up Roman as the adopted daughter of a retired general, Aulus Plautius (Felix Aylmer), Lygia is technically a hostage of Rome. Marcus persuades Nero to give her to him for services rendered. Lygia resents this, but still falls in love with Marcus. Meanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly more outrageous and his acts more insane. When he burns Rome and blames the Christians, Marcus goes off to save Lygia and her family. Nero captures them and all the Christians, and condemns them to be killed in the arena.

Sinbad has fallen in love with her, and their coming marriage is meant to secure peace between her father's realm and Sinbad's homeland of Persia.Sinbad and his men confront the Roc.After reaching Bagdad, the wedding is prepared, and Parisa's father (Harold Kasket) arrives as the guest of honor. Sokurah performs his magic at the pre-wedding festivities, but despite his prowess the Caliph of Bagdad (Alec Mango) refuses to grant the magician his return to Colossa. Later that night, Sokurah secretly reduces the princess to diminutive size, enraging her father who then declares war on Bagdad. Sinbad and the Caliph give in to Sokurah, who explains that the eggshell of a Roc needed for the potion to release Parisah from her spell can be found only on Colossa. Sokurah provides Sinbad and his crew with the construction plans for a giant crossbow, if needed, to be used against the island's giant creatures.Sinbad recruits additional sailors for the voyage from among the convicts in the Caliph's prisons. Before they reach Colossa, the cutthroats mutiny and capture Sokurah, Sinbad, and his men. During a violent storm, the sounds of keening demons from an island south of Colossa drives the crew nearly mad, endangering the ship. After the mutineers' leader falls to his death from the Crow's nest, one of them releases Sinbad so he can save the ship.On Colossa, Sinbad, Sokurah, and some of the crew enter the Valley of the Cyclops, where they find the creature's treasure cave. Sinbad and his men are captured after Sokurah regains the magic lamp, but he is also trapped by the Cyclops. With Parisah's aid, Sinbad escapes, blinds the one-eyed creature, and lures it off the edge of a cliff to its death. Sinbad retains custody of the lamp until Parisah is turned back to normal.Sokurah leads Sinbad and his starving men to the nesting place of the giant Rocs, finding an intact egg close to hatching. Sinbad's men crack it open and kill the Roc nestling inside, roasting it. While the men are eating, Parisah enters the magic lamp and befriends the childlike Genie of the lamp, Barani (Richard Eyer), who tells her how to summon him in exchange for her promise for his freedom. The parent Roc returns and slays several of the men. Sinbad manages to retrieve both an eggshell fragment and the lamp, but he is grabbed up by the Roc, who later drops him unconscious in its nest. The magician kills Sinbad's aide Harufa (Alfred Brown) and abducts the princess, taking her to his underground fortress.Sinbad awakes and rubs the magic lamp, summoning Barani, who takes Sinbad to Sokurah's fortress. Barani helps him evade the chained dragon that stands guard. Sinbad reaches Sokurah, who restores the princess to normal. When Sinbad refuses to hand over the lamp, the magician animates a skeleton warrior, which Sinbad battles and destroys. He and Parisah make their way out of the cave, stopping to honor their promise to destroy the lamp, setting Barini free.Leaving the cave, they encounter another cyclops. Sinbad releases the dragon, who fights the cyclops to the death. Sinbad and Parisa make good their escape, and Sokurah orders the dragon to follow and kill them. Sinbad's men, having assembled and armed the giant crossbow, manage to kill the dragon with a giant arrow. As it dies, Sokurah is crushed beneath the collapsing creature. Sinbad, Parisa, and the remaining crew depart for Bagdad to stop the war. They are joined by Barani, now human and Sinbad's new cabin boy, who, before his transformation, magically placed the treasure of the Cyclops in Sinbad's cabin as a wedding gift., Question: Who regains the magic lamp?

Explanation: Applying a cool substance on the forehead can create a soothing effect that may temporarily help alleviate fever discomfort. The forehead is home to the temporal artery, which is close to the skin surface and responsible for measuring one's temperature with infrared thermometers. By cooling the forehead, it may provide temporary relief from a fever. Option A is not an ideal method because the neck is not as effective for providing the cooling sensation that can help with fever relief.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, Roger Spottiswoode and Holger-Madsen were both involved in the same profession, which is the film industry. However, it's essential to note the differences in their careers, their contributions to the world of cinema, and the time periods in which they worked. Roger Spottiswoode is a British-Canadian film director, editor, and screenwriter, born in 1945. He started his career in the film industry as an editor, working on several well-known films, including \\"Straw Dogs\\" (1971) and \\"Hard Times\\" (1975) before transitioning into directing. As a director, Spottiswoode has helmed numerous critically acclaimed and commercially successful films throughout his career. Some of his notable works include \\"Under Fire\\" (1983), \\"A Street Cat Named Bob\\" (2016), and the 18th installment of the James Bond film series, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (1997). Though primarily focused on directing, Spottiswoode has also contributed to the screenplays of various films he directed, showcasing his aptitude in various aspects of filmmaking. Holger-Madsen, on the other hand, was a Danish film actor and director, born in 1878 and passed away in 1943. With a career that spanned the early 20th century, Madsen primarily worked in the silent film era, which can be seen as a significant distinction between him and Spottiswoode. He started his career as an actor in 1910, later transitioning into writing and directing. As a director, Madsen was known for creating several Danish, Swedish, and German films, including \\"Towards the Light\\" (1919), \\"The Golden Smile\\" (1921), and \\"The Wild Duck\\" (1921). Unlike Spottiswoode, who began his career in Hollywood, Madsen was more affiliated with the European film industry, particularly during a time when it was still in its nascent stage. In summary, although both Roger Spottiswoode and Holger-Madsen were involved in the film industry, their careers and areas of specialization differed significantly. While Spottiswoode's work spans from the late 20th to the 21st century and includes film editing, directing, and screenwriting, Holger-Madsen was part of the silent film era in the early 20th century, working primarily as an actor and director. Both figures, however, have left enduring imprints on the world of cinema, showcasing the vast scope and evolution of the film industry over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the keywords or phrases that convey sentiment: - \\"terrific performances\\" - \\"willingness to wander\\" - \\"dark areas\\" - \\"without flinching\\" 2. Analyze each keyword or phrase: - \\"terrific performances\\" has a positive connotation since 'terrific' is an adjective with a positive meaning. - \\"willingness to wander\\" has a neutral slant since it describes a trait or action and doesn't inherently convey an emotion. - \\"dark areas\\" generally have a negative connotation, as 'dark' is often used to describe something negative or unpleasant. - \\"without flinching\\" is a phrase indicating resilience, which carries a slightly positive connotation. 3. Consider the context in which the keywords or phrases are used: - The sentence as a whole seems to praise Fontaine's ability to depict parent-child relationships without shying away from the darker aspects. 4. Weigh the positive and negative elements: - There are two positive elements (terrific performances, without flinching) and one negative element (dark areas), with the remaining one being neutral (willingness to wander). 5.

Context: The filming was kind of a long process, but maybe it didn’t need to be? Or maybe it did? The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...

Thus, the phrase \\"Huckabee, we don't do that in our culture\\" would fit perfectly. In this ending, Jon Stewart turns Huckabee's criticism back onto him. Stewart, with characteristic irony, might retort, \\"Huckabee, we don't do that in our culture,\\" suggesting that it's not Beyoncé or Jay-Z that's crossing lines—it's Huckabee. Stewart argues that Huckabee is the one straying from societal norms by publicly criticizing individuals for their personal or professional choices and suggesting what the Obamas should allow their daughters to consume. Stewart could point out that it's not within Huckabee's jurisdiction to judge or dictate what others, including Beyoncé, the Obamas, or the general public, should or shouldn't consume, whether that's music, literature, or other forms of media. He might argue that it's an individual's personal right and freedom to choose without judgement or pressure from political figures taking moral high ground. Here, Stewart might analyze Huckabee's behavior as a form of cultural imposition—one culture or individual imposing their beliefs, values, and norms on others. This is what Huckabee seems to be doing in his book, demarcating cultural lines based on his personal perspectives and suggesting that those who cross these boundaries, such as Beyoncé with her \\"explicit\\" style, are morally wrong or inappropriate. Stewart might go further, arguing that such explicit criticism and public judgement do not belong in the modern societal culture that highly values personal freedom, diversity, and artistic expression. Thus, the phrase \\"Huckabee, we don't do that in our culture,\\" serves as a rallying call against Huckabee's judgemental perspective, turning his own criticism against him, and asserting a broader, more inclusive cultural norm. In this approach, the ending isn't just about a direct response to Huckabee's comments. Stewart uses the platform of the \\"Daily Show\\" to point out a broader social issue—the ongoing battle over cultural norms and freedom of expression. It's a statement that questions the right of any one individual or group to define what is acceptable or 'normal' in our diverse and evolving society. It's a promote reflection on the part of viewers, inviting them to consider where they stand in this wider cultural discourse."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Moving on to the review of the Pugster charms, the reviewer says that the quality is \\"really really good\\" and that the detail is \\"amazing.\\" These statements show that the reviewer is quite impressed with the Pugster charms' quality and design, giving a positive impression. However, they also mention that the cheaper charms purchased from the mall fell apart within 10 minutes of adding them to the bracelet, rendering them a waste of money. This part of the review is certainly negative but targeted at the mall charms, not the Pugster charms. In conclusion, the product review is generally positive towards the Pugster charms, expressing satisfaction with their quality and design. The reviewer does share a negative experience with other charms purchased from a mall, but this aspect does not tarnish their overall positive impression of the Pugster charms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, the chances of buying the product would most likely decrease. The reviewer clearly expresses their dissatisfaction and disappointment with the DVD's content, which does not align with what they were expecting. Here's a detailed breakdown of the factors that contribute to the overall decrease in the chances of purchasing the product: 1. Misleading content: The review states that the buyer was expecting to see Pink Floyd discussing their albums, but instead, the band only appears for about two minutes. This indicates that the DVD's description may have been misleading or not accurately representing the content, which would be a red flag for potential buyers. 2. Excessive focus on critics and other bands: The reviewer mentions that 45 minutes of the 47-minute DVD are dedicated to critics discussing Pink Floyd's albums and featuring another band named \\"Mostly Autumn.\\" This could be seen as irrelevant or uninteresting content for potential buyers who are primarily interested in Pink Floyd themselves. 3. Lack of value for seasoned Pink Floyd fans: The reviewer suggests that the DVD is only helpful for new fans to discover Pink Floyd's discography, whereas long-time fans would derive no real value from it and are better off saving their money for another product, like the PULSE DVD. 4. Potential waste of money: The reviewer outright states that the DVD is not worth the investment and urges readers to avoid wasting their money on it. This indicates that the product is not thought to be of high quality or worth the expense. Taking all of these factors into consideration, the review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product. The dissatisfaction expressed by the reviewer, along with the criticisms of the content, make the product seem less appealing and not worth the potential buyer's investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: What term is often used to describe a 6-0 scoreline in a set of a Tennis match?","completion":"The term often used to describe a 6-0 scoreline in a set of a tennis match is a \\"bagel.\\" The term is derived from the shape of the zero in the score, which resembles a bagel, a round bread made of dough shaped into a ring and boiled and then baked to achieve a chewy texture. A bagel in tennis represents a dominating performance by one player over their opponent, where the player who scored 6 points didn't allow the opponent to score any games in the set. This scoreline showcases a significant gap in skill or form between the two players during that particular set, with the winning player demonstrating exceptional ability and often demoralizing their opponent in the process. It is worth noting that the term is primarily used in professional tennis, though it is also sometimes used in recreational play among knowledgeable fans and players. Although the term \\"bagel\\" might seem informal or humorous, it is widely recognized and accepted within the tennis community, both by players and in the media. Tennis commentators and journalists often use the term to describe a 6-0 scoreline in articles, analysis, and even during live broadcasts. In addition to the term \\"bagel,\\" there are some other tennis terms related to one-sided scorelines. For example, a \\"breadstick\\" is a term used to describe a 6-1 scoreline in a set, referring to the long, slim shape of the bread that resembles the number 1. A \\"golden set\\" refers to a rare achievement in which a player wins every single point in a set, leading to a 6-0 scoreline without dropping a point to their opponent, but this term is not commonly used to describe a simple 6-0 scoreline. It is important to understand that a bagel in a tennis match is not an indication of the overall outcome of the match since tennis matches, in most cases, are decided by a best-of-three or best-of-five sets format. A player who loses a set by a bagel can still come back to win the match with improved performance in subsequent sets. As a result, the term \\"bagel\\" only describes the scoreline of a single set and not the collective result of the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Which verses of the ballad about the Wabash River talk about missing a loved one?, using the article: The ballad speaks of the Wabash River, which flows through Indiana, and reminisces about events that occurred there. The song has two verses and a chorus. The first verse is about the narrator's childhood on a farm and his love for his mother. The second verse is about his lost love, Mary. While the subjects of the verses are connected, the narrative of the chorus is detached from the verses as it seemingly reminisces nostalgically.Without speaking directly of death, both verses indicate the absence of a loved one, and the narrator's sadness and inability to cope with the grief. In the second verse, the narrator cannot bring himself to come near to his lost love's grave. The effort to avoid the subject of death and the focus on fond memories is typical of songs and societal sensibilities at the time.The melody of the song is a memorable tune made easy to learn because of its combination of harmonic repetition and contrast—elements that make music easy to remember while avoiding monotony. The recurrence and dissimilarity within the melody is similar to the patterns in many popular folk songs. Dresser, however, avoided the common 19th-century practice of using a portion of the refrain's melody in the verse. With little formal training in music theory, it is unlikely that Dresser purposefully made any methodical calculations when he composed the melody.Written for piano, guitar, and mandolin, the music begins in the key of G major with an Andante Moderato tempo. The verses follow a chord progression of G–C–G. The chorus transitions to B minor, and progresses as B–E–E, before returning to G–C–G in its final bars. Although the melody of the chorus is unique within the piece, it is in harmonic unity with the verses. An upbeat version played at a Andantino tempo was also adapted for play by small orchestras and big bands., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question would be: The second verse of the ballad about the Wabash River talks about missing a loved one, specifically the narrator's lost love, Mary."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My point, of course, is not to suggest that reality-show contestants can’t have worthwhile views on matters of international affairs. Rather, what’s striking here is the Republican Party – which once considered credibility on foreign matter a matter of GOP birthright – is taking on a former Secretary of State in this presidential election, and the party lacks the kind of credible, experienced, high-profile professionals who can assess Clinton’s record on foreign policy in a serious way. To be sure, such figures exist in the party – there are several living former Secretaries of State from Republican administrations, for example – but they generally want nothing to do with promoting Trump’s candidacy, and they’re keeping political activities this year at arm’s length.

Combine like terms (the terms that have the same variable, in this case, m). -60*m + 63*m = (63 - 60)*m = 3*m. So, the equation now becomes: 3*m + 9 = 0. 2. As we want to find the value of m, we need to isolate m. We'll first move the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 9 from both sides: 3*m + 9 - 9 = 0 - 9 This simplifies to: 3*m = -9 3. Now, we have the term 3*m on the left side of the equation. To isolate m, we need to divide both sides by 3: (3*m)/3 = -9/3 This will cancel out the 3 on the left side, leaving just m: m = -3 Now, we have the value of m.

Other stars are much farther away, with the closest star system, Alpha Centauri, located about 4.37 light-years away. Star brightness can vary greatly based on their size, temperature, age, and distance. Some stars are intrinsically brighter or dimmer than the sun.

Adjust your breathing and hold your breath when necessary. Extend your body horizontally under the wave. Wear surfing goggles. Practice diving under small or flat waves. Dive under supervision. Article:","completion":"Title: Conquering the Waves: Master the Art of Diving Under Large Swells Introduction Surf's up, and there's no better feeling than hitting the waves and feeling the adrenaline surge through your body as you ride those big swells. However, while riding over colossal waves can be exhilarating, there's an essential skill every surfer must learn to stay safe in the water: diving under large waves. Diving under big waves can be challenging and intimidating for beginner surfers. Still, with some essential tips and continuous practice, you'll master this lifesaving skill and be on your way to confidently enjoying the ocean. In this article, we will discuss some crucial techniques to help you improve your surfing experience and safety. 1. Dive Early to Get Under Large Waves Timing is everything; you need to assess the wave quickly and make a decision to dive under it. When facing an impending large swell, start paddling towards it and dive early in the process. This technique will allow you to have enough time to get deep enough under the wave without being dragged back or slammed by the crashing wave. Learning to read the waves is a crucial skill, and it will significantly improve as you continue to practice and spend time in the water. 2. Adjust Your Breathing and Hold Your Breath When Necessary Breath control is essential when diving under waves. You'll want to master the art of quickly adjusting your breathing to the circumstances. Before diving under, take a deep breath, filling your lungs to their full capacity. This way, you'll have plenty of oxygen to help you through until you resurface. Remember to exhale slowly upon resurfacing to avoid hyperventilation or shallow breathing. 3. Extend Your Body Horizontally Under the Wave As you approach the wave, aim to extend your body horizontally while diving under it. This position will help you effectively cut through the water and ensure you pass under the wave with minimal resistance. Maintaining a streamlined and flat body position helps in reducing the drag, allowing you to dive smoothly and comfortably. 4. Wear Surfing Goggles Chances are, you'll have your eyes open underwater to navigate your way under those massive waves. To make your vision more precise and protect your eyes from saltwater irritation, consider wearing surfing goggles. These specially-designed goggles will help you see clearly underwater and prevent the possibility of losing contact lenses or experiencing painful eye stings. 5. Practice Diving Under Small or Flat Waves Before diving headfirst into large waves, hone your diving skills under smaller, flatter waves. Practicing under these calmer conditions allows you to get the correct body positioning, breath control, and timing without the added stress and anxiety of a big wave approaching. Gradually increase the size of waves you dive under as you gain confidence and improve your skill. 6. Dive Under Supervision As a beginner, it is always helpful to have a knowledgeable and experienced surfer nearby to provide guidance and support when learning to dive under waves. Taking surf lessons or joining a surf camp can offer helpful supervision and advice, ensuring that you are practicing the techniques correctly and safely. Additionally, they can offer real-time feedback to help you make adjustments and boost your overall performance. Conclusion Diving under large waves is an essential skill that every surfer must-have. It not only ensures that you can safely navigate the ocean but also significantly improves your surfing experience. By following these tips and consistently practicing, you'll overcome the fear and uncertainty that comes with diving under large swells. So go ahead, paddle out, dive under those menacing waves, and let the ocean reward you with an exhilarating ride."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When he was two years old, his family moved to Hong Kong and then to Boston when he was 11. His younger sister, Chris Yen, is also a martial artist and actress, and appeared in the 2007 film Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon. Donnie Yen was considered as one of the premiere action choreographers in the world, having been invited by Hollywood to choreograph blockbusters such as Blade II, Highlander: Endgame, and Shanghai Knights. In Asia, he is the action choreographer for most of his movies and has won multiple awards for his action choreography. Yen's most famous works include films such as Flash Point and SPL: Sha Po Lang. He has mentioned that the main differences in filmmaking in Asia and Hollywood are with regards to freedom and control. In Asia, the action choreographer takes over the scene during the fight scene. This means that for action scenes filmed in Asia, the choreographer becomes the director and is in full control over camera placements, camera angles, and the relationship between the drama and the action; therefore the main director is not needed at all. While in Hollywood, on the other hand, Yen explains that the action choreographer simply choreographs the actions with the director, who still maintains full control of such settings and camera angles. Yen's work as a choreographer won him \\"Best Action Choreography\\" awards at the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards and the 2008 and 2011 Golden Horse Film Awards. Yen was the fight choreographer for the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen. For this film, Yen mentioned that he included Jeet Kune Do elements as a tribute to Bruce Lee, who played Chen Zhen in the 1972 film Fist of Fury. Furthermore, he incorporated many MMA elements in the film, coupled with the utilisation of Wing Chun. Yen also stated that the concept behind Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do is similar to that of MMA, hence the incorporation of many forms of martial arts was a necessity in the film. He won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography 4 times, being one of the most frequent winners of this coveted award. He has won awards for his choreography in films such as The Twins Effect, SPL: Sha Po Lang, Flash Point, and Kung Fu Jungle.

It was Friday, 5:30 PM--thirty minutes before the grand opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. The arcade room had been arranged nicely--although not the way Billy-Eye would have done it. But still, it was good. The two popcorn machines were ready to go. High school aged workers were ready to hand out bags of the stuff. The first group in the competition was warming up on the bandstand. A stand-alone blackboard to the right side of the drums had the name of the band written across it in white chalk: The Triangulators. Each band would be responsible for putting their name on that board. \\"Glad you like it, Daddy.\\" Craig beamed. Finally, he had done something right. \\"So, what do you think?

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to learn about portion size Determine your dietary goals and recommended daily caloric intake. Your portion needs will depend on age, sex, activity level, and weight goals. Online interactive dietary planners and calorie calculators can help more closely estimate your necessary daily calorie intake and precise portion sizes.","completion":"Once you have a clear understanding of your daily caloric needs, you can start to break down what a portion size looks like for different food categories such as carbohydrates, proteins, dairy, and fats, keeping in mind that it's not just about quantity, but quality. Healthier food choices, such as whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, should make up the majority of your servings because they are lower in calories and rich in essential nutrients. In this context, understanding your portion sizes comes with familiarizing yourself with measuring tools and common household items. Measuring cups, spoons, and food scales can offer a more accurate representation of serving sizes, especially when you are just starting with portion control. Over time, it can become easier to eyeball these measurements. As a visual cue, for instance, a single serving of lean protein should be about the size of a deck of cards, while half a cup of cooked rice, pasta, or other carbohydrate-rich foods should be about the size of a small fist. Instead of going for seconds, consider filling half your plate with vegetables, a quarter with lean protein, and another quarter with healthy carbs. This balance approach will help ensure you are getting the nutrients you need and maintaining the right portion sizes for a balanced meal. Indeed, proper plate mapping can direct the eye and the stomach to accept smaller portions, while the variety and balance satisfy our nutritional and culinary needs. Meal planning and pre-portioning food, especially for meals and snacks that you often consume, make it easier to avoid overeating. For instance, instead of eating snacks like nuts or chips straight from the bag, pre-portion them into individual servings so that you can avoid mindless eating. Using smaller plates, bowls, and cups can also help control portion sizes. Finally, keep a food diary to track what and how much you're eating. Monitoring your intake can provide in-depth insight into your eating patterns and can be a useful tool for identifying areas of improvement. Over time, you will start to get a sense of how well you manage portion control and be able to adjust the quantities to better achieve your nutritional and weight goals. Regular exercise also plays a key role in managing calorie intake and portion control, as it not only burns calories but also increases feelings of fullness. Bear in mind that changing eating habits and learning portion control takes time, patience, and practice. Don't discourage yourself if you initially struggle with portion sizes, it's a learning process. Implementing these strategies consistently will help you better understand portion sizes and, hopefully, lead you to create healthier eating habits that can last a lifetime. Remember, achieving better health isn't just about restricting portion sizes but making informed food choices, eating mindfully, and appreciating each bite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Amyntas III was forced to flee his kingdom in either 393 or 383 BC (based on conflicting accounts), owing to a massive invasion by the Illyrian Dardani led by Bardylis. The pretender to the throne Argaeus ruled in his absence, yet Amyntas III eventually returned to his kingdom with the aid of Thessalian allies. Amyntas III was also nearly overthrown by the forces of the Chalcidian city of Olynthos, but with the aid of Teleutias, brother of the Spartan king Agesilaus II, the Macedonians forced Olynthos to surrender and dissolve their Chalcidian League in 379 BC.Alexander II (r. 370 – 368 BC), son of Eurydice I and Amyntas III, succeeded his father and immediately invaded Thessaly to wage war against the tagus (supreme Thessalian military leader) Alexander of Pherae, capturing the city of Larissa. The Thessalians, desiring to remove both Alexander II and Alexander of Pherae as their overlords, appealed to Pelopidas of Thebes for aid; he succeeded in recapturing Larissa and, in the peace agreement arranged with Macedonia, received aristocratic hostages including Alexander II's brother and future king Philip II (r. 359–336 BC– ). When Alexander was assassinated by his brother-in-law Ptolemy of Aloros, the latter acted as an overbearing regent for Perdiccas III (r. 368 – 359 BC), younger brother of Alexander II, who eventually had Ptolemy executed when reaching the age of majority in 365 BC. The remainder of Perdiccas III's reign was marked by political stability and financial recovery.

Q:Question: \\"To whom are cases or accusations deferred when no additional evidence is admissible to the elders?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses have been accused of having policies and culture that help to conceal cases of sexual abuse within the organization. The religion has been criticized for its \\"two witness rule\\" for church discipline, based on its application of scriptures at Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17, which requires sexual abuse to be substantiated by secondary evidence if the accused person denies any wrongdoing. In cases where corroboration is lacking, the Watch Tower Society's instruction is that \\"the elders will leave the matter in Jehovah's hands\\". A former member of the church’s headquarters staff, Barbara Anderson, says the policy effectively requires that there be another witness to an act of molestation, \\"which is an impossibility\\". Anderson says the policies \\"protect pedophiles rather than protect the children.\\" Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have a strong policy to protect children, adding that the best way to protect children is by educating parents; they also state that they do not sponsor activities that separate children from parents.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"In the Jehovah's Witnesses organization, when cases or accusations cannot be further substantiated due to lack of additional admissible evidence, they are deferred to Jehovah, meaning they leave the matter in God's hands.

The \\"two witness rule\\" is based on the application of scriptures from Deuteronomy 19:15 and Matthew 18:15-17. Critics, including former members like Barbara Anderson, argue that this policy often ends up protecting the accused abusers rather than the victims, as it is highly unlikely to have another witness in cases of molestation. They assert that the policy inadvertently contributes to concealing cases of sexual abuse within the organization. Jehovah's Witnesses maintain that they have strong policies in place to protect children, emphasizing the importance of educating parents and not sponsoring activities that separate children from their parents.

Pick your answer from: [-] no. [-] yes.","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is focused on understanding the strength of sigma bonds compared to pi bonds, while the second question is about the general concept of pi bonds. - In response to the first question, \\"Why is the sigma bond strong compared to the pi bond?\\": Sigma bonds are stronger than pi bonds because they involve end-to-end overlap of bonding orbitals, whereas pi bonds involve side-by-side overlap. In a sigma bond, the electron density is concentrated between the two bonding atoms, resulting in a strong covalent bond. Since the shared electron pair occupies the region directly between the bonded atoms, this interaction creates a strong, stable bond. Pi bonds, on the other hand, result from the side-by-side overlapping of p orbitals that are parallel to the bond axis. This leads to electron density being distributed above and below the bond axis, creating a region of electron sharing known as a pi bond. As a result, the electron density is spread out and not directly between the two nuclei, which makes the pi bond weaker compared to a sigma bond. Furthermore, sigma bonds allow for free rotation around the bond axis, while pi bonds restrict this rotation due to the overlapping p orbitals. This constraint in rotation introduces additional instability to pi bonds, and therefore they tend to be weaker than sigma bonds. - In response to the second question, \\"What are pi bonds?\\": Pi bonds are a type of covalent bond that occur when two adjacent atoms share a pair of electrons in the overlapping of unhybridized parallel p orbitals. They can be found in double or triple bonds, alongside sigma bonds. In double bonds, there is one sigma bond and one pi bond, and in triple bonds, there is one sigma bond and two pi bonds. The electron density in pi bonds is distributed above and below the bond axis, and these bonds are characterized by their side-by-side overlap. In contrast to sigma bonds, pi bonds do not allow for free rotation around the bond axis as the parallel p orbitals must maintain their overlap for the pi bond to exist. Pi bonds are generally weaker than sigma bonds due to the nature of their side-by-side overlap and constraint in rotation. One important application of pi bonds is in the study of organic chemistry, where these interactions play a crucial role in the structure and function of unsaturated hydrocarbons and other organic molecules with double or triple bonds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But here she was, at a crossroads, unsure about accepting an invitation from this seemingly ordinary man. \\"Good, then maybe you won't mind if I join you,\\" Brad repeated, his eyes fixated on her, searching for a response. He appeared genuine, as if he truly wanted her company. Still, she couldn't help but weigh her options: step out of her comfort zone and explore potentially new experiences with Brad, or continue being stuck in the past, yearning for the one who got away. \\"Sure, why not?\\" she replied carefully, cautiously extending an olive branch to a man she barely knew. The corners of his lips curled into a small yet warm smile that, despite its lack of fire, brought a sense of comfort and tranquility to the table. As they spent time together, she soon discovered a sense of serenity in Brad's company. He was kind, attentive, and genuinely cared for her well-being. The more they laughed, the more she realized the spark she yearned for in his eyes was slowly flickering, trying to find a reason to ignite. They discussed their dreams, fears, and ambitions, sharing glimpses into their souls, acknowledging the vulnerabilities that made them human. With each passing day, Brad grew into a presence she couldn't ignore. In his arms, she found solace, and his steady heartbeat became the cadence to which she slept. Gone were the days of wild passion and intense longing that previously swarmed her thoughts; in its place was a quiet embrace, a slow dance of emotion that resonated within her core. But as the days turned into weeks and the bonds between them deepened, the ghost of Jack still haunted her mind. She tried to silence the memories - to smother them in Brad's calming presence - but they refused to be quelled or extinguished. There came an evening, as they danced underneath the twilight sky, when the weight of her past became too heavy to bear; the facade cracked, and a single tear escaped, tracing its somber path down her cheek. Brad noticed the change immediately, concern etching across his kind features. \\"Are you alright?\\" he inquired softly, brushing her tear away with his thumb. His gentleness touched her in a way she hadn't expected, and in that moment, she knew she couldn't keep her secret any longer. \\"Brad,\\" she whispered, \\"there's something I need to tell you.\\" As she divulged her haunted past, her soul ached at the thought of possibly losing the man who had taught her a new way to love. But as she finished, instead of anger or indifference, she was met with understanding and unwavering support. In Brad's eyes, she found not a storm, but the harbor - a place of safety where her emotions could find solace. From that day forward, they embarked on a new journey together - one that wasn't marred by the tempests of the heart but anchored in the steadiness of their love. Though the spark in Brad's eye would never quite dance the way Jack's did, it burned with a quiet intensity that spoke volumes about the depths of his love for her. And so it was that in the end, she chose Brad - not just as a lover or a companion, but as someone who would shelter her from the storms, ignite the fire in her soul, and remind her that attraction can take on many shades, and within its undertones lie the secrets to a quieter, yet equally passionate, love story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Finchley Road, an inner city main road which runs for about , is one of the major thoroughfares of north London, England. - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - The Jubilee line is a London Underground line. Opened in 1979, it is the newest line on the network, although some sections of track date back to 1932 and some stations to 1879. Its western end beyond Baker Street was previously the Stanmore branch of the Bakerloo line, while the new build was completed in two major sections: initially in 1979 to Charing Cross tube station in central London; then extended in 1999 with the Jubilee Line Extension to Stratford station in east London. The later stations are larger and have special safety features, both aspects being attempts to future-proof the line. Following the extension into east London, serving areas once poorly connected to the Underground, the line has seen a huge growth in passenger numbers and is currently the third busiest on the network, with over 213 million passengers per year. The Jubilee line is coloured silver/grey on the Tube map, to mark the Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II after which the line was named. - West Hampstead is an area in the London Borough of Camden in north-west London. Mainly defined by the railway stations of the same name, it is situated between Childs Hill to the north, Frognal and Hampstead to the north-east, Swiss Cottage to the east, South Hampstead to the south-east, Kilburn to the west and south-west, and Cricklewood to the north-west. The area is mainly residential with several small shops, restaurants, cafes, bakeries concentrated on the northern section of West End Lane and around West End Green. It is served by three stations: West Hampstead on the Jubilee line, West Hampstead Overground station and West Hampstead Thameslink station. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly. - Hampstead (or ), commonly known as Hampstead Village, is an area of London, England, northwest of Charing Cross. Part of the London Borough of Camden, it is known for its intellectual, liberal, artistic, musical and literary associations and for Hampstead Heath, a large, hilly expanse of parkland. It has some of the most expensive housing in the London area. The village of Hampstead has more millionaires within its boundaries than any other area of the United Kingdom. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - The Jubilee Line Extension is the extension of the London Underground Jubilee line from to through south and east London. An eastward extension of the line was first proposed in the 1970s and a modified route was constructed during the 1990s. It opened in stages from May to December 1999. - Charing Cross denotes the junction of Strand, Whitehall and Cockspur Street, just south of Trafalgar Square in central London. It gives its name to several landmarks, including Charing Cross railway station, one of the main London rail terminals. - The Tube map is a schematic transport map of the lines, stations and services of London's public transport systems, the primary system being London Underground, known colloquially as \\"the Tube\\", hence the map's name. The first schematic Tube map was designed by Harry Beck in 1931, and it has since been expanded to also include today the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, TfL Rail, Tramlink and the Emirates Air Line cable car. - Rapid transit, also known as heavy rail, metro, subway, tube, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Unlike buses or trams, rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way, which cannot be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort, and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways. - The London Underground (also known simply as the Underground, or by its nickname the Tube) is a public rapid transit system serving Greater London and some parts of the adjacent counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. - The Bakerloo line is a line of the London Underground, coloured brown on the Tube map. It runs partly on the surface and partly at deep level, from Elephant and Castle in Central London, via the West End, to Harrow & Wealdstone in the north-western outer suburbs. The line serves 25 stations, of which 15 are below ground. It was so named because it serves \\"Baker\\" Street and Water\\"loo\\". North of Queen's Park (the section of the line above ground), the line shares tracks with London Overground's Watford DC Line and runs parallel to the West Coast Main Line. - Charing Cross (sometimes informally abbreviated as Charing X) is a London Underground station at Charing Cross in the City of Westminster with entrances located in Trafalgar Square and The Strand. The station is served by the Northern and Bakerloo lines and provides an interchange with the National Rail network at station. On the Northern line it is between and stations on the Charing Cross branch, and on the Bakerloo line it is between Embankment and stations. The station is in Travelcard Zone 1. The station was served by the Jubilee line between 1979 and 1999, acting as the southern terminus of the line during that period. - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - Swiss Cottage is a district of the London Borough of Camden in London. It is located north-northwest of Charing Cross. It is centred on the junction of Avenue Road and Finchley Road and is the location of Swiss Cottage tube station. Swiss Cottage forms part of Hampstead and sits at the triumvirate of postcodes of Hampstead NW3, St Johns Wood NW8 and Kilburn/West Hampstead NW6. It is the proposed site for the tallest residential tower in Camden. - Swiss Cottage is a London Underground station at Swiss Cottage , north London . It is on the Jubilee line , between Finchley Road and St. John 's Wood stations . It is in Travelcard Zone 2 and located at the junction of Finchley Road , Avenue Road and College Crescent . - Finchley is an area of north London, England, in the London Borough of Barnet. Finchley is on high ground, north of Charing Cross.

This indicates","completion":"This indicates a geological history involving deposition and changes in the environment over time. The layering of shale on top of limestone suggest different processes that occurred in the region during different periods. To fully understand the implications of this observation, it's important to understand the characteristics of the two rock types and how they form. Limestone is a sedimentary rock primarily composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in the form of mineral calcite. It forms through the accumulation of marine organisms' shells, corals, and other calcium-rich materials in shallow, warm water environments. The formation of limestone is typically indicative of a marine environment, often in quiet-water conditions such as lagoons and shallow seas where deposition of these calcareous materials can occur without major disturbance. Limestone usually forms in layers and can exhibit both biogenic (organisms like mollusks, coral and plankton) and chemical origins (chemical precipitation and accumulation of calcium-rich minerals). On the other hand, shale is also a sedimentary rock, composed mostly of clay minerals and fine-grained fragments, like silt, mud or clay. It forms primarily in calm water environments as these tiny particles are easily erodible and can be transported long distances by water before eventually being deposited. The slow accumulation and settling of these small particles result in the formation of shale layers, often in deep marine basins or in low-energy environments like floodplains and lakes. Shale is characterized by its tendency to split into thin layers and often contains fossilized remains of the organisms or plant material that were present during its formation. Now, considering the observation that a layer of shale is found on top of a layer of limestone, several geological and environmental conditions can be inferred: 1. A change in depositional environment: A transition might have occurred in the area over time, shifting from a marine environment that supported limestone formation to a different environment characterized by deposition of fine-grained sediment like clay, silt, or mud. This could be due to various factors such as changes in sea level, climatic conditions, tectonic activity, or a combination of these factors. 2. A relative change in the energy of the depositional environment: The formation of fine-grained shale indicates that there could have been a reduction in the energy levels at this location. Calmer conditions would support the suspension of tiny particles in the water column, which would later settle down to form the shale layer. In contrast, the limestone might have formed in a higher energy environment, where calcium-rich organisms thrived in a shallow marine setting. 3. A difference in time of formation: The limestone beneath the shale represents an older geological time when the conditions were suitable for limestone deposition. As time passed, there was a change in the environment, leading to shale deposition. This geologic time gap could potentially provide information about the changes that happened on Earth during these periods based on the fossils and minerals found within each rock layer. In conclusion, a road cut showing a layer of shale on top of a layer of limestone is indicative of a transition in the depositional environment over time, possibly due to changes in sea level or climate, tectonic activity, or a shift in the energy of the depositional environment. This observation provides invaluable insights into the geological history of the area, as well as a glimpse into the paleoenvironments and paleoclimate during the time these rock layers were formed. Additionally, it can offer an opportunity to study the fossils and minerals within the layers, further enriching our understanding of Earth's history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What does a 'Vintner do?","completion":"A vintner, also known as a winemaker or wine producer, is a professional involved in the intricate and multifaceted process of producing wine from grape cultivation to its eventual distribution and sale. The role of a vintner traditionally pertains to those who play a significant part in winemaking and may include an array of responsibilities such as vineyard management, grape harvesting, fermentation, blending, aging, bottling, and marketing. Here are the primary responsibilities and tasks of a vintner in greater detail: 1. Vineyard management: The cultivation of grapevines is an essential component of winemaking. A vintner is responsible for determining the location of the vineyard, selecting appropriate grape varieties, and establishing vineyard infrastructure. This includes incorporating proper trellising systems, deciding on planting densities, and developing a vineyard management plan that may involve decisions on pruning, fertilization, irrigation, and pest and disease control. 2. Grape harvesting: A vintner monitors the ripeness and maturity of the grapes, deciding when they should be picked to ensure that they possess the desired sugar, acid, and flavor profiles. The timing of harvest largely influences the character and quality of the wine produced. 3. Fermentation: The vintner oversees the fermentation process, which involves the conversion of the grape sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide by yeast. During fermentation, the vintner may control factors such as temperature, oxygen exposure, yeast strains, and must chemistry to shape the final aroma, flavor, and texture of the wine. 4. Blending: Many wines are composed of several grape varieties or multiple batches of the same variety. The vintner is responsible for blending these components, finding the appropriate balance of flavors, acidity, mouthfeel, and tannins to create a harmonious and well-structured wine. 5. Aging: A vintner determines the appropriate aging process for each wine, considering factors such as wine type, vintage, and desired characteristics. This may involve aging the wine in oak barrels or stainless steel tanks, stirring the lees (spent yeast cells), or exposing the wine to controlled amounts of oxygen to enhance complexity and mouthfeel. 6. Bottling and packaging: Once the wine has reached the desired quality, it is transferred from barrels or tanks to bottles. The vintner may oversee the bottling process and make decisions concerning bottle type, closures (corks, screw caps, or alternative closures), and label designs. 7. Quality control and tasting: Throughout the winemaking process, the vintner plays a crucial role in ensuring that the wine meets the qualitative standards. This includes tasting the wine at various stages of development and making necessary adjustments to balance flavors and improve the wine's overall character. 8. Marketing and sales: A vintner is often responsible for cultivating the brand identity and reputation of the winery or wine label. This may include creating marketing materials, setting pricing strategies, hosting tastings and events at the winery, and establishing relationships with wholesalers, retailers, and restaurant accounts. In summary, a vintner is a multifaceted professional responsible for all aspects of winemaking, from grape cultivation to wine distribution and sales. The vintner's primary goal is to produce high-quality, unique, and enjoyable wines that will resonate with consumers and contribute to the overall success of their wine brand."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Some of the most popular styles of Mehndi patterns for Indian women include: 1. Indian Mehndi Designs: Indian Mehndi designs are known for their intricate detailing and dense patterns. These designs include traditional motifs like flowers, peacocks, paisleys, and more, often combined to form elaborate patterns. Indian Mehndi designs often cover the entire hand and can even extend up to the wrists and forearms, depending on the occasion. 2. Arabic Mehndi Designs: Arabic Mehndi designs are also popular among Indian women. These designs are characterized by their bold and large floral patterns with vines or leaves connecting the main elements. Arabic Mehndi designs are less dense compared to Indian designs and typically leave more open spaces. This style gives a more modern and minimalistic look, perfect for those who prefer something less ornate. 3. Moroccan Mehndi Designs: Moroccan Mehndi designs are inspired by the geometric patterns and architecture found in the Arab world. The designs feature crisp lines, angles, and straight shapes, creating unique patterns that differ from the highly curved and flowing patterns found in other Mehndi designs. This style gives a fresh and elegant look, perfect for those who appreciate simplicity and clean designs. 4. Rajasthani Mehndi Designs: Rajasthani Mehndi designs are influenced by the rich and colorful culture of the Indian state of Rajasthan. These designs incorporate traditional motifs like peacocks, lotus flowers, and royal embellishments. Rajasthani Mehndi patterns often cover the entire hand and feature intricate designs that showcase the wearer's skill and creativity. 5. Indo-Western Fusion Mehndi Designs: Due to the increasing popularity of Mehndi across the globe, a fusion of Indian and Western patterns has emerged called Indo-Western fusion mehndi designs. These designs combine the intricate detailing of Indian designs with the more minimalistic and modern touches of Western patterns, creating a perfect balance between tradition and contemporary aesthetics. Henna art, or Mehndi, is not only a symbol of beauty but also carries various cultural and religious connotations. For Indian women, Mehndi designs are an essential part of their celebratory attire during festivals like Diwali, Karva Chauth, and Teej, as well as life events like marriages and engagements. The intricacy and depth of Mehndi patterns reflect the dedication and skill of the artist, as well as the wearer's appreciation for their cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a premise: \\"Young ladies crossing a street.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"There are women in the street.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true? Pick your answer from: (1). yes (2). it is not possible to tell (3). no","completion":"The premise given is \\"Young ladies crossing a street.\\" This premise presents a situation where multiple young females are in the process of moving from one side of a street to another. The statement is clear in specifying that these individuals are young ladies, which means they are young females, and they are actively crossing a street. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states, \\"There are women in the street.\\" This hypothesis is a claim about the presence of females in the street. Women is a term generally used to refer to adult females, although it can also be used to encompass females of all ages. Examining the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is possible to determine whether the hypothesis is true by analyzing the presented premise. The premise specifies that young ladies are crossing the street, which implies that these young females are in the process of traversing the street. Given that they are in the process of crossing the street, it is accurate to say that there are females in the street during this action. Although the term \\"women\\" is mainly used to refer to adult females, the general understanding of females in the street, in this case, would include females of all ages. With this interpretation, the group of young ladies crossing the street would be considered as a subset of women. Therefore, it is accurate to say that the hypothesis, \\"There are women in the street,\\" is true based on the premise provided. In conclusion, the answer is: (1). yes, the premise tells us that the hypothesis is true. The premise describes a situation where young ladies are crossing a street, which implies that there are females, in this case being referred to as a subset of women, present in the street. This information aligns with the proposed hypothesis, ultimately confirming it as correct."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? and cinemantic flair","completion":"In order to analyze the sentiment of the given sentence, we must first understand the context and components: The sentence, \\"and cinemat(c)ic flair\\", only has two components - 'cinematic' and 'flair.' While the sentence itself is quite short and lacks more contextual information, we can still break down the two words and examine their sentiments individually. 1. Cinematic: This term is usually associated with the movie industry, film production, or visual storytelling. In essence, it relates to the way a visual story is presented on the screen. Phrases or sentences that include the word \\"cinematic\\" inherently suggest a stylized or artistic interpretation that adds value to the viewing experience. As such, the sentiment attached to this term can be perceived as positive. 2. Flair: This term often refers to a sense of style or the ability to do something with panache or enthusiasm. When people think of flair, they generally think of creativity, exuberance, or artistic expertise. In most cases, the word \\"flair\\" would be seen as having a positive sentiment, as it conveys a positive characterization of someone's ability or the quality of their work. Based on the analysis of these individual terms, we can infer that the sentiment of the sentence \\"and cinematic flair\\" leans towards positive. However, without further context about the situation, theme, or subject matter, it is essential to note that sentiment may vary depending on the reader's perception or when combined with other sentences that provide additional information. In a broader context, a more accurate sentiment evaluation can be performed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Not everybody would feel as relaxed lying in a hammock strung thousands of feet up in the air between mountains. But then these thrill-seekers high up in the northern Italian Alps aren't just anybody. They are members of a group of extreme athletes who have travelled to take part in the International Highline Meeting in Monte Piana, Italy. The inaugural meeting took place in 2012, when Monte Piana was identified as a great place for the sport, easily accessible and with a glorious past and a fairy tale atmosphere. The highliners came together for a week to practice their sport in harmony with nature and without mutual showdown, and it was such a success that now the meeting takes place annually. There are seemingly no end of daredevils who like nothing better than to take up the challenges posed by highwire walking. From natural geographical features such as waterfalls and gorges, to man-made objects such as skyscrapers and suspension bridges, tightrope walkers have attempted to walk across them all - with varying degrees of success. It's a physical accomplishment which is not for the the faint of heart. Not at that altitude anyway. Perhaps they are secretly trying to emulate that great high wire walker Jean Francois Gravelet, alias Charles Blondin, of France, who made the earliest crossing of the Niagara Falls on a three-inch rope 1,100ft long and 160ft above the Falls in 1859. Blondin thereafter made each crossing of the Falls in a different manner: blindfolded; trundling a wheelbarrow; on stilts, once with a man on his back, and once and sitting down halfway to make an omelette. These guys look like cooking a few eggs while they chill out in hammocks wouldn't be far beyond them. Scroll down for video. Just chill out man: A guitarist strums a tune while all around him the high wire experts relax. But how did he get the guitar there? Come join! A highline walker heads towards his compadres who rest in a hammock on webbing stretched between rocks in the Italian Alps. Clingon: An extreme athlete makes the walk across a wire strung between the Italian Alps thousands of feet above ground level. Nearly there: After his long walk across this tightrope enthusiast is almost at the other side. Now get back up there: Losing your footing results in the inevitable, but a small safety rope stops this high wire enthusiast from plummeting to his death. Easy does it: A female highliner walks the line strung between rocks in the Alps as part of the gathering near Misurina in northern Italy. Walk the line: A dramatic shot from low down shows three of the highliners criss crossing the gorge. Cosy in there? This highliner is so happy to be resting in his snug hammock he's catching 40 winks. All tgether now, heave! Highliners tighten the webbings between rocks so they can continue to try new routes across the gorge. That's fairly high! This shot shows just how far above the ground these thrill seekers are as they nonchalantly walk across the webbings. Then three came along all at once: Highliners chat to each other, strung hundreds of feet above the ground. And so to bed: A huddle of tents forms the makeshift village for a week as the highliners get some well-deserved sleep before another day of thrill seeking. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"A group of brave athletes called highliners went to Monte Piana in Italy for an event called the International Highline Meeting.

When you land on the space, you may choose to purchase the property at the price listed on the card. Pay that cost to the banker or the owner of the property. If you do not purchase the property, and it is not currently owned by another player, the banker will hold an auction. You can participate in the auction even though you chose not to buy it at the purchase price. Once you own all of the site properties of one color, you have a monopoly and can build on them. You can charge rent from other players who land on your property. When you own utilities, you can charge usage fees. Players who land on your utility will owe you rent based on a dice roll. Owning both the phone and internet utilities will greatly increase your income from other players. A player who lands on your utility will owe rent determined by the amount they roll on the dice multiplied by 4, then multiplied again by 10,000. If you own both utilities, the rent owed is the player’s dice roll multiplied by 10, then 10,000. Airports allow you to collect fees from other players. Each time a player lands on one of your airports, they will owe you the amount shown on the Title Deed card. This can be any number you negotiate together. If you have any buildings on properties of the same color, you cannot sell the property until you sell all of the buildings on that same color.

Here is an article: Ohio will use an untried dose of two drugs to put to death a man who raped and killed his girlfriend's three-year-old daughter, the state prisons agency said on Monday. A warden determined that the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility doesn't have enough pentobarbital, the drug Ohio used until its manufacturer put it off-limits for executions, a Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman, JoEllen Smith, said in an email. Instead, the state will use an intravenous combination of midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, in the 14 November execution of Ronald Phillips. Those drugs are included in Ohio's untested backup execution method, which requires them to be injected directly into an inmate's muscle. No state has put a prisoner to death with those drugs in any fashion. Phillips, 40, was sentenced to death for killing Sheila Marie Evans in 1993, after a long period of abusing her. Ohio's revamped execution policy calls for the state to try to buy specialty batches of pentobarbital from compounding pharmacies, which mix individual doses of drugs for specific patients. If that fails, the policy calls for the use of the two-drug approach. A plan by Georgia to use a specialty batch of pentobarbital has been put on hold by a federal lawsuit challenging the state prison agency's refusal to identify the compounding pharmacy that provided the drug. The lawsuit also questions the drug's safety and effectiveness. Compounding pharmacies are under increased scrutiny following a 2012 meningitis outbreak which killed more than 60 people and sickened hundreds and was linked to contaminated ingredients at the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. Phillips' lawyers have pushed for mercy, arguing that he was raped and beaten by his late father as a child and grew up in a chaotic, filthy environment.

The suit positions Microsoft as a champion of its customers’ privacy and draws attention to a legal process many may not be aware of. “Most people do think of their email as their personal property, wherever it happens to reside,” said A. Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami. “But there is a disconnect between behavior and expectations and the statute. And Microsoft is inviting a court to bring the law in line with people’s expectations.” Beyond image-burnishing, the suit is a pragmatic attempt to move away from litigating cases one by one, which is costly and time-consuming. “Microsoft is going on offense, but they’re kind of forced into it,” Mr. Froomkin said. Judges grant the secrecy orders. Microsoft sees only the warrant for the information demanded and not the argument made by the prosecutors to justify a gag order. But the Microsoft legal team looked at the high percentage of secrecy orders granted in the year and a half through March of this year, and concluded that prosecutors often relied on a vague standard that there was a “reason to believe” that disclosure might hinder an investigation. Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, “readily recognizes that nondisclosure orders are appropriate and necessary” when there is a risk of endangering a person’s life or that crucial evidence may be destroyed, for example. “What concerns us is the low standard the government has to bear and the absence of a time limit,” Mr. Smith added. About two-thirds of the secrecy orders Microsoft received in the span it audited had no time limits. In the physical world, so-called sneak-and-peek warrants for secret searches are granted to look at documents without notifying a target. But most secrecy orders delay notification for a fixed period of time, typically 30 to 90 days, and detailed evidence is required for any extensions. Microsoft, Mr. Smith said, has talked to other major tech companies, and others may join with briefs in support of Microsoft. ||||| Microsoft sued the Justice Department today, challenging the constitutionality of the gag orders issued by the government that prevent tech companies from informing their customers when their data is accessed as part of an investigation. The suit challenges a provision in the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) that allows courts to force Microsoft and other companies that offer cloud storage to stay silent when they turn over customer data to the government. Microsoft claims that these gag orders violate customers’ right to know when the government searches their property, and the company’s right to communicate freely with its customers. Written 30 years ago, before cloud storage was as common as it is today, ECPA gives the government legal cover to access data stored in the cloud without notifying its owner. “The government,” Microsoft argues in its lawsuit, “has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.” Microsoft claims that, between September 2014 and March 2016, it has received 5,624 federal requests for customer data. Of those requests, 2,576 were accompanied by a gag order, prohibiting Microsoft from informing its customers that their information was being accessed by the government. Although some of the secrecy orders came with a time limit, after which Microsoft could tell its customers about the intrusion, the majority did not — meaning that Microsoft could never divulge that the search had taken place. In its suit, Microsoft singles out its Outlook.com and and Office365 as products that are frequently targeted by the government. “These twin developments—the increase in government demands for online data and the simultaneous increase in secrecy—have combined to undermine confidence in the privacy of the cloud and have impaired Microsoft’s right to be transparent with its customers, a right guaranteed by the First Amendment,” Microsoft states in its suit. The lawsuit comes one day after the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously on the Email Privacy Act, a bill that aims to reform ECPA. Update: The ACLU praised Microsoft’s lawsuit and called on Congress to take up ECPA reform, specifically focusing on the gag order issues raised by Microsoft. “If Congress fails to include those changes as it considers ECPA reform, then the courts should step in, including in Microsoft’s case, to end the government’s constitutional failure to provide notice,” said ACLU staff attorney Alex Abdo. ||||| SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has sued the U.S. government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails, the latest in a series of clashes over privacy between the technology industry and Washington. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella delivers the keynote address during the Microsoft Build 2016 Developer Conference in San Francisco, California in this March 30, 2016, file photo. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach/Files The lawsuit, filed on Thursday in federal court in Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents. The government’s actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right for people and businesses to know if the government searches or seizes their property, the suit argues, and Microsoft’s First Amendment right to free speech. The Department of Justice is reviewing the filing, spokeswoman Emily Pierce said. Microsoft’s suit focuses on the storage of data on remote servers, rather than locally on people’s computers, which Microsoft says has provided a new opening for the government to access electronic data. Using the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), the government is increasingly directing investigations at the parties that store data in the so-called cloud, Microsoft says in the lawsuit. The 30-year-old law has long drawn scrutiny from technology companies and privacy advocates who say it was written before the rise of the commercial Internet and is therefore outdated. “People do not give up their rights when they move their private information from physical storage to the cloud,” Microsoft says in the lawsuit. It adds that the government “has exploited the transition to cloud computing as a means of expanding its power to conduct secret investigations.” Related Coverage Microsoft lawsuit against government relies on speech, privacy rights SURVEILLANCE BATTLE The lawsuit represents the newest front in the battle between technology companies and the U.S. government over how much private businesses should assist government surveillance. By filing the suit, Microsoft is taking a more prominent role in that battle, dominated by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) in recent months due to the government’s efforts to get the company to write software to unlock an iPhone used by one of the shooters in a December massacre in San Bernardino, California. Apple, backed by big technology companies including Microsoft, had complained that cooperating would turn businesses into arms of the state. “Just as Apple was the company in the last case and we stood with Apple, we expect other tech companies to stand with us,” Microsoft’s Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a phone interview after the suit was filed. One security expert questioned Microsoft’s motivation and timing. Its lawsuit was “one hundred percent motivated by business interests” and timed to capitalize on new interest in customer privacy issues spurred in part by Apple’s dispute, said D.J. Rosenthal, a former White House cyber security official in the Obama administration. As Microsoft’s Windows and other legacy software products are losing some traction in an increasingly mobile and Internet-centric computing environment, the company’s cloud-based business is taking on more importance. Chief Executive Satya Nadella’s describes Microsoft’s efforts as “mobile first, cloud first.” Slideshow (2 Images) Its customers have been asking the company about government surveillance, Smith said, suggesting that the issue could hurt Microsoft’s ability to win or keep cloud customers. In its complaint, Microsoft says over the past 18 months it has received 5,624 legal orders under the ECPA, of which 2,576 prevented Microsoft from disclosing that the government is seeking customer data through warrants, subpoenas and other requests. Most of the ECPA requests apply to individuals, not companies, and provide no fixed end date to the secrecy provision, Microsoft said. Microsoft and other companies won the right two years ago to disclose the number of government demands for data they receive. This case goes farther, requesting that it be allowed to notify individual businesses and people that the government is seeking information about them. Increasingly, U.S. companies are under pressure to prove they are helping protect consumer privacy. The campaign gained momentum in the wake of revelations by former government contractor Edward Snowden in 2013 that the government routinely conducted extensive phone and Internet surveillance to a much greater degree than believed. Late last year, after Reuters reported that Microsoft had not alerted customers, including leaders of China’s Tibetan and Uigher minorities, that their email was compromised by hackers operating from China, Microsoft said publicly it would adopt a policy of telling email customers when it believed their email had been hacked by a government. The company’s lawsuit on Thursday comes a day after a U.S. congressional panel voted unanimously to advance a package of reforms to the ECPA. Last-minute changes to the legislation removed an obligation for the government to notify a targeted user whose communications are being sought. Instead, the bill would require disclosure of a warrant only to a service provider, which retains the right to voluntarily notify users, unless a court grants a gag order. It is unclear if the bill will advance through the Senate and become law this year. Separately, Microsoft is fighting a U.S. government warrant to turn over data held in a server in Ireland, which the government argues is lawful under another part of the ECPA. Microsoft argues the government needs to go through a procedure outlined in a legal-assistance treaty between the U.S. and Ireland. Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) is fighting a separate battle in federal court in Northern California over public disclosure of government requests for information on users. The case is Microsoft Corp v United States Department of Justice et al in the United States District Court, Western District of Washington, No. 2:16-cv-00537. ||||| Sure, Microsoft's lawsuit aims to protect civil liberties, but the company says it also wants to ensure it can continue to sell products that its customers can trust. The company argues that the government has placed it under an unlimited gag order, forcing it to refrain from informing customers when the authorities request emails and other information. And that the gag order violates the free speech protections of the First Amendment. Microsoft says it understands there are times when secrecy is needed so that a suspect doesn't destroy evidence or further jeopardize an investigation. However, some of the requests prohibit from ever telling a customer the government accessed their data. \\"Based on the many secrecy orders we have received, we question whether these orders are grounded in specific facts that truly demand secrecy,\\" explained president and chief legal officer Brad Smith. \\"To the contrary, it appears that the issuance of secrecy orders has become too routine.\\" The company is no stranger to battles with the US government over customer privacy and security. In 2014, for example, Microsoft resisted a demand to seize offshore email accounts stored at a data center in Ireland. Redmond is not alone in the fight for more transparency when it comes to government requests, either. Both Google and Twitter want to be able to disclose more information on the number of national security letters it receives. Twitter filed a lawsuit in 2014, asking a court to declare the government's restrictions on what it's able to disclose in transparency reports a violation of the First Amendment. ||||| SEATTLE—Microsoft Corp. sued the Justice Department on Thursday, saying it’s unconstitutional for the government to bar tech companies from telling customers when federal agents have examined their data. The suit, filed in the federal court here, raises a fundamental question of how easily, and secretly, the government should be able to gain access to individuals’ information in the cloud-computing era.

The following is a summary for each article: 1. Microsoft has filed a lawsuit against the US government for the right to tell its customers when the government is looking at their emails. Microsoft argues that the gag orders violate the Fourth Amendment, which gives people and businesses the right to know if the government searches or seizes their property. The lawsuit also claims that the government has violated Microsoft's First Amendment right to free speech. 2. Microsoft is suing the Justice Department, challenging the constitutionality of gag orders that prevent tech companies from informing their customers when their data is accessed as part of an investigation. Microsoft claims that these gag orders violate customers' right to know when the government searches their property, and the company's right to communicate freely with its customers. The lawsuit comes a day after the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously on the Email Privacy Act, a bill that aims to reform the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA). 3. Microsoft has sued the U.S. government for the right to tell its customers when a federal agency is looking at their emails. The lawsuit, filed in Seattle, argues that the government is violating the U.S. Constitution by preventing Microsoft from notifying thousands of customers about government requests for their emails and other documents. The government's actions contravene the Fourth Amendment, which establishes the right to know if the government searches or seizes property, and Microsoft's First Amendment right to free speech. 4. Microsoft's lawsuit against the US government argues that the unlimited gag order placed on the company, forcing it to refrain from informing customers when the authorities request emails and other information, violates the free speech protections of the First Amendment. Microsoft claims that it understands the need for secrecy in some cases, but questions the routine issuance of secrecy orders. The company is not alone in its fight for more transparency, as Google and Twitter also seek to disclose more information on the number of national security letters they receive. 5.

In 1973, during the Yom Kippur War, an Israeli A-4 Skyhawk jet carrying a nuclear weapon is shot down.29 years later, in 2002, a Syrian scrap collector uncovers a large unexploded bomb buried in a field within the Golan Heights. He sells it to a South African black market arms trafficker named Olson (Feore), who recognizes it as the nuclear bomb that was lost during the war. He then sells it to a secretive far-right cabal seeking to impose a fascist world order, led by Austrian billionaire and Neo-Nazi Richard Dressler (Bates). Dressler's aim is to transform Europe into a united fascist superstate. He intends to start a nuclear war between the United States and Russia that will devastate them both.CIA analyst Jack Ryan (Affleck) is summoned by Director William Cabot (Freeman) to accompany him to Russia to meet President Nemerov (Hinds). In Moscow, Cabot and Ryan are allowed to examine a Russian nuclear weapons facility as prescribed by the START treaty, where Ryan notices the absence of three scientists listed on the facility's roster. Cabot sends Special Activities Division operative John Clark (Schreiber) to Russia to investigate the missing scientists. Clark tracks the missing scientists to a former Soviet military facility in Ukraine, where Cabot suspects they are building a secret nuclear weapon that Russia could use without any way to trace it back to them.Ryan and his colleagues discern that a crate from the facility in Ukraine was flown to the Canary Islands, then sent to Baltimore on a cargo ship. Ryan warns Cabot, who is attending a football game in Baltimore with the President, about a bomb threat being in play. The President is evacuated before the bomb detonates, but the city is wrecked by the ensuing shock wave. To escalate the situation, a corrupt Russian Air Force general who has been paid by Dressler sends Tu-22M Backfires to attack a U.S. aircraft carrier operating in the North Sea.Ryan learns from the radiation assessment team that the isotopic signature from the nuclear blast pinpoints it as having been manufactured at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina in 1968; evidence which would seem to exonerate the Russians. In Syria, Clark tracks down Ghazi, one of the men who found the bomb, now dying of radiation exposure. He tells Clark that he sold the bomb to Olson, who lives in Damascus. Ryan's colleagues at Langley infiltrate Olson's computer and download files that implicate Dressler as the person who bought the plutonium and who is behind the Baltimore attack.Ryan is able to reach the National Military Command Center in the Pentagon and get a message to Nemerov, saying that he knows that Russia was not behind the attack, while also asking Nemerov to stand down his forces as a show of good faith. Nemerov agrees to do so as President Fowler follows suit. The participants in the conspiracy, including Dressler, are later assassinated.

As they strolled through the bustling market, filled with delicious aromas and colorful fruits and vegetables, Angela couldn't help but continually sample the various offerings. She munched on a juicy peach, sipped on a fresh and tangy lemonade, and savored a delectable piece of artisanal cheese. Meanwhile, Cynthia's hunger grew. She finally spotted a food vendor selling her favorite dish: a warm and flaky pastry filled with a delightful mixture of spinach and feta cheese. Cynthia eagerly purchased one, and as she took her first bite, her energy levels seemed to immediately revive. With their appetites satisfied and their spirits lifted, the two friends chatted excitedly about their plans for the day. They had both recently taken up hiking as a new hobby and decided to tackle a nearby trail that boasted beautiful vistas and a stunning waterfall.

UK cancer survival rates, while improving, were poor compared with the rest of Europe, the report said. NHS England said it was already working on a new five-year strategy. The report, published following evidence from a number of cancer charities and experts, looked at what progress had been made in improving cancer services and outcomes in England. Margaret Hodge, who chairs the committee, said: \\"With more than one in three people developing cancer in their lifetime, cancer touches the lives of all of us at some point, and the Department of Health spends over Â£6.7bn on cancer services a year. \\"That is why it is so concerning that the Department of Health and NHS England have lost momentum in the drive to improve cancer services in the last two years. \\"More and more people are getting cancer but the resources available to support improvement have gone down.\\" The report said that despite a good record in improving cancer services, progress had dipped recently. Cancer waiting time targets, for example, had been missed. The NHS target that 85% of cancer patients should be treated within 62 days of being urgently referred by their GP was missed for the first three-quarters of 2014. As a result, 5,500 patients had to wait longer than 62 days for treatment between July and September last year. Two other cancer waiting time targets were also missed at times during 2014, the report said. It also said it was not good enough that in the UK nearly a third of people died within a year of a cancer diagnosis and about half did not survive for five years. The committee also had issues with \\"poor\\" survival rates and access to treatment for people over 65. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said the NHS was helping more people than ever survive cancer. But he acknowledged it was time to take \\"a fresh look at how we can do even better across the whole patient journey\\". \\"This is why we have already established an independent taskforce to develop a new cancer strategy for the next five years.\\" The taskforce, announced by NHS England in January, will focus on better prevention, faster diagnosis and better treatment, care and aftercare. Sarah Woolnough, executive director of policy at Cancer Research UK, said: \\"It is depressing that too many patients are waiting longer than they should for their diagnosis and effective treatment. \\"We hope the report will urgently catalyse NHS England, the Department of Health and others charged with providing cancer care to deliver the best for all patients, no matter their age, the cancer they suffer from or where they live. \\"All patients deserve the best treatment and care and many are not currently receiving it.\\" She said more people were surviving cancer thanks to the ability to diagnose patients earlier and treat them effectively. But with an ageing population, more people would inevitably develop cancer. To continue to improve cancer services, the right leadership, more investment and better planning was needed now, she said. Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham said: \\"This report makes devastating reading for David Cameron and is damning proof of his mismanagement of the NHS. Under the Tories, cancer care has gone backwards and patients are missing out on the treatment they need.\\" A Department of Health spokesperson said an estimated 12,000 extra people would survive cancer by the end of 2015. \\"We have invested an extra Â£750m on cancer services, including early diagnosis and innovative radiotherapy.\\"","completion":"A report by the Public Accounts Committee has found that the UK's National Health Service (NHS) is struggling to meet waiting time standards for cancer patients, with resources being reduced. Despite improvements, UK cancer survival rates remain poor compared to the rest of Europe. The report highlighted missed cancer waiting time targets in 2014, resulting in thousands of patients waiting longer for treatment. NHS England acknowledged the need for better strategies and is working on a new five-year plan to focus on prevention, faster diagnosis, and better treatment, care, and aftercare. Cancer Research UK emphasized the importance of increased investment, better planning, and strong leadership to continue improving cancer services."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Continue writing the next sentence in this paragraph: How to act toward someone with dissociative identity disorder Know the symptoms. Did is characterized by the presence of alternate identities, often referred to as alters. These identities are often complex, with their own unique histories and physical and behavioral traits.","completion":"When interacting with someone who has Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID), it is essential to establish a respectful and empathetic approach by keeping some key points in mind. 1. Educate yourself about DID: To better understand the person, educate yourself about the symptoms and challenges faced by those with DID. Familiarize yourself with the concept of alters and how individuals with DID experience their lives. Understand that DID is a reaction to severe and traumatic experiences, and it is a coping mechanism that allowed the person to survive those events. 2. Address the person with respect: When engaging with someone with DID, always address them with respect and dignity, irrespective of which alter is present. Do not make fun or belittle the person or their alters, as their experiences are their reality. 3. Recognize their various alters: Understand that the person with DID may switch between alters during different situations. Recognize their different alters and refer to them by their preferred names, showing that you acknowledge and respect their unique identities. 4. Establish boundaries: Just like with any other relationship, make sure to establish and maintain healthy boundaries. It is essential to discuss communication preferences, personal space, and limitations early in the interaction to ensure a healthy relationship. 5. Offer support, but don’t push: Offer emotional support and encouragement when needed, but do not impose your will on the person or their alters. They may require time and space to process their emotions and experiences. Be patient and understanding of their needs. 6. Respect their triggers: It is crucial to recognize and avoid discussing certain topics or situations that may trigger distressing memories or switch alters for the person with DID. Tread with caution and always be sensitive when addressing these issues. 7. Facilitate integration: Integration, or the process of merging alters into a single identity, may be a goal for some individuals with DID. If the person you are interacting with is actively working towards integration, provide reassurance, and support their efforts. But, do not force them to integrate if they are unwilling or not ready to do so. 8. Encourage professional help: Encourage the person to seek appropriate professional help, like psychotherapy, to better understand and manage their DID. Offer to assist them on their journey to find the right therapist or support group if needed. 9. Communicate openly: Maintain open and honest communication with the person, and encourage them to share their thoughts and feelings without judgment. Be a good listener and offer guidance when necessary. 10. Be patient and adaptable: Understand that interacting with someone who has DID may be challenging and require patience, flexibility, and adaptability on your part. In conclusion, when interacting with someone who has DID, it is vital to educate yourself about the disorder, address the individual with respect, and take an empathetic approach to establish a meaningful relationship. Understanding and openness will go a long way in making the person feel accepted, valued, and supported."},{"prompt":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What does the woman from the Blue World need to return home?, using the article: One evening, Cleveland Heep, who became the superintendent of a Philadelphia apartment complex after his family was murdered, discovers Story, a naiad-like character (called a \\"Narf\\") from the Blue World, in his building's pool, immediately rescuing her from an attack by a \\"Scrunt\\", a grass-covered, wolf-like creature that hides by flattening its body against the turf. Story is here to find the Author, a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran, who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas.

Objective: how to make an herbed egg sandwich Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"To fully answer this question, I will first describe the process of making an herbed egg sandwich and then analyze the physical reasoning involved in various steps. How to make an Herbed Egg Sandwich: Ingredients: 1. 2 slices of bread 2. 1-2 large eggs 3. 2 tbsp unsalted butter 4. Fresh herbs (e.g., parsley, chives, or basil) 5. Salt and pepper 6. Cheese (optional) 7. Mayonnaise and mustard (optional) 8. Lettuce and tomato (optional) Instructions: 1. Prepare the ingredients: Finely chop the fresh herbs and set aside. If you're adding cheese, lettuce, and tomato, slice the cheese, wash the lettuce, and slice the tomato. Set these ingredients aside as well. 2. Crack the eggs: In a small bowl, crack the eggs and beat them with a fork or whisk until the yolks and whites are combined. Add the chopped herbs, salt, and pepper to the beaten eggs and whisk again to incorporate the herbs evenly. 3. Cook the eggs: In a non-stick frying pan or skillet, melt the butter over low to medium heat. Then, pour the egg mixture into the pan. Cook the eggs gently. If you wish, fold the cooked egg mixture in half or make it an omelette-style by adding the cheese on top of the egg mixture before folding. Let the cheese melt while the eggs cook through. Once the eggs are fully cooked, remove the frying pan from the heat. 4. Toast the bread: While the eggs are cooking, toast the bread slices in a toaster or toaster oven until they are golden brown and crispy. Alternatively, you can use the same frying pan used for the eggs, adding more butter to toast the bread slices on each side. 5. Assemble the sandwich: Spread mayonnaise and mustard on one side of each slice of bread if desired. Place the cooked herbed eggs onto one slice of bread, followed by the cheese if you haven't added it to the eggs already. Add lettuce and tomato slices if you choose to use them. Finally, top the sandwich with the second slice of bread. 6. Serve immediately: Cut the sandwich into halves or quarters, according to your preference, and serve immediately. You can enjoy the herbed egg sandwich as a hearty breakfast or a delicious lunch. Now that we have discussed how to make an herbed egg sandwich, it is essential to consider the naive physics reasoning involved in the process. Naive physics refers to the intuitive understanding of the principles guiding objects' behavior in the physical world. The most significant naive physics principles are cooking the eggs evenly, appropriate heat management to avoid overcooking or burning the ingredients, and the proper assembly of the sandwich to maintain its structural integrity. One sound naive physics reasoning aspect is gently cooking the eggs on low to medium heat, which ensures that the eggs are cooked evenly and prevents them from overcooking or burning. Another sound reasoning is assembling the sandwich in an orderly fashion, which involves adding the condiments, eggs, cheese, lettuce, and tomato slices in a way that maintains the sandwich's structural integrity. This makes it easier to hold, eat, and enhances the overall eating experience. In conclusion, the process of making an herbed egg sandwich involves sound naive physics reasoning with careful heat management and assembly techniques. Following the steps and ingredients described above will result in a delicious and satisfying herbed egg sandwich."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

His family were very poor farmers, and there was never enough to eat. Frank decided he did not want to be farmer. He took a short business course, and went to work as a salesman in a large city. Woolworth realized he had a natural skill for showing goods to attract people's interest, but he soon learned something more important. One day his boss told him to sell some odds and ends ( ) for as much as he could get. Frank put all these things on one table with a sign which said five cents each. People fought and pushed to buy the things and the table was soon cleared. Soon afterwards, Woolworth opened his own store., selling goods at five and ten cents. But he had another lesson to learn before he became successful. That is, if you want to make money by selling low-price goods, you have to buy them in large quantities directly from the factories. Once, for example, Woolworth went to Germany and placed an order for knives. The order was so large that the factory had to keep running 24 hours a day for a whole year. In this way, the price of the knives was cut down by half. By 1919, Woolworth had over 1000 stores in the US and Canada, and opened his first store in London.

A recent experiment suggests that the answer to that question may depend on your age. Martin Doherty, a psychologist at the University of Stirling in Scotland, led the team of scientists. In this experiment, Doherty and his team tested the perception of some people, using pictures of some orange circles. The researchers showed the same pictures to two groups of people. The first group included 151 children aged 4 to 10, and the second group included 24 adults aged 18 to 25. The first group of pictures showed two circles alone on a white background. One of the circles was larger than the other, and these people were asked to identify the larger one. Four-year-olds identified the correct circle 79 percent of the time. Adults identified the correct circle 95 percent of the time. Next, both groups were shown a picture where the orange circles, again of different sizes, were surrounded by gray circles. Here's where the trick lies in. In some of the pictures, the smaller orange circle was surrounded by even smaller gray circles -- making the orange circle appear larger than the other orange circle, which was the real larger one. And the larger orange circle was surrounded by even bigger gray circles -- so it appeared to be smaller than the real smaller orange circle. When young children aged 4 to 6 looked at these tricky pictures, they weren't fooled -- they were still able to find the bigger circle with roughly the same accuracy as before. Older children and adults, on the other hand, did not do as well. Older children often identified the smaller circle as the larger one, and adults got it wrong most of the time. As children get older, Doherty said, their brains may develop the ability to identify visual context. In other words, they will begin to process the whole picture at once: the tricky gray circles, as well as the orange circle in the middle. As a result, they're more likely to fall for this kind of visual trick. Question: According to the passage, we can know that _ . Answer: OPTIONS: (i). a smaller orange circle appears bigger on a white background. (ii). an orange circle appears bigger than a gray one of the same size. (iii). a circle surrounded by other circles looks bigger than its real size. (iv). a circle surrounded by bigger ones looks smaller than its real size.

Coming off their easy road win over the Rams, the Vikings went home for a Week 6 inter-conference duel with the Baltimore Ravens. Minnesota got off to a fast start in the first quarter with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Bernard Berrian. Afterwards, the Ravens got the only points of the second quarter as kicker Steven Hauschka getting a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Vikings picked up where they left off with a 40-yard field goal from kicker Ryan Longwell. Baltimore responded with a 22-yard touchdown run from running back Ray Rice, yet Longwell helped out Minnesota by nailing a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, an action-packed fourth quarter ensued. Minnesota increased its lead with Favre hooking up with Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Ravens continued to hang around as quarterback Joe Flacco found wide receiver Mark Clayton on a 32-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings replied with Longwell's 29-yard field goal, but Baltimore took lead for the first time in the game as Flacco hooked up with wide receiver Derrick Mason on a 12-yard touchdown pass and Rice running 33 yards for a touchdown.

Efforts to reform the Afghan National Police force have been stymied by \\"corruption and lack of political will,\\" and police are wrongly being used to help fight the insurgency instead of crime, an independent research group said in a report. An Afghan policeman guards the scene of a suicide attack in Kabul on November 27. \\"The U.S. military ... still mainly sees the police as an auxiliary security force rather than an enforcer of the law,\\" the International Crisis Group concluded in a report posted Thursday on its Web site. \\"Too much emphasis is still placed on using the police to fight the insurgency rather than crime. \\"The Afghan National Police (ANP) is ill-equipped for this role, and has been targeted by the Taliban, with 1,200 killed in 2007 and a similar toll expected in 2008,\\" the group added. The Taliban will be on the agenda during the first visit by Pakistan's president to Afghanistan on Friday. The talks come amid ongoing warfare and tension along the Afghan-Pakistan border. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in Afghanistan have been based in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. \\"The goal of the Afghan government and the international community should be a national police force able to uphold the rule of law, and thereby help tackle the root causes of alienation that drive the insurgency,\\" the International Crisis Group said. The group described Afghanistan's Interior Ministry as a \\"hub of systemic corruption,\\" and accuses the department of placing \\"personal enrichment\\" above the need for improved policing. Recent leadership changes at the Interior Ministry should be used to stress that abuses will no longer be tolerated. \\"There has been little political will in Kabul or foreign capitals to tackle the power brokers who are preventing reform,\\" said Samina Ahmed, the group's South Asia project director. \\"Organized crime and lawlessness lie at the heart of much popular disillusionment and instability. Better law enforcement, including a functioning judicial system, would help counter any appeal the insurgents may hold in Afghanistan,\\" he added. The International Crisis Group covers more than 60 countries and territories, using field-based analysis and advocacy to deter and resolve deadly conflicts. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"A report says that efforts to fix the Afghan National Police force are not going well because of \\"corruption and lack of political will.\\" The police are being used to fight bad guys called the Taliban, instead of fighting crime like they should. This makes it easier for the Taliban to cause trouble in Afghanistan. The International Crisis Group, which made the report, thinks that the police should focus on catching criminals and making sure people follow the law. This way, they can help stop the reasons that make people join the Taliban. The group also said that there is a lot of corruption in the government department in charge of the police, which makes it harder to fix the problems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the above sentence using proper case.","completion":"Now you: What's your take on the latest campaign? My take on the latest campaign is that it has several key strengths, as well as a few potential weaknesses, which I will address in detail. To begin with the strengths, the messaging of the campaign is clear and concise, making it easily digestible for a wide range of audiences. The slogan captures the core themes of the campaign effectively and will likely resonate with many people who share the same values and goals. Additionally, the choice of color schemes and visuals in the promotional materials is engaging, helping the campaign to stand out among its competitors. The use of social media and other digital platforms has been well-executed, allowing the campaign to connect with its target audience where they are most active. By leveraging the power of influencers and sharing a variety of content, such as videos, infographics, and testimonials, it has succeeded in generating a buzz and driving public conversation. Furthermore, the campaign's consistent engagement with supporters, which includes responding to comments, sharing user-generated content, and hosting live-stream events, has fostered a sense of community and loyalty among its followers. However, there are also some potential weaknesses that may hinder the campaign's success. First, the demographic focus might be too narrow, which could potentially limit the overall reach of the message. By not catering to a wider audience, the campaign may miss out on the opportunity to expand its supporter base and create broader awareness around its goals. Second, while the campaign has been efficient in utilizing digital platforms, there is still room for improvement in terms of traditional media. By neglecting print, radio, and television ads, it may lose out on supporters who are not as active on social media or who simply prefer other methods of receiving information. Lastly, there may be concerns surrounding the financing of the campaign. Transparent and ethical funding sources are vital for maintaining credibility in today's political climate. Thus, it is crucial that the campaign takes steps to ensure that all financial contributions are reported accurately and ethically. In conclusion, while the latest campaign demonstrates several strengths, such as a powerful message, engaging visuals, and strategic use of online platforms, it would be wise to address potential weaknesses, including broadening target demographics, increased utilization of traditional media methods, and ensuring transparency in funding. By addressing these areas, the campaign has the potential to achieve even greater success and impact in its quest to achieve its goals."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception? In February 1953 Vaughan Williams and Ursula were married. He left the Dorking house and they took a lease of 10 Hanover Terrace, Regent's Park, London. It was the year of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation; Vaughan Williams's contribution was an arrangement of the Old Hundredth psalm tune, and a new setting of \\"O taste and see\\" from Psalm 34, performed at the service in Westminster Abbey. Having returned to live in London, Vaughan Williams, with Ursula's encouragement, became much more active socially and in pro bono publico activities. He was a leading figure in the Society for the Promotion of New Music, and in 1954 he set up and endowed the Vaughan Williams Trust to support young composers and promote new or neglected music. He and his wife travelled extensively in Europe, and in 1954 he visited the US once again, having been invited to lecture at Cornell and other universities and to conduct. He received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception. Kennedy describes it as \\"like a musical state occasion\\".Of Vaughan Williams's works from the 1950s, Grove makes particular mention of Three Shakespeare Songs (1951) for unaccompanied chorus, the Christmas cantata Hodie (1953–1954), the Violin Sonata, and, most particularly, the Ten Blake Songs (1957) for voice and oboe, \\"a masterpiece of economy and precision\\". Unfinished works from the decade were a cello concerto and a new opera, Thomas the Rhymer. The predominant works of the 1950s were his three last symphonies. The seventh—officially unnumbered, and titled Sinfonia antartica—divided opinion; the score is a reworking of music Vaughan Williams had written for the 1948 film Scott of the Antarctic, and some critics thought it not truly symphonic. The Eighth, though wistful in parts, is predominantly lighthearted in tone; it was received enthusiastically at its premiere in 1956, given by the Hallé Orchestra under the dedicatee, Sir John Barbirolli. The Ninth, premiered at a Royal Philharmonic Society concert... The answer is:","completion":"The last name of the person who received an enthusiastic welcome from large audiences, and was overwhelmed at the warmth of his reception is Williams.

In this context, cyber criminals lure unsuspecting users by using Beckham's fame and the prospect of seeing potentially scandalous pictures of him. This strategy relies on social engineering tactics, where attackers manipulate user's emotions and trust. To mitigate such risks, users should be cautious when encountering messages with sensational content, especially unsolicited emails or messages from unknown sources.

Available choices: 1). yes 2). no","completion":"2). No The answer you provided is not clear and could be improved for better understanding. A more detailed and long answer to the question \\"When did EMI create the first stereo discs?\\" would be: EMI (Electrical and Musical Industries Ltd.) had indeed been involved in the development of stereo sound technology since the 1930s. The company conducted several experiments and tests in cooperation with other industry pioneers, such as Bell Labs and Alan Blumlein. It is accurate that Bell Labs' stereo experiments took place in 1933 and EMI had cut some test discs using stereo technology during that period. However, it is essential to note that these tests were primarily aimed at the research and development of the new technology, and they did not lead to a commercial release in the 1930s. In the 1950s, stereo technology gained significant traction, and multiple companies were competing to establish their stereo systems in the market. EMI made a significant contribution to the development of stereo discs in 1957. The company started releasing its first stereo records in the 1958, using the Westrex \\"45/45\\" stereo cutting system. This system was developed by the Westrex Corporation (a division of the Western Electric Company) and was one of the pioneering methods for cutting stereo discs, where the lateral and vertical groove modulations represented the left and right channels of the stereo signal, respectively. In summary, EMI had been involved in stereo experiments and tests since the early 1930s, which contributed to the company's rich history in the field of stereo technology. However, it was not until 1958 that EMI started commercially releasing its first stereo records, using the Westrex \\"45/45\\" cutting system. This 1958 commercial introduction of stereo discs is an essential milestone in the history of stereo sound technology and the music industry overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a step-by-step explanation for choosing this answer: Step 1: Identify the main concern of the question. The question focuses on a soon-to-be homeowner and their concerns in the context of fighting inflation. Step 2: Analyze the given options. The options provided are: - Lower interest - Raising interest rates - Higher interest rates - Lowering prices - Save money Step 3: Eliminate options that do not relate to inflation. Fighting inflation would typically result in changes to interest rates or prices, so we can eliminate \\"save money\\" as a viable option. Step 4: Identify the options that are relevant to homeowners. To narrow down further, we should consider which options directly impact homeowners. The options related to interest rates are more relevant to soon-to-be homeowners as they are likely to be borrowing money for their home purchase. Step 5: Determine the consequences of inflation on homeownership. Inflation typically leads to an increase in interest rates, as central banks use this as a tool to control inflation. As a result, borrowing costs for soon-to-be homeowners will increase. This means that among the given choices, \\"higher interest rates\\" and \\"raising interest rates\\" are possible options. Step 6: Select the most appropriate option that reflects the homeowner's concerns. Though both \\"higher interest rates\\" and \\"raising interest rates\\" are linked to inflation, the term \\"higher interest rates\\" better emphasizes the direct concern of the soon-to-be homeowner since it clearly highlights that they have to worry about the level of interest rates being higher than they would prefer. Therefore, the correct choice is \\"higher interest rates\\" because it directly connects to the concerns of a soon-to-be homeowner in the context of fighting inflation."},{"prompt":"Q: I heard that Addison was feeling ill, but they took the medicine too fast and it didn't sit well.

PUBLISHED:. 13:29 EST, 7 January 2014. |. UPDATED:. 17:10 EST, 7 January 2014. Suspect: Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after four guns and nearly 50 bombs were found in his vehicle during a traffic stop Monday. A man stopped for speeding in central Ohio was charged with illegally making or possessing an explosive device after nearly 50 bombs and four guns were discovered in his vehicle. Andrew Scott Boguslawski, 43, was arrested late New Year's Day on Interstate 70 west of Columbus. Investigators found two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosive devices and tools and materials to make additional explosives. Also inside was a remote detonating device, Assistant Madison County Prosecutor Nick Adkins said. Officials are trying to determine why the man had the cache of weapons and bombs. He is being held on 1million bond pending a court hearing Friday in Madison County. According to the state trooper who stopped him for going 85mph in a 70mph zone, Boguslawski said he had no weapons. However, the officer returned with a ticket and saw the handle of a gun between the man's knees. ‘At that point, he drew his service weapon, held the man there and called for backup,’ said Adkins.Boguslawski told authorities he has an attorney, but none was listed on the court docket. Adkins said a 1million bond set for the defendant reflected the possible risk to the public. Boguslawski was stopped on I-70 in Madison County just before midnight on New Year's Day for going about 15mph over the speed limit. Ohio State Highway Patrol Trooper William Davis asked the driver if he had any weapons in his vehicle after spotting a bumper sticker on Boguslawski's car that read: 'If you can read this, you’re in range,' The London Madison-Press reported. The 43-year-old man lied that he was unarmed, but when the trooper returned with his ticket, Boguslawski was clutching a gun with his knees. Tell-tale sign: An Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper asked Boguslawski if he had any weapons on him after spotting a bumper sticker on his car that read: 'If you can read this, you're in range' After additional officers arrived on the scene, Boguslawski's car was searched, yielding an arsenal of two pistols, two rifles, 48 explosives and bomb-making paraphernalia. 'Most concerning to me was that they found a remote detonating device,' said Adkins. According to Adkins, Boguslawski works at a training facility for Navy SEALS in Indiana. At the time of his arrest, the suspect was carrying blueprints for buildings that are part of his workplace. The prosecutor said investigators are trying to determine if Boguslawski has ties to any known terrorist organizations.","completion":"1.

Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows.

Translate to French.","completion":"La meilleure étude montre qu'en 2050, la chaleur causera 400 000 décès supplémentaires, mais 1,8 million de personnes en moins mourront à cause du froid. Pour approfondir ce sujet, il est important de comprendre le contexte et les facteurs qui contribuent à ces chiffres. Le réchauffement climatique est un phénomène qui continue de s'accentuer, avec de graves conséquences sur l'environnement et la santé humaine. Les températures moyennes à travers le monde augmentent, entraînant des vagues de chaleur plus intenses et plus fréquentes. Cependant, au fur et à mesure que les températures montent, les hivers deviennent moins rigoureux, réduisant potentiellement la mortalité liée au froid. En ce qui concerne les décès dus à la chaleur, les personnes les plus vulnérables sont les personnes âgées, les enfants et ceux qui ont des problèmes de santé préexistants, comme les maladies cardiaques, les problèmes respiratoires et le diabète. Les travailleurs exposés à des environnements extrêmement chauds, comme les agriculteurs et les ouvriers du bâtiment, sont également à risque. Les vagues de chaleur peuvent provoquer divers problèmes de santé tels que la déshydratation, les coups de chaleur, l'épuisement par la chaleur, ainsi que des complications liées à des maladies préexistantes. D'un autre côté, la baisse du nombre de décès dus au froid peut sembler être une conséquence positive du réchauffement climatique. En effet, les températures moins extrêmes durant l'hiver pourraient réduire le nombre de personnes qui meurent de causes telles que l'hypothermie, les maladies respiratoires et les accidents vasculaires cérébraux liés au froid. Toutefois, il est important de tenir compte du fait que ces chiffres ne sont pas compensés par la hausse des décès liée à la chaleur. Il est également essentiel de mettre en place des mesures préventives pour faire face à ces changements de température. Des actions telles que la mise en place de systèmes d'alerte précoce, d'infrastructures adaptées, et de programmes de sensibilisation pour encourager la population à prendre les précautions nécessaires durant les périodes de températures extrêmes peuvent contribuer à minimiser les risques pour la santé. En conclusion, l'augmentation des températures mondiales aura des conséquences importantes sur la santé humaine. Les gouvernements et les communautés doivent adopter des stratégies adaptées pour faire face à ces défis et protéger les personnes les plus vulnérables face aux effets du réchauffement climatique."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Both were very sick----Ryan with brain cancer, Walter with leukemia . Ryan, who was 3 at the time, began making silly faces at Walter and chatted about going home to change into his Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles costume. Several days later, Ryan moved to another hospital. Though they saw each other only a handful of times after that, Walter never forgot Ryan. \\"He inspired me to fight against my cancer,\\" said Walter, now 17, a football player. Then one day, Walter saw a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles shirt at a mall, which made him decide to search out Ryan.

A:","completion":"New York, known as the Empire State, has a rich history that dates back to the early colonial period. The state has been the stage for significant events, from battles during the Revolutionary War to momentous developments in art and culture. As a result, New York has numerous historical places that reflect its rich heritage. Some of the key historical sites and landmarks include: 1. Statue of Liberty National Monument and Ellis Island: The Statue of Liberty, a colossal neoclassical statue on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is a symbol of freedom and was a gift from France to the United States in 1886. Ellis Island is the site of the former U.S. federal immigration station that processed over 12 million immigrants between 1892 and 1954. Both sites are part of the National Park Service and are accessible by ferry. 2. The National September 11 Memorial & Museum: Built on the footprint of the former World Trade Center, this memorial and museum honors the victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Two reflecting pools mark the site where the Twin Towers once stood, and the museum contains numerous exhibits detailing the events of 9/11 and its aftermath. 3. New York State Capitol: Located in Albany, this historic building houses the New York State Legislature and the governor's office. Completed in 1899, the Capitol features Victorian architecture, symbolic carvings, and a renowned art collection. 4. Old Fort Niagara: Located on the eastern bank of the Niagara River, Old Fort Niagara has been an essential strategic location since the 1600s. The fort has witnessed several sieges and battles, particularly during the Revolutionary War and the War of 1812. Today, it serves as a living history museum. 5. Seneca Falls: This town is considered the birthplace of the American Women's Rights Movement. The Seneca Falls Convention, which took place in 1848, was the first women's rights convention in the United States. Visitors can explore the Women's Rights National Historical Park, including the Elizabeth Cady Stanton House and the Wesleyan Chapel, where the convention was held. 6. George Eastman Museum: Located in Rochester, this museum is dedicated to the life and work of George Eastman, the founder of the Eastman Kodak Company. The museum comprises Eastman's historic mansion, gorgeous gardens, and extensive collections related to photography and film. 7. Hyde Park: This historic site in the Hudson Valley is the location of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Home and Presidential Library, as well as the Vanderbilt Mansion. Both estates are open to the public and showcase the lifestyles of the wealthy and influential families in the early 20th century. 8. Saratoga National Historical Park: This park in Stillwater commemorates the site of the pivotal Battle of Saratoga during the Revolutionary War. The American victory here is considered a turning point in the war, leading to increased support from European allies. 9. Harriet Tubman Home: Located in Auburn, this historic site includes the residence of Harriet Tubman, the brave African American woman who guided many enslaved people to freedom via the Underground Railroad. The site also has the Harriet Tubman Home for the Aged, which she established to care for elderly African Americans. 10. Brooklyn Bridge: Completed in 1883, the Brooklyn Bridge is not only an iconic symbol of New York City but also a significant historic landmark in American engineering. Spanning the East River, the bridge connects Manhattan and Brooklyn and was the world's first steel-wire suspension bridge.

The Hunter Mountain Fire Tower will be the longest standing fire lookout tower in the U.S Available options: a). Yes. b). It's impossible to say. c). No.","completion":"b). It's impossible to say. The Hunter Mountain Fire Tower has a significant historical background, being the first of the 23 fire lookout towers built in the Catskill Mountains in New York and one of the five still standing today. Its construction dates back to the early 20th century and has since undergone various renovations and improvements to keep it standing. However, determining whether it will be the longest standing fire lookout tower in the United States or not cannot be conclusively answered based on the information provided. While Hunter Mountain Fire Tower’s age and continued existence may hold some sway, one must also take into consideration the factors that contribute to the longevity of structures, such as environmental conditions, maintenance efforts, and even potential natural disasters that can impact the tower. Furthermore, the question does not provide any contextual information on the other existing fire lookout towers in the U.S., making any comparisons or projections difficult. There could be other fire lookout towers in the country, either within or outside of the Catskill Mountains, that may already hold a more extended operational record. Likewise, upcoming maintenance, renovation, or eventual replacement of these towers could affect their longevity. Moreover, fire lookout towers' practical use has declined over the years due to technological advancements in fire detection and surveillance methods, making the future of these structures uncertain. Future public policies and conservation efforts may play a vital role in preserving and maintaining the remaining fire lookout towers across the United States. In conclusion, while the Hunter Mountain Fire Tower is undeniably essential from a historical standpoint, we cannot make a definitive statement about its standing as the longest-standing fire lookout tower in the U.S., based on the information provided.

That is true, but this is mostly a futuristic story, which looks a lot like Batman Forever with it's direction style and weird character designs. It was mismarketed, and should have been marketed as a futuristic tale, instead of just a lame cop comedy. Whether or not this movie is mismarketed, it's still a horrible movie. In the future, dinosaurs have been brought back to life through amazing technology, and they talk and walk around like humans. Teddy is a dinosaur detective who is never taken seriously, but after a dinosaur is murdered, he's given the case to work on, but he has to be partners with the toughest cop of them all, Katie Coltrane (Whoopi Goldberg). It's up to this mismatched duo to solve the murder, and it's up to the audience to stay awake long enough to make it through this piece of crud. Teddy starts the picture as a normal acting character, but by the end he is unbearable to listen to. For some reason along with being a detective, he's also a bad comedian and a bad impersonator. He does imitations of famous people and accents, and has some truly awful lines. Whoopi blames him for farting and he says, \\"It's not my butt trumpet!\\" Wow! What a puerile, immature line, even for a kid's movie of this caliber. Whoopi is also annoying and rude to everyone. I was hoping Teddy would bite her head off the entire length of the film. This movie never knew what it wanted to be. When the futuristic scenes and action occur, there is no comedy or humor. In any non-action scenes, the characters try to be as funny as they can, which just results in nonstop straight faced boredome. The action scenes don't work as they're too weird and not violent enough, and as stated earlier, the comedy is just a bunch of massacred jokes. Nothing ever works here. Having a dinosaur/human detective duo seems like a pretty original movie, if nothing else. Nope! This movie is a huge rip-off of Who Framed Roger Rabbit. Just replace dinosaurs with cartoons, and set it in the future, and it's the exact same plot. A man is killed, a dinosaur is killed. A dinosaur and detective solve the murder, a toon and detective solve the murder. The bad guys in Roger Rabbit are Christopher Lloyd and weasels. The bad guys here are a guy who sounds like Christopher Lloyd and guys who act just like the weasels. The club scene in Roger Rabbit where Jessica Rabbit walks down the stage is imitated with dinosaurs. This is a huge rip-off of a much better movie!

A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the given paragraph, we cannot definitively determine which friend received more vaccinations. The paragraph only states that Nigel was more prone to viral infections and contracted HIV, and Manny had a bacterial infection. Vaccination history is not mentioned for either friend. Vaccinations are typically used to protect against viral and bacterial infections by prompting an immune response in the person receiving the vaccine. This helps the person's immune system recognize and fight off the pathogen more effectively if they come into contact with it in the future. It is important to note that there is currently no vaccine available for HIV. However, there are several vaccinations available for some bacterial and viral infections. Although we cannot determine from the paragraph provided who received more vaccinations, we do know that Nigel did not receive a vaccine for HIV, as it does not exist. For Manny, it depends on the type of bacterial infection he contracted. There are vaccines available for some bacterial infections like Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and Neisseria meningitidis, which can cause pneumonia, meningitis, and other infections. If Manny contracted one of these bacterial infections, it is possible that he had received some vaccinations, but failed to achieve full protection due to an inadequate response from his immune system or because he had not completed the entire vaccine series.

There’s been a lot of discussion of this question since writer-directors Scott McGehee and David Siegel announced that they were planning a gender-flipped version of William Golding’s 1954 novel. But that conversation is perhaps less interesting than the one raised by Joanna Russ’ We Who Are About To. That question being: What if Lord of the Flies were feminist? Advertisement Many critics of McGehee and Siegel’s project have argued that the book is about violent masculinity, and the viciousness of upper-class boys trained to rule. Switching boys to girls, in this reading, undermines Golding’s critique of patriarchal violence. But does the novel really critique patriarchal violence? Golding’s own discussion of the issue is quite confused. When asked to explain why he’d chosen to make the story about boys only, he rambled incoherently, first saying that he had been a boy so understood boys better, then arguing that boys were a better representation of a “scaled-down version of society,” then concluding that girls are superior to boys. Golding, in short, did not seem to know why he had chosen boys, which suggests that the decision was less an intentional effort to critique gender roles, and more an unconscious default to the boy-centric adventure stories which Lord of the Flies both critiques and reproduces. Joanna Russ was neither confused nor ambivalent. We Who Are About To, released in 1977, is a clear-eyed, bleak excoriation of the interpenetration of masculinity, colonialism, and death. The short novel is about eight people—five women and three men—whose spaceship has gone off course and dropped them on a distant, unknown, semi-hospitable planet. Advertisement According to science-fiction and boys adventure tropes, this should be the start of a story of adventure and excitement—or at least, à la Lord of the Flies, of devolution and satisfying violent confrontation with horrifying atavism. The people on the ship are familiar with these stories, as the narrator wearily informs us. The escape pod has barely landed before the others on board are engaged in “excited talk of ‘colonization,’ whatever that is.” The narrator herself isn’t dreaming of colonization, though. As soon as the ship goes off course, she knows that on a world without food, with unknown dangers, billions of miles from rescue, they are all going to die. In fact, that’s the first line of the novel. “About to die. And so on. We’re all going to die.” The action of the novel—such as it is—is not about fighting for survival, either against the natural world or even against the other passengers. Rather, the narrator’s problem is that the other passengers won’t accept that they’re as good as dead. As a result, they decide that the women must agree to breed. In Lord of the Flies, civilized young boys shuck off civilization and become pagan savages, as if the real evil of the British is that under the polish they’re just like the people they colonize. But in We Who Are About To, the civilized people are horrible not because they’re really savage, but because they are, after all, blandly civilized—and civilization is built on an edifice of sexism and violence. In the name of the noble ideal of perpetuating civilization, the men insist that they have to rape the women. The shipwrecked view themselves as colonizers, thrusting themselves upon a new virgin land, taming and teaching, spreading their seed across the soil. The narrator is forced to kill them all so that she can die in peace. In Lord of the Flies, the terror of the novel is the vision of slipping backwards into savagery. Golding may be critiquing the upper classes, but when he wants to represent horror, he does it through paganism and images that might as well have been taken from Tarzan serials. If he is horrified by the violence of little boys, he also finds it exciting. That ambivalence, directed at a female cast, could easily turn into a mix of misogyny and fetishization, perhaps especially in the hands of male directors. ||||| EXCLUSIVE: Scott McGehee & David Siegel have made a deal at Warner Bros to write and direct a new version of Lord Of The Flies, based on the iconic William Golding novel. They plan to be faithful to the novel with one major twist: the young students stranded on a remote island who descend into a savage social order will be girls. Two Arts It is an intriguing take on a novel that was most famously turned into a 1963 film by Peter Brook. It was later turned into a 1990 Castle Rock film by director Harry Hook, which is how Warner Bros wound up with some of the rights. McGehee & Siegel last directed the 2012 drama What Maisie Knew, and before that Bee Season and The Deep End. They are very good at depicting traumatic events and stories seen through youthful eyes. They told Deadline they are big fans of Brook’s original film, but thought a new contemporized version felt timely. It took awhile for Warner Bros and their ICM Partners reps to work out the rights issues with the author’s estate. That just happened, and they have just closed their deals and will begin writing immediately. “We want to do a very faithful but contemporized adaptation of the book, but our idea was to do it with all girls rather than boys,” Siegel told Deadline. “It is a timeless story that is especially relevant today, with the interpersonal conflicts and bullying, and the idea of children forming a society and replicating the behavior they saw in grownups before they were marooned.” McGehee said the subject matter “is aggressively suspenseful, and taking the opportunity to tell it in a way it hasn’t been told before, with girls rather than boys, is that it shifts things in a way that might help people see the story anew. It breaks away from some of the conventions, the ways we think of boys and aggression. People still talk about the movie and the book from the standpoint of pure storytelling,” he said. “It is a great adventure story, real entertainment, but it has a lot of meaning embedded in it as well. We’ve gotten to think about this awhile as the rights were worked out, and we’re super eager to put pen to paper.” They are repped by ICM Partners and Nelson Davis. ||||| Despite having few details known about the project, immediate criticism met the news that Warner Bros. is developing an all-female adaptation of Lord of the Flies, William Golding's 1954 novel. The concern lay in the fact that the project would be written and directed by two men, Scott McGehee and David Siegel, who have said the movie would be a faithful adaptation of the novel, about a group of boys stranded on an island after a plane crash. Lord of the Flies is a book about toxic masculinity and what happens when that is left unchecked, even at a young age. It could prove difficult, if not impossible, to be both faithful to the source material and also to the psychology of the young women the film would be about — particularly without the input of female creative talent at the top levels of the project. “You aren’t even tapping the talent pool that will help you achieve market success,” contends Dr. Stacy Smith, who works on USC’s Media, Diversity and Social Change Initiative. The university's most recent study found that just 34 out of the 900 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2016 were directed by women. Of the films currently in production at Warner Bros., none are being directed by women, though the studio delivered one of the biggest box-office successes of 2017 with Wonder Woman, which has earned more than 800 million and had Patty Jenkins at the helm of the female-driven film starring Gal Gadot as the Amazon princess Diana. Observers of Wonder Woman's success note that the film likely rang true because of the female voices in the mix in the creative process. “One of the reasons the recent Wonder Woman film worked so well was because Diana was not just a male character dressed up in women's clothing,” says Dr. Martha Lauzen, the executive director at SDSU’s Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, which is responsible for the annual Celluloid Ceiling report. Only 31.4 percent of speaking roles in the top 100 grossing movies in 2016 were women, according to Smith's study. With such little onscreen representation, a question that's being raised about the all-female Lord of the Flies is whether or not the industry and audiences should welcome any female-fronted studio movie, no matter who is behind the camera. \\"That really complicates things because you don’t want to say in this industry that men can’t make stories about women,\\" says Kirsten Schaffer, the executive director of Women In Film. Lord of the Flies is just the latest in a trend of Hollywood gender-bending — and many of the projects have women in top roles. There is a Splash remake (from screenwriter Marja-Lewis Ryan), where Jillian Bell will play the Tom Hanks role and Channing Tatum will have the tail as a merman; and a Dirty Rotten Scoundrels redo, titled Nasty Women (also written by a woman, screenwriter Jac Schaeffer). There’s a role-swapping Overboard in production with Anna Faris, and a Rocketeer movie in development with the protagonist being re-imagined as a young African-American girl. And, of course, there is that all-female Ocean’s Eleven spinoff, Ocean’s Eight, that has produced set images with Rihanna, Cate Blanchett and Sarah Paulson in a variety of fall outerwear. In a post-Wonder Woman Hollywood, having female stories may no longer be enough. It is a matter of who is telling those stories. “It’s a question of what is driving the appetite to put women in front of the camera. Is it just a business opportunity?” asks Dr. Katherine Pieper, a colleague of Smith’s. “Do the people greenlighting these stories want an authentic female representation of these characters? If they do, then I think we would see women telling these stories.” Schaffer’s hope is that women screenwriters will see this as an opportunity to pitch their own gender-bending remakes of classic literature of their own. (Annie Clark, as known as the musician St. Vincent, is attached to direct a movie adaptation of The Portrait of Dorian Grey for Lionsgate, where the protagonist will be a woman.) While both Lauzen and Smith's research has shown that films with female directors have higher numbers of women producers, cinematographers, editors and other women in below-the-line roles, all say that the prospective Lord of the Flies production should look to hire women in key gate-keeping roles. \\"Or take on a female mentee or an apprentice,\\" offers Schaffer. \\"A woman who has directed feature but not at this budget level, as a way to help women rise.” ||||| Warner Bros is planning to remake “Lord Of The Flies” into a movie that promises to stick to the fundamentals of the original book except with one minor tweak. It’s an all female cast, and it’s written and directed by two males. An all-girl Lord Of The Flies is by far one of the stupider ideas for a movie, and I’ve heard about the recently proposed Anti-American Sniper. And in a rare and surprising turn of events, the internet actually agrees with me. Guys I know we’re all upset about LORD OF THE FLIES but it should make my all-human adaptation of ANIMAL FARM easier to sell. — Jessica Ellis (@baddestmamajama) August 31, 2017 uhm lord of the flies is about the replication of systemic masculine toxicity every 9th grader knows this u can read about it on sparknotes https://t.co/EQFyuSA3MV — froy (@froynextdoor) August 31, 2017 “all-female Lord of the Flies remake” SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE MISSED THE FUUUUUCKIN POINT OF LORD OF THE FLIES — Gavia Baker-Whitelaw (@Hello_Tailor) August 30, 2017 I’m not sure what the directors were thinking. That it would be fun to watch girls for an hour and a half in limited clothing on an island? That every movie featuring boys should also include a separate girl version – just to make it fair? In that case, Christopher Nolan better get started on an all female Dunkirk. Whether this movie is a grasp at gender equality or cheap way to generate buzz is beside the point. The fact of the matter is this already exists. Now, my new Twitter friends can say this wouldn’t happen to an all-female group on a remote island because girls are superior blah-blah-blah. I’ve heard it all a million times. That’s flagrantly false. Although I myself haven’t spent much time on a remote island, I did spend four years in high school as a girl. And the savagery in high school rivals, if not surpasses, that of a remote island. In high school the claws come out, island or no island. Girls in high school have got it all: civic disorder, conflicts, and hierarchies, and even violence. I’ve seen a girl get bullied about the flavor of yogurt she brought to lunch. I’ve seen trash cans thrown. I’ve seen screaming, crying fights over which girl gets to hang out with another girl on Friday night. And if these directors think they need an island to bring out this level of savagery, they must not have gone to high school. Besides, movies like this already exist. Ever heard of Mean Girls? Look up the descriptions for Mean Girls versus Lord Of The Flies. The summaries are basically the same. This isn’t an issue of feminism, equality, or living in the bubble that “women aren’t savages.” Yes, women are. It’s just in a different way. We don’t need to debate this on the big screen for an hour and a half. If these directors want real savagery, I suggest they lace up their converse and skinny jeans and march on over to their local high school. It’s guaranteed entertainment for a lot less money. ||||| In an undated interview, the author of the book, William Golding, who died in 1993, said he was often asked why he wrote about boys instead of girls. He said that it was partly because he grew up as one, but that gender was also crucial to the larger point of the novel. “If you land with a group of little boys, they are more like scaled-down society than a group of little girls would be. Don’t ask me why, and this is a terrible thing to say, because I’m going to be chased from hell to breakfast by all the women who talk about equality. This has nothing to do with equality at all. I mean, I think women are foolish to pretend they’re equal to men — they’re far superior and always have been. But one thing you cannot do with them is take a bunch of them and boil them down, so to speak, into a set of little girls who would then become a kind of image of civilization, of society.” Gender reversals in reboots are not new for Hollywood: A “Ghostbusters” with a cast of women was a critical and box office success last year, and women will be the outlaws in the upcoming “Ocean’s 8.” And teenage girls have long been awful to one another on screen, as seen in “Mean Girls” and “Heathers.” What remains to be seen is whether the new “Lord of the Flies” will offer largely a mirror image of the novel, subbing in girls without changing the central plot points and behavior of the characters, or if it will wrestle with how girls would approach their fate differently. “It could be problematic if all they’re doing is switching out girls for boys and saying, ‘Well, girls would do this too,’” said Pamela Davis-Kean, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan who studies children and families. Though many differences between boys and girls tend to be overstated, boys do tend to be more physically aggressive, she said. Some of the novel’s scenes of physical violence probably wouldn’t align with how girls would settle their issues, especially in the era of the book, she said. ||||| Story highlights A remake is planned using girls instead of boys Some don't think its a good idea (CNN) A planned remake of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" reimagined with an all-female cast has stirred controversy. Deadline reported that Scott McGehee and David Siegel will write and direct a new version of \\"Lord Of The Flies,\\" based on the iconic 1954 William Golding novel about a group of boys stranded on a deserted island. Once there, the group tries to govern themselves with disastrous results. Siegel told Deadline the plan is to be faithful to the book, which spawned films in 1963 and 1990, but with a contemporary twist of using girls instead of boys. \\"It is a timeless story that is especially relevant today, with the interpersonal conflicts and bullying, and the idea of children forming a society and replicating the behavior they saw in grownups before they were marooned,\\" he said.

Critics have argued that as the novel is about the violent nature of masculinity, particularly among upper-class boys groomed for dominance, replacing boys with girls will undermine Golding's critique of patriarchal violence. Golding's reasoning was also confused and elliptic. This implies that choosing boys was more an unconscious nod to boy-centric adventure tales than a deliberate intention to critique gender roles. In contrast, Joanna Russ’ We Who Are About To, released in 1977, is a plain-speaking dissection of the intermingling nature of masculinity, colonialism, and death. Civilization is portrayed as being founded on the basis of sexism and violence. Gender-bending stories have increased in popularity with Hollywood recently, though it remains unclear whether the new Lord of the Flies will be a mirror image of the novel or explore how girls might approach their fate differently."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Final closing arguments having been presented, a visibly bored judge instructs the jury to decide whether the boy is guilty of murder. If there is any reasonable doubt of his guilt they are to return a verdict of not guilty. The judge further informs them that a guilty verdict will be accompanied by a mandatory death sentence.The jury retires to a private room, where the jurors spend a short while getting acquainted before they begin deliberating. It is immediately apparent that the jurors have already decided that the boy is guilty, and that they plan to return their verdict without taking time for discussion with the sole exception of Juror 8 (Henry Fonda), who is the only \\"not guilty\\" vote in a preliminary tally. He explains that there is too much at stake for him to go along with the verdict without at least talking about it first. His vote annoys the other jurors, especially Juror 7 (Jack Warden), who has tickets to a baseball game that evening; and Juror 10 (Ed Begley Sr.), who believes that people from slum backgrounds are liars, wild, and dangerous.The rest of the film's focus is the jury's difficulty in reaching a unanimous verdict. While several of the jurors harbor personal prejudices, Juror 8 maintains that the evidence presented in the case is circumstantial, and that the boy deserves a fair deliberation. He calls into question the accuracy and reliability of the only two witnesses to the murder, the \\"rarity\\" of the murder weapon (a common switchblade, of which he has an identical copy), and the overall questionable circumstances. He further argues that he cannot in good conscience vote \\"guilty\\" when he feels there is reasonable doubt of the boy's guilt.Having argued several points and gotten no favorable response from the others, Juror 8 reluctantly agrees that he has only succeeded in hanging the jury.

Information: - Six Wheels On My Wagon is the second album by British electronic music group Fluke, released on 7 October 1993. The title parodies that of the song \\"Three Wheels on My Wagon\\", from the early 1960s. The most prominent track on the album, \\"Slid\\" is featured in the 1993 Phillip Noyce film \\"Sliver\\" as well as being a club favourite of popular DJ Sasha. - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music. - An electronic musical instrument is a musical instrument that produces sound using electronics. Such an instrument sounds by outputting an electrical audio signal that ultimately drives a loudspeaker. - The theremin (originally known as the ætherphone/etherphone, thereminophone or termenvox/thereminvox) is an early electronic musical instrument controlled without physical contact by the thereminist (performer). It is named after the Westernized name of its Russian inventor, Léon Theremin (é), who patented the device in 1928. - Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. - A synthesizer (often abbreviated as synth, also spelled synthesiser) is an electronic musical instrument that generates electric signals that are converted to sound through instrument amplifiers and loudspeakers or headphones. Synthesizers may either imitate instruments like piano, Hammond organ, flute, vocals; natural sounds like ocean waves, etc.; or generate new electronic timbres. They are often played with a musical keyboard, but they can be controlled via a variety of other input devices, including music sequencers, instrument controllers, fingerboards, guitar synthesizers, wind controllers, and electronic drums. Synthesizers without built-in controllers are often called \\"sound modules\\", and are controlled via MIDI or CV/Gate using a controller device, often a MIDI keyboard or other controller. - The Hammond organ is an electric organ, invented by Laurens Hammond and John M. Hanert and first manufactured in 1935. Various models have been produced, most of which use sliding drawbars to create a variety of sounds. Until 1975, Hammond organs generated sound by creating an electric current from rotating a metal tonewheel near an electromagnetic pickup, and then strengthening the signal with an amplifier so that it can drive a speaker cabinet. Around two million Hammond organs have been manufactured. The organ is commonly used with, and associated with, the Leslie speaker. - Phillip Noyce (born 29 April 1950) is an Australian film director. - The Telharmonium (also known as the Dynamophone) was an early electrical organ, developed by Thaddeus Cahill circa 1896 and patented in 1897. The electrical signal from the Telharmonium was transmitted over wires; it was heard on the receiving end by means of \\"horn\\" speakers. - \`\` Slid '' is the sixth single by the English electronic music band Fluke .

The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.

Sentence:","completion":"This data set primarily focuses on the United States, addressing different aspects such as ethnicity, geography, and specific locations within the country. Specifically, the ethnic group highlighted is Native Americans within the United States. Native Americans, also referred to as American Indians, First Americans, or Indigenous Americans, are the pre-Columbian inhabitants of North America, including the contiguous United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. These Indigenous people possess diverse cultures, languages, and histories, and continue to hold a significant presence in contemporary American society, now comprising around 2.9 million people, or roughly 0.9% of the U.S. population. Native Americans contribute to the rich, cultural mosaic of the United States by preserving their heritage, customs, and traditions in various aspects of life, such as art, music, and dance. Regarding geography, the data set mentions Auburn, Washington, a city located in the United States. Auburn, with a population of approximately 81,000 residents, is situated in both King County and Pierce County, in the state of Washington. Historically, the Auburn area was home to Indigenous tribes such as the Skopamish, Smalhkamish, and the Stkamish. These tribes later became part of the Muckleshoot Indian Tribe, which still resides nearby on the Muckleshoot Indian Reservation. Today, the city of Auburn boasts a diverse population, including a small percentage of Native Americans. The city of Auburn is part of the Seattle Tacoma metropolitan area, known for its beautiful landscapes, vibrant cultural scene, and various attractions. Located just 30 miles south of Seattle and 15 miles northeast of Tacoma, Auburn serves as a gateway to Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens, and the Olympic Mountains. In addition to its natural beauty, Auburn offers a range of recreational opportunities, including the White River Valley Museum that preserves and presents the history, including Native American cultures, of the area, Soos Creek Botanical Garden, and the Emerald Downs horse racing track. In conclusion, this data emphasizes the importance of the Native American ethnic group within the United States and particular locations like Auburn, Washington.

Q:Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"which roman god goddess are you?\\" A:","completion":"A possible correct answer to the question \\"Which Roman god/goddess are you?\\" would be: \\"I am most closely aligned with Minerva, the Roman goddess of wisdom, warfare, and the arts.\\" To provide a detailed explanation for this answer, one could consider several aspects of Minerva's symbolism and significance in Roman mythology: 1. Wisdom: Minerva was considered to be the goddess of wisdom, embodying knowledge, intellect, and understanding. If this aspect resonates strongly with you, you might identify with Minerva for her wisdom and ability to comprehend complex subjects and concepts. If you value education, seek continuous learning, and strive to make well-informed decisions, you are likely to have a strong connection with Minerva's wisdom domain. 2. Warfare: Minerva was also known as the goddess of warfare, particularly strategic warfare and defensive tactics. While the association with warfare might seem contradictory to her embodiment of wisdom, it highlights the importance of combining intelligence, strategy, and strength in order to overcome adversity. If you have natural leadership skills and tend to approach challenges with analytical thinking and strategic planning, you might identify with Minerva as the goddess of warfare. 3. The Arts: Minerva was the patron of numerous arts, crafts, and trades, including weaving, painting, sculpture, and metalwork. As such, she represents creativity, innovation, and skill in various forms of artistic expression. If you have a passion for the arts, value self-expression, and possess a creative mind, you likely resonate with Minerva's role as the goddess of the arts. 4. Invention and Industry: As the facilitator of numerous crafts, Minerva was also considered a goddess of invention and industry. She was often depicted with an owl, which symbolizes wisdom and foresight, as well as a shield, symbolizing her protective nature and her role in battles. If you are someone who likes to think outside the box, find innovative solutions to problems, and contribute to progress in society, you might identify with Minerva's attributes related to invention and industry. In conclusion, if you find yourself relating to Minerva's domains of wisdom, warfare, the arts, and invention, you might consider yourself aligned with this Roman goddess. Of course, Roman mythology encompasses a vast and diverse pantheon of gods and goddesses, each with their own unique traits and attributes. The suitability of this answer ultimately depends on how well it reflects your own personal characteristics and values."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

When examining both statements, it is clear that they express the same essential idea - that the problem in question was resolved thanks to McCain's attendance at the lunch as a guest of the United States. The premise states that \\"this problem was quickly resolved when McCain, who was attending the lunch as a guest of U.S.\\" In this sentence, the adverb \\"quickly\\" is used to emphasize the swift resolution of the problem while clearly identifying that McCain's attendance at the lunch as a guest of the U.S. played a role in facilitating the resolution. The hypothesis, on the other hand, says \\"This problem was swiftly resolved when McCain attended the lunch as a guest of U.S.\\" The core meaning of this statement is the same – the problem was resolved on account of McCain's presence at the lunch event. The only difference between the two statements is the choice of adverbs: \\"quickly\\" in the premise and \\"swiftly\\" in the hypothesis.

Barb takes a bite of her sandwich and remarks that the boat she is currently using doesn't have any cavitation. and a hint : Cavitation is, in many cases, an undesirable occurrence. In devices such as propellers and pumps, cavitation causes a great deal of noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency. Cavitation has also become a concern in the renewable energy sector as it may occur on the blade surface of tidal stream turbines.When the cavitation bubbles collapse, they force energetic liquid into very small volumes, thereby creating spots of high temperature and emitting shock waves, the latter of which are a source of noise. The noise created by cavitation is a particular problem for military submarines, as it increases the chances of being detected by passive sonar. Please answer this question : Who would have a harder time going on a long distance trip with their boat?","completion":"Stephanie would have a harder time going on a long distance trip with her boat due to the cavitation issues. Cavitation causes excessive noise, damage to components, vibrations, and a loss of efficiency, all of which can negatively impact the performance and reliability of the boat during a long distance trip.

Q: I have lived in my apartment for 4.5 months now and on move-in I asked my neighbor next to me if there were any problems with bugs. He mentioned that there has been issues with roaches and over the months that I have lived here I have definitely seen it. I also have a BIG fear of roaches, like a full-blown phobia much the same way that people have phobias of spiders or snakes. I can’t even look at photos without feeling panicked of like I need a shower. A couple months into living here I happened to glance inside my neighbor’s apartment and saw a lot of stuff everywhere. I only saw a quick glance so I didn’t get a good look at everything that was there but it got me thinking that that could be where the roaches came from. Flash forward to today, I was frustrated because despite keeping my apartment incredibly clean I have had a significant amount of roaches in my apartment - mainly the kitchen. I called the complex and mentioned my neighbor’s mess and she said she would look into it. I immediately started feeling bad about it because my downstairs neighbor has some sort of mental disability and I’m not sure how capable he is of taking care of his apartment. So, do you guys think I’m an asshole or is mentioning it justified? A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the task - I need to create a suitable title for a social media post describing a complex ethical situation. Step 2: Analyze the provided text - Situation: The person has faced a roach problem in their apartment for 4.5 months. - The person asked their neighbor about the issue; the neighbor mentioned that there were roach problems. - The person has a phobia of roaches and cannot even look at photos of them. - They suspect the neighbor's apartment's mess could be the source of the roach problem. - The neighbor has a mental disability and may not be capable of taking care of the apartment. - The person called the complex but feels bad about it and asks for opinions on whether they are an asshole or not. Step 3: Craft a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. - \\"Roach Phobia and Neighbor's Mess: Was Reporting Justified?\\" Explanation: The title \\"Roach Phobia and Neighbor's Mess: Was Reporting Justified?\\" clearly explains that the main event is the person's fear of roaches and the possible cause of the issue coming from their neighbor's messy apartment. The question in the title intrigues readers to read the post and share their opinions on whether the person is justified in reporting the issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title: On Tuesday, Advanced Micro Devices introduced its two fastest processors yet, a quiet slap at Intel #39;s latest roadmap revision. Title:","completion":"\\"Advanced Micro Devices Launches Its Two Fastest Processors, Challenge to Intel's Recent Roadmap Revision\\" Justifications: 1) The information given talks about a significant event by Advanced Micro Devices — the release of its two fastest processors. Hence, this is the primary point emphasized in the title. 2) It also mentions that this is a 'quiet slap' at Intel and its recent roadmap revision. In a more professional context, this can be interpreted as a challenge. Therefore, the task indicates a competitive relationship between Advanced Micro Devices and Intel which I have reflected in the title. 3) The day \\"Tuesday\\" was not incorporated into the title as it is not standard practice to include specific dates in news title unless it is a significant event by itself. 4) The title avoids using specialized symbols like '#39's'. Symbols often interrupt the flow of reading and may confuse readers. By maintaining clear and simple language, the title is more accessible to a broader audience. 5) Finally, the title is designed to be intriguing and informational, giving enough context about the event while also encouraging readers to click and read more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Coincidentally, his investigation brings him close to his hometown, and he decides to pay his mother a surprise visit before publishing his work and revealing his whereabouts. As Nick makes his way through the quiet suburban streets to his childhood home, he nervously anticipates the emotional reunion with his mother.

As the investigation continues, Nick and Helen reconnect, rediscovering their love and bond. Nick starts to question his own investigation and the possibility that it may have had severe unintended consequences on his personal life. Meanwhile, the police slowly begin to uncover a web of secrets surrounding Nick's disappearance, his undercover investigation, and a dangerous conspiracy that threatens the entire community. While Detective Jones and Detective Murphy close in on the culprits, Nick convinces himself that his mother's safety and the community's wellbeing are more important than his career-defining story. Nick reluctantly chooses to reveal the information he had learned during his undercover investigation to the detectives, and in doing so, he puts himself and his mother in grave danger. As the dark truths surrounding the secrecy, corruption, and family values are brought to light, Nick and Helen must rely on each other and their community for protection. Through a thrilling series of twists and turns, it becomes evident that everyone in the community is interconnected, and their loyalties are tested. In the end, they discover that the real power behind the evil operation is someone they least expected, putting them in a race against time to expose and stop them before their sinister plan is complete. As the movie concludes, Nick, Helen, and the community come together, emerging stronger and more united than ever.

Plot title: The Long Good Friday Movie plot: Harold Shand is the ruling kingpin of the London underworld and is trying to convince the American mafia to go into partnership with him, with plans to redevelop the London Docklands, including building a casino. However, his world is suddenly destabilised by a series of unexplained murders (including Harold's best friend, Colin) and exploding bombs from an unknown foe. He and his henchmen try to uncover his attackers' identity whilst simultaneously trying not to worry their American visitors, who Harold believes will not go into business with him if they think he's not in full control of his affairs. The situation worsens when a pub in which they are about to have dinner at is blown up and Harold's partner, Victoria, tells the Americans that they are under attack from an unknown enemy. She suspects that Harold's right hand man, Jeff, knows more than he has been letting on about the attacks, while Jeff simultaneously starts to fear that Harold might be onto him and tries to prevent people from talking through intimidation. After some detective work, Harold confronts Jeff, who confesses that he sent Harold's friend Colin on a job to Belfast to deliver money raised by Irish Navvies (construction workers) to the IRA. When Harold discovers Jeff accepted a job to deliver funds to the IRA, he becomes extremely angry and vows to destroy the IRA in London.

Write some highlights for the following article: More than 160 people have been arrested in connection with the massacre earlier this month of scores of people in central Nigeria, a national police spokesman told CNN Monday. Of the 163 arrested, 41 will be charged with homicide, said spokesman Emmanuel Ojukwu. The other 122 will be charged with rioting, arson and possession of firearms, he said. More than 200 people died in the March 7 massacre, according to some estimates. They took place in predominately Christian towns near the city of Jos, where about 150 people, mostly Muslims, were reported killed in January. The region lies on a faith-based fault line between Muslim-dominated northern Nigeria and the mainly Christian south. Ojukwu said the ethnic backgrounds of those arrested are mixed, but they are all from the area near Jos. Human Rights Watch said the attacks by Muslims with guns, machetes and knives apparently were in retaliation for the previous attacks against Islamic communities and the theft of cattle from herdsmen. Last week, at least 11 more people were killed in a predominantly Christian village. Choji Gyang, special adviser on religious affairs to the governor of the Nigerian state of Plateau, has said the attackers were Muslim herdsmen, some dressed in military uniforms. They also stole about 120 cattle from the village, he said. The violence has put much of oil-rich Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, on edge. Authorities in Lagos took the unusual step of sending a text message to residents earlier this month to try to put them at ease. The violence often pits Christians and Muslims against each other. But John Onaiyekan, Roman Catholic archbishop of Abuja, Nigeria, and former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo have said that the violence is fueled more by other factors: ethnic, social and economic problems. \\"If you have one group or a community that has land that's been encroached upon by another community or even by itinerant cattle farmers, then the people who lay claim to the land will fight back,\\" Obasanjo recently told CNN. \\"If there are job opportunities in an area, and persons believe they are indigenous to that area, and (are) not getting enough out of the jobs that are available, they will fight those who are getting the jobs.\\" Highlights:","completion":"1.

Why so much emphasis on Illuminati and the New World Order? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information. Both questions are asking for an explanation on the emphasis and hype surrounding the Illuminati and the New World Order. Here is an analysis of these concepts and the hype surrounding them: 1. Background: The Illuminati is a term often used to describe a secret society or group of individuals believed to possess significant influence in global affairs. The New World Order is a conspiracy theory that suggests a secretive and powerful elite group aims to control and govern the world under a unified and authoritarian regime. These concepts often intertwine in various conspiracy theories. 2. Popularity: The reason for the emphasis and hype around the Illuminati and the New World Order can be attributed to their widespread presence in pop culture and social media. Movies, books, music, and other forms of entertainment have contributed to spreading these theories and keeping them relevant. 3. Human nature: People are often intrigued by the idea of secret organizations and mysterious forces controlling world events. This fascination stems from our natural curiosity and the desire to make sense of complex global issues. 4. Distrust and uncertainty: In times of socio-political turmoil, economic crises, or other large-scale events, people may feel overwhelmed and afraid. Conspiracy theories like the Illuminati and the New World Order provide a narrative that can help individuals make sense of their fears and uncertainties by assigning a scapegoat for global problems. 5. Internet and social media: The easy dissemination of information – including misinformation – has led to more people being exposed to these theories. This accessibility allows conspiracy theories to spread quickly and widely, fueling the hype surrounding them. In conclusion, both questions are asking for information on why the Illuminati and the New World Order receive significant attention and notoriety. The reasons behind the hype include their presence in popular culture, human curiosity, socio-political uncertainties, and the proliferation of information via the internet and social media."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out. It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs. Question: In the next part, the author would most probably further explain _ .

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 g/cm3). The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is: 2Li(s) + 2H 2 O(l) ⟶ 2LiOH(aq) + H 2(g).

If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4).

Write an article using the following points: Israel plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1, or E1, zone in the West Bank. Comes after the U.N. voted to grant Palestine non-member observer status. Palestinians believe construction here would essentially cut the West Bank in half. Group: Currently 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, with about 325,000 inhabitants.","completion":"Title: Israel's Plans to Construct Settlements in the E1 Zone Raise Concerns over the West Bank's Future Introduction: The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has taken a new turn as Israel plans to begin construction of settlements in the East 1 (E1) zone in the West Bank. This development arises amidst the United Nations' recent decision to grant Palestine non-member observer status, thereby signaling a significant change in the dynamics between the two nations. Paragraph 1: Background on Israeli Settlements in the West Bank Currently, there are 137 Israeli settlements in the West Bank, housing approximately 325,000 inhabitants. These settlements have long been a contentious issue between Israel and Palestine, as Palestinians argue that they infringe on their territory and disrupt the possibility of a contiguous, independent Palestinian state. The international community has also expressed deep concerns about the expansion of settlements, with many countries deeming them illegal under international law. Paragraph 2: The Importance of the E1 Zone The E1 zone is a strategically significant area in the West Bank, lying adjacent to Jerusalem and stretching from the western edge of the city to the outskirts of Jericho. Palestinians express their fears that Israel's construction plans in the E1 zone would effectively cut the West Bank in half, isolating East Jerusalem – the intended capital of a future Palestinian state – and rendering the prospect of a territorially intact Palestinian state virtually impossible. Paragraph 3: Implications of the U.N.'s Decision to Grant Palestine Non-Member Observer Status The United Nations' decision to confer non-member observer status upon Palestine signifies an important shift in international recognition of the Palestinian plight, paving the way for greater influence and standing within the global community. Although this upgraded status falls short of full membership, it enables Palestine to participate more actively in U.N. debates and to join various U.N. agencies and treaties. Paragraph 4: Potential Consequences of Israeli Settlement Expansion in the E1 Zone The construction of settlements in the E1 zone is expected to further destabilize the already fragile relationship between Israel and Palestine. If Israel proceeds with its plans, it will likely provoke outrage from Palestinians, the United Nations, and international powers that have been advocating a two-state solution. Ramifications may include escalated tensions, deteriorating regional stability, and the diminishing possibility for peaceful reconciliation between the two nations. Conclusion: In light of these potential consequences, the international community is likely to keep a watchful eye on Israel's actions regarding the E1 zone, hoping that both parties can find a path towards a sustainable resolution to the longstanding territorial dispute. With the U.N.'s recent recognition of Palestine's non-member observer status, there is an opportunity for fruitful dialogue and negotiation – but only if both sides are willing to engage productively and in good faith."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the Sahara, and how do the average temperatures there compare to the ones in the Syrian Desert? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Select from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"The Sahara is the world's largest hot desert, encompassing most of Northern Africa. It spans over 9.2 million square kilometers (3.6 million square miles) and occupies roughly 31% of Africa's total area. The Sahara's landscape includes varied topography such as sand dunes, sand seas, vast stretches of flat rocky terrain, rocky plateaus, mountains, and dry valleys. Some of its iconic features include the Erg Chebbi and Erg Chigaga sand sea in Morocco, the Ténéré Desert in Niger, and the Tibesti Mountains along the border between Chad and Libya. The Sahara's climate alternates between extreme heat and cold, with extremely hot temperatures during the day and substantially cooler temperatures at night. The region gets very little rainfall as well, with annual precipitation amounts typically less than 100mm (4 inches). The Sonoran Desert, on the other hand, is located in North America, spanning parts of the Southwestern United States and Northwestern Mexico. It covers a total area of about 260,000 square kilometers (100,000 square miles). The Sonoran Desert is characterized by its unique flora and fauna, including the iconic saguaro cactus and the Joshua tree. This desert area experiences a subtropical desert climate, with relatively warm winters and scorching hot summers. Rainfall mainly occurs during the summer months. Now let's compare the average temperatures of the Sahara and the Sonoran Desert. In the Sahara, the daytime temperatures during the hottest months can reach up to 47°C (116.6°F) or higher, while at night they can fall as low as 3-7°C (37-44°F). It is important to note that winter nights can be cold with temperatures dropping to below freezing. On the other hand, the Sonoran Desert's average high temperature in the summer is typically around 40°C (104°F), with the night temperatures ranging from 20-25°C (68-77°F). In general, the Sahara experiences more extreme temperature fluctuations than the Sonoran Desert. As for the second question, the Syrian Desert, also called the Syrian Steppe, is a region in the Middle East, covering parts of modern-day Iraq, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria, with an area of about 520,000 square kilometers (200,000 square miles). It consists of a combination of arid steppe and true desert, characterized by its gravelly terrain with occasional sand dunes and a semi-arid climate. Temperature-wise, the Syrian Desert experiences very hot, dry summers and cold, relatively wetter winters. The average high temperatures in the summer months can reach up to 40°C (104°F), while nighttime lows are approximately 20-25°C (68-77°F). In conclusion, the questions are not paraphrases of each other as the regions being compared differ. The first question seeks a comparison between the Sahara and the Sonoran Desert, while the second question requests a comparison between the Sahara and the Syrian Desert.

The type of fennel you choose to grow will depend on what part of the fennel plant you wish to use -- the bulb, the fronds or the seeds. Florence Fennel is grown for its bulbous stem, which can be eaten raw, grilled or baked. It is also possible to eat the thicker stalks which sprout from the bulb, as they are similar to celery. Herb fennel does not produce the same bulbous stem. It is grown for its delicate leaves, which are used as a herb. Herb fennel also produces seeds which have a licorice-like flavor (as does the rest of the plant) and are used for seasoning. The process for planting both varieties of fennel is the same. The seeds should be planted directly into the garden, around the time of the last spring frost. Plant the fennel seeds in fertile, well drained soil. If necessary, loosen the soil a little before planting and add in some compost and a little soil for drainage. Plant the seeds approximately ten inches apart and cover them with a light layer of soil, about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) deep. It's probably a good idea to plant a few more seeds than you need, then thin them out later. Plant the fennel far away from any dill or coriander -- these plants tend to cross-pollinate, which reduces seed production and affects the taste. You can use an almanac to determine when the last frost typically occurs in your area. If you prefer, you can plant the fennel seeds in containers approximately 4 weeks before the last spring frost. Once the seedlings have grown to height of 3 or 4 inches (7.6 or 10.2 cm), you can harden them off in a cool greenhouse or cold frame before transplanting them to the garden. Alternatively, you can keep the fennel in a container. As fennel is a deep-rooted plant, it will require a container at last 12 inches (30.5 cm) deep, filled with light soil with some added gravel for drainage. If you plant more than one fennel plant in a container of this size, it will be too crowded to produce a large bulb, but you will still be able to enjoy the leaves and seeds. Fennel grows best in full-sun. At first, you should water it regularly to keep the soil moist. Once it has established itself, you may only need to water it if there is a drought. Be careful not to overwater, as this may cause the roots to rot. There is no need to fertilize the soil during growing season. Once the bulb begins to form at the base of the stem, hill up the surrounding soil to cover it. This shades it from the sun and prevents it from turning green. This is known as \\"blanching\\", as it keeps the bulb white and sweet (which is only necessary if you intend to eat the bulb). Fennel is not usually affected by pests or disease, but occasionally you will spot aphids or whiteflies on the leaves. If so, you can use a pyrethrin-based insecticidal soap to get rid of them.","completion":"Fennel can be grown for its bulb, fronds, or seeds, and to enjoy all parts, plant the right type of fennel in well-drained soil with sunlight and watering without overdoing it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. This question has options. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How can I calculate how much water my plant will need during my vacation? Select from the following. - Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per day.; - Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per week.;","completion":"To calculate how much water your plant will need during your vacation, you have two options to consider, depending on whether the plant requires watering daily or weekly. Here's a detailed explanation of each option. Option 1: Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per day. If your plant needs daily watering, you should follow this approach. First, you'll need to determine the amount of water your plant requires each day. The daily water requirement may vary according to the plant species, pot size, local climate, and other factors. You can find this information in a plant care guide, by consulting with a plant specialist, or by observing the plant's condition over time. Once you know the daily water requirement, follow these steps: 1. Determine the length of your vacation - the number of days you will be gone. 2. Multiply the number of days by the daily water requirement of your plant. This will give you the total amount of water needed by your plant during your vacation. 3. To ensure adequate watering, you may want to use self-watering devices, a drip irrigation system, or ask a friend or neighbor to water your plant on a daily basis, following the calculated daily water requirement. Option 2: Multiply the number of days you will be gone by the amount of water needed by the plant per week. If your plant needs watering on a weekly basis, use this option. In this case, you should determine the amount of water the plant requires each week. This may depend on the plant species, soil type, pot size, local environment, among other factors. Check a plant care guide or consult with an expert to get accurate information on your plant's weekly water requirement. Once you determine the weekly water requirement, follow these steps: 1. Calculate the length of your vacation - the number of days you will be gone. 2. Convert the length of your vacation from days to weeks. If the number of days is not a multiple of 7, round up to the nearest week. For example, if you'll be gone for 10 days, convert this to 2 weeks. 3. Multiply the weekly water requirement by the number of weeks, to get the total amount of water needed during your vacation. 4. Since the plant requires water on a weekly basis, you can consider using a self-watering device or an irrigation system that you can set to release the calculated amount of water each week. Alternatively, you might ask a friend or neighbor to water the plant on a weekly basis, following the determined weekly water requirement. By considering the plant's unique water requirements and the length of your vacation, you can choose the most appropriate method to ensure your plant receives the necessary care and sustenance during your absence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the name of the magazine that Murli resigns from being the editor of? Movie title: Dostana Movie plot: Dostana is a story about two guys, Sameer Acharya (Abhishek Bachchan) who is a doctor and Kunal Chauhan (John Abraham), a photographer. They bumped into each other while looking for an agreement to rent, and confusion headed towards the same bungalow. However, they were both thrown out because the owner wants to re-rent the apartment to girls only, since niece, Neha Melwani (Priyanka Chopra) stays in second apartment alone. Sameer gets the idea (when a US Soldier, who is a gay, tells them about missing his life partner) that if Kunal and he pretend to be gay lovers, then the owner will agree to let them stay. Kunal initially refuses, but agrees out of desperation. Their plan works and they move in. Over a period of time Neha, Kunal, and Sameer become good friends, hanging out together and developing a good relationship as housemates.One day Neha's boss 'M', short for Murli (Boman Irani) announces that he is resigning from his job as the editor of the magazine called 'Verve' and will also decide who should take his position. In order to impress her editor and get the job, Neha invites 'M' for dinner at her house telling him that she will introduce him to her gay friends. The evening turns out to be a comedy one. But Sameer's mother finds out that her son might be gay and is not pleased. Next day at Neha's office M announces that Abhimanyu Singh (Bobby Deol) will be the new editor. Neha, heartbroken returns home where she is consoled by Sameer's mother. Kunal and Sameer, then help Neha with her on a film project, given to her by Abhimanyu.While Kunal is out of the film for a few days, Sameer takes Neha to supporting role, and they share a film. Later, at a shop, Sameer tries to tell Neha that he acts her in second scene and that he's straight through a fitting room door, but it turns out Kunal was behind that door and heard everything . Murli becomes angry with Sameer and states that he also marry him. As they try to figure out what to do be gay, Kunal suggests that they should both take Neha out to this great... A:","completion":"The magazine that Murli resigns from being the editor of in the movie Dostana is called 'Verve.' This information is quintessential to the plot because it shapes Neha's professional ambitions and affects her relationships with Sameer and Kunal. Murli's resignation leads to a chain of events that further complicate the dynamics between the housemates. After Murli's resignation, the position of editor becomes vacant at 'Verve,' setting in motion Neha's desire to fill this position. However, Murli is not only resigning but also choosing his replacement, adding an extra layer of complexity to the situation. To impress Murli and get the job, Neha devises a plan to introduce him to her supposed gay friends, Sameer and Kunal. But despite her efforts, Murli chooses none other than Abhimanyu Singh, played by Bobby Deol, as the new editor of 'Verve.' This situation at the 'Verve' ends up becoming a pivotal point for Neha, Sameer, and Kunal's relationship and their respective future trajectories. It forces everyone, especially Sameer and Kunal, into helping Neha success on a film project given to her by new editor Abhimanyu. It also leads to Sameer's unexpected confession to Kunal about his true feelings for Neha and the fact that he's not really gay. The decision Murli makes regarding the position of the editor at 'Verve' is the inception of the conflict that drives the rest of the film's plot. So, in essence, Murli resigning from his position at 'Verve' is a critical plot element in the movie Dostana. This stroke of fate seems to bring Sameer, Kunal, and Neha closer but also imposes challenges in their personal and professional lives. With finesse and humor, the movie explores same-sex relationships, friendship, and love using 'Verve' as a metaphorical backdrop."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Mittlerweile habe ich schon die zweite Staffel im Regal stehen :) Jeannie ist einfach (ungewollt) komisch und lässt ihren Meister Anthony ständig in urwitzige Situationen hinein stolpern, so dass er den armen Dr. Bellows fast um den Verstand bringt. Langsam aber sicher war mir spätestens nach drei Folgen wieder bewusst, warum ich diese Serie als Kind so gern hatte! Ich denke, ich werde nicht eher Ruhe finden, bis ich alle Staffeln durch habe ;) Man sieht zwar deutlich, dass die erste Staffel in schwarz-weiß gedreht und später nachcoloriert wurde, aber das ist - für mich - zu verschmerzen. Viele der Folgen wirken halbwegs natürlich, nur ein paar wenige sind doch arg bunt geraten. Aber was soll's. Von mir gibt's dafür keinen Punktabzug! Bei 2 oder 3 Folgen ist mir an den Bildqualität ein Griseln aufgefallen. Es war nicht wirklich tragisch, aber im Vergleich zu den übrigen Folgen ist es halt aufgefallen. Die Box an sich ist optisch allein schon sehr hübsch gemacht, vor allem mit den reliefartigen Erhebungen vorn. Der Digipack ist von der Qualität her ebenfalls sehr gut. Dass sowohl die Originalsprachfassung als auch noch neben der deutschen Synchro (meistens) die französische und italienische Sprachfassung dabei ist, ist ebenfalls ein Pluspunkt. Ein ganz großes Lob gibt es von mir noch für die absolut genialen Extras! Sind zwar nicht viele, aber dafür sind sie klasse! Was soll ich noch sagen? Ich LIEBE Jeannie und ich LIEBE Anthony! :D Eine wirklich wunderschöne und witzige Serie! Mein Fazit: 5 Sterne A:","completion":"POS"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here's what you need: 1. A big cucumber 2. A pitcher (A big container to hold about 8 cups of water) 3. Water 4. Ice And now, let's get to the fun part - making Spa Water! Step 1: Peel and slice the cucumber First, ask an adult to help you with this part. Grown-ups are great at cutting things and keeping you safe! They will peel the cucumber using a peeler, take the green skin off, and then slice it into thin circle pieces. Step 2: Fill the pitcher with water, cucumber, and ice Now, you need a pitcher that holds about 2 quarts (1.9 liters) or 8 cups of water. If you don't know how big that is, ask an adult to help you find the right one. When you have the pitcher, fill it with water, and then ask your adult assistant to add the cucumber slices and some ice. Step 3: Let the water mixture sit Now, here's the hardest part: waiting! Yes, you have to give the water some time to become friends with the cucumber and ice. This is called \\"infusing,\\" which means the cucumber gets to share its yummy flavor with the water.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: How to identify signs of dementia<br>Know the general symptoms. [substeps] Memory loss is the first and earliest sign of dementia. It is, however, more than just forgetting where you put your keys. Hypothesis: A doctor alone can identify dementia.","completion":"In order to formulate an hypothesis, let's break this prompt down. The provided context is about identifying the signs of dementia, and it mentions that memory loss is the first and earliest sign of this condition. However, it doesn't provide explicit information about who can identify these signs or whether it specifically requires a doctor. Here's the step-by-step analysis: 1. The context informs the reader about one can identify signs of dementia, successfully educating them on one of the early symptoms - memory loss. This evokes an understanding that a general individual with this awareness could potentially identify signs of dementia in a preliminary stage. 2. The context doesn't specify the involvement or necessity of a doctor in identifying dementia. Therefore, mentioning the need for a doctor to identify dementia would be an assumption, as it was not explicitly stated. 3. It's also important to recognize that while the context provides one sign of dementia (memory loss), it doesn't encompass all symptoms or stages of the condition. A full diagnosis typically requires a comprehensive examination by a healthcare professional. This, however, is an understanding we gain from outside the context provided as it isn't mentioned within the given text. So, based on the provided context, the hypothesis \\"A doctor alone can identify dementia\\" can't be clearly drawn. There's no mention in the text indicating that only a doctor can identify dementia. For a more accurate hypothesis, we would need additional data or context that specifically connects the identification of dementia to a doctor's expertise. Therefore, the hypothesis could be incorrect or too narrow based on the given context. One could, nonetheless, infer that a doctor is necessary for a comprehensive diagnosis, but that's not explicitly stated in the context provided."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Thousands of students, from all around the world, have helped their international careers by taking EIS English studies at South Thames College London - STCL.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is Green Climate Fund? Is global warming a hoax? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"First, let's address the question: \\"What is Green Climate Fund?\\" Step 1: Understanding the question and context In this case, the user is asking for information regarding the Green Climate Fund. This question is not ambiguous, and it intends to get an explanation of what the Green Climate Fund is. Step 2: Research To provide an accurate answer, I will search for reliable information from authoritative and credible sources about the Green Climate Fund. Step 3: Formulating a response based on research The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a financial mechanism established in 2010 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The fund aims to mobilize and allocate resources, both public and private, to support projects and programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase climate resilience, and promote low-emission development. Now, let's address the second question: \\"Is global warming a hoax?\\" Step 1: Understanding the question and context The user is inquiring about the validity of global warming, questioning whether it is factual or a hoax. The question implies skepticism and requires clarification on the issue. Step 2: Research To answer this question, I will gather evidence from reputable scientific sources on the topic of global warming, such as peer-reviewed studies, assessments by climate scientists, and reports from organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Step 3: Formulating a response based on research The overwhelming scientific consensus is that global warming is not a hoax. Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due primarily to the build-up of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, from human activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation. This consensus is supported by extensive research and the findings of the vast majority of climate scientists and well-regarded scientific organizations around the world, including the IPCC. Finally, let's address whether these two questions are paraphrases of each other. The two questions: 1. What is Green Climate Fund? 2. Is global warming a hoax? These questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they are inquiring about different topics. The first question seeks information on the Green Climate Fund, which is a mechanism related to climate finance. The second question concerns the validity of global warming, which is a phenomenon driven primarily by human activity. While they are both related to the broader context of climate change, they are not rephrased versions of the same inquiry."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Please answer the following question: Question: Why is Mike left in charge of the store? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Be Kind Rewind Context: BE KIND REWIND is the name of a quaint, little video store that carries VHS titles only because the owner (Danny Glover) can't afford to upgrade to DVD films. It's a small shop set in the middle of a crumbling, poverty stricken neighborhood, made up mostly of minorities. The film stars Jack Black as Jerry, a junkyard worker who magnetizes his brain while trying to sabotage a power plant that he thinks is responsible for his constant headaches. Rapper Mos Def plays Mike, his best friend and the only employee of the video store. The store's owner (Danny Glover) goes on 'vacation' (to spy on a huge franchise video chain), leaving Mike in charge with strict instructions not to let Jerry inside. Of course, Jerry gets in anyway and manages to 'magnetize' all of the VHS movies and wipe them clean. Soon Mike and Jerry are shooting their own versions of classic films like GHOSTBUSTERS and the RUSH HOUR movies with a camcorder, laughably bad 'special effects' and using neighborhood folks in small roles. Unexpectedly, their movie versions (which are referred to as SWEDED becuase Jerry charges 20 bucks to rent a movie, claiming that they are Swedish Imports), become so popular that the small store (facing foreclosure) is actually making money. They begin taking custom orders for movies and end up filming SWEDED versions of THE LION KING, DRIVING MISS DAISY, ROBOCOP and more. Soon, however; they attract the attention of the Feds, who inform them they are breaking the law (of course) and that they must cease and desist. What will they do to save the store now? They make an original film about the history of the city and about a 'famous' musician who was born and raised there. They charge admission and the whole neighborhood comes out to see the film, making them a small profit that still won't save the place from demolition. But a tough, city councilman has a change of heart, in the end after seeing the outpouring of neighborhood support. A:","completion":"Mike is left in charge of the store because the owner (Danny Glover) goes on 'vacation' (to spy on a huge franchise video chain).

Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\\" For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones.

Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Common causes of heat exhaustion include:[1] Hot, sunny, humid weather Physical exertion, especially in hot, humid weather Due to impaired thermoregulation, elderly people and infants can get serious heat illness even at rest, if the weather outside is hot and humid, and they are not getting enough cool air. Some drugs, such as diuretics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, alcohol, ecstasy, and amphetamines can cause an increase in the risk of heat exhaustion.[2] Especially during physical exertion, risk factors for heat exhaustion include:[1] Wearing dark, padded, or insulated clothing; hats; and/or helmets (for example, football pads or turnout gear) Having a higher percentage of body fat Dehydration Fever Some medications, like beta blockers and antipsychotic medicines[2] Two groups of people were out in the sunny, humid weather of Illinois. Group One wore black clothes and helmets, and Group Two wore white, light clothing. Both groups were comprised of people of all ages and fitness levels and exercised in the sun for an hour. Which group had fewer inebriated people experiencing heat illness? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information and risk factors for heat exhaustion, it can be inferred that Group Two would likely have fewer inebriated people experiencing heat illness. Group Two wore white, light clothing, which would help reflect sunlight and allow for better moisture evaporation to cool their bodies down. Light clothing is more breathable and will not trap heat as dark, padded, or insulated clothing would. Therefore, Group Two would experience less heat buildup in their bodies due to their choice of clothing. In contrast, Group One wore black clothes and helmets, which increase the risk of heat exhaustion. Dark clothing absorbs more heat from sunlight, causing the body to heat up faster. Helmets, while providing vital protection in specific situations, can also trap heat around the head and prevent the body from cooling down effectively. Moreover, physical exertion in hot, humid weather contributes to the risk of heat exhaustion for both groups. People who are inebriated can have impaired judgment and may no longer be able to recognize early signs of heat exhaustion accurately. Alcohol is also a diuretic, causing people to lose more water through urine, which can contribute to dehydration. Dehydration is one of the risk factors for heat exhaustion. While both groups exercised in the sun for an hour, Group Two's choice of wearing light clothing would have provided them with some level of protection against heat illness. Therefore, Group Two would likely have fewer inebriated people experiencing heat illness compared to Group One. It is essential to note that the specific number of inebriated people experiencing heat illness can't be determined without additional information and data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. In the south, one effect to the development of the oil industry might be _ . A) a large reduction on unemployment B) a growth in the tourist industry C) a reduction in the number of existing industries D) the development of a number of service industries A:","completion":"C) a reduction in the number of existing industries"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it. Question: How long has the author been writing an art blog?

Article: People and the sources of air pollution are found in the same places. This means that cities with large populations have the biggest problem of dirty air. Air pollution is caused by many different things. A major source of air pollution is the gas fumes from cars. Statistics show that 93 percent of all auto trips are within cities. Another major source of dirty air is the burning of coal and oil for energy. This energy is needed to make electricity. Of course, much more electricity is used in the city than in the country. On the average, we throw away more trash and garbage than the year before. The burning of garbage contributes to air pollution. Many major industries are also responsible for the dirty air in the around cities. The fumes from iron, steel, chemical, and petroleum production add particles to the air. The effects of air pollution range from mild headaches to death. The levels of pollution found in heavy for traffic may cause headaches for loss of clear vision.

Article:The transfer took place on Sunday. Rights groups had raised concerns that some 200 Sri Lankans may have been handed over, including Tamils who say they face persecution at home. The government has not commented on other possible cases, but says everyone was subject to \\"enhanced screening\\" to ensure compliance with Australia's international obligations. This is the first time the government has confirmed it has intercepted people at sea, screened them and returned them to their country of origin. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged on Monday that a boat-load of 41 people had been handed back to Sri Lanka, while not commenting on the fate of a second boat reportedly carrying about 150 people. He said they were transferred at sea just outside the Sri Lankan port of Batticaloa on Sunday. \\"All persons intercepted and returned were subjected to an enhanced screening process,\\" he said. The government says only four of those returned on Sunday were Tamils. Mr Morrison added that only one person may have had a case for asylum but he opted to return voluntarily with the rest of the passengers. Sri Lankan officials said the group would be taken to the port of Galle and handed over to police to be investigated. Last week the UN refugee agency UNHCR had expressed \\"profound concern\\" about the reported situation. \\"Requests for international protection should be considered within the territory of the intercepting state, consistent with fundamental refugee protection principles,\\" it said. \\"International law prescribes that no individual can be returned involuntarily to a country in which he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution.\\" Richard Marles, Australia's shadow minister for immigration, questioned the operation. \\"Australia's international obligations are reliant upon a credible processing system and we have deep concerns about how that could have been performed by video link at sea in a way which gave an individual assessment, when all the time the boat was steaming towards Sri Lanka,\\" he said. Sri Lanka has been under heavy international pressure over alleged human rights violations during the final phase of the war against Tamil separatists which ended in 2009. Rights groups say Tamils still face violence at the hands of the military. The fate of those on a second boat reportedly detained remains unclear. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young urged the government to \\"start being up front with what's happening to them and what their fate will be\\". The Australian government has been criticised for imposing what campaigners call a culture of secrecy around asylum, by refusing to comment on operations. Australia has been taking a tough approach to asylum seekers who try to reach the country by perilous sea journeys. Under current policy, asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent to detention camps in Papua New Guinea (PNG) or Nauru. If found to be refugees, they will be resettled there, not in Australia. Australia says its asylum policy - which is also widely believed to involve towing boats back to Indonesian waters - is aimed at saving lives. It is also facing tough questions over its offshore processing policy. The UN and rights groups have condemned conditions in its camps in PNG and Nauru. Investigations are continuing into the death of one asylum seeker in violence at the PNG camp. He is believed to have been beaten to death by a 10-person mob comprising camp guards and PNG locals. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"This article discusses the controversy around an instance where the Australian government intercepted a boat of asylum seekers and returned them to their country of origin, Sri Lanka. This action marked the first time the government confirmed such an operation, with the transfer taking place on Sunday. Among the 41 people returned, only four were Tamils, despite concerns raised by rights groups regarding the potential return of 200 Sri Lankans, including persecuted Tamils. This move of the government sparked criticism, with UNHCR showing \\"profound concern\\" and Richard Marles, Australia's shadow minister for immigration, questioning the credibility of the processing system. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged that an enhanced screening process was conducted and maintained only one person might have had a valid asylum case, who opted to return voluntarily.

Furthermore, Australia's refusal to comment on asylum operations has led critics to accuse the government of fostering a 'culture of secrecy'. This incident takes place against a backdrop of Sri Lanka facing global pressure over purported human rights violations towards Tamil separatists during the war that concluded in 2009, with claims that Tamils continue to face violence from the military.

Lindsay Dee Lohan (born July 2, 1986) is an American actress, businesswoman, fashion designer and singer. Born and raised in New York, Lohan was signed to Ford Models as a child. Having appeared as a regular on Another World at age 10, her breakthrough came in Disney Pictures' The Parent Trap (1998). Lindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, in The Bronx borough of New York City, and grew up in Merrick and Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, New York. She is the eldest child of Dina and Michael Lohan. Her father, a former Wall Street trader, has been in trouble with the law on several occasions, while her mother is a former singer and dancer. Lohan has three younger siblings, all of whom have been models or actors: Michael, Jr., who appeared with Lohan in The Parent Trap, Aliana, known as \\"Ali,\\" and Dakota \\"Cody\\" Lohan. Lohan is of Irish and Italian heritage, and she was raised as a Catholic. Her maternal antecedents were \\"well known Irish Catholic stalwarts\\" and her great-grandfather, John L. Sullivan, was a co-founder of the Pro-life Party in Long Island. Lohan attended Cold Spring Harbor High School and Sanford H. Calhoun High School, where she did well in science and mathematics, until grade 11, when she started homeschooling. Lohan is a natural red head. Lohan's parents have a turbulent history. They married in 1985, separated when Lindsay was three, and later reunited. They separated again in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2007. Lohan began her career as a child model with Ford Models at the age of three. She modeled for Calvin Klein Kids and Abercrombie, and appeared in over 60 television commercials for brands like Pizza Hut and Wendy's, as well as a Jell-O spot with Bill Cosby. By the age of 10, when Lohan played Alexandra \\"Alli\\" Fowler in the television soap opera Another World, Soap Opera Magazine said she was already considered a show-business veteran. Lohan returned to Disney in 2005, starring in the comedy Herbie: Fully Loaded, the fifth film in the series with the anthropomorphic car Herbie. Fully Loaded earned 144 million worldwide, but it received mixed reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Lohan \\"a genuine star who ... seems completely at home on the screen\\", while James Berardinelli wrote that \\"as bright a starlet as she may be, Lohan ends up playing second fiddle to the car.\\" While shooting the film in 2004, Lohan was hospitalized with a kidney infection brought on by stress in her personal life and from recording her first album while the film was in production, prompting Vanity Fair to label it Lohan's \\"first disastrous shoot.\\" She also guest-starred in an episode of That '70s Show, of whose cast Wilmer Valderrama, her boyfriend at the time, was a regular member. According to Vanity Fair, the breakup with Valderrama contributed to Lohan's issues during the Herbie shoot. In 2005, Lohan became the first person to have a My Scene celebrity doll released by Mattel. She also voiced herself in the animated direct-to-DVD film My Scene Goes Hollywood: The Movie, based on the series of dolls. Following Mean Girls, Lohan spent several years living out of hotels in Los Angeles, of which two years were spent at the infamous Chateau Marmont, where comedy actor John Belushi had died. In late 2007, after settling down in a more permanent residence, she explained that she \\"didn't want to be alone\\" but that \\"it wasn't a way of life ... not very consistent.\\" She had a series of car accidents that were widely reported, in August 2004, October 2005, and November 2006, when she suffered minor injuries because a paparazzo who was following her for a photograph hit her car. Lohan's next widely released film, the romantic comedy Just My Luck, opened in May 2006 and, according to Variety, earned her over 7 million. The opening weekend box office takings of 5.7 million \\"broke lead actress Lindsay Lohan's winning streak\\" according to Brandon Gray. The film received poor reviews and earned Lohan her first Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Actress. Following Just My Luck, Lohan focused on smaller roles in more mature, independent movies. Robert Altman's ensemble comedy A Prairie Home Companion, based on humorist Garrison Keillor's works, in which Lohan co-stars with Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, had a limited release in June 2006. Peter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone that \\"Lohan rises to the occasion, delivering a rock-the-house version of 'Frankie and Johnny.'\\" Co-star Streep said of Lohan's acting: \\"She's in command of the art form\\" and \\"completely, visibly living in front of the camera.\\" The Emilio Estevez ensemble drama Bobby, about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination, was released in theaters in November 2006. Lohan received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Sharon Stone. As part of the Bobby ensemble cast, Lohan was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2006, Lohan attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The 8-part docu-series Lindsay was transmitted in March and April 2014 on Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable network. The series followed Lohan's life and work as she moved to New York City after leaving rehab. In the final episode, Lohan said that she had had a miscarriage which had interrupted filming of the series. The premiere had 693,000 viewers, described as \\"so-so\\" by The Hollywood Reporter. The ratings then slipped and the finale only had 406,000 viewers. New York Daily News called the series \\"surprisingly routine,\\" Variety described it as boring, while Liz Smith said it was \\"compelling\\" and \\"usually painful to watch.\\" In April 2014, Lohan guest-starred in an episode of the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls. In July 2014, she filed a lawsuit against Rockstar Games claiming elements in the video game Grand Theft Auto V were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2018, Lohan again attempted to sue the makers of Grand Theft Auto V, and lost the case. Lohan made her stage debut in October 2014, starring in the London West End production of David Mamet's Speed-the-Plow, a satire about the movie business. She portrayed Karen, the secretary of a Hollywood executive, in a role originally played by Madonna. Reviews of Lohan's performance were mixed, with the Associated Press describing critical reception overall as \\"lukewarm.\\" The Stage said she was \\"out of her league\\" while The Times wrote that she \\"can act a bit\\" and The Guardian said she \\"holds the stage with ease.\\" In December 2014, the free-to-play video game app Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame was released for the iOS and Android operating systems. Polygon said it was \\"funny, trashy and surprisingly self-aware\\" while Vulture called it \\"a crappy knockoff of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.\\" In May 2015, a judge ended Lohan's probation after she completed the community service that resulted from her 2012 reckless driving, making it the first time in nearly 8 years that she was probation free. In 2015, the English band Duran Duran announced that Lohan had been featured on the song \\"Dancephobia\\" from their upcoming fourteenth studio album, Paper Gods. In June 2016, Lohan confirmed her intentions for recording and releasing her third studio album during an online video chat with her fans. Lohan confirmed that she owed her record label one final album, as per her contract, and would only release music once it would not upset her younger sister, Ali, who is also pursuing her own music career. In December 2016, Lohan opened Lohan Nightclub in Athens, Greece. Lohan serves as a part-owner along with making bi-monthly promotional appearances.

Choices: i. yes; ii. it is not possible to tell; iii. no;","completion":"i. yes; The premise, \\"So I'd be obliged if you'd tell him to scoot,\\" entails the hypothesis, \\"Please tell him to leave.\\" This is because both statements essentially convey the same request, albeit with varying choices of words and tone. In the premise, the speaker uses the phrase \\"I'd be obliged,\\" which is a polite way of expressing a request or, more specifically, expressing gratitude in advance for a favor that has yet to be granted. Similarly, in the hypothesis, the word \\"Please\\" is used, indicating a polite request. The main action being requested in both statements is for someone to tell another person to leave a certain location. In the premise, the word \\"scoot\\" is employed, which is an informal and possibly quirky way of asking someone to depart from a place. In the hypothesis, the word \\"leave\\" is used, which is a more straightforward and commonly understood term for the same action. Given these similarities in meaning and structure, it is safe to conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis. Both statements are requesting that someone communicate the speaker's desire for a third party to exit or depart from their present location, and both do so in a fairly polite manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mangos grew better in the fields that Hunter owned versus those of Logan even though","completion":"The Mangos grew better in the fields that Hunter owned versus those of Logan even though both farmers devoted an equal amount of time and resources, carefully tending to their trees, implementing the latest agricultural practices, and maintaining a diligent eye on their respective crops. This confounding result captured the attention of the local agricultural community, prompting a series of experiments and investigations to understand the underlying causes behind the seemingly inexplicable difference in the mango yield between Hunter's and Logan's fields. Eventually, researchers from the regional agriculture office arrived at the properties to study the phenomenon and gather data on critical factors influencing the crop's success. Working closely with Hunter and Logan, they gathered information on soil composition, irrigation systems, fertilization practices, sun exposure, and numerous other factors that could potentially impact the mango trees. When analyzing the data, a pattern emerged pointing towards differences in the microclimates of the two fields. Despite being located within the same region, subtle variations in temperature, humidity, and wind patterns were present. Hunter's field happened to benefit from a set of unique favorable microclimatic conditions, such as slightly warmer temperatures during the fruit setting stage and cooler temperatures during fruit maturation, which ultimately resulted in superior fruit quality and yield. Furthermore, it was discovered that the soil composition differed considerably at a microscale too. While the overall soil fertility in both fields was similar, the researchers found that Hunter's field had a marginally better pH level and better soil structure, allowing for more efficient water retention and nutrient uptake by the mango trees. Raised beds constructed in Hunter's field also contributed to better drainage, which proved critical during periods of heavy rainfall, preventing overwatering and root rot. Additionally, it was revealed that beneficial microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi, had formed symbiotic relationships with the mango trees in Hunter's field. This partnership positively impacted the overall health of the plants, enhancing nutrient uptake and improving their resistance to pathogens. On the other hand, Logan's field was deficient in these beneficial microorganisms, which inhibited his mango trees from receiving the same beneficial effects. Overall, while it was initially perplexing to comprehend why the mango trees in Hunter's field performed significantly better than those in Logan's field, the mystery unfolded, highlighting crucial elements that contribute to the success of mango cultivation. It stressed the importance of microclimate, soil composition, and biotic relationships in determining the success of a crop. This newfound knowledge not only explained the disparity in yields between the fields but also provided valuable insights that would inform future agricultural practices in the region, improving mango cultivation for everyone."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, the cause of such issues, as mentioned, is usually due to the .sys files. DLL files, such as RWia450.dll, are system files that contain small programs shared by multiple applications. As for .sys files, they are crucial system files that support the functioning of your Windows operating system. Both of these file types are vital for the smooth operation of your computer software and hardware. If you are experiencing an issue with the RWia450.dll device and no sound, I suggest you try the following solutions to resolve the problem: 1. Update Your Drivers: Drivers facilitate communication between your computer's hardware and software. Outdated or missing drivers might cause DLL or SYS file issues, so ensure that all your device drivers, particularly the sound drivers, are up-to-date. You can update them from the manufacturer's website or by using a third-party tool like \\"Driver Booster.\\" 2. Run Windows System File Checker: The System File Checker (SFC) is an in-built Windows utility that inspects and fixes corrupted or damaged system files. To perform a system file check, open the Command Prompt by typing \\"cmd\\" in the search bar, right-click \\"Command Prompt,\\" and choose \\"Run as administrator.\\" In the Command Prompt, type \\"sfc /scannow\\" (without the quotes), press Enter, and wait for the scan to complete. 3. Re-register the DLL file: If the specific DLL file is causing an issue, you can try re-registering it. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator, and type the command \\"regsvr32 /u RWia450.dll\\" (without the quotes) to unregister the DLL file. Then, input \\"regsvr32 /i RWia450.dll\\" (without the quotes) to re-register it. After executing these commands, restart your computer and check if the issue persists. 4. Repair or Reinstall the Affected Software: If the issue is limited to specific software or applications, try to repair or reinstall them. This process will restore any missing or corrupted DLL and SYS files associated with the software. 5. Perform a System Restore: If the problem started recently, you might want to revert your system to a previous state when everything was working correctly. Utilize the Windows System Restore feature for this purpose, but remember that any recent software installations or changes will be undone. If these solutions do not resolve the issue, you may require advanced troubleshooting or professional assistance. In such cases, consider seeking help from an IT professional or contacting your computer's manufacturer for further support."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Woodes Rogers was the eldest son and heir of Woods Rogers, a successful merchant captain. Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company PS6,000 (about PS820,000 at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained PS1,600 (now worth perhaps PS218,700) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. However, the long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive. After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled A Cruising Voyage Round the World. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard Duchess, also wrote a book, A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as Robinson Crusoe. While Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose--to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade.

Paragraph: Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\" Question: \\"Of what nationality were the majority of people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" Answer: \\"The majority of people were Chinese\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choices: -- no. -- yes.","completion":"Answer: yes.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west.

The two sentences provide different pieces of information and do not necessarily imply each other. Sentence 1 states that there are four distinct schools within the structure, and every school has its own portal and inner courtyard. This information focuses on the layout and physical aspects of the schools, but does not provide any details about the quality of education they offer. Sentence 2, on the other hand, talks about the size of the schools and the quality of education provided. It claims that while the schools are small, they provide a wonderful education. This particular sentence focuses on the educational aspects of the schools rather than their structure.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need? Judging from the extreme experiment of Frederick in the 13th century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue he told the nurses to keep silent. All the babies died before the first year. But clearly there was more than language deprivation (,). What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the ability to survive is seriously affected. Today no such extreme deprivation exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to signals of the baby, whose brain is programmed, to mop up language rapidly. There are critical times, it seems when children learn more rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. Linguists suggest that speech milestones are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. Recent evidence suggests that a baby is born with the ability to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a teddy bear with the sound pattern \\"teddy bear\\". But speech has to be developed, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child's babbling, clinging, grasping, crying, smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals reduces the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal signals is basic to the growth and development of language. Question: Frederick's experiment was extreme because _ . - he wanted to prove children are born with ability to speak - he wanted his nurses to say another language - he was unkind to the nurses - he ignored the importance of mothering to the babies A:","completion":"Frederick's experiment was extreme because he ignored the importance of mothering to the babies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

CHAPTER XI After nearly six months in the Nueces gorge the loneliness and inaction of his life drove Duane out upon the trails seeking anything rather than to hide longer alone, a prey to the scourge of his thoughts. The moment he rode into sight of men a remarkable transformation occurred in him. A strange warmth stirred in him--a longing to see the faces of people, to hear their voices--a pleasurable emotion sad and strange.

When he hid alone in the brakes he was safe from all except his deeper, better self; when he escaped from this into the haunts of men his force and will went to the preservation of his life. Mercer was the first village he rode into. He had many friends there. Mercer claimed to owe Duane a debt. On the outskirts of the village there was a grave overgrown by brush so that the rude-lettered post which marked it was scarcely visible to Duane as he rode by. He had never read the inscription. But he thought now of Hardin, no other than the erstwhile ally of Bland. For many years Hardin had harassed the stockmen and ranchers in and around Mercer. On an evil day for him he or his outlaws had beaten and robbed a man who once succored Duane when sore in need.

Questions: Where would you put groceries after you have bought them and reached your house? Options: - refrigerator - supermarket - pantry - shelf - trunk","completion":"When you have bought groceries and reached your house, the appropriate place to store them would depend on the type of groceries you have purchased. However, common sense would suggest organizing groceries into different categories, such as perishable items, non-perishable items, and household supplies. Then, store them in the appropriate locations accordingly. Here is a detailed plan for storing the items based on the options provided: 1. Refrigerator: Groceries that require refrigeration or those with shorter shelf lives should be stored in the refrigerator. These include dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese; fresh produce like fruits, vegetables, and herbs; raw meat, poultry, and seafood; and any other items that mention \\"keep refrigerated\\" on their packaging. The refrigerator helps maintain these items at the right temperature, ensuring that they remain fresh and safe for consumption. 2. Pantry: A pantry is an ideal place for storing canned, jarred, and packaged food items that do not require refrigeration or have longer shelf lives. Such items include canned vegetables, soups, and meats, pasta, rice, cereals, and other grain products, baking ingredients like sugar, salt, and flour, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. These products should be kept in a cool, dry, and dark place to prevent spoilage and prolong their shelf life. 3. Shelf: Kitchen shelves, particularly those used for storing dry/canned goods or spices, are also excellent storage spaces for items that do not need refrigeration. This could include dry, non-perishable items such as cereals, boxed pasta, baking supplies, and spices. Make sure to organize your kitchen shelves to allow proper airflow and prevent overcrowding, which could impact the quality and freshness of the products. 4. Trunk: The trunk is an inappropriate place to store groceries after you have bought them and reached your house. It is usually located inside your car and is meant for temporary storage of items during transportation. Storing groceries in the trunk for an extended period could result in spoilage, damage, and even infestations from insects or rodents. In conclusion, based on the options provided and using common sense, the appropriate places to store your groceries after arriving home from the supermarket would be the refrigerator for perishable items, pantry for non-perishable items that need a cool, dry, and dark place, and shelves for other dry items and spices. Storing your groceries properly will help you maintain their quality and freshness, ensuring that they remain safe to consume, and extending their shelf life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day, then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing, and hangs it up to cure. Some recipes apply heat to about 40 °C (104 °F) to accelerate fermentation and drying. Higher temperatures (about 60 °C (140 °F)) stop the fermentation when the salami reaches the desired pH, but the product is not fully cooked (75 °C (167 °F) or higher). Makers often treat the casings with an edible mold (Penicillium) culture. The mold imparts flavor, helps the drying process, and helps prevent spoilage during curing. Is it true that do you eat the white coating on salami?","completion":"Yes, it is true that you can eat the white coating on salami. The white coating, often found on the outside of salami and other cured meats, consists of an edible mold called Penicillium. This mold plays a crucial role in the development of the salami's flavor, texture, and preservation. When salami is made, after the raw meat mixture is fermented and stuffed into casings, it is hung to cure. During the curing process, mold cultures, primarily Penicillium, are intentionally applied or allowed to grow on the casings. The mold serves several purposes: 1. Flavor development: The mold contributes to the unique and complex flavor of salami. As the mold grows and develops, it breaks down proteins and fats in the meat, creating distinct flavor compounds. 2. Drying: The mold helps to regulate the moisture content of the salami. As it grows, it absorbs and removes excess moisture from the surface, promoting an even drying process and preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. 3. Preservation: The mold acts as a natural preservative, preventing the growth of undesirable bacteria and fungi on the salami. This is crucial for maintaining the safety and quality of the product during the lengthy curing process. While the white mold coating is entirely safe and edible, some people may prefer to remove it before consuming the salami. If you find the mold's taste or texture unappealing, you can peel off the casing or scrape off the mold before eating. It is essential to note that this white mold coating should not be confused with harmful mold, which may appear in various colors, including green, blue, or black, and should not be consumed. If you notice any strange odors or off-colored mold on salami, it is best to discard the product as it could be spoiled. In conclusion, the white coating on salami is safe to eat and contributes to the product's unique flavor and preservation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, certain vegetables and dietary adjustments can provide relief from various conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ovarian cysts, or even promote ovarian health in general. Additionally, alternative therapies, including using castor oil packs and systemic enzyme therapy, may help support recovery and reduce inflammation. This article explores various methods to help improve ovarian health and support the healing process. 1. Rich in Vegetables for Ovarian Healing: A diet high in vegetables offers an abundance of essential nutrients that promote overall health, including ovarian well-being. Vegetables, such as leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, and antioxidant-rich colorful vegetables like bell peppers, promote optimal hormone balance, reduce inflammation, and improve blood flow to the ovaries, which may help alleviate some ovarian issues. Incorporating a variety of vegetables into your daily meals ensures a well-rounded intake of valuable nutrients. 2. Potassium-rich Foods for Improved Ovary Function: Potassium is an essential mineral that supports nerve and muscle functions, fluid balance in the body, and the proper functioning of cells. Foods high in potassium, such as bananas, sweet potatoes, and spinach, may help in reducing the symptoms associated with ovarian cysts by promoting healthy fluid regulation and reducing water retention. As a counterbalance to sodium, potassium also helps maintain healthy blood pressure levels, which is crucial for overall health and well-being. 3. Drinking Apple Cider Vinegar for Ovary Support: Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has a long history of use as a natural remedy and supports gut health by promoting better digestion. When consumed in moderation – no more than 1 to 2 tablespoons per day – ACV may aid in balancing blood sugar levels and helping detoxify the liver, which in turn can optimize hormonal balance within the body. Diluting ACV in water and ingesting it first thing in the morning is an effective way to incorporate this product into your daily routine. 4. Systemic Enzyme Therapy for Ovarian Health: Systemic enzyme therapy refers to the use of enzymes as a natural healing modality. Enzymes like bromelain, serrapeptase, and papain can help break down excess proteins and support the body’s natural inflammatory response. By reducing inflammation, these enzymes may improve blood flow to the ovaries, alleviate pain, and potentially even reduce the size of ovarian cysts. If considering systemic enzyme therapy, consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance and recommendations. 5. Using Castor Oil Packs for Ovary Support: Castor oil, sourced from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant, is an ancient remedy that may help improve ovarian health by supporting the body’s detoxification processes and reducing inflammation. To use a castor oil pack, saturate a flannel cloth with the oil, place it over the affected ovary, and apply gentle heat using a hot water bottle or heating pad for 45-60 minutes daily. This practice can help stimulate blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, promoting the healing of ovarian cysts and reducing pain associated with other ovarian issues. 6. Vitamin Supplements under Doctor's Supervision: For individuals suffering from ovarian conditions, vitamin supplementation may provide additional support. Vitamins B6, C, D, and E have all been shown to play a role in hormonal balance and ovarian health. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regime, as they will assess your individual needs and recommend the appropriate dosages and combinations of supplements to complement other treatments and dietary approaches. Conclusion: Natural healing methods, such as incorporating a vegetable-rich diet, potassium-rich foods, apple cider vinegar, systemic enzyme therapy, and castor oil packs, coupled with vitamin supplementation, may help alleviate symptoms and support the healing process for individuals with ovarian-related issues. As with any treatment plan, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure that the selected methods are appropriate and tailored to individual needs for optimal benefits and safety."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Age of Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, refers to an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Enlightenment emphasized the importance of reason, science, and individualism and sought to reform society using these principles. Prominent philosophers of this time, including John Locke, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, wrote works that greatly influenced both the American and French Revolutions. The Age of Enlightenment can be considered to have come to an end towards the close of the 18th century, as the scientific and rationalist ideas became more widely accepted, leading to societal transformations. The Industrial Revolution, which began during the mid-18th century, was a period of significant technological advancement, industrial growth, and socioeconomic change. It marked the shift from agrarian, rural societies to industrialized, urban ones. The introduction of new machinery and techniques revolutionized various industries, especially the textile industry. Steam power and iron production also improved, leading to innovations in transportation and communication. Although the Industrial Revolution continued on into the 19th century, its origins and early developments were largely concentrated in the late 18th century. Lastly, the American Revolution, which took place from 1765 to 1783, marked the end of British colonial rule in the Thirteen American Colonies. This period witnessed a series of political and social transformations, sparked by unrest over issues such as taxation, representation, and the perceived tyranny of the British government. The Revolutionary War eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized the independence and sovereignty of the United States. In conclusion, to answer the question \\"What period ended towards the end of the 18th century?\\" it is more appropriate to discuss the Age of Enlightenment, which saw the spread of scientific and rationalist ideas; the early phase of the Industrial Revolution, characterized by technological advancements and industrial growth; and the end of British colonial rule in America due to the American Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Paris. These events and movements signify major historical shifts that correspond with the end of the 18th century, setting the stage for the developments of the 19th century."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here is a news article: After you've seen The Kids Are All Right, check out our Spoiler Special discussion: You can also download the program here, or you can subscribe to the Spoiler Special podcast feed via iTunes or directly with our RSS feed. Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right (Focus Features) is the movie we've been waiting for all year: a comedy that doesn't take cheap shots, a drama that doesn't manipulate, a movie of ideas that doesn't preach. It's a rich, layered, juicy film, with quiet revelations punctuated by big laughs. And it leaves you feeling wistful for at least three reasons: because of what happens in the story, because the movie's over, and because there aren't more of them this good. Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening) are a middle-aged lesbian couple in Los Angeles with two teenage children, Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). Nic, a physician, is the breadwinner of this stable, well-off family, while the unfocused Jules has vague plans to start a landscaping business on her partner's dime. Near the start of the movie, Joni, at her younger brother's urging, calls up the sperm bank that provided their mothers with genetic material 18 years ago. Behind their mothers' backs, the siblings make contact with their hitherto anonymous biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), a hedonistic restaurateur who's flattered by the attention but unsure how to proceed. Gradually, Paul is incorporated into the fringes of the family: The children bring him home for an excruciatingly awkward lunch, and against Nic's wishes, Jules takes on the job of landscaping his yard. It's fitting that gardening—Jules' landscaping project, Paul's achingly trendy farm-to-table restaurant—plays such a large role in The Kids Are All Right, because the movie is at heart about the ecosystem of a family, and the way that system changes when an exotic species is introduced. The presence of Paul changes everything, exposing fault lines in Nic and Jules' relationship and forcing the children to defy their mothers and reassess their peer friendships. (A subplot in which the introverted Laser finally stands up to his jerky best friend is particularly well-handled.) In one of the movie's funniest scenes, Nic unleashes her hostility toward Paul in an icy diatribe about the organic-food fad: \\"If I hear one more person say how much they love heirloom tomatoes, I'm going to punch them right in the face.\\" Without ever making the comparison outright, Cholodenko and her co-writer Stuart Blumberg draw a parallel between the aspiration for organic purity and the myth of the perfect family. However assiduously you cultivate your garden, they suggest, there's no predicting what might crop up by surprise or how it'll grow. In a movie whose story hinges entirely on how the characters treat one other, the acting here is really interacting, and this stellar ensemble cast gets it exactly right. Bening makes Nic a force to be reckoned with: an acid-tongued workaholic who loves her wine a little more than she should but who's such lively company you understand what Jules sees in her. A scene in which Nic sings Joni Mitchell's \\"All I Want\\" a cappella at a dinner party veers from embarrassment to exaltation—and then back to embarrassment again. Advertisement The ever-astounding Julianne Moore finds lots of layers in Jules: passive-aggression, vulnerability, coquettish vanity, sexual hunger. Ruffalo just Ruffaloes it up, playing the kind of part that's been his subspecialty since You Can Count on Me: the immature but well-meaning and rakishly sexy scamp. And as the kids who aren't always, but eventually will be, all right, Wasikowska and Hutcherson are tentative and tender and convincingly sibling-like. The scene in which the family drops the college-bound Joni off at her freshman dorm will wring tears even from the few audience members who made it dry-eyed through Toy Story 3. More than anything, The Kids Are All Right is a film about marriage. Not about gay marriage in particular, though the portrait of this couple's decades-long bond underscores the absurdity of the debate about what to call same-sex unions. Cholodenko, who has a donor child with her partner, isn't making a rah-rah commercial for alternative families—in fact, some gay viewers may bristle at the movie's less-than-orthodox take on lesbian sexuality and the complications of donor parenthood. What Cholodenko has aimed for, and achieved, is something bigger: a serious and funny film about the simple yet incomprehensibly fraught act of moving through time with the person you love.

The Kids Are All Right: The movie we've been waiting for all year. ||||| \\"All right\\" doesn't begin to describe it. \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is wonderful. Here is a film that respects andall of its characters, the give-and-take and recklessness and wisdom of any functioning family unit, conventional or un-. The independently financed 5 million indie, picked up for distribution by Focus Features, is the easiest movie to love I've seen all year.In writer-director Lisa Cholodenko 's previous theatrical releases, the New York-set \\"High Art\\" and the Los Angeles -set \\" Laurel Canyon,\\" the filmmaker proved adept at examining relationships from close quarters. She's especially shrewd at delineating how a vulnerable soul can be pulled into undiscovered country, perilous and exciting. Every action or transgression comes with a price, however, and that's why Cholodenko is so good; she sees the reasons behind everyone's behavior. Her films are well-made in a straightforward, humanistic vein, yet emotionally expansive and open-ended, like all good fiction.This holds especially true in \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" which is set in the sunny hillsides of LA and was co-written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg. Already it has become known as the \\"lesbian moms film\\" or the \\"sperm donor dad movie,\\" both of which are true, if reductive. Doctor Nic ( Annette Bening ) and her longtime partner, Jules ( Julianne Moore ), have two teenagers from the same sperm donor. Daughter Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ), heading off to college, is leaving behind a younger brother, Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ), who has grown curious about the identity of their father.Contact is made, behind the moms' backs, and in a charmingly awkward scene, Mark Ruffalo 's restaurateur Paul — an easygoing SoCal satyr, open to any new experience — says he'd be willing to have some sort of relationship, or friendship, with these two. From there the narrative offers an equal number of satisfying inevitables and gratifying surprises. The Bening character, a hard-drinking, somewhat fearsome control freak, doesn't like the idea of this man entering their lives. Moore's character, a fledgling landscape gardener who's hired to transform Paul's canyon hillside into something more than untended scrub, sees him differently, more forgivingly. She's also intrigued by this boy-man in his 40s who seems to live in a seductive fog of availability.Shot on pleasantly hazy 35 mm by cinematographer Igor Jadue-Lillo, Cholodenko's film is conversational without being stagey. Bening and Moore have never been looser or wittier on screen, and Ruffalo is the perfect foil, a man who enjoys a romantic challenge as much as a sure thing. Wasikowska and Hutcherson are two of the truest, most direct young screen actors working today. Like Kenneth Lonergan's \\"You Can Count on Me\\" a decade ago, which also co-starred Ruffalo, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is a triumph of simple technique wedded to complex and satisfying comedy- drama An LA friend came out of Lonergan's film saying, \\"I love it, and I can't even tell you why, exactly.\\" I suspect Cholodenko's achievement will elicit similar responses among all kinds of moviegoers.R (for strong sexual content, nudity, language and some teen drug and alcohol use)Annette Bening (Nic); Julianne Moore (Jules); Mark Ruffalo (Paul); Mia Wasikowska (Joni); Josh Hutcherson (Laser); Yaya DaCosta (Tanya)Directed by Lisa Cholodenko; written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg; produced by Gary Gilbert, Jeffrey Levy-Hinte, Celine Rattray, Jordan Horowitz and Daniela Taplin Lundberg. A Focus Features release. Running time: 1:44 ||||| Witty, urbane and thoroughly entertaining, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is an ode to the virtues of family, in this case a surprisingly conventional one even with its two moms, two kids and one sperm donor. Whatever your politics, between peerless performances, lyrical direction and an adventurous script, this is the sort of pleasingly grown-up fare all too rare in the mainstream daze of this very dry summer.Before delving into the layered perfection of Annette Bening Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo , let's start by getting past any hesitations or reservations about the lesbian household premise on which \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is based. The issue of gay marriage is not what's on the table here. At its heart, this is a movie about how families, whatever their composition, stay together, love each other through difficult times, and weather the particularly storm-tossed seas that come when the kids hit their teenage years. (Why the 2s are considered terrible instead of the teens, I'll never understand).Writer-director Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg have put the politics aside for now and created an easy interplay of comedy and drama spawned by typical family pressures — the thank you notes that haven't been sent, the sketchy best friend the parents don't approve of, the house rules made to be broken. It helps that the characters are eminently relatable at the same time intriguingly iconoclastic, no small feat. For those who are wondering, there is some sheet tangling, sweaty sex, but it's mostly of the hetero variety courtesy of the very appealing Ruffalo.The laughter and the tears are set in motion when 15-year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) presses his 18-year-old sister Joni (an excellent Mia Wasikowska ) to use her new legal standing to find out who their bio-dad is. While curiosity does not quite kill the cat, it definitely upends this seemingly settled family headed by Bening's Nic, a doctor and by-the-book breadwinner and Moore's Jules, the easy-going stay-at-home half. As for the kids, Joni's an honors student headed to college in the fall and Laser's the star athlete trying to figure out his emerging self, so definitely they're all right, but change is in the air.Enter Ruffalo's Paul, a PC-liberal dreamboat of a donor dad, who spends his days tending the organic vegetable garden that supplies his hipster-chic restaurant at night. He also comes with a self-deprecatingly smug charm about his college dropout success, farm-to-table lifestyle and unencumbered bachelorhood. By the time Nic finally breaks in the face of all that eco-goodness dissolving into an anti-composting rant, it's hard to suppress the desire to cheer.With all the players in place, the filmmakers set about deconstructing life as the family knows it, with Paul their weapon of mass deconstruction. Everything about him is seductive, with the kids falling hard for their newly acquired father-figure, followed in short order by Jules and even a very resistant Nic. But then, the lovable incorrigible is Ruffalo's sweet spot and his performance here, if possible, is even more refined than his breakout in another intimate family drama, \\"You Can Count on Me.\\"At first Paul represents endless possibility: the cool parent whom kids fantasize about, the unexpected lover who believes in you and your dreams, the latecomer who turns out to be the life of the party even as his very presence is redefining the family. But in filmmaker Cholodenko's increasingly sure hands, life is neither easy, nor neat and tidy. As she has done in her previous work, \\"High Art\\" and the incisive \\"Laurel Canyon,\\" she cuts to the bone of human emotions, with the humans themselves fraying around the edges.In \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" it's hard to tell who is fraying faster, Nic or Jules. They are a typical long-coupled couple, focused on the routine of daily life and forgetful of the romance that brought them together. At home, as well as at work, Bening's Nic is scalpel sharp. Tension radiates around her like an energy field with Bening using it against her fear of the unknown and then the greater fear of the known.As the serious one with a domineering streak, Bening has the harder task unearthing her character's humanity without any of the cuddle factor that everyone else has been given. But as she did in \\"American Beauty,\\" she makes the unlikable understandable, forgivable. In \\"Kids\\" she manages to be funny in ways so subtle you might miss them if they weren't so perfectly played in the cock of her head, the roll of an eye. And when the deep wounds come, and they do, you're allowed tears even if Nic isn't.Where Nic is brittle, Jules is the bough that breaks and in taking her there Moore is fearless. There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera — sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally, but always with an abandon that exposes all of the character's complicated layers. Jules is an existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty, and Moore plays every note perfectly.The kids, who really serve as a counterweight for the craziness brought about by bio-dad's desire to have a place in their lives, are refreshingly real. Wasikowska, in particular, is exceptional — disappointment lingering in her eyes, face quivering on the edge of tears as one after another of her parents lets her down, as parents inevitably do. While she may be best known for her delightful Alice in Tim Burton 's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" it is the mix of vulnerability and steel she brings to HBO's \\"In Treatment,\\" as one of Gabriel Byrne 's troubled clients, that most informs Joni.Before they've finished wringing everything out of their actors, the filmmakers dredge through the issues — age old and thoroughly modern — that come along to threaten that most basic of bonds. Fierce, funny, smart and overflowing with love, this unconventionally conventional film sits squarely in the family values camp, which is exactly where it belongs. ||||| Lesbian Family Values in The Kids Are All Right Two moms, two kids, and a sperm donor make one all-American movie Serious comedy, powered by an enthusiastic cast and full of good-natured innuendo, Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right gives adolescent coming-of-age and the battle of the sexes a unique twist, in part by creating a romantic triangle between a long-standing, devoutly bourgeois lesbian couple Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) and the newly identified, merrily free-spirited sperm donor, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), responsible for both the couple's teenage children, Joni and Laser (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson). Normality, as made clear by the introductory family dinner that features two mothers acting all motherly, rules. The kids refer to their American-as-apple-pie parents in the plural, as in \\"that really hurt the moms' feelings.\\" (The moms' designated kink is their occasional use of gay male porn as an aphrodisiac—although even this gets an amusingly didactic explanation.) Whereas Cholodenko's two previous features, High Art (1998) and Laurel Canyon (2003), each focused on an innocent young woman swept up in the glamorously baffling sex-and-drugs scene swirling around a charismatic older female artist, the situation here is reversed; unexpectedly drawn in to and fascinated by the ultra-domestic household created by a pair of charismatic femmes, the swinger is the straight man (literally). A happily hippified gardener-/restaurateur-cum-sex-object, Paul is introduced balling his employees and otherwise spreading his (organic) seed. \\"I love lesbians!\\" is his initial response upon coming face-to-face with his grown-up spermatozoa and being informed of their family situation. Although it was the 15-year-old Laser who prompted the father-and-child reunion, he's a sensitive jock who's put off by blithely diffident Paul's lack of enthusiasm for team sports; on the other hand, big sister Joni, still a virgin on the eve of college, finds this groovy stud really cool (as in hot). And so does Jules, especially after Paul engages her to landscape his backyard. (Unlike her workaholic doctor spouse, she has a bit of time on her hands.) We can tell where this is going when she describes Paul's overgrown grounds as \\"fecund.\\" Cholodenko's previous features have amply demonstrated her talent for directing actresses. High Art (1998), her genuinely edgy debut, gave aged-out brat-packer Ally Sheedy the opportunity to give her first real adult performance as a reclusive photographer, while memorably showcasing then-unknown Patricia Clarkson as Sheedy's hilariously Teutonic lover; Laurel Canyon (2003) provided the much-abused Frances McDormand with a rare opportunity to strut her stuff and even extracted a more than default-decorative turn from Kate Beckinsale. Given a reliably stellar duo in Bening and Moore, Cholodenko makes their rapport her key performance. The actresses are loose and funny, trading off big scenes and clearly enjoying themselves throughout. The acerbic Nic gets the best lines (\\"I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!\\" she snaps, when Paul presumes to offer her parenting advice) and even gets to drunkenly yowl her way through Joni Mitchell's \\"All I Want,\\" although Jules has the movie's pre-eminent solo of truth. Premiered last January at Sundance, The Kids Are All Right triggered considerable discussion as well as a lively bidding war. The excitement is unsurprising. Despite, or perhaps in accordance with, its '60s rock-and-roll title, it's actually a pretty conservative movie—particularly when compared to Cholodenko's previous works. Given its juicy premise, The Kids could have been played for sitcom, reality show, or soap opera—had it been made in 1970, it might have been an Echo Park Teorema, with everyone winding up in bed together. Ten years into the 21st century, it's a heartfelt poster for family values. Everything new is old again. jhoberman@villagevoice.com ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Kids Are All Right is a comedy-drama film directed by Lisa Cholodenko that tells the story of a middle-aged lesbian couple, Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening), living in Los Angeles with their two teenage children, Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). When Joni and Laser contact their biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), they introduce him to their family, which inadvertently disrupts the family dynamic.

Write an article based on this summary: Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale said her politics were not \\"wildly different\\" from left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who is favourite to win the UK party's contest. Article:","completion":"Title: Kezia Dugdale's Politics Resonate with Jeremy Corbyn's Ideals Introduction: The political landscape of the United Kingdom is witnessing a surge in leadership contests within the parties, as politicians vie for control of their respective factions. A notable figure in this scenario is Kezia Dugdale, a Scottish Labour leadership hopeful, who recently voiced her political views and opined that they were not \\"wildly different\\" from those of Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing frontrunner in the UK Labour Party's leadership contest. This article seeks to explore the implications of their possible alignment in policy and the potential impact on both the Scottish and UK Labour parties. Kezia Dugdale's Standing: As a member of the Scottish Parliament since 2011, Kezia Dugdale has made her presence felt in the Scottish political sphere. With her focus on education and social justice, Dugdale quickly rose through the ranks to become the deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2014. As she vies for the top post within the party, it is significant that her political views align with the popular Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy Corbyn's Ascend: Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn has gained a massive following in recent years, often hailed as the face of the left-wing resurgence in UK politics. His policies advocating for economic equality, social justice and an anti-austerity stance have resonated with many working-class Britons, making him a frontrunner for the leadership of the UK Labour Party. Common Ground: Upon analyzing the political stances of both Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn, it becomes evident that their ideologies share several similarities. While they may not agree on every policy, their focus on social justice, education, and the welfare of the working class embodies the ideals of the Labour party itself. The possible convergence of their political strategies offers a tantalizing prospect to the voters in Scotland and the United Kingdom, who are looking for a more formidable force to counter the ruling Conservative Party. Impact on Scottish Labour Party: Should Kezia Dugdale become the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, her like-mindedness with Jeremy Corbyn could lead to a stronger and more united front within the party. This renewed sense of purpose and unity could work wonders in regaining the trust and support of the Scottish people, who have leaned towards the Scottish National Party (SNP) in recent years. Implications for the UK Labour Party: A possible collaboration between Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn could yield fruitful results for the UK Labour Party as well. As the power dynamic shifts within the party, their collective focus on social justice, worker's rights, and progressive policies could serve to reinvigorate the party on a national level, making them a more competitive force against the Conservative majority in Parliament. Conclusion: Politics has often been described as the art of compromise, and in this case, the similar political views shared by Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn could pave the way for greater cooperation and success for both the Scottish and UK Labour parties. For the voters in Scotland and the United Kingdom, the union of these two leaders could signal a compelling alternative to the existing political status quo, potentially ushering in a new era of progressive politics in the face of conservative dominance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: In what quarter was the longest touchdown pass?","completion":"Title: [A Look Back at the Longest Touchdown Pass in NFL History: The Fateful Quarter] Introduction The game of football, particularly the National Football League (NFL), has been a perennial source of impressive athletic feats and record-breaking milestones. One such unforgettable moment in NFL history is the longest ever touchdown pass, which has left fans and analysts debating the ideal circumstances and strategies that clinched this record. This article delves into the background, unfolding events, and the unforgettable quarter that witnessed this remarkable throwing distance. Background and Context The current NFL record for the longest touchdown pass was set on September 27, 1981, during a regular-season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets. Jets' quarterback Richard Todd and wide receiver Wesley Walker teamed up for the awe-inspiring play that spanned a total of 98 yards. As of today, this remains the longest completed touchdown pass in NFL history. The Fateful Quarter: A Breakdown The record-breaking touchdown pass happened during the third quarter of the game. Considering the pressing need for strategic plays as the game approached its final stretch, this quarter became the perfect stage for showcasing audacity, grit, and perfect execution. The third quarter took off with the Miami Dolphins leading the scoreboard 21-14. However, the Jets had other plans as they took possession of the ball on their 2-yard line, seemingly unaware of the impending feat. The Jets' quarterback, Richard Todd, took the snap and dropped back into his end zone. As he stood poised to pass, the offensive line provided Todd with the time he needed to scan the field for an open target. Amid a sea of defensive pressure and hasty positioning, wide receiver Wesley Walker broke free from the Dolphins' defenders, rapidly accelerating towards the endzone. When Todd spotted Walker, he launched an electrifying long pass that seemed unstoppable. Wesley Walker outpaced the defense, catching the ball around the 50-yard line, and sprinted towards the endzone. As he crossed the goal line, the realization dawned upon everyone present, including both the teams and spectators, that a historical event had just taken place. After Walker's 98-yard touchdown reception, the game continued to see touchdowns exchanged between the Dolphins and Jets, swinging the matchup's momentum one way, then another. However, this arduous battle eventually wrapped up with the Dolphins winning the game 31-28. Lessons Learned and A Lasting Legacy The longest touchdown pass in the third quarter of the Miami Dolphins versus the New York Jets game has become a symbol of strategic expertise and tactical responsiveness in the modern football world. The fact that this play took place at a crucial point in the game highlights the importance of seizing opportunities when the opposing team's guard is down and making timely, impactful decisions on the field. Moreover, the teamwork and trust displayed between Todd and Walker elevated their respective positions to new heights, proving that splinter-second decisions have the power to change careers – and etch them into the annals of football history. Conclusion The longest touchdown pass in NFL history remains a thrilling highlight from a time when football players defied all expectations during heated contests. The impressive synergy between Richard Todd and Wesley Walker in the fateful third quarter of 1981 will surely serve as a benchmark and an inspiration to both aspiring and established athletes alike. Football fans worldwide look forward to witnessing yet another breathtaking moment that might challenge, or perhaps even shatter, this longstanding record."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects.

Article: A letter to Edward, a columnist Dear Mr Expert: I grew up in an unhappy and abusive home. I always Promised myself that I'd get out as soon as possible. Now, at age 20,I have a good job and a nice house, and I'm really proud of the independence I've achieved. Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine -- so much so that they make mine theirs. It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me. But now they seem to take it for granted that they can shou up any time they like. They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes-- it makes the place feel comfortable and warm-- but this is my home, not a party house. I was old enough to move out on my own, so why can't I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ? Joan Edward's reply to Joan Dear Joan: If your family didn't pay attention to your needs when you were a child, you probably have trouble letting others know your needs now. And if you've gathesed yourfriends around you to rebuild a happy family atmosphere ,you may fear that saying no will bring back the kind of conflict you grew up with-- or destroy the nice atmosphere you now enjoy. You need to understand that in true friendship it's okay to put your own needs first from time to time. Be clear about the message you want to send. For example, \\"I really love your company but I also need some privacy. So please call before you come over.\\" Question: We can infer from the first letter that_. Yes or no, is the answer \\"Joan's friends visit her more often than she can accept\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"Joan's friends visit her more often than she can accept\\". The inference can be derived from Joan's initial letter to Edward, the columnist. She describes how her friends started out by spending their weekends at her place and have now started to take it for granted that they can show up at any time they want. This includes bringing their boyfriends over, talking on the phone for long durations, and not leaving her home. Despite her feeling proud of her independence and the comfort acheived through some company, there is a sentiment of violation of privacy due to the excessive invasion by her friends. She mentions that while she does enjoy having her friends over sometimes, which makes the place feel comfortable and warm, she still views it as her home and not some sort of communal party house. Therefore, from Joan's scenarios and the tone in her letter, it's evident that her friends visit her more often than she can accept, thereby compromising her privacy and space. This is an indication of distress and discomfort caused by the lack of understanding and respect towards Joan's personal space on her friends' part. Joan's predicament highlights a typical interpersonal conflict where the line between personal space and companionship gets blurred. Her struggle to express her feelings to her friends might be related to her past where her needs were overlooked, an insight aptly pointed out by Edward in his response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The three theories below are essential in Earth science. Each accounts for an enormous amount of data. Each is supported by many lines of evidence. All can be used to make predications. As new evidence arises, any of these theories may need to be altered. But none of these three are likely ever to be disproved. They are accepted by nearly all of the credible scientists in their fields. Q: In science, what is supported by much evidence, widely accepted by credible scientists, and unlikely to be disproved? A: A:","completion":"In science, a well-supported and widely accepted concept that is unlikely to be disproved is often referred to as a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and consistently tested and refined through experimentation and observation. Scientific theories are grounded in a large body of empirical evidence, which lends them a high degree of reliability and acceptance within the scientific community. In the context of the given paragraph, the three essential theories in Earth science mentioned are prime examples of such widely accepted and well-supported scientific theories. Although it is not explicitly stated which theories these are, they potentially refer to key concepts such as the Theory of Plate Tectonics, the Theory of Evolution, and the Big Bang Theory, among others. All these theories have undergone rigorous scientific testing and are widely accepted by credible scientists in their respective fields. They are capable of making accurate predictions and are consistent with the available empirical data. Moreover, these theories are subject to modification as new evidence arises, which reflects the dynamic and self-correcting nature of the scientific process. It is important to note that scientific theories, while highly reliable and strongly supported by evidence, are never considered to be absolute truths. Instead, they represent the best available explanations for observed phenomena based on the current scientific understanding and the accumulated knowledge to date. However, their widespread acceptance and the extensive evidence supporting them make it unlikely that they will be disproved, although they may continue to evolve and improve as new data becomes available. This underlines the inherently tentative nature of scientific knowledge and highlights the importance of continuous inquiry and innovation in advancing humanity's understanding of the natural world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Context: Carter's debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for \\"Best New Artist\\", and also became a Top Ten hit. The lead single was \\"Tha Block Is Hot\\". After the release of Tha Block is Hot, Carter was featured on the single \\"Bling Bling\\", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. His verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus. His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut but was certified gold by RIAA. Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. The lead single was \\"Get Off the Corner\\", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was \\"Shine\\" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of Lights Out, Lil Wayne was featured on the single, \\"Number One Stunna\\" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at No. 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart. Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez, released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor, it also failed to match the success of his debut. The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez. The lead single was \\"Way of Life\\" which failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, Wayne was featured on the single \\"Neva Get Enuf\\" by 3LW. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","completion":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article: 1. Lil Wayne's background: Born and raised in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, his challenging upbringing and personal resilience to succeed despite his circumstances are noteworthy. 2. Early success: Lil Wayne achieved significant success with his debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot at just 17 years old, showcasing his talent and potential in the music industry from a young age. The album went platinum and earned him a Source magazine nomination for \\"Best New Artist.\\" 3. Collaborations: The article highlights Lil Wayne's collaborations with other artists, such as the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. These partnerships not only contributed to his early career success, but also helped to shape his musical style and development. 4. Evolution of his music: The article points out that critics noted a lack of coherent narratives in his verses during his early career, yet there was an improvement in his lyrical content and style as evidenced by his subsequent albums, such as Lights Out and 500 Degreez. 5. References to other artists: The title of Lil Wayne's third album, 500 Degreez, is mentioned as a reference to Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez. This reveals how Lil Wayne was influenced by, or responded to, the work of his fellow musicians in the industry. These aspects demonstrate Lil Wayne's early career achievements, collaborations, and evolution as an artist, offering insight into his rise to stardom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He and his sister, Letty (b. 1943), were raised in Midwood, Brooklyn. He is the son of Nettie (nee Cherry; November 8, 1906 - January 27, 2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900 - January 8, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was Jewish, and his grandparents immigrated to the US from Russia and Austria and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German. Allen is a passionate fan of jazz, featured prominently in the soundtracks to his films. He began playing the clarinet as a child and took his stage name from clarinetist Woody Herman. He has performed publicly at least since the late 1960s, notably with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band on the soundtrack of Sleeper. One of his earliest televised performances was on The Dick Cavett Show on October 20, 1971. Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing each Monday evening at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel for many years (as of 2011, specializing in classic New Orleans jazz from the early twentieth century). He plays songs by Sidney Bechet, George Lewis, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone and Louis Armstrong. The documentary film Wild Man Blues (directed by Barbara Kopple) documents a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band, as well as his relationship with Previn. The band has released two CDs: The Bunk Project (1993) and the soundtrack of Wild Man Blues (1997). In a 2011 review of a concert by Allen's jazz band, critic Kirk Silsbee of the L.A. Times suggested that Allen should be regarded as a competent musical hobbyist with a sincere appreciation for early jazz: \\"Allen's clarinet won't make anyone forget Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard or Evan Christopher. His piping tone and strings of staccato notes can't approximate melodic or lyrical phrasing. Still his earnestness and the obvious regard he has for traditional jazz counts for something.\\" Allen and his band played the Montreal International Jazz Festival on two consecutive nights in June 2008. For many years, Allen wanted to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans. The film, tentatively titled American Blues, would follow the vastly different careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Allen stated that the film would cost between 80 and 100 million and is therefore unlikely to be made. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How was Woody Allen involved in music?","completion":"Woody Allen was deeply involved in music as a passionate fan of jazz, which is prominently featured in the soundtracks of his films. He began playing the clarinet as a child, inspired by clarinetist Woody Herman, from whom he took his stage name. Allen has been performing publicly since the late 1960s, notably with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band. He and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing regularly at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel for many years. The band has released two CDs: The Bunk Project (1993) and the soundtrack of Wild Man Blues (1997). Additionally, Allen's jazz band participated in various events, such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Besides performing, he has expressed a desire to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans, which would focus on the careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Overall, Woody Allen's involvement in music mainly revolves around his deep appreciation and love for jazz, playing the clarinet, and performing with his band."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole.

We will discuss the data in terms of the number of lost matches, places, and total matches played in Finland. 1. Number of Lost Matches (6 LOST 5): The first piece of data, \\"6 LOST 5\\", suggests that there were a total of 6 lost matches. The number \\"5\\" may denote that out of these 6 lost matches, the subject from Finland lost 5 matches. This information could indicate the overall performance of the participant/team in a defined time frame or competition. 2. Placement (Finland PLACE 7): The second piece of data, \\"Finland PLACE 7\\", appears to denote the ranking or standing of the subject. In the context of a competition, this could mean that the Finnish participant/team secured the 7th position. This could be taken as a relative measure of success in comparison to other competitors. 3. Number of Matches (Finland MATCHES 6): The third set of data, \\"Finland MATCHES 6\\", represents the total number of matches that the Finnish subject participated in, which amounts to 6 matches. This information helps in understanding the context of their performance and the level of activity in a given time frame or tournament. Upon analyzing these data points, we can draw the following conclusions: - The Finnish participant/team had a moderate performance as they lost 5 out of the 6 matches they played. This performance may not be considered highly successful but might be seen as an opportunity for improvement and growth. - With a 7th place finish, the participant/team managed to surpass several other contenders for the ranking positions, which could be a source of motivation and a boost for the Finnish participant/team when considering future contests. - Out of the 6 matches played, only one match turned out to be victorious or favorable for the Finnish participant/team. However, it's worth noting that competitive environments often demand perseverance and continuous effort. Identifying the areas of weakness and focusing on improving them can contribute to better results in future matches. - Lastly, it is essential to emphasize that different variables might affect the outcomes of each match. These variables could include factors such as the level of competition, the conditions under which matches took place, and the specific rules and methodologies applied in each case.

These conflicts began in the 17th century and continued for many years. Step 2: Identify the key events and timelines associated with the end of the Indian warfare - One of the significant factors leading to the end of Indian warfare on the Texas frontier was the increasing presence of the United States military in the region. - The Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, forced many Native American tribes to move westward, reducing the conflicts in Texas. - In the 1870s, the final military campaigns against Native American tribes took place, as the U.S government sought to establish dominance over the western frontier. This included the Red River War of 1874-1875, which targeted the Comanche, Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes in the Texas Panhandle. Step 3: Provide the best approximate end date for the Indian warfare on the Texas frontier - Although minor skirmishes and confrontations continued for some years, the widespread Indian warfare on the Texas frontier is generally considered to have ended following the Red River War in the mid-1870s.

There was another group of people called the \\"Gang of Six\\" who also had a plan to reduce the money that the government spends. The President liked this plan better. But the House of Representatives kept the hope alive for the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan. They also talked about making another plan, just in case their first plan didn't work. They called this second plan as \\"Plan B\\". For now, the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan has made a small victory by passing the House of Representatives, but the journey is not over.

How backward must a local channel be, to have the rights to broadcasting the biggest television event in America, and not be able to stream weather warnings across the bottom of the screen without interrupting the HD signal? And just for the record, I don't give a rat's ass that there is winter storm warning in Northern Arizona, and even if I did it wouldn't matter since I'm busy staying indoors, watching the Super Bowl.

The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with several aspects about the local TV channel: 1. The channel's technical capabilities: The author complains about the interruption of the HD signal whenever there are weather warnings, indicating a negative experience with the broadcast quality. 2. Relevance of content: The author mocks the significance of a weather warning in northern Arizona during an indoors event, expressing the irrelevance of the warning to themselves personally - this critique shows annoyance as they do not find the information shared to be valuable. 3. The channel's affiliation with NBC: The reviewer states that this poor quality channel should partner with NBC, grouping two entities they perceive as negative together. Overall, the tone of the text reflects a high level of dissatisfaction and a critical stance towards the local channel's operation and broadcasting.

Regret signifies disappointment in a past action, which doesn't apply in this scenario. e) Irritation - This term has a negative connotation and relates to Joe's experience of disliking anything that interrupts his meal.

What is the capital of the Sultanate of Oman????","completion":"The capital city of the Sultanate of Oman is Muscat. Muscat is a port city located on the northeastern coast of Oman, along the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. Known for its rich history and cultural significance in the region, Muscat has been an important trading center between the East and the West for centuries. Muscat is not only the political capital of Oman but also serves as the economic, cultural, and administrative center of the country. The city is home to the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, the Royal Opera House, and many museums that showcase the history, art, and traditions of Oman. It also houses the Al Alam Palace, the ceremonial palace of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, which is a symbol of Oman's rich architectural heritage. The region of Muscat has been inhabited since at least 6,000 years ago and has been ruled by various indigenous and foreign powers. Among these are the ancient Persians, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British, all of whom left their mark on the city and its culture. In the early 16th century, the Portuguese established a stronghold in Muscat and controlled the region for around a century. However, by the mid-17th century, the Omani people successfully expelled the Portuguese, and the city's importance continued to grow under domestic rule. In 1970, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said came to power, bringing with him several modernization efforts and a focus on economic growth. Under his rule, the city of Muscat rapidly developed infrastructure, educational institutions, and transportation systems, transforming it into the modern capital city we see today. Today, Muscat continues to thrive and expand. Its strategic location along global trade routes has made it a hub for commerce, trade, and diplomacy. The city is divided into multiple districts, such as Muttrah, Ruwi, and Qurum, each offering a unique blend of traditional Omani and modern urban charm. With its scenic beauty, historic landmarks, and vibrant cultural scene, Muscat is a fascinating destination for tourists and a symbol of the remarkable transformation that the Sultanate of Oman has undergone in recent decades."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. Paragraph: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Q: In this task, you're given a paragraph and title from the research paper. Your task is to classify whether the given title is suitable or not for the research paper based on the given paragraph. Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: This study examined whether an infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) potentiates respiratory signs upon exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Five-week-old conventional pigs were inoculated intratracheally with the Lelystad strain of PRRSV and received 5 days later one or two intratracheal LPS administrations. The necessary controls were included. After LPS administration, pigs were intensively monitored for clinical signs. Additionally, some pigs were euthanatized after a second LPS administration for bronchoalveolar cell analysis and virological examinations of the lungs. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells were counted and differentiated. Lung suspensions and BAL fluids were titrated for PRRSV. Exposure of pigs to PRRSV only resulted in a fever for time periods ranging from 1 to 5 days and slight respiratory signs. Exposure of pigs to LPS only resulted in general signs, characterized by fever and depression, but respiratory signs were slight or absent. PRRSV-LPS exposed pigs, on the other hand, developed severe respiratory signs upon LPS exposure, characterized by tachypnoea, abdominal breathing and dyspnoea. Besides respiratory signs, these pigs also showed enhanced general signs, such as fever and depression. Lung neutrophil infiltration was similar in non-infected and PRRSV-infected pigs upon LPS exposure. PRRSV quantities were similar in lungs and BAL fluids of pigs infected with PRRSV only and PRRSV-LPS exposed pigs. These data show a clear synergism between PRRSV and LPS in the induction of respiratory signs in conventional pigs. The Veterinary Microbiology 88 (2002) 1-12 : S 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 ( 0 2 ) 0 0 1 0 4 -9 synergism was observed in 87% of the pigs.

In this situation, Taylor appears to have faced rejection when asking someone to the dance. As a result, it is essential for Taylor to take a deep breath, evaluate their current state of mind, and muster the courage to proceed with asking another person to the dance. Taylor can take several steps before asking another person to the dance. Here are a few suggestions to help build confidence and prepare for the task ahead: 1. Reflect on past experiences: Taylor should recognize that one rejection is not the end of the world. Examining previous social experiences that went well can boost self-esteem and provide some helpful perspective to face the situation head-on. 2. Seek advice and support from friends: Taylor can share feelings of nervousness or apprehension with close friends. They might offer some encouragement, advice, or even firsthand experiences that can help Taylor to see the bigger picture and build the courage to ask another person to the dance. 3. Practice self-affirmations: Taylor can remind themselves of their strengths and positive qualities. Positive self-talk can build confidence when it comes time to ask someone else to the dance. 4. Visualize a positive outcome: Instead of focusing on the possibility of rejection, Taylor should visualize a successful interaction – the person saying yes, sharing a great time at the dance, and making lasting memories. 5. Develop a backup plan: To ease anxiety, Taylor can consider other options if asking someone out is unsuccessful. Knowing that there is a backup plan, such as going with a group of friends, can make the task feel less daunting. 6. Approach the situation with enthusiasm and genuine interest: Taylor should know that genuine enthusiasm can be contagious. When asking another person to the dance with true interest and excitement, the other person might be more inclined to mirror those positive qualities. 7. Practice the ask: Taylor can try rehearsing what to say when asking the other person to the dance. This practice can help in finding the most comfortable, natural way of speaking and conveying the message. In conclusion, Taylor needs to get up the courage to ask another person to the dance following these suggestions. This will involve a combination of self-reflection, seeking support, focusing on visualization and positive thinking, practicing the act of asking, and approaching the situation with enthusiasm. By doing this, Taylor will be well-prepared to face their fears and ask someone else to the dance, regardless of any previous rejections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A telescope is an optical instrument that aids in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light). The first known practical telescopes were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, by using glass lenses. They found use in both terrestrial applications and astronomy. Within a few decades, the reflecting telescope was invented, which used mirrors to collect and focus the light. In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s. The word \\"telescope\\" now refers to a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors. The word \\"telescope\\" (from the Ancient Greek , \\"tele\\" \\"far\\" and , \\"skopein\\" \\"to look or see\\"; τηλεσκόπος, \\"teleskopos\\" \\"far-seeing\\") was coined in 1611 by the Greek mathematician Giovanni Demisiani for one of Galileo Galilei's instruments presented at a banquet at the Accademia dei Lincei. In the \\"Starry Messenger\\", Galileo had used the term \\"perspicillum\\". The earliest existing record of a telescope was a 1608 patent submitted to the government in the Netherlands by Middelburg spectacle maker Hans Lippershey for a refracting telescope. The actual inventor is unknown but word of it spread through Europe. Galileo heard about it and, in 1609, built his own version, and made his telescopic observations of celestial objects.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By Richard Shears PUBLISHED: 08:22 EST, 30 October 2012 | UPDATED: 14:56 EST, 30 October 2012 The young wife of North Korea’s leader has made her first public appearance in two months, bringing to an end what might have been a period of ‘home detention’ for being too carefree. Ri Sol-ju had been photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual manner when accompanying her husband Kim Jong-un, the newly appointed leader of the secretive Stalinist state. But then she disappeared from view, provoking speculation that she might be pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image promoted by her husband’s late father, Kim Jong-il.

In 1267, Genoa managed to capture the Tower of Flies and blockade the harbour of Acre for twelve days before being evicted by a Venetian flotilla. The ongoing warfare between Genoa and Venice had a major negative impact on the Kingdom's ability to withstand external threats to its existence. Save for the religious buildings, most of the fortified and defended edifices in Acre had been destroyed at one point or other and according to Rothelin, the continuator of William of Tyre's History, 20,000 men in total had lost their lives, a frightful number considering the Crusader states were chronically short on soldiery. The War of Saint Sabas was settled in 1270 with a pact to cease the hostilities between the Venetians and the Genoese. In 1288, Genoa finally received their quarter in Acre back. Answer this question: How many years was it between Genoa capturing the Tower of Flies and the settling of the War of Saint Sabas?","completion":"Okay, little buddy, let's find the answer together! Genoa captured the Tower of Flies in 1267, and the War of Saint Sabas was settled in 1270. Now, we want to know how many years passed between these events. So, let's do some simple math: 1270 - 1267 = 3 years. That's it! There were 3 years between Genoa capturing the Tower of Flies and the settling of the War of Saint Sabas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: Over-exercising your dog when he is young can lead to bone and joint issues that may lead to the development of hip dysplasia. Gentle, low impact exercises can be beneficial for puppies, but avoid letting your pup run, leap, or jump until he is physically mature. High impact sports like jumping and leaping can be hard on your puppy’s developing joints, so avoid doing these activities with your puppy until he is fully developed. Keep your dog active to help him stay physically fit with moderate exercise like running, walking, and swimming. Dogs with large, strong leg muscle mass may be less likely to develop hip dysplasia than dogs with a smaller muscle mass. Activities that might apply too much force on your dog’s joints, such as jumping for a Frisbee or leaping for a ball, can lead to development of hip issues. Consistent walking, running, and swimming can help your dog build muscle strength without putting too much stress on his body. Summary:","completion":"Over-exercising young dogs may cause bone, joint issues, and possibly hip dysplasia. High impact activities such as jumping and leaping should be avoided until a puppy is fully grown, as these exert unnecessary pressure on developing joints.

For anyone who wants to make a serious play for the Latino vote -- and not just go through the motions -- here's what you need to know: Latinos are single-issue voters. The issue is respect. Or, as we say, respeto. Nothing else matters. If you want the votes of Latinos, show some respect. Or we'll show you the door. I know what you're thinking. What's so special about this constituency? Three things: Size, geography and unpredictability. In 2008, about 10 million Latinos voted; the 2012 figure could be higher. Latinos are well represented in \\"battleground\\" states (i.e. Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico). And, in the case of the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who make up about 66% of the U.S. Latino population, they're in play because they have shown a willingness to vote for moderate Republicans even though most are registered Democrats. Polls show that Latinos are just like other voters in that they care about education, jobs, the economy and health care. But their antennae go up when they see politicians using the immigration issue to scare up votes -- and, in the process, treating them like piÃ±atas. That is disrespectful. And while neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney has gone that far, there is still a problem. Neither of these candidates seems to respect Latinos, as evidenced by their cynical attempts to manipulate the immigration issue and take gimmicky shortcuts to get Latino support. This is why both are having trouble with Latino voters. \\"Trouble\\" is defined differently for each candidate. In polls, Romney is having trouble getting as much as 30% of the Latino vote. Political observers note that a Republican presidential hopeful needs at least 35% to win. Obama has more than twice that level of support but his problem is that there's an enthusiasm gap and, if Latinos don't turn out for Obama, Romney will win. Romney took a wrong turn when he lurched to the right in the Republican primaries to pander to the nativist wing of the party. He portrayed illegal immigrants as takers and usurpers of public benefits and giveaways. He knows better. He is well aware of the fact that illegal immigrants -- most of whom come from Latin American countries -- are lured here by jobs offered by U.S. employers. Romney should have learned this lesson when it came to his attention, during his stint as governor of Massachusetts, that he had hired a landscaping company that employed illegal immigrants. Romney claimed that he didn't know the workers tending to his lawn were in the country illegally. Nonetheless, the experience should have illustrated for him the law of supply and demand: Without a demand for illegal immigrants, there would be no supply. Obama is not much better. Raised in a black and white world, the president doesn't know much about Latinos. And he hasn't seemed all that interested in learning. Our most important institution is the family. One good way to get on our bad side is to divide hundreds of thousands of families by deporting more than 1.2 million people in three years. And when you accomplish that feat by roping local police into the enforcement of immigration law through a program like Secure Communities in ways that invite ethnic profiling, this isn't going to win you any friends among Latinos. Finally, when you get caught in the act and these things come to light, it's not a good idea to insist that most of the folks deported were criminals, when criminal activity has been cited as a reason for deportation in only 17% of the cases last year. So far, in 2012, that figure is down to 14%. Who makes up the rest? It's likely that the answer is gardeners, housekeepers and nannies who pose no threat to society. Naturally, neither Romney nor Obama wants to talk about immigration. When Romney spoke to a Latino business group recently, he talked about education but didn't say a word about the DREAM Act, which would give legal status to undocumented students who go to college or join the military. When administration officials recently invited a group of Latina bloggers to the White House, the main topics of discussion were education and health while immigration was conspicuously left off the agenda. Guess what? Immigration came up anyway, when the bloggers asked about it during the question and answer session. That's the thing about immigration. Unless it is dealt with head-on, it seeps into the discussion of other issues. It happened during the health care debate, when what consumed many conservatives was the question of whether illegal immigrants could access benefits under \\"Obama-care.\\" Gentlemen, you can run but you can't hide. You have to talk about immigration. Until you clear the air, admit what you've done wrong, and try to make it right, you can't expect Latinos to listen to what you have to say on any other subject -- or if they do, to believe what they hear. Gov. Romney, stop pandering to racists and nativists in the GOP base by portraying illegal immigrants as takers; acknowledge that the only thing that lures them here are jobs provided by U.S. employers who need to be held accountable; stop proposing simplistic solutions like saying that all illegal immigrants should \\"self-deport\\"; and take up the cause of American businesses who can't find U.S. workers to do jobs that immigrants wind up doing because parents are raising their kids to feel entitled to avoid hard work. President Obama, stop saying you don't have the executive power to stop deportations when it has been established by a slew of legal experts, including nearly 100 law professors who recently sent a memo to the White House, that you do. Stop deportations of college-age students who would have been eligible for legal status under the Dream Act and the parents of U.S.-born children; stop portraying Republicans as singlehandedly preventing immigration reform, and take your share of responsibility for not getting it done; and propose to Congress a specific plan for comprehensive immigration reform. Do all that, and we'll be able to get past immigration and move onto other topics. Jobs. The economy. Education. The environment. Whatever you want. But immigration comes first, because it lets us assess your character. Or lack thereof. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.

Given the question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... How did the prison population drop below 1.5 million? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - There was a sharp increase in the number of inmates in federal prisons. - Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. - not enough information - Tough-on-crime policies were enacted in the 1990s. The answer is:","completion":"Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. The drop in the prison population below 1.5 million can be attributed to several factors, as mentioned in the provided information. The primary cause is the sentencing reforms that have been enacted in recent years at both the federal and state levels. These reforms have led to an eight-year downward trend in the U.S. prison population. In 2017, there was a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons, alongside decreases in several states with large prison populations. As a result, the total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000, with the number of federal prisoners falling to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declining to 1.3 million. It is important to note that the downward trend in the prison population is not solely due to recent sentencing reforms. The decline also reflects the evolving attitudes towards criminal justice and a shift away from the tough-on-crime policies that were enacted in the 1990s, which contributed to the growth of the prison population in the first place. However, it is still uncertain whether the trend of declining prison population in the U.S. will continue. The Vera Institute for Justice, the criminal justice reform organization that reported this information, cautions that the future of this trend depends on the ongoing efforts in criminal justice reform and how well communities continue to adopt and support decarceration strategies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory.

Start with the restaurant's name, \\"Aromi\\". Step 4: Incorporate the eatType, \\"coffee shop\\", into the sentence. This can be done by simply saying \\"Aromi is a coffee shop\\". Step 5: Add the type of food served, \\"Indian\\", to the sentence. This can be achieved by including it as an adjective, like this: \\"Aromi is an Indian coffee shop\\". Step 6: Include the customer rating, \\"5 out of 5\\", in the sentence. To do this, it can be helpful to use a short phrase, such as: \\"Aromi is an Indian coffee shop with a 5 out of 5 customer rating\\". Step 7: Mention the location, \\"city centre\\", in the sentence. This information can be added with the help of a preposition, like this: \\"Aromi is an Indian coffee shop with a 5 out of 5 customer rating, located in the city centre\\". Step 8: Finally, add whether the restaurant is family-friendly or not, \\"yes\\" in this case. This information can be included as a short phrase, like this: \\"Aromi is an Indian coffee shop with a 5 out of 5 customer rating, located in the city centre, and is family-friendly\\". Completed sentence: \\"Aromi is an Indian coffee shop with a 5 out of 5 customer rating, located in the city centre, and is family-friendly.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: If everything is not spelled out in a treaty, how are details clarified? Context: In the United States, the term \\"treaty\\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.","completion":"If everything is not spelled out in a treaty, details can be clarified through executive agreements.

I once had a neighbor who played it constantly, loudly, and badly, so I thought I knew it better. Malaquez tried to mediate, but I saw him as siding with Tasha. So, I think, did she.

The use of clothes labels, of which DROPS DESIGN forms part, is conditioned by the inclusion of the following text: 'A DROPS DESIGN made by...'.\\" Here's why I punctuated it this way: 1. A comma was placed after 'edited' because 'The photo may not be cut or edited' and 'the logo should be clearly visible' are two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction 'and'. This is a common place in sentences to insert a comma for clarity and readability. 2. I inserted a period after 'clearly visible' to create separation between this idea and the next independent thought about clothes labels. 3. I placed commas around 'of which DROPS DESIGN forms part' because it is a nonessential clause. It provides extra information about the clothes labels, but the sentence would be gramatically correct and understandable without it. Therefore, it's enclosed by commas. 4.

A:","completion":"This product review conveys a more negative sentiment overall. While the reviewer mentions that the story premise is okay, they express several issues they have with the book which contribute to the negative sentiment. Firstly, they mention that they believe the book should have been shorter, indicating dissatisfaction with the length. They also reveal that they skimmed through approximately 1/3 of the book, implying that there were parts of the content they did not find engaging or worth their full attention. Secondly, the reviewer discusses a specific issue with the narrative, expressing frustration with the recurring theme of characters wanting to touch or speak but being unable to do so. This frustration negatively impacts their perception of the book. Lastly, even though the reviewer's interest is piqued when they mention Abigail's fever, their underlying intention to hurry towards the end of the book suggests that they struggled to maintain interest.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft’s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce... The narrator believes that: - Microsoft is too greedy - not enough information - Microsoft is a better company now - Microsoft is worse than it was before Answer:","completion":"The news of Microsoft acquiring GitHub has brought about a variety of opinions and reactions from different people in the tech community. Some view this acquisition as a strategic move for Microsoft to better support developers, while others perceive it as an intrusion into the open source ecosystem. Despite some criticism, the overall outlook for the acquisition appears to be quite positive, and there are multiple reasons to believe that there is a bright future ahead for both Microsoft and GitHub. It is essential to understand that there have been significant changes in Microsoft's approach, especially under the leadership of their CEO, Satya Nadella. No longer the adversary of open source projects, Microsoft has emerged as a major investor and participant in numerous open source projects. In addition to hiring open source developers and running their own open source projects (such as VSCode), Microsoft actively sponsors and supports many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. While it is true that there still might be some deep-seated discomfort regarding Microsoft's involvement in open source, it is crucial not to overlook its evolution. Many employees of Microsoft genuinely appreciate their work at the company and share similar values and goals as developers and other members of the open-source community. Microsoft is undoubtedly not the same company it was in the late nineties, and its transformation has been significant. Despite the progress Microsoft has made, there is still a level of cynicism that lingers. This primarily stems from concerns over trust and the company's intentions with open source projects. However, it is important to remember that no company is perfect, and Microsoft's massive shift in its approach to open source signifies a willingness to adapt and grow. In conclusion, the acquisition of GitHub presents a promising future for both Microsoft and GitHub, as well as the open-source community as a whole. Although some skepticism still exists, it is important to recognize the substantial evolution Microsoft has undergone, especially regarding its involvement in open-source development. By continuing to engage and contribute to the open-source community, Microsoft has the potential to break down any lingering barriers and foster an environment of collaboration and progress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process would be to determine the mission objectives and requirements for the satellite, which will inform the type of orbit it needs to occupy. This decision depends on a variety of factors, such as the purpose of the satellite (communication, Earth observation, weather monitoring, etc.), desired coverage of the Earth's surface, and budget constraints. Based on these factors, an appropriate orbit can be selected, which can be one of the following three main categories: 1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO): Ranging from altitudes of 160 to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface, LEO satellites provide high-resolution imagery and communication services over short distances. They usually have an orbital period of 90-120 minutes and require frequent ground tracking. 2. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): Operating at altitudes of 2,000 to 36,000 kilometers, MEO satellites have larger coverage areas and allow communication signals to travel farther. These satellites are ideal for GPS navigation systems and have orbital periods ranging from 2 to 24 hours. 3. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO): Located at altitudes of around 36,000 kilometers, GEO satellites hover above a specific location on the Earth's equator, enabling uninterrupted coverage of the same area. These satellites have an orbital period equal to Earth's rotation (24 hours) and provide weather observation and communication services. Once the type of orbit has been decided, the subsequent steps can be outlined as follows: 1. Design and development of the satellite: Once the objectives and specifications for the satellite are defined, engineers can design and build the required components, such as power supply systems, control and stabilization systems, communication components, and payload instruments. Rigorous testing ensures the satellite's reliability and functionality during its operational lifespan. 2. Selection and preparation of the launch vehicle: After the satellite's development, a suitable rocket has to be chosen to transport the satellite into space. The satellite's mass, size, and desired orbit play crucial roles in this decision. The chosen rocket should be capable of accommodating the satellite payload and reaching the target orbit. 3. Assemble and integrate the satellite with the rocket: The satellite is carefully enclosed within the rocket's payload fairing, ensuring proper alignment and connectivity with the launch vehicle. Moreover, the satellite's systems are checked and final preparations are made before sealing the fairing. 4. Crew readiness and training: The personnel involved in the launch, such as mission control officers and ground crew, must be trained in their respective tasks, including telemetry monitoring, communications, and emergency procedures. Continuous coordination ensures a smooth execution of the mission. 5. Establish the countdown date and timeline: A suitable date for the launch must be chosen, taking into account weather conditions, availability of launch facilities, and potential restrictions stemming from air or ground traffic. Prior to the launch date, a detailed countdown timeline is set, outlining the activities at each phase, such as fueling of the rocket and various system checks. 6. Launch of the rocket: Once all the preparations are complete, the rocket is launched following the countdown sequence, carrying the satellite into space. 7. Deployment of the satellite in the target orbit: Upon reaching the desired orbit, the satellite is carefully deployed from the rocket, and it begins its various operational activities, including the orientation of solar panels, activation of communication antennae, and conducting its designed missions. By following these steps, a satellite can be successfully placed in its intended orbit to carry out its predefined functions, contributing to advancements in communication, research, and understanding of our planet."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Select from the following. -- negative; -- positive;","completion":"Based on the provided review, it can be concluded that the reviewer holds a negative opinion of the movie. The statement clearly indicates their dissatisfaction with the film's comedic elements, specifically citing the absence of wit and presence of labored gags. This suggests that the movie failed to deliver its intended humor and did not meet the reviewer's expectations in providing an enjoyable experience. Consequently, this directly contributes to a negative perception of the movie overall. In general, a positive review will highlight the aspects of a movie that the reviewer found enjoyable, praiseworthy, or well-executed. Examples of such commentary may include compliments on the plot, acting, special effects, or dialogue. On the other hand, a negative review, like the one provided, will typically criticize the movie's shortcomings and emphasize elements that the reviewer believes could have been improved upon. In this case, the reviewer's focus on the lack of wit and labored gags demonstrates their disappointment in the film's attempt at humor, which is a key aspect of the overall experience.

B. Use glue paste.","completion":"When it comes to repairing a broken statue, several factors need to be considered before choosing the most appropriate option. These factors include the material of the statue, the nature of the damage, and the purpose of the statue after repair (i.e., aesthetic display or functional use). Based on these factors, one must evaluate which out of the two options - A. Using super glue or B. Using glue paste - makes more sense to accomplish this goal. Option A: Using super glue Super glue, also known as cyanoacrylate, is a strong and quick bonding adhesive. It forms an almost instant bond within seconds of application and can provide considerable strength to the repair. Using super glue could be appropriate for certain types of materials such as resin, ceramic, and porcelain statues. Additionally, it is especially effective when repairing clean, precise breaks with minimal gaps. Benefits of using super glue include: 1. Faster curing time - Super glue bonds quickly, which can be advantageous if the statue needs to be restored and displayed rapidly. 2. Clear drying - Super glue forms a transparent bond, so it won't be as visible in the final repair. 3. High bonding strength - Super glue can offer high bonding strength and durability, depending on the material of the statue and the nature of the break. Drawbacks of using super glue include: 1. Brittle bond - Super glue can form a somewhat brittle bond, which might not be ideal for statues meant for outdoor display or those that face environmental exposure. 2. Necessity for precise alignment - The quick bonding time of super glue means that statue parts must be aligned correctly on the first try, which can be challenging. 3. Fewer options for gap filling - Super glue works best when the broken pieces fit together snugly, and it is less suitable for filling gaps in the statue. Option B: Using glue paste Glue paste, a mixture of adhesive and a thickening agent, is a versatile bonding solution. It is often used when dealing with porous materials like wood, paper, or textiles but can also be used in other applications and materials. Glue paste is typically less brittle and more flexible than super glue, and it's better suited for filling gaps between broken pieces. Benefits of using glue paste include: 1. More flexibility - Due to its less brittle nature, glue paste could be more suitable for outdoor statues or those that require a flexible adhesive. 2. Longer working time - Glue paste generally has a longer drying time, allowing more time for accurate alignment and adjustment of the broken pieces. 3. Better gap filling - Glue paste can be used to fill gaps in the statue more effectively than super glue. Drawbacks of using glue paste include: 1. Longer drying time - Glue paste usually takes longer to dry and bond, which may delay the repair process and display of the statue. 2. Potential visibility of repairs - Glue paste may not dry as clear or as invisibly as super glue, resulting in visible repairs. 3. Lower initial bonding strength - Glue paste may offer lower initial bonding strength, which may not be suitable for extremely heavy or large statues. Conclusion In conclusion, the choice between using super glue and glue paste would mainly depend on the material, the type of break or damage, and the purpose of the repaired statue. For clean, precise breaks with minimal gaps in materials like resin, ceramic, and porcelain, super glue would be a more suitable choice. On the other hand, glue paste would be ideal for statues that require a more flexible bond, have gaps to fill, or are made of porous materials. Additionally, it's essential to consider factors like drying time, bonding strength, and visibility of the repairs when choosing the appropriate adhesive. For best results, consult a specialist or read product instructions to determine which adhesive to use for your specific statue repair project."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Premise: \\"That the people with whom Brandon feels most at home would kill him if they knew his true gender is the movie's most tragic irony--and the one that lifts it out of the realm of gay-martyr hagiography and into something more complex and a meditation on the irrelevance of gender.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"It is sad to know that those close to him would not approve of his true identity. \\"?","completion":"If the premise holds true, it suggests that the film captures the tragedy of an individual named Brandon who is not accepted by the people he feels most connected to due to his true gender. This tragic irony works to emphasize that the film does not simply present a gay-martyr story, but rather engages in a deeper exploration of the complexities surrounding gender and societal norms. Consequently, the premise highlights the irrelevance of gender in determining one's identity, the value of relationships, and understanding one another as individuals. Analyzing the hypothesis, \\"It is sad to know that those close to him would not approve of his true identity,\\" it is clear that the sadness stems from the fact that Brandon forms deep connections with people who, ultimately, would reject him based on his true gender. This notion reflects the importance of acceptance and understanding in forming meaningful relationships, and how societal norms and expectations can sometimes disrupt these connections. In light of the premise, the hypothesis appears to be accurate as it recognizes the tragedy that Brandon faces in not being able to be genuine with those he cares about. It highlights the importance of acceptance and love, regardless of one's gender identity. Further, it serves as a reminder of the harsh reality for individuals who experience discrimination or persecution based on aspects of their identity, such as gender or sexual orientation. Moreover, the hypothesis emphasizes the critical nature of promoting empathy and understanding in society to foster more inclusive relationships, where individuals are not pushed away or discriminated against due to their gender identity. Ultimately, this sad reality that Brandon faces in the film shows how societal norms and expectations can stifle personal growth, relationships, and one's ability to be their authentic self. To conclude, if we accept the premise as true, it demonstrates that the film moves beyond the scope of a gay-martyr tale and delves into a multifaceted examination of gender and its impact on relationships and identity. This understanding, when applied to the hypothesis, confirms that it is indeed sad knowing that those close to Brandon would not approve of his true identity. The powerful message of the film's tragic irony lies in the exploration of the consequences of societal norms and the importance of empathy and understanding for more inclusive relationships and discussions of gender."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tracking these and other animals Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Marine biologist, Kevin Kocot believes one day he will solve the mystery of climate change through the study of tiny mollusks.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence indeed follows the preceding text, as it provides a focused insight into the objective of marine biologist Kevin Kocot and establishes a connection between his studies on tiny mollusks and their potential role in understanding the effects of climate change on marine life. To elaborate further, Kevin Kocot's in-depth research and extensive field experience in studying invertebrates provide him with a unique perspective on the marine ecosystem. As climate change continues to impact the planet, bringing about shifts in ocean temperatures, acidity levels, and oxygen levels, the marine life, including these tiny mollusks, are experiencing direct and indirect effects. Mollusks, being an integral component of the marine ecosystem, serve various essential functions. They are a vital food source for many marine creatures, contribute to nutrient recycling, and participate in bio-calcification processes that form structures such as shells and reefs. By examining the changes in mollusk distribution, morphology, and physiology in relation to climate change, Kocot aims to unravel the complex interplay of factors that drive these changes in the marine environment. Moreover, mollusks have been present in Earth's history for more than 500 million years, and their fossil record provides valuable information about past climate conditions. Thus, by comparing past and present mollusk populations, Kocot endeavors to detect crucial patterns that can reveal the mysteries of climate change and its impact on marine life—both in present times and the future. In conclusion, the sentence follows the preceding text as it further explains Kevin Kocot's research goals and establishes how meticulously studying tiny mollusks could potentially contribute to uncovering the effects of climate change on marine life. This knowledge, in turn, can help devise effective strategies to mitigate and adapt to these global challenges affecting ecosystems and, by extension, human society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - Chambers of rhetoric were dramatic societies in the Low Countries. Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the French word 'rhétoricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and lyrics. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early public relations for the city. - Chrétien de Troyes (\\"Christian\\") was a late-12th-century French poet and trouvère known for his work on Arthurian subjects, and for originating the character Lancelot. This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated). - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic. - Thibaut de Blaison , Blason , or Blazon ( died after March 1229 ) was a Poitevin nobleman , Crusader , and trouvère from a noble family with lands in Blason and Mirabel . Eleven poems -- one contested and one definitely spurious -- have been ascribed to Thibaut in the chansonniers . Three further anonymous songs have also been attributed to him by Terence H. Newcombe , his modern editor . Thibaut was the seneschal of Poitou and his uncle was Maurice , Bishop of Poitiers . In 1214 Thibaut helped negotiate a truce between Philip II of France and John of England . In 1212 he was taking part in the Reconquista in Spain and he was among the Albigensian Crusaders besieging Toulouse in 1218 . He appears alongside the trouvère Amauri de Craon in a document of 1219 . He attended the coronation of Louis IX in 1226 , along with the trouvère Hue de la Ferté . Theobald I of Navarre , also a trouvère , dedicated the song De ma dame souvenir to Thibaut and also used Thibaut 's Amours , que porra devenir as a model for a religious poem of his own . Gautier d'Espinal also borrowed the melody of Amours for one piece . Thibaut himself borrowed from rhythms from the polyphonic repertoire of the day . He may have based his Bien font Amours lor talent on the conductus Quid frustra consumeris and Chanter et renvoisier seuil on Sol sub nube latuit . With the exception of three chansons that are restricted to a sixth -- Amours , que porra devenir , Chanter et renvoisier seuil , and Huimain par un ajourant -- and one , Li miens chanters ne puet mais remanoir , which is severely restricted in movement , most of Thibaut 's melodies move freely . They are all basically syllabic , with only Li miens chanters exhibiting more complex melisma . Compared to his melodies ( all recorded in bar form ) , his prosody is usually simple , though three songs -- Bien font Amours lor talent , Bon jour ait hui cele a cui sui amis , and Quant je voi esté venir -- exhibit some variety . The simplicity of Bien font Amours is more in keeping with Thibaut 's... - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies. - Blason is a form of poetry. The term originally comes from the heraldic term \\"blazon\\" in French heraldry, which means either the codified description of a coat of arms or the coat of arms itself. The Dutch term is Blazoen, and in either Dutch or French, the term is often used to refer to the coat of arms of a chamber of rhetoric. - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. - In heraldry and heraldic vexillology, a blazon is a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb \\"to blazon\\" means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag traditionally has considerable latitude in design, while a blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements; thus it can be said that a coat of arms or flag is primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though often flags are in modern usage additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). \\"Blazon\\" also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms. What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'thibaut de blaison'? Choices: - composer - literary - performer - poet - public relations - reader - rhetoric - troubadour - trouvère","completion":"Thibaut de Blaison had the occupation of a trouvère, a poet-composer in the northern dialects of France. He was also a Crusader and a nobleman with his works mainly as lyric poetry. His role included composing and performing his songs, making him a performer as well. So, the objects having the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'Thibaut de Blaison' are trouvère, poet, composer, and performer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He grew up in Orange County, California, attending Cypress High School and the Orange County High School of the Arts, studying acting and musical theater and writing plays in his spare time. He hosted a public-access television show called Centurion Highlights, based on the school's mascot. In a 2015 interview, Aukerman said \\"I'm still doing that same show, just with celebrities instead of my high school cafeteria.\\" Context: After a brief period studying at the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts and touring the country as a musical theater actor, in 1995, at the request of his friends, Aukerman and Porter started performing at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles under the moniker \\"The Fun Bunch\\", a name meant to parody improvisation groups at the time. Mr. Show co-creator Bob Odenkirk was in the audience for the second performance, and soon tapped the duo to write for and occasionally perform on the show in its fourth season. This led to an Emmy nomination in 1999 for Aukerman and the rest of the staff. Aukerman appeared sporadically on the show, most notably as the model Theo Brixton in the Taint Magazine sketch. After the show's cancellation, Aukerman and Porter segued into writing film and television scripts, most notably Run Ronnie Run! and the first draft of the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In 2004, he and Porter received an \\"Additional Dialogue\\" credit on the animated feature film Shark Tale. They went on to write an unproduced script for the sequel, as well as an unproduced Shrek spin-off film based on the character Puss in Boots. In 2007, a feature film script he wrote with Porter and Odenkirk, titled Kanan Rhodes: Unkillable Servant of Justice, was purchased by MTV Films with the intent of starring Rainn Wilson, although it currently remains unproduced. Also in 2007, Aukerman released a self-described \\"joke record\\", Scott Aukerman's Koo Koo Roo's Greatest Hits, which featured Aukerman and Sarah Silverman Program writer Jon Schroeder shouting over current soft-rock hits. This was put out in limited release on AST Records. In 2009, Aukerman and Porter wrote a pilot script for NBC, titled Privates. The network ultimately passed on the show. That year, Aukerman took on the role as head writer for the 2009 MTV Movie Awards and executive produced and co-wrote a pilot for Comedy Central, The New Andy Dick Show. The network ultimately passed on ordering it to series. In 2010, Aukerman wrote a feature film script for friend Zach Galifianakis for Fox, and he and Patton Oswalt co-wrote a television pilot for Fox, which the network ultimately passed on. Later that year, Aukerman joined a \\"writers lab\\", writing film scripts for Imagine Entertainment. Question: When did his career begin?.

If the body gets too much protein, it can't save it all for later like a toy box. Instead, it breaks down the extra protein into different parts. Some parts are used for energy, and the leftover waste goes out of your body when you use the bathroom.

When he was 15 years old, his dad, a brave and kind police officer, was shot and killed while working to keep people safe. Fast forward five years later, and Tanner found out that his dad's old police car was going to be sold at a charity auction. Tanner really wanted his dad's car because it reminded him of his dad and made him feel close to him. The auction was held to raise money for a group called COPS, which helps families who lost their loved ones while they were bravely working as police officers. Tanner went to the auction, hoping to buy his dad's car, but the price went higher and higher. Poor Tanner did not have enough money to keep bidding. But then, something magical happened. A kind and generous man named Steve Wells, a rancher, won the bid for the car by paying 60,000.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

A mustang is what type of creature?","completion":"A Mustang is a type of horse, specifically a free-roaming, feral horse that is native to the Western regions of North America. The name \\"Mustang\\" comes from the Spanish word \\"mestengo,\\" which means \\"stray livestock animal.\\" These horses are descendants of domesticated Spanish horses that were brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers and settlers in the 16th century. Over time, these horses either escaped or were released from captivity, and they went on to breed with other horses in the wild, forming the distinct population known as the Mustang. Mustangs eventually adapted to their new environment, becoming more resilient and hardy than their domesticated counterparts. They are known for their strong endurance, sure-footedness, and level-headed temperament. These qualities make them highly sought after by riders and horse enthusiasts, particularly for western riding disciplines such as ranch work, rodeo competitions, and trail riding. However, due to their feral nature, they require experienced handlers for training and taming. In terms of physical appearance, Mustangs exhibit a wide variety of colors, patterns, and sizes, as they possess a diverse genetic background. The average height of a Mustang ranges from around 14 to 15 hands (56 to 60 inches, or 142 to 152 cm) tall, and their weight typically falls between 700 and 800 pounds (about 320 to 360 kg). Common coat colors include bay, black, chestnut, dun, and gray, among others. In order to protect and manage the population of Mustangs, the United States government passed the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971. The act grants protection to these horses, and the population is monitored and managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the United States Forest Service. The BLM conducts periodic roundups to help control the population numbers and finds homes for many Mustangs through its adoption program. Adopting a Mustang does require a certain level of experience, knowledge, and commitment, as they often need specialized training and handling to transition from a wild horse to a working or companion animal. Despite efforts to protect and manage the population, Mustangs still face threats, including habitat loss, disruption to their natural behavior due to human intervention, and potential risk of slaughter. Conservation and advocacy groups, such as the American Mustang Foundation, work tirelessly to promote awareness, protect the welfare of these horses, and ensure their future as an enduring symbol of the American West. In conclusion, a Mustang is a type of feral horse found in the Western regions of North America. Descended from Spanish horses, these creatures are known for their strength, endurance, and adaptability. They are closely tied with the history and culture of the American West, and their legacy is protected under national law and carefully managed by federal agencies. The Mustang is not just a creature, but a symbol of the untamed spirit and natural beauty that define the American landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

(which just went on the block) and Neiman Marcus (being sold by a PE group that includes TPG, Warburg Pincus, Leonard Green and Credit Suisse) — and then merging the two companies together. To be sure, there are some good business arguments for such a move. For example, a Citi research note points out that the two companies have some overlapping stores that drive down performance at each, and also that the combined company could have greater leverage over suppliers. And KKR may be able to mitigate the high asking price for Saks SKS – its current trades are around the same EBITDA multiple paid for Neiman Marcus, so a premium would be rich — by doing sale-leaseback transactions on its some of its underlying real estate assets. The bigger question may be one of logistics. Neiman Marcus shareholders originally began laying IPO groundwork last summer, and also appear to have been contemplating a parallel sale process. In other words, Neiman Marcus should be further along than Saks – a timeline issue exacerbated by the fact that it private-to-private deals like Neiman Marcus are usually easier/faster to complete than are public-to-private deals like Saks. Would KKR make the completion of Saks (or at least shareholder approval) a precondition to closing Neiman Marcus? And, if so, would Neiman’s private equity owners be willing to wait? Or does KKR have a model where Neiman Marcus can produce adequate returns on its own, with Saks serving as gravy? Not saying that such a two-step can’t be done, but it could be a tricky manuever.

What is the most logical next event? How to choose healthy cereals for your baby Read the nutrition label. When you're looking for a healthy and nutritious baby cereal, the first place you'll need to look is the food label. This is where you'll get a lot of information on the product and be able to compare to other items in the store.","completion":"The most logical next event after learning how to choose healthy cereals for your baby is to proceed by discussing factors to consider while reading the nutrition label and suggesting tips on making the right selection based on your baby's specific nutritional needs: 1. Check the ingredients list: Look for cereals with whole grains as the first ingredient, such as whole wheat, brown rice, or oat. Whole grains are rich in nutrients and can help promote digestive health in your baby. Avoid cereals containing added sugars, artificial colors, or preservatives, which could cause allergies or other adverse effects. 2. Analyze the sugar content: The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting the intake of added sugars during the first two years of life. Therefore, pick a cereal containing no or low amounts of sugar. You can add natural sweeteners like pureed fruits or a dash of cinnamon to enhance taste. 3. Assess the fiber content: Fiber helps to promote digestion and prevent constipation, which is a concern for babies during the early stages of solid food introduction. Choose a cereal with at least 2 grams of dietary fiber per serving. Fiber-rich cereals can support a baby's digestive system and bowel movements, making the transition from breast milk or formula to solid food smoother. 4. Look for fortified cereals: Iron-fortified cereals are preferable for babies above six months of age, as the primary source of their iron intake becomes food rather than milk; however, consult a pediatrician to verify iron levels for your baby. Additionally, fortified cereals may contain essential vitamins and minerals such as zinc, calcium, and Vitamin B that contribute to overall growth and development. 5. Consider your baby's age and food allergies: Choose cereals appropriate for your baby's age and development. Ensure that the cereal is not too coarse or difficult to swallow, especially if it's their first time eating solid foods. Gradually introduce new textures as your baby grows and becomes more accustomed to different types of grains. Also, be mindful of potential allergens like gluten when choosing cereals if your baby has a history of allergies or a family history of food-related allergies. 6. Opt for organic cereals: If possible, consider choosing certified organic cereals, which are made without pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This option may be healthier and potentially safer for your baby. 7. Taste test: Try out different flavors and textures to find the cereals that your baby enjoys the most. It is essential to encourage a healthy relationship with food from an early age, and providing a variety of tastes can foster this goal. In conclusion, selecting the healthiest cereal for your baby may seem daunting at first, but by using these guidelines based on nutritional labels and ingredients can help you make an informed decision. Remember to introduce new foods one by one and consult with a pediatrician about any concerns or questions related to your child's diet and nutrition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the name who supported himself in England, with the help of George Grove and others, by giving recitals? Answer the above question based on the context below: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Imagine your body is like a toy car that needs energy to run and play. To get energy, the car needs batteries, right? Well, your body also needs energy, and it gets it from the food you eat. Now, the food you eat needs to be turned into energy, just like putting batteries in the car. This process of turning food into energy is called cellular respiration, and it happens inside tiny little parts of your cells called mitochondria. You can think of mitochondria as the places where your body \\"charges\\" its batteries. So, the role of mitochondria is to help your body get energy from the food you eat. Now, about those two questions: They are very similar, and both want to know what mitochondria do. The first question is specifically asking about the role of mitochondria in cellular respiration (which is to help turn food into energy). The second question is more general, but the answer is still the same: Mitochondria help your body get energy.

While true exhibition matches are not uncommon, most matches tell a story analogous to a scene in a play or film, or an episode of a serial drama: The face will sometimes win (triumph) or sometimes lose (tragedy). Longer story arcs can result from multiple matches over the course of time. Since most promotions have a championship title, competition for the championship is a common impetus for stories.

Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Write a negative yelp review ( [-] negative; [-] positive;).","completion":"Title: A Disappointing Encounter Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ 1/5 Let me preface this review by saying that I usually try to find the silver lining in most situations, but my recent experience at this establishment warrants no such generosity. There are times when the reality falls drastically short of expectations. This particular instance at the place in question was an embodiment of the aforementioned statement. Upon entering the establishment, the first issue that came to my attention was the less-than-hospitable environment. Far from the comfort and warmth shown in the photos provided online, the real place was a stark contrast. The lighting felt uncomfortably harsh, more akin to a DMV office than a place of intended leisure. This fact was only accentuated by the indistinct noise echoing around, making it difficult to carry on any semblance of conversation. Next, let's discuss the service, which unfortunately didn't redeem the experience either. Though I understand that everyone can have a rough day, the waitstaff was notably aloof and inattentive. A long wait for service is undesirable, but even worse when coupled with staff that seemed more interested in their phones than in customer service. We faced multiple instances of incorrect orders and slow service, turning what was supposed to be a pleasurable experience into a frustrating one. As for the food, it left much to be desired. The presentation lacked refinement and appeared rushed. Beyond appearance, taste profiles of the dishes we ordered were lackluster. They lacked the balance of flavors crucial to their respective dishes. The quality of the ingredients brought into question their commitment to delivering value to their patrons. The prices, when considered with the quality of food and service, were exorbitantly high. To charge customers premium rates, one expects a corresponding level of quality, which was unfortunately absent. The overall value for the cost was poor, thus making it seem as though the business was more interested in their profit margins than delivering a satisfactory dining experience to its customers. Lastly, despite bringing these issues to the establishment's attention, the management seemed unbothered and didn’t offer an apology or effort to rectify the situation. This lack of customer service felt like a comprehensive disregard for consumers, an approach that seemed anchored in the establishment's ethos, given our encounter. In summary, my experience was characterized by a regrettable ambiance, significantly lacking service quality, uninspiring cuisine, inflated prices, and dismissive management. Based on this experience, I find it challenging to recommend this establishment and would caution potential visitors to temper their expectations. I wish the management and staff of this establishment the very best and hope they can use this feedback for substantial improvements in the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Fargo Movie plot: In the winter of 1987, Minneapolis car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) is desperate for money; repayment is due on a large GMAC loan that he fraudulently collateralized with nonexistent dealership vehicles. Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. After Carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, Gaear kills him. When two passing eyewitnesses spot Carl disposing of the body, Gaear kills them as well. The following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand), who is seven months pregnant, initiates a homicide investigation. Records from the murdered trooper's last traffic stop, along with a phone call to Proudfoot, placed at a local truck stop by two suspicious men, lead her to Jerry's dealership, where she questions Jerry and Proudfoot. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita (Steve Park), an old classmate who takes her to dinner, tells her that his wife, another classmate, has died, and attempts to seduce her.

Collect or obtain used coffee grounds. - Reason: Coffee grounds are a common household byproduct, and they are environmentally-friendly and non-toxic. 2.

Monitor snail activity in the garden to see if the coffee grounds are effective. - Reason: Observing the effectiveness of the coffee grounds provides insight on whether additional applications are required or if alternative methods should be tried. While spreading black pepper (option ii) around the garden might also deter snails due to their sensitivity to strong smells, it would likely be less effective and more costly than using coffee grounds.

The morbidly obese cat, who was three times heavier than a healthy cat, was a recent rescuer at a California animal shelter last month after his owners could no longer afford to keep him. Weighing a startling 36 pounds, Little Dude's life was full of complications that ultimately led to his untimely demise, drawing attention to the growing epidemic of pet obesity. Little Dude was welcomed into a foster home last month, where shelter staff diligently worked towards helping him lose weight and regain a semblance of quality of life. In just a few weeks, they managed to bring Little Dude's weight down by a few pounds as they continued their efforts to improve his health. Unfortunately, despite the staff's best efforts and numerous life changes, Little Dude ultimately succumbed to his health challenges on Saturday. The shelter staff attributed his death to the complications related to his severe obesity as well as the accumulated stress of the many alterations in his life in recent weeks. The loss of Little Dude serves as a humbling reminder of the consequences that pet obesity can have on our beloved animals' lives. It highlights the importance of responsible pet ownership and the need for each caretaker to prioritize their furry friend's well-being. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), approximately 58.2% of cats and nearly 56.1% of dogs in the United States are overweight or obese. These staggering numbers indicate that pet obesity is an issue that needs to be addressed on an urgent basis. Some of the most common health problems related to pet obesity include diabetes, osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, and a shortened life expectancy. With those risks in mind, it is essential for pet owners to pay close attention to their pets' overall health, eating habits, and exercise routines. They must actively work to prevent obesity by providing balanced, nutritional meals, implementing portion control, and engaging their pets in regular physical activity. Employing these practices can vastly improve the health and well-being of pets, ensuring they live happy lives devoid of any preventable health issues. Little Dude's story, while painful and unfortunate, is an eye-opener for pet owners. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible pet ownership, the risks associated with pet obesity, and the need for ongoing education and awareness about pets' nutritional and exercise requirements. Taking a proactive role in maintaining our beloved animals' health is the best way to honor Little Dude's memory and prevent other pets from suffering the same heartbreaking fate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 g/cm3). The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is: 2Li(s) + 2H 2 O(l) ⟶ 2LiOH(aq) + H 2(g).

FINAL EXAM Question 1. The horse-collar tackle is closely associated with what safety who played college football for the University of Oklahoma?","completion":"The horse-collar tackle is closely associated with a former football player from the University of Oklahoma named Roy Williams. Roy Williams is a former American college and professional football player who was a safety in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons during the 2000s. He was born on August 14, 1980, in California. He played college football for the University of Oklahoma, where he was a two-time All-American, and was recognized as outstanding college defensive back in the country. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys eighth overall in the 2002 NFL Draft, and he earned five straight Pro Bowl selections from 2003 to 2007. As safety, his primary role on the field was to stop the opposing team's wide receivers and make tackles. The infamous horse-collar tackle is often associated with Roy Williams due to an incident that occurred during the 2004 NFL season. He made numerous tackles using this technique, which is dangerous and can lead to severe injuries to the player being tackled. Consequently, it stirred up a lot of controversy. The horse-collar tackle method involves a player grabbing inside an opponent's shoulder pads or jersey from behind and quickly pulling down, which jerks the player backward. This abrupt move often causes the tackled player to fall backward or be flipped onto their head, leading to a high risk of injuries like sprains, fractures, or even paralysis. In December 2004, one of these tackles by Williams resulted in Terrell Owens, a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, suffering from a severe ankle sprain and a fracture in his leg. The incident led to substantial scrutiny of the horse-collar tackle, and the NFL subsequently banned the technique before the start of the 2005 season. Though Williams was also skilled in cover situations, he was best known for his hard hits, blitzing skills and his excellence in run support, his tackling style overshadowed these traits.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

Here is another sentence: Many sunken ships rest on the ocean floor. Does the term floor mean the same thing in both these sentences?","completion":"In both sentences, the term \\"floor\\" refers to the base or the lowest level of a structure or space; however, the context and implications of the term are different in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"The pit floor showed where a ring of post holes had been,\\" the term \\"floor\\" refers to the base of a pit, which is likely an excavated or dug-out area on land. This type of floor is specifically related to an archaeological or construction context – the surface upon which a structure is built, or a space created by earthmoving activities. The floor of a pit might be uncovered during an excavation or through other methods of archaeological research. It can provide crucial information about the previous occupants or usage of that area, as evidenced by the presence of post holes. In this context, the term \\"floor\\" is more closely associated with the ground or the lowest level of a terrestrial space. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"Many sunken ships rest on the ocean floor,\\" the term \\"floor\\" refers to the base of the ocean. The ocean floor is the lowest part of a water body – an underwater surface that consists of a variety of geographical and geological features such as trenches, ridges, and plains, as well as underwater ecosystems. This context is vastly different from that in the first sentence, as it addresses a marine environment and involves factors such as water pressure, marine life, and underwater geological formations. In this context, the term \\"floor\\" signifies the lowest level of an underwater space. In summary, while the term \\"floor\\" does indicate the lowest level or base of a space in both sentences, the specific meaning and context differ based on whether it is applied to a terrestrial pit (an excavated, constructed, or archaeological space) or the underwater base of the ocean.

The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier. Paragraph: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: The reaction in which beaker has a higher activation energy? Answer:","completion":"The reaction in beaker R has a higher activation energy. In the scenario given in the paragraph, the chemist pours equivalent amounts of two different liquids into two identical solutions housed respectively in beaker R and beaker T. The solution in beaker R remains unchanged after the addition of the liquid. Meanwhile, the solution in beaker T exhibits some form of change subsequent to the introduction of its liquid. This divergence in reactions indicates a differential in the catalytic effect of the specific liquids added. The theory supporting this centers on constructing an understanding about how catalysts function. Catalysts, by their fundamental working principle, provide a lower energy pathway for reactions, which effectively decrease the requisite activation energy. This lower energy barrier empowers more collisions to occur, successfully overcoming this barrier, thus accelerating the transformation rate from reactants to products. Under such circumstances, an immediately observable change in the beaker's contents would be expected since the addition of the liquid in effect enhances the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy. Conversely, in a situation where the activation energy remains high, fewer collisions manage to overcome the energy barrier and, as a result, the transformation of reactants to products is noticeably slower or potentially even visually imperceptible, mimicking the scenario in beaker R. Therefore, based on the information presented and the principles of chemistry, the reaction in beaker R has a higher activation energy. The lack of observable change in beaker R suggests that the liquid added didn't act effectively as a catalyst, thus the reaction would need a higher amount of energy to proceed, leading to a higher activation energy. Conversely, the observed change in beaker T signifies that the liquid added to this beaker acted as a catalyst and consequently reduced the activation energy required, resulting in a visibly quicker reaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants that contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed. Q: In seed plants, after fertilization, what will the ovule eventually develop into? A: The answer is:","completion":"In seed plants, after fertilization, the ovule will eventually develop into a seed. This transformation occurs as a result of the reproductive process taking place within the ovule, which houses the female gametophyte. Here is a more detailed explanation of the role of the ovule in seed plant reproduction and its development into a seed: 1. Initially, within the ovule, there is a tiny female gametophyte, which is responsible for producing an egg cell. This egg cell contains the genetic material necessary for the formation of a new plant. 2. The process of fertilization occurs when a sperm cell, which is produced by the male reproductive structure called pollen, unites with the egg cell within the ovule. This union of sperm and egg results in a fertilized egg or zygote, which now contains a complete set of genetic information from both parents. 3. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of cell divisions, eventually leading to the formation of an embryo. This embryo contains the beginnings of the root, shoot, and leaf structures that will eventually develop into the mature plant. 4. As the embryo continues to grow, the ovule itself also undergoes changes to accommodate and nourish the developing new plant. The cells of the ovule's outer layers begin to differentiate and form specialized tissues, such as the seed coat, which will protect the embryo and help it to survive in different environmental conditions until it is ready to germinate. Additionally, some of the other cells in the ovule will serve as the source of food reserves for the growing embryo in the form of stored nutrients, such as starch, lipids, and proteins. 5. Eventually, the entire structure of the ovule, including the embryo and the surrounding specialized tissues, will develop into a mature seed. This seed contains all the necessary components needed for the emergence of a new plant, allowing it to survive, grow, and reproduce once it germinates in a suitable environment. In summary, the ovule in seed plants plays a critical role in the reproduction process, as it houses the female gametophyte responsible for producing the egg cell. Once fertilization occurs, the ovule undergoes a series of developmental changes to transform into a seed, which carries the potential for a new plant's growth and continuation of the plant's life cycle."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: My daughter went to see The Wild One recently and she commented that Marlon Brando was wearing jeans so long ago. Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \\"cool\\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \\"Tiffany's look\\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \\"geisha trips\\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events. The fashion is also beginning to spread to western countries. Question: What does the film Memoirs of a Geisha lead to? Options: A: The popularity of the Chinese actress.

A semi truck pulling several fuel tankers drives by, followed by a black Buick GNX containing Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) and two older pickup trucks. Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker. Letty is already spraying the hitch connecting the fuel tankers to each other and smashes it with a hammer once it's frozen so the last two tankers become detached and eventually come to a stop. As the second pickup is preparing the same feat (with Dom talking to them on walkie-talkies, hinting that they're not particularly great at what they are doing), Letty is standing on top of one of the tankers, and the semi driver sees her in his rear view and begins to speed up, hitting the GNX. Things get a little hectic, and the second pickup is pretty much getting dragged since they pulled off the U-turn and are connected to the trailer hitch. Letty gets knocked off of her feet but hangs on, though her hammer falls. While driving alongside of her, Dom orders Letty to spray the hitch, despite her no longer having a hammer. He instead pulls a 180-degree turn with the rear end of his car hitting the tanker, which shatters the frozen hitch, though he is now driving in reverse. At this point, they are already heading downhill, and the semi driver jumps out with his pet lizard.

Chrysanthemum boreale (or \\"Dendranthema boreale\\") is a flowering plant within the Asteraceae family and \\"Chrysanthemum\\" genus. It used to be in the compositae family and many books still contain as such. It is a perennial flowering plant that is often noted because of its yellow flowers. It has 18 chromosomes at the diploid stage. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Accoring to many books, Chrysanthemum boreale belongs to compositae family\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"According to many books, Chrysanthemum boreale belongs to the compositae family\\" is technically accurate as per the provided information. However, it's important to note that classifications and nomenclature in the field of botany can often undergo revisions as scientists' understanding of plant relationships and related genetic data evolves over time. To elaborate, Chrysanthemum boreale, a member of the Asteraceae family, was previously classified under the Compositae family. Compositae is an older designation for what is now commonly known as the Asteraceae family. Therefore, older texts, references, or resources might refer to Chrysanthemum boreale—and indeed other plants—as a member of the Compositae family. However, in the modern plant taxonomy, the family Compositae has been largely substituted by Asteraceae. The rationale behind this change is to reflect recent genetic and molecular research that suggests a more accurate way to classify these plants. So, to clarify, Chrysanthemum boreale is still the same plant it was even when it was classified under Compositae. The change in nomenclature represents revised thinking and understanding in the scientific community, not a change to the plant itself. Therefore, it might be more accurate and contemporary to assert that Chrysanthemum boreale currently belongs to the Asteraceae family, even though older texts might refer to it as belonging to the Compositae family. This highlights the need for periodic updates to biological nomenclatural references to reflect current, more accurate scientific consensus and to avoid potential confusion. In terms of the fundamental biology of Chrysanthemum boreale, this plant is a perennial species, meaning it lives for more than two years. Known for its yellow flowers, it's also notable for having 18 chromosomes in its diploid stage, indicating that it possesses two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent – which is a common characteristic for most animals and many plants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"The second sentence \\"I wish I could play like I used to when I was younger\\" is not explicitly entailed by the first sentence. Entailment, in linguistics, refers to the logical relation between two sentences where the truth of one requires the truth of the other. In other words, if sentence 1 is true, then sentence 2 must also be necessarily true. Looking closely at the first sentence, it does narrate a story where the speaker used to be a good piano player but became involved in many other things, and they no longer have a piano to play on. The speaker also expresses some degree of regret about this situation, seeing it as \\"sad\\" that they have let their piano playing ability \\"slip away\\". Meanwhile, the second sentence is a standalone statement where the speaker expresses a desire to be able to play the piano as they used to in their younger days. While one can reasonably infer or interpret a sense of longing or wishful thinking from the first sentence based on its overall sentiment, the first sentence does not explicitly state a wish or a desire to be able to play like the speaker used to. Thus, we cannot say that the second sentence is logically entailed by the first. It's more of an implied sentiment rather than a clearly stated fact. However, these two sentences obviously share a common theme and contribute to building a coherent narrative about the speaker’s relationship with piano playing over time. Yet, while they are related in theme and sentiment, direct entailment does not exist between them. The first sentence does not necessitate the truth of the second sentence. It's possible to feel sad about losing a skill without necessarily wishing to regain it. So, while the sentiment of the second sentence is consistent with the first sentence, a logical entailment does not exist."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Gerri Peev. PUBLISHED:. 19:26 EST, 17 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:26 EST, 17 October 2013. Alan Milburn called on the Government to slash winter fuel payments and free TV licences. Pensioners must shoulder some of the burden of the spending cuts or their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state, the Government’s social mobility tsar has said. Alan Milburn, a health secretary under Labour, called on the Government to slash universal benefits for over-65s such as free TV licences and winter fuel payments. He said it was ‘unfair’ that better-off pensioners were protected from the impact of the cuts while working families with children were bearing two-thirds of the burden of cutting the deficit. His comments were dismissed as ‘bonkers’ by pensioners’ groups, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who said: ‘Punishing pensioners isn’t going to help a single child achieve more in life.’ David Cameron’s official spokesman also dismissed the claims, saying: ‘The Prime Minister believes it’s right to make the commitments he’s made to pensioners and to introduce the triple lock which means pensioners will get a 2.7 per cent rise.’ Mr Milburn’s Social Mobility Commission unveiled its report on the state of the nation yesterday. He warned that the burden of cuts had fallen disproportionately on middle-class families, and that for the first time in more than a century there was a risk that the next generation of adults could end up with lower living standards than today’s generation. As a result, Mr Milburn claimed pensioners should shoulder more of the burden. The report highlights that the number of pensioners is rising, their state benefits are going up and the numbers who can fund them are in decline. It said ministers had allowed an ‘inter-generational injustice’ which sees better-off pensioners protected but families with children bearing two-thirds of spending cuts. ‘We do not believe that favouring pensioners over their children and grandchildren will be a sustainable position over the long-term if a meaningful dent is to be made in the UK’s high levels of child poverty and low levels of social mobility,’ it added. Mr Milburn said pensioners should shoulder more of the burden and said their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state (file picture) Nick Clegg said: 'Punishing pensioners isn¿t going to help a single child achieve more in life' Mr Milburn later told the Mail that the Government was simply trying to protect its share of the vote among pensioners. ‘I just don’t think it’s right that you have ordinary hardworking middle-income families who are finding their finances being squeezed and their public finances being cut and, at the same time, wealthy pensioners seeing their benefits not just protected but enhanced,’ he said. ‘I think that is going to be increasingly hard to justify.’ He added that sparing pensioners from being charged the spare room subsidy if they rented homes that were bigger than they needed was also ‘part of the same picture’. ‘Pensioner benefits are rising by 17.5 per cent during the course of this parliament,’ he said. ‘That is equivalent to half of the reductions in expenditure on welfare. ‘I understand politically why a. Government would want to protect pensioners who vote, but you can’t say. you want a fair fiscal deficit reduction and then you don’t do it. fairly.’ Polls showed. wealthy pensioners would be happy to give up their winter fuel. allowances and free TV licences and bus passes, Mr Milburn said, adding. that cutting perks for all but the poorest pensioners – who receive. pension credit – could save £1.4billion a year. ‘Grandparents are more concerned about what is good for their children than themselves. ‘The. decline in social mobility is not just a problem for low-income. families, it’s definitely a problem for middle-income families too. ‘The gap is widening between the wages that people are getting, the prices that they are paying and the fact that their children are finding it hard to get on the housing ladder. ‘That is the reason why Middle England is feeling uncomfortable about the prospects for the next generation.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

The reason for the firemen's later arrival was because \\"they were coming from so far away.\\" In this context, the pronoun \\"they\\" refers to the firemen. However, the original statement does not provide any explicit information about the distance the police had to cover to arrive at the scene. While the statement does not say the police were coming from a shorter distance, we might infer from the given information that the police's distance may be shorter than that of the firemen, allowing them to arrive before them. Now, let's evaluate the available choices: [a]. no; Referring to the choice 'no', it would mean that the statement \\"The police were coming from so far away\\" is false. However, this choice is not supported by the information given in the problem statement, as there is no clear assertion suggesting that the police were coming from a close distance. The statement merely provides a comparative scenario between the distances covered by the firemen and the police. [b]. yes; The option 'yes' is more plausible based on the given information. By acknowledging that \\"The police were coming from so far away\\" is true, we accept that the police might have also been coming from a considerable distance.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel? Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

PUBLISHED:. 16:15 EST, 29 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 21:44 EST, 29 September 2013. NASA is preparing to launch a 3-D printer into space next year, a toaster-sized game changer that greatly reduces the need for astronauts to load up with every tool, spare part or supply they might ever need. The printers would serve as a flying factory of infinite designs, creating objects by extruding layer upon layer of plastic from long strands coiled around large spools. Doctors use them to make replacement joints and artists use them to build exquisite jewelry. In NASA labs, engineers are 3-D printing small satellites that could shoot out of the Space Station and transmit data to earth, as well as replacement parts and rocket pieces that can survive extreme temperatures. Made in space: Project manager Matthew Napoli, left, and director of research and development Michael Snyder test a 3D printer which will eventually be used in space. ‘Any time we realize we can 3-D print something in space, it's like Christmas,’ said inventor Andrew Filo, who is consulting with NASA on the project. ‘You can get rid of concepts like rationing, scarce or irreplaceable.’ The spools of plastic could eventually replace racks of extra instruments and hardware, although the upcoming mission is just a demonstration printing job. ‘If you want to be adaptable, you have to be able to design and manufacture on the fly, and that's where 3-D printing in space comes in,’ said Dave Korsmeyer, director of engineering at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, about 35 miles south of San Francisco. For the first 3-D printer in space test slated for fall 2014, NASA had more than a dozen machines to choose from, ranging from 300 desktop models to 500,000 warehouse builders. Test run: Tools and parts made by a 3D printer are displayed. One of the biggest obstacles to space exploration is that you need to bring everything with you including tools, equipment, spare parts and satellites. All of them, however, were built for use on Earth, and space travel presented challenges, from the loads and vibrations of launch to the stresses of working in orbit, including microgravity, differing air pressures, limited power and variable temperatures. As a result, NASA hired Silicon Valley startup Made In Space to build something entirely new. ‘Imagine an astronaut needing to make a life-or-death repair on the International Space Station,’ said Aaron Kemmer, CEO of Made in Space. ‘Rather than hoping that the necessary parts and tools are on the station already, what if the parts could be 3-D printed when they needed them?’ When staffing his start up in 2010, Kemmer and his partners warned engineers there would be ups and downs - nauseating ones. In more than a dozen flights in NASA's ‘vomit comet’ reduced-gravity aircraft, Made In Space scientists tested printer after printer. Ready for launch: Aaron Kemmer, CEO and co-founder of Made in Space, looks through some items. Specialized 3D printers would allow astronauts to produce the things they need on-demand when they're in space, allowing them to travel farther from the Earth. Last week at their headquarters on NASA's campus, Made In Space engineers in lab coats and hair nets tinkered with a sealed 3-D printer in a dust free cleanroom, preparing the models for further pre-launch tests. As proof of its utility, the team revisited the notorious 1970 moon-bound Apollo 13 breakdown, when astronauts were forced to jerry-rig a lifesaving carbon dioxide filter holder with a plastic bag, a manual cover and duct tape. A 3-D printer could have solved the problem in minutes. ‘Safety has been one of our biggest concerns,’ said strategic officer Michael Chen. Sparks, breakages and electric surges can have grave consequences in the space station. ‘But when we get it right, we believe these are the only way to manifest living in space,’ he said. Space-bound printers will also, eventually, need to capture gasses emitted from the extruded plastics, be able to print their own parts for self-repairs and have some abilities to recycle printed products into new ones. Scott Crump, who helped develop 3-D printing technology in 1988 by making a toy frog for his daughter with a glue gun in his kitchen, said he never conceived how pivotal it could be for space travel. But he said that until metal becomes commonly used in 3-D printers, the applications will be limited. ‘The good news is that you don't have to have this huge amount of inventory in space, but the bad news is now you need materials, in this case filament, and a lot of power,’ he said. NASA and other international space agencies are pressing forward with 3-D printing. Mastering space manufacturing, along with finding and producing water and food on the moon or other planets, could lead to living on space. Last month, the space agency awarded Bothell, Wash.-based Tethers Unlimited 500,000 toward a project to use 3-D printing and robots to build massive antennas and solar power generators in space by 2020. It replaces the expensive and cumbersome process of building foldable parts on Earth and assembling them in orbit. For Made In Space's debut, when it's shuttled up to the space station aboard a spaceflight cargo resupply mission, the initial prints will be tests - different small shapes to be studied for strength and accuracy. They're also discussing with NASA about what the first real piece that they should print will be. Whatever it is, it will be a historic and symbolic item sure to end up in a museum someday. ‘It's not something we're discussing publicly right now,’ said CEO Kemmer. Then, Jason Dunn, the chief technology officer, beckoned, dropping his voice as he grinned. ‘We're going to build a Death Star,’ he joked softly, referring to the giant space station in the ‘Star Wars’ movies that could blow up planets. ‘Then it's all going to be over.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article is about NASA preparing to send a 3D printer into space next year.

This can help them save space and weight on their spacecraft by not having to bring everything they might need with them. A company called Made In Space was asked by NASA to build a special 3D printer that can work well in space. They went on many airplane rides that made them feel like they were in space so they could test how well the 3D printer would work there. In the future, when astronauts need to fix something or build something new in space, they may be able to use a 3D printer like this one to make the parts they need instead of having to wait for supplies to be sent from Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why do the Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","completion":"The Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan for several reasons that revolve around their concerns about its impact on the economy, the federal deficit, and the distribution of benefits among different income groups. Here are some key reasons why the Democrats do not support the Trump tax plan: 1. Benefits skewed towards the wealthy: Democrats argue that the proposed tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthiest individuals and large corporations, at the expense of the middle class and working families. They believe that the plan's provisions, such as the lowering of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the reduction of the top individual income tax rate, and the elimination of the estate tax, would mainly benefit the rich, further exacerbating the income inequality in the United States. 2. Increase in federal deficit: Critics of the tax plan, including many Democrats, are concerned about its impact on the federal deficit. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the tax plan would add approximately 1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Democrats argue that this increase in the deficit would have long-term negative effects on the economy and would likely lead to cuts in key social programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which benefit vulnerable populations. 3. Limited economic growth potential: Democrats dispute the Republicans' claim that the tax cuts are essential for generating significant economic growth and job creation. Several independent analyses have suggested that the tax cuts would provide only modest economic growth and would not be sufficient to offset the increase in the federal deficit. Democrats argue that alternative approaches to taxation and public investment would be more effective in promoting economic growth. 4. Temporary benefits for individuals, permanent for corporations: The Trump tax plan proposes temporary tax cuts for individuals that would expire after 2025, while the corporate tax cuts would be permanent. Democrats argue that this approach demonstrates preferential treatment of corporations over individual taxpayers, and that working families would ultimately face tax increases once the temporary cuts expire. 5. Reduction in state and local tax deductibility: The limitation on the deductibility of state and local taxes under the Trump tax plan is a significant concern for Democrats, particularly those representing constituents in high-tax states. By reducing the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from federal income tax, this provision would effectively impose a double tax burden on many taxpayers and potentially lead to reduced public investment in vital services such as education, infrastructure, and public safety. These reasons, among others, have led Democrats to strongly oppose the Trump tax plan. They contend that the plan is inequitable, fiscally irresponsible, and detrimental to long-term economic growth and the well-being of middle-class and working families."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian...

Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a wealthy Cuban businessman, sends for American Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie) to sail to his country to be his bride. Julia departs from the ship, looking nothing like the photos she's sent prior to her voyage. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is interested in a pretty face, and that's why she's been deceptive - substituting a plain-looking woman in place of her own picture. Luis also admits to deception; he's been misleading her into believing he's a poor working man, instead of the rich owner of a coffee company. Luis and Julia wed within hours of her setting foot in Cuba. Luis falls passionately in love with his new wife. Meanwhile, Julia's sister Emily has been trying to contact her, worried about her after such a long trip to a strange land.

The remaining fragments of the U.S. government and military hide out in fortified military bases and colonies, attempting to find a solution to the zombie pandemic. Sarah, Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator William \\"Bill\\" McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their base to Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They encounter a large horde of the undead, and return to their army base in the Everglades, where a small group of scientists, supported by a skeleton crew of soldiers, is searching for a way to stop or reverse the re-animation process. Dr. Logan, the lead scientistÂ â also known as \\"Frankenstein\\" due to his grisly surgical dissections of zombies Â â believes that the zombies can be trained to become docile, and accordingly has amassed a collection of test subjects, which are kept in a large underground corral in the compound, in spite of the objections of base-commander Captain Henry Rhodes. The tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, loss of communication with other survivors, and slow progress in research. During a meeting between the scientists and the soldiers, Rhodes announces that he is taking command of the base, that the scientists henceforth will work under his orders, and that anyone who objects will be instantly killed. Dr. Logan hopes to secure Rhodes' cooperation by showing him the results of his research. He is especially proud of \\"Bub\\", a docile zombie who remembers some parts of his past life and engages in rudimentary human behavior: listening to music, aiming a pistol, and saluting Captain Rhodes. \\"Civil behavior must be rewarded,\\" Logan says. \\"If it's not rewarded, there's no use for it. There's just no use for it at all!\\" Rhodes is not impressed.

The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Late in the 4th quarter, CB Nate Clements intercepted Matt Ryan's pass which should have sealed the game for the 49ers who were then up 14 - 13. However, instead of going down, Clements continued down the left sideline attempting to score. He would return the interception 39 yards before Falcons WR Roddy White was able to strip the ball from him and the Falcons recovered the fumble. After regaining possession, the Falcons drove down the field again and this time was able to win the game on a 43-yard field goal by Matt Bryant, giving the 49ers another loss.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The thalidomide tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill to enhance drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth had to prove to FDA that their drugs were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.\\"? Answer:","completion":"One suitable question for this passage could be: \\"How did the thalidomide tragedy impact drug regulation in the United States, and what specific changes were implemented following the enactment of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment in 1962?\\" This question encourages students to engage with the text by asking them to identify the key event (the thalidomide tragedy) that led to the resurrection and subsequent enactment of the Kefauver-Harris Amendment. Additionally, the question prompts students to examine and understand the multiple changes that were implemented due to the amendment, such as: 1. Manufacturers being required to prove their drugs' efficacy and safety to the FDA before being sold. 2. The FDA gaining authority to regulate prescription drug advertising and establish good manufacturing practices. 3. The requirement for all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 to be proven effective. 4. The resulting FDA - National Academy of Sciences study showing that nearly 40% of the products from this period were not effective, and the subsequent similar study on over-the-counter products. Asking such a question would test the students' ability to comprehend the passage and extract relevant information while recognizing the significant impact of the thalidomide tragedy on drug regulation and the changes it brought in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: AOL Inc. and several private-equity firms are exploring making an offer to buy Yahoo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, devising a bold plan to marry two big Internet brands facing steep challenges. Silver Lake Partners and Blackstone Group LP are among the firms that have expressed interest in teaming up with AOL to buy Yahoo or trying to take it private on their own, these people said. They added that at least two or three other firms could be interested in participating if a formal buyout proposal is drawn up. The people familiar with the matter cautioned that these discussions—involving private-equity firms, AOL executives and financial advisers—are preliminary and don't yet involve Yahoo. The conversations may not lead to an approach given the complexities in structuring a proposal, the people said. Spokeswomen for Yahoo and AOL declined to comment. Yahoo has asked its banker Goldman Sachs about the rumors, verify whether they are credible and if there is an approach, what steps to follow, a person familiar with the matter said. The person characterized these discussions as routine in response to market speculation. Yahoo has a long-standing relationship with Goldman, which advised it on Yahoo's takeover defense against Microsoft Corp. in 2008. AOL, which spun off from Time Warner Inc. in late 2009, currently has a market capitalization of 2.68 billion, far smaller than Yahoo's 20.56 billion market value. Shares of Yahoo on Thursday afternoon were up 4.3%, or 65 cents, to 15.90, after having spiked up further in the morning, following an unusual day of trading Wednesday. On Wednesday, the shares rose 5.7% to 15.25 at 4 p.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Some 49.6 million Yahoo shares changed hands on Wednesday considerably higher than the average of 17 million shares a day so far this month. It was one of the best-performing tech stocks of the day. One of the scenarios under discussion among the buyout firms is a complex deal in which China's Alibaba Group would buy back Yahoo's roughly 40% stake in Alibaba, the people said. Some of Yahoo's other assets would also be sold off to interested media or technology firms, and the remaining company would be of a much smaller valuation that private-equity firms could get financing for, one of the people said. Another scenario involves AOL combining its operations with Yahoo in a reverse merger after Yahoo disposes of the Alibaba stake, the people said. It is unclear if the resulting entity would be listed publicly. Alibaba Chief Executive Jack Ma has expressed interest in repurchasing Yahoo's stake in his company, which analysts value at about 10 billion. A big chunk of Yahoo's current market value comes from its Alibaba stake. Separately, AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong has also talked privately about the idea that Yahoo could buy AOL, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another person familiar with the matter said private-equity firms may also look to partner with media companies to buy Yahoo. A combined Yahoo-AOL would have greater scale to compete in online advertising against industry juggernaut Google Inc. While both companies draw huge amounts of users, their advertising businesses have struggled as they've faced competition from a range of websites. The scenarios being discussed are similar to ones financial firms have discussed before. Yahoo and AOL discussed a merger in 2008, as Yahoo weighed a 45 billion takeover offer from Microsoft Corp. Microsoft eventually pulled its bid. While private-equity firms have long contemplated a deal for Yahoo, talks have heated up in recent weeks as several senior Yahoo employees have left the company, intensifying pressure on Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz to prove she can turn the company around, the people familiar with the matter said. Ms. Bartz has improved Yahoo's profitability by cutting costs, but revenue hasn't grown much and the company faces other problems. The Internet pioneer, for example, has shown fewer benefits than competitors from a broad recovery in display advertising—an area where it faces increasing competition from Google and Facebook Inc. The company, which reports third-quarter earnings next week, claims that more than 600 million people use its home page, email service or other sites every month. But the number of Yahoo pages viewed by its users, known as \\"user engagement,\\" began shrinking in the second quarter. Yahoo also has seen a drop in the value of advertising against content that Yahoo pulls from other sources. Ms. Bartz said in a recent interview she needed more time to pull off a turnaround. —Amir Efrati contributed to this article. Write to Jessica E. Vascellaro at jessica.vascellaro@wsj.com and Anupreeta Das at anupreeta.das@wsj.com ||||| Stock Chart for Yahoo! Inc (YHOO) Yahoo! Inc., which spurned an acquisition bid from Microsoft Corp. in 2008, is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help defend against possible takeover approaches, said three people familiar with the matter. While the Sunnyvale, California-based company hasn’t received an offer, Yahoo has been working with advisers for about two weeks to field any approach, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. AOL Inc. has talked with private-equity funds including Silver Lake about a possible bid, two people familiar with the matter said. Yahoo climbed 4.5 percent today after paring earlier gains of as much as 9.9 percent. The company had lost half its value since Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, withdrew an almost 50 billion bid in 2008, and sales haven’t grown under Chief Executive Officer Carol Bartz, leaving Yahoo vulnerable to fresh overtures. “The shareholders own this company and the shareholders have lost a lot of value because of the actions of the directors and the management of this company,” said Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc., which holds Yahoo shares. “Something’s going to happen.” Discussions between AOL and private-equity firms are preliminary and have recently focused on a possible purchase of parts of Yahoo, two people said. The private-equity funds have weighed raising 10 billion to 12 billion, these people said. Takeover Defense Neither AOL nor private-equity funds have made an approach to Yahoo, the people said. Representatives of AOL, Yahoo and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Yahoo began preparing for an outside offer after some of its advisers picked up tips that private-equity funds were trying to raise money for a takeover, these people said. Private-equity firms, bankers and some Yahoo investors have been pitching the idea of a Yahoo takeover to AOL and News Corp., according to a person familiar with the conversations. The idea is that Yahoo should focus on being a media company and align itself with another media-focused business, the person said. A spokeswoman for News Corp. declined to comment. Yahoo rose 68 cents to 15.93 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. AOL fell 17 cents to 24.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. AOL has gained 7.2 percent this year. After withdrawing its Yahoo takeover bid, Microsoft struck a 10-year agreement to handle search for Yahoo’s sites. Microsoft has no current plans to make another bid for Yahoo and expects that its search deal would stand up to a change of ownership, two people familiar with the matter said. Ballmer’s Comments Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, when asked whether he’s interested in bidding for all or part of Yahoo, said that’s “not something I’m working on.” Asked to elaborate, he declined to comment. Earlier he had held a question-and-answer session at the University of Washington in Seattle. AOL’s discussions focus on bringing Yahoo’s media operations under the management of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, according to two of the people. Yahoo General Counsel Michael Callahan has been in charge of the takeover-defense effort, two people said. The company’s thinking is that an outsider may be interested in Yahoo’s 39 percent stake in China-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which analysts say is worth about 10 billion, these people said. John Spelich, Alibaba’s spokesman in Hong Kong, didn’t reply to requests seeking comment. Alibaba, China’s biggest electronic-commerce company, said last month it offered to buy back its stake in May, though the talks collapsed the following month. Alibaba Stake Now that Yahoo uses Microsoft’s Bing search technology and is phasing out its own capabilities, Alibaba no longer needs the company as a partner, David Wei, head of the Chinese company’s Alibaba.com Ltd. unit, said Sept. 10. Alibaba Group sold the stake to Yahoo in 2005 for 1 billion and ownership of Yahoo’s Chinese unit. Under the agreement, Alibaba would have the right to buy back the stake if Yahoo were to be taken over, according to a 2005 SEC filing. The Hangzhou-based parent of Hong Kong-listed Alibaba.com operates Yahoo’s local website and other Internet businesses, including Taobao.com, China’s biggest online shopping site. Yahoo also owns 35 percent of Yahoo Japan Corp., operator of the nation’s most visited Web portal. Fumihiro Ito, a spokesman at Yahoo Japan’s largest shareholder, Softbank Corp., said the company is sticking with its intention of holding on to its stake. Yahoo in Asia Yahoo’s enterprise value after removing the stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is about 13.3 billion, compared with AOL’s 2.9 billion valuation, according to Miller Tabak & Co. analyst David Joyce. If AOL were to be involved in a deal, private-equity funding would be necessary, unless it was structured as a reverse merger with AOL gaining managerial control, Joyce, who recommends buying AOL stock, wrote in a note today. A combination of AOL and Yahoo would bring together Web properties that have struggled against Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. Yahoo, under a turnaround effort led by Bartz, announced last month the exodus of three of its top managers after reporting second-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates. AOL, also in a turnaround effort led by CEO Armstrong, was short of sales estimates in its second quarter after being spun off from Time Warner Inc. last December. This isn’t the first time the combination of AOL and Yahoo has been considered. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in December 2008 that talks about possible deals for AOL were under way with Yahoo, Microsoft and Google. When those talks didn’t lead anywhere, Time Warner opted for a spinoff. News Corp., based in New York, owns the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, a film studio and MySpace. AOL, since its December spinoff from Time Warner, has been trying to reshape itself into a media-driven company by investing in community news and niche online content and last month buying news blog TechCrunch Inc. The technology blog AllThingsD previously reported that companies including AOL and Silver Lake have weighed an offer for Yahoo.

This idea is still very new, and nobody has actually talked with Yahoo directly about it. Some of the people eager to buy or join with Yahoo include Silver Lake Partners and Blackstone Group, and a few others might be interested too. However, this joining was a bit like building a really big and complex Lego tower - it could topple at any moment! So, everyone was taking small steps and discussing different ideas on how they could make it work. But nobody was exactly sure of what to do. Yahoo came to know about these talks and asked Goldman Sachs, a special friend who gives them business advice, to check if these talks were real, like when mommy asks if the cookie jar it is actually empty or not. Another part of the plan was for a company named Alibaba, from China, to buy back some parts that Yahoo owns. Then, some other parts of Yahoo could be sold off to interested companies. Remember that yard sale you had last summer? It's similar to that. A different plan said that AOL might mix its business with Yahoo after Yahoo gets rid of some parts. This would be like mixing two different arts and craft projects into one big project. Alibaba's boss, Jack Ma, and AOL's boss, Tim Armstrong, both might want to buy AOL. If AOL and Yahoo joined, they could be really big in the internet world and could compete against another powerful company called Google in the online advertising game. It's like having a really big team in a football match! Even though some people have thought about this kind of joining before, talks became more serious recently as some important people from Yahoo left the company. This put pressure on Yahoo's boss, Carol Bartz, to prove that she could make the company better. However, Yahoo is facing some difficulty, which is why it is considering different ideas. You can compare it to when you had a hard time completing that jigsaw puzzle? In the end, everyone was just trying to make sure that things would work out best for their companies, like when we try to pick the best ingredients for our cookies.

We will combine the terms with the variable n (5n and -3n). 5n - 3n = 2n So the simplified equation is 2n - 6 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable n. To isolate n, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 6 to both sides of the equation: 2n - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6 2n = 6 Step 3: Solve for n by dividing by the coefficient of the variable. Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is 2. 2n / 2 = 6 / 2 n = 3 The answer is n = 3."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Child's Play Movie plot: On the morning of November 9, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois, while being chased by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon), Charles Lee Ray, a serial killer known as \\"The Lakeshore Strangler\\" (Brad Dourif), is shot and mortally wounded. Before dying, Charles takes cover inside a toy store, finding boxes of talking \\"Good Guy\\" dolls and then uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into one of the dolls. The store is then struck by lightning and it burns to the ground.Later that morning, 6-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) tells his widowed mother Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) that he wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unable to afford the full price, Karen buys a stolen doll from a street peddler, which is the same doll into which Charles Lee Ray had earlier transferred his soul.That night, as Andy is playing with the doll who has introduced himself as \\"Chucky\\" Karen's friend, Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff), who is babysitting Andy, scolds him for turning on the evening news and placing Chucky in front of the TV. When Andy tries to deny the accusation, she doesn't believe him and sends him to bed. Maggie is later violently struck with a hammer by an unseen figure and falls out of the apartment kitchen window to her death. Andy, when questioned, insists that Chucky has revealed himself to be alive and that he killed Maggie.The next day, Andy visits the house of Eddie Caputo (Neil Giuntoli), Charles Lee Ray's accomplice, who had betrayed him. Chucky sneaks into Eddie's house and blows out the pilot light on the stove and turns up the gas. Eddie discovers Chucky is alive and, in panicked self-defense, fires his gun and the house explodes, killing him.Authorities place Andy in a psychiatric ward after he is found near the crime scene. Karen discovers Andy was telling the truth after discovering that the included batteries in the Good Guy doll box were never put inside Chucky. After threatening to throw him in the fireplace, Chucky comes alive in her hands, bites her and runs out of the apartment. She... Answer:","completion":"Chucky bleeds in the movie \\"Child's Play\\" because his body is undergoing a transformation. When Charles Lee Ray used the voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into the Good Guy doll, he began a process in which the longer his soul stayed inside the doll, the more human-like the doll became. Throughout the movie, Chucky becomes more and more indistinguishable from a real human, with his body taking on human characteristics, such as bleeding. This transformation is also supported by the voodoo curse which allowed Charles' soul to pass into the doll in the first place. This further solidifies the supernatural aspects of the curse and its consequences beyond just the ability to animate the inanimate object. The bleeding is a visual indication to the audience of this transformation, showing that Chucky is not just a simple toy anymore. This added element of danger and suspense increases the horror aspect of the movie and contributes to the fear that the characters—and viewers—are experiencing throughout the film. As Chucky becomes more human-like, he becomes more believable as the villain, and as a result, the stakes for the characters rise, making their efforts to end his terror all the more urgent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"flowers require _.\\" is \\"pollen\\", given that flowers require insects? Answer:","completion":"In providing an answer to the question \\"flowers require _,\\" it is essential to consider the broader context and the various factors that contribute to the growth and reproduction of flowers. While it is true that many flowers require insects for pollination, it would be incomplete and somewhat misleading to say that flowers require pollen. Pollen is a crucial part of the reproductive process for many plants, including flowers, as it is a powdery substance consisting of microspores that carry male gametes. However, it should be noted that pollen is produced by the flowers themselves, specifically by the male reproductive organ called the stamen. Thus, it might be more accurate to say that flowers produce pollen rather than require it. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ (the stamen) to the female reproductive organ (the pistil), allowing fertilization and the formation of seeds. In many cases, flowers depend on insects like bees, butterflies, and moths to carry out this process. These insects are attracted to flowers through various means, such as their color, scent, or availability of nectar, and as they feed on the nectar, they inadvertently collect pollen on their bodies, which is then transferred to other flowers' pistils as they continue their foraging. It is also important to note that not all flowers rely on insects for pollination. Some flowers are pollinated through other means such as wind, water, or even self-pollination. In wind-pollinated flowers, pollen is carried by the wind from one flower to another. Water-pollinated plants typically grow in or near aquatic environments and use water currents to distribute their pollen. Self-pollinating flowers can pollinate themselves, often in the absence of pollinating agents like insects, wind, or water. In addition to pollination, flowers require several other factors for their growth and survival. These include sunlight, water, and proper soil conditions containing essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These elements, together with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are necessary for photosynthesis – the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy for growth and reproduction. In summary, while it is true that flowers require insects for pollination, it would be inaccurate to say that the right answer to the question \\"flowers require _\\" is \\"pollen.\\" Instead, a more comprehensive answer might be that flowers require a combination of factors, such as sunlight, water, nutrients, proper soil conditions, and in many cases, pollination by various agents like insects, wind, or water, to grow and reproduce successfully."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia. During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers. While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\".

Folk dancers stomp loudly in Gilbert's room just above Iris, making it impossible for Miss Froy to properly hear a musician singing a haunting melody out in the street. Iris bribes the manager to throw Gilbert out of his room. Gilbert retaliates by barging into Iris's room and refusing to leave.

Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Kevin Toms (born 22, April 1957 in Paignton) is a British computer game designer who founded Addictive Games and is famous for creating the original \\"Football Manager\\", a simulation game released in the early 1980s that included a portrait of his bearded face on publicity material and cassette covers. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA).

A top-seller in the Canadian and United States educational markets, it was Commodore's first full-featured computer, and formed the basis for their entire 8-bit product line, including the Commodore 64. The first model, which was named the PET 2001, was the third personal computer ever made available to retail consumers, after the Apple II and TRS-80. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - Commodore International (or Commodore International Limited) was a North American home computer and electronics manufacturer. Commodore International (CI), along with its subsidiary Commodore Business Machines (CBM), participated in the development of the homepersonal computer industry in the 1970s and 1980s.

It is best known for the \\"Football Manager\\" series of games created by company founder Kevin Toms. The company was originally based in Milton Keynes, England and later relocated to Bournemouth, in southern England. - The IBM System/360 introduced byte-addressable memory with 8-bit bytes, as opposed to bit-addressable or decimal digit-addressable or word-addressable memory, although its general purpose registers were 32 bits wide, and addresses were contained in the lower 24 bits of those addresses. Different models of System/360 had different internal data path widths; the IBM System/360 Model 30 (1965) implemented the 32-bit System/360 architecture, but had an 8 bit native path width, and performed 32-bit arithmetic 8 bits at a time.

Last year, the company made a lot of money, around £1.6 million, just for helping people remember not to throw trash on the ground. How did they do that? Well, they had a deal with some towns and villages. The leaders of these places asked Xfor to help them by teaching everyone that throwing trash on the streets is not nice. The way they taught people was by giving them a special punishment called a \\"fine\\" if they were caught being naughty and dropping things like matchsticks, orange peels, or banana skins on the ground. A fine is a kind of punishment where you have to give some of your money away because you did something wrong. If someone accidentally dropped one of these things and a helper from Xfor saw them, they had to give up to £80 because they didn't follow the rule. The helpers were really good at their jobs, and they caught many people who made the streets dirty. Because of their hard work, Xfor made lots of money.

Article: Explorer Benedict Allen has been haunted for decades about having to eat his faithful dog to save his life when lost in the Brazilian rainforest Since the age of 10 I'd wanted to be an explorer. My dad was a test pilot flying Vulcan bombers and I wished I could be an adventurer like him. So in 1982, I saved up and planned my first trip across the north-eastern Brazilian rainforest. After five months of trekking, being passed from one indigenous tribe to another, not really knowing what I was doing, I came across some goldminers who attacked me in the night. I was only 22, naive and very scared. In the darkness I fled towards my canoe. With me was a dog I'd found in a village a few months before; I'd healed its paw, and it had become my companion. But in the chaos, the canoe capsized and I lost everything. I ended up walking on my own, lost in the rainforest with only the dog for company. As we walked we got steadily weaker and, after about three weeks, I was starving to death; I had malaria and I was delirious. But the dog had become incredibly important to me in terms of keeping my hopes up. We were both suffering, but we were in it together. I couldn't see myself, but I knew how bad the dog looked. I drew a little jokey cartoon in my diary of us both fantasising about eating one other; I knew it was becoming a very real proposition. I started thinking more about what I might have to do if I ever wanted to see my mum and dad again. I remember lying on my back one day and thinking I wouldn't get up again if I didn't eat something; the only thing left was to eat the dog. I managed to cook a few bits using a survival kit. It gave me a little strength to keep going but, in a way, I was even more terrified, as knew I'd played my last card. Some days later, miraculously, I saw a chink of daylight; I'd been in a dark tangle for as long as I could recall, but soon I was standing in a farmer's crop. He treated me with an anti-malarial drink and I was taken to hospital. When I got back to Britain I was too ashamed to tell my parents how badly things had gone. Then the local paper asked me about the trip. I let slip about the dog and before I knew it the nationals were on to it; my sorry tale became a two-page spread in the Daily Mail. The RSPCA came round with a sack of hate mail. I often wonder whether what happened was a mistake or not; obviously it kept me alive but it has also haunted me. In a way it has driven me in my career, fuelling my desire to understand why I had survived. But it has always been something I've wanted to rectify.

The BBC's Frank Gardner said Mr Allen had asked to be rescued and efforts were under way to retrieve him, but he was \\"not out of danger yet\\". A search was mounted for the 57-year-old after his family said he had not taken planned flights home. Mr Allen was travelling on his own to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, whom he first met 30 years ago. His agent, Jo Sarsby, said the co-ordinating director for New Tribe Mission in Papua New Guinea, Keith Copley, had confirmed in writing at 17:00 local time that Mr Allen was \\"safe, well and healthy\\", and at a remote airstrip 20 miles north-west of Porgera, Enga Province. \\"Confirmation on exact location coordinates are now being confirmed in order to arrange evacuation as soon as possible,\\" she said. She said it was understood the airstrip was not accessible by road, so it was hoped a helicopter would be sent on Friday. Analysis By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner Benedict Allen was under no illusions about the dangers and difficulties he would face when he chose to march off alone into the jungles of Papua New Guinea, in search of the isolated Yaifo tribe. This is exactly the sort of challenge he thrives on. But as well as having to contend with almost impossibly steep and forested terrain, it seems his plans have been disrupted by an outbreak of tribal infighting which often happens in remote areas. Although foreigners are rarely the target of this violence outside the towns, there is always a risk of being associated with one tribe that is at war with another. Those now trying to organise a rescue say he chose not to take a satellite phone, made no evacuation plan and left no coordinates of where he intended to end his journey. They say his only way out is by helicopter or light aircraft. Mr Allen's older sister, Katie Pestille, had said it was \\"out of character\\" for him to miss his scheduled flight out of Papua New Guinea to Hong Kong. The explorer, from London, has previously crossed the Amazon Basin on foot and in a dug-out canoe, and participated in a six-week male initiation ceremony in which crocodile marks were carved onto his body. He has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries and written books on exploration. Who is Benedict Allen? First solo adventure: To the Amazon at 22, during which he was shot at by two hitmen Tough time: An initiation into manhood in Papua New Guinea. He was kept in a \\"crocodile nest\\" with 20 others, and repeatedly cut with bamboo blades to leave scars that looked like crocodile scales Low moment: Eating his own dog to survive Travel habit: Always keeps loo paper in a back pocket. \\"You know how it is,\\" he tells the Lonely Planet. Philosophy: \\"For me personally, exploration isn't about conquering nature, planting flags or leaving your mark. It's about the opposite: opening yourself up and allowing the place to leave its mark on you.\\" Career: Six TV series for the BBC, author, motivational speaker Family: Lives with family in Czech Republic In his last tweet from 11 October, Mr Allen wrote: \\"Marching off to Heathrow. I may be some time.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"Explorer Benedict Allen, renowned for his solo adventures and survival situations, was in the limelight for consuming his own dog to survive when he was lost in the Brazilian rainforest during his first expedition in 1982. After being attacked by gold miners, losing his belongings, suffering from malaria, and starving, Allen was left with no choice but to cook his canine companion just to keep going. This incident has impacted his life deeply, influencing his career and haunting his conscience. Years later, Allen was spotted \\"alive and well\\" near an airstrip in Papua New Guinea after missing a flight back home. He was reportedly on a mission to locate the elusive Yaifo tribe, which he first encountered 30 years prior.

Question: Process: - Cold water taken in through a hose to the bottom - Heating element heats water - Pump forces water up in pipes connected to spinning paddles - The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler - Water comes out of small holes in paddles - Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean - Water is drained through a filter - Filter collects particles of food - Water was so hot that it evaporates for dry dishes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cold water taken in happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context refers to the idea that introducing more cold water into the dishwasher system might have an effect on its ability to clean dishes better. To evaluate this hypothesis, it is important to understand the different components of the dishwasher's process and how they may be affected by this change. 1. Cold water intake: Adding more cold water to the system means that there will be a larger volume of water available for the cleaning process. In principle, this could help in cleaning the dishes more effectively by allowing a greater amount of water to be used throughout the cycle. 2. Heating element: The water needs to be heated to a certain temperature to effectively clean and sanitize the dishes. With more cold water entering the system, the heating element will have to work harder and use more energy to heat the increased volume of water. This could lead to a longer heating time and increased energy consumption. However, once the required temperature is reached, the effectiveness of the cleaning process should not be compromised. 3. Pump and spinning paddles: With more water in the system, the pump will also have to work harder to force water through the pipes and make the paddles spin. If the pump is capable of handling the increased amount of water, then the forced water will still cause the paddles to spin, distributing the hot water onto the dishes as intended. However, if the pump struggles to manage the increased water volume, this could potentially lead to reduced effectiveness in the dishwashing process. 4. Water collection and recycling: More water in the system means more water to be collected and reused during the dishwashing process. This could be beneficial in terms of having more water to remove food particles from the dishes. However, it is crucial to ensure that the dishwasher's water recycling system can effectively handle the increased water volume without compromising the overall cleaning process. 5. Water drainage and filtration: After the dishes are cleaned, the water needs to be drained through a filter, which collects the food particles. With a larger volume of water, there may be an increased amount of food particles filtered out, potentially leading to a cleaner end result. However, this also raises concerns about the efficiency of the filter and the possibility of it becoming clogged more quickly with the increased level of food particles. 6. Evaporation for dry dishes: Lastly, the hot water used during the washing process needs to evaporate for the dishes to be dry. With more water in the system, there might be a larger amount of water to evaporate, which could lead to longer drying times. This effect may be minimized by the dishwasher's heating and ventilation capabilities. In conclusion, the introduction of more cold water into the dishwasher system could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process. On one hand, it may provide more water to effectively clean the dishes, but on the other hand, it could strain the various components (heating element, pump, filter, and drying system) and increase energy consumption. While it is possible that adding more cold water might help improve the dishwasher's cleaning ability, this effect would be contingent on the various components being able to handle the increased water volume without compromising their efficiency or overall function."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Robles, who was driving a bus with 45 evacuees, experienced the unfortunate mishap when the vehicle caught fire, resulting in 23 deaths. The incident occurred in September 2005, when thousands of people were evacuating the Gulf Coast to escape the devastating Hurricane Rita. Robles’ bus carried 45 passengers, all evacuated from a nursing home in Bellaire, Texas. Tragically, the fire caused significant damage, and 23 elderly passengers succumbed to the smoke and flames. Following the disaster, authorities investigated the cause of the fire and determined it was due to a mechanical failure in the bus's braking system. However, questions have arisen whether there were other contributing factors to the tragedy. Hours before the bus was engulfed, Robles was reportedly fixing a flat tire, and some wonder if the tire repair and possible overheating of the brakes could have played a role in the blaze. Now, the Mexican Consulate has stepped in, questioning the charges brought against Robles. They argue that the investigation should be thorough and fair, considering all factors that may have contributed to the fire. Furthermore, they emphasize that as a driver, Robles might not be the only one responsible for the tragic incident. The Mexican Consulate is urging authorities not to rush to blame Robles solely, as a more in-depth examination of the circumstances may reveal a multifaceted issue. They have stated that their primary goal is to ensure that justice prevails in the tragic accident. In conclusion, the Mexican Consulate has questioned the charges against Juan Robles and seeks a thorough investigation into the bus fire during the Hurricane Rita evacuation.

Question: Q: A red blood cell will swell and burst when placed in a? Choices: - acidic solution - exothermic solution - dissolved solution - hypotonic solution A: Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the concept of a red blood cell swelling and bursting. When a red blood cell is placed in a solution, it can either swell, stay the same, or shrink based on the solution's concentration compared to the concentration inside the blood cell. The diffusion of water through the cell membrane (osmosis) balances the concentration. Step 2: Consider each choice provided. - Acidic solution: An acidic solution has a low pH, but this does not necessarily affect the swelling or bursting of a red blood cell. It might affect the overall health of the cell but is not the primary reason for a cell to swell and burst. - Exothermic solution: An exothermic solution refers to a process releasing heat, which is not directly related to the swelling or bursting of a red blood cell. Temperature can affect the cell, but it is not the primary reason for swelling and bursting. - Dissolved solution: This term does not provide clear information about the concentration of the solution, which is the essential factor in determining the effect it will have on the red blood cell. - Hypotonic solution: A hypotonic solution has a lower concentration of solute outside the red blood cell compared to the inside. This causes water to move into the cell through osmosis, resulting in the cell swelling and potentially bursting if enough water enters.

Despite this, he made his debut in for Dundee United in 1981 and won the Scottish Football League Premier Division title in 1983. In the subsequent 1983-84 European Cup United reached the semi final. United made it to the 1986/87 UEFA Cup Final. En route they defeated Terry Venables' F.C. Barcelona side featuring Gary Lineker and Mark Hughes at home and away in the quarter finals. Kevin Gallacher scored the only goal in the first leg at home. Ian Redford delivered the free kick headed home by John Clark for a 2nd leg equaliser at Camp Nou. This prompted Lineker to prophetically say to one of the United players, 'this mob'll just chuck it.' Iain Ferguson then scored a second for United nodding in Paul Sturrock's cross to win 3-1 on aggregate. In the semi final they drew 0-0 at home to Borussia Monchengladbach. In the return leg in Germany they inflicted Borussia's first home defeat in Europe in 55 games going back to 1970. Ferguson put United ahead just before half time. Redford capped the United performance with a last minute goal to seal a 2-0 win. Billy Thomson was injured after five minutes of the final first leg diving at the feet of Lennart Nilsson and needed five stitches for a blow just behind his left ear. Some reports said Thomson almost lost his ear. Thomson though repelled attack after attack and was beaten only once when Stefan Pettersson scored. McLean described Thomson's performance as \\"magnificent\\". Despite Clark scoring in the final in the 1-1 second leg draw at Tannadice, United lost 2-1 on aggregate.

The force of friction always opposes the motion causing it, and it plays a crucial role in allowing objects to grip and move across surfaces, while also generating heat as a byproduct."}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:W},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:B,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const i=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return i?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(i)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(i)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(i=>setTimeout(i,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"search-container"},P={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},j={key:1};function L(i,e,h,m,n,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",q,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",P,[(a(!0),o(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),o("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
