You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read this article and answer this question Mount Vesuvius has erupted many times. The famous eruption in AD 79 was preceded by numerous others in prehistory, including at least three significantly larger ones, the best known being the Avellino eruption around 1800 BC which engulfed several Bronze Age settlements. Since AD 79, the volcano has also erupted repeatedly, in 172, 203, 222, possibly in 303, 379, 472, 512, 536, 685, 787, around 860, around 900, 968, 991, 999, 1006, 1037, 1049, around 1073, 1139, 1150, and there may have been eruptions in 1270, 1347, and 1500. The volcano erupted again in 1631, six times in the 18th century (including 1779 and 1794), eight times in the 19th century (notably in 1872), and in 1906, 1929 and 1944. There have been no eruptions since 1944, and none of the eruptions after AD 79 were as large or destructive as the Pompeian one. Vesuvius entered a new phase in December 1631, when a major eruption buried many villages under lava flows, killing around 3,000 people. Torrents of lahar were also created, adding to the devastation. Activity thereafter became almost continuous, with relatively severe eruptions occurring in 1660, 1682, 1694, 1698, 1707, 1737, 1760, 1767, 1779, 1794, 1822, 1834, 1839, 1850, 1855, 1861, 1868, 1872, 1906, 1926, 1929, and 1944.

In the first group, there are 25974 toy cars and in the second group, there are 24250 toy cars. You want to find out, how many more toy cars do you have in the first group than in the second group. To do this, you subtract the number of cars in the second group from the first group. So, you have 25974*c - 24250*c. To simplify this, just like when you put blocks together, you can regroup the toy cars. But instead of blocks, we deal with the number of cars. You would have (25974 - 24250) * c. Now, let's do the subtraction: 25974 - 24250 = 1724 So, now we have 1724 * c. The problem says that 1724 * c is equal to 17240. To figure out how many toy cars (c) we have, we need to divide 17240 by 1724. 17240 ÷ 1724 = 10 So, c = 10. That means, you would have 10 more toy cars in the first group than in the second group!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Given the following context: Tosca is an opera in three acts by Giacomo Puccini to an Italian libretto by Luigi Illica and Giuseppe Giacosa. It premiered at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome on 14 January 1900. The work, based on Victorien Sardou's 1887 French-language dramatic play, La Tosca, is a melodramatic piece set in Rome in June 1800, with the Kingdom of Naples's control of Rome threatened by Napoleon's invasion of Italy. It contains depictions of torture, murder and suicide, as well as some of Puccini's best-known lyrical arias. Puccini saw Sardou's play when it was touring Italy in 1889 and, after some vacillation, obtained the rights to turn the work into an opera in 1895. Turning the wordy French play into a succinct Italian opera took four years, during which the composer repeatedly argued with his librettists and publisher. Tosca premiered at a time of unrest in Rome, and its first performance was delayed for a day for fear of disturbances. Despite indifferent reviews from the critics, the opera was an immediate success with the public. Musically, Tosca is structured as a through-composed work, with arias, recitative, choruses and other elements musically woven into a seamless whole. Puccini used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas. While critics have often dismissed the opera as a facile melodrama with confusions of plot—musicologist Joseph Kerman called it a \\"shabby little shocker\\"—the power of its score and the inventiveness of its orchestration have been widely acknowledged. The dramatic force of Tosca and its characters continues to fascinate both performers and audiences, and the work remains one of the most frequently performed operas. Many recordings of the work have been issued, both of studio and live performances. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects and ideas?","completion":"The first name of the person who used Wagnerian leitmotifs to identify characters, objects, and ideas in Tosca is Giacomo.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S. Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs the highest level playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans.

A Spanish nurse who treated an Ebola victim in Madrid has become the first person in the world to contract the deadly virus outside of Africa. The 44-year-old is said to have spent the last 15 years working at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, where the two Spanish missionaries infected with Ebola died. The woman, who is married, was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month so that he could be treated for the deadly virus. Scroll down for video. The Spanish nurse has become the first person in the world to contract Ebola outside of Africa after treating a patient with the deadly virus at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital. Pictured: Police escort an ambulance with the nurse. The medical workers donned full protective clothing as they transported the nurse between Spanish hospitals. The 44-year-old Spanish woman was moved between the hospitals in a special fully-incubated stretcher. Medical staff could be seen removing the woman on an enclosed stretcher out of the ambulance last night. The woman has moved from Alcorcon Hospital to Madrid's Carlos III Hospital by those in full protective suits. A medical worker in protective gear stands next to a special stretcher carrying the infected Spanish nurse. Two separate tests confirmed that the woman, who has yet to be named, had contracted the disease. Colleagues tonight expressed their surprise at news that the nurse, from Galicia in northwest Spain, had caught the virus, saying that there had been 'extreme' measures in place to protect staff. One told Spanish daily El Pais that nurses were equipped with two protective overalls, two pairs of gloves and glasses. All medics had to use a special card to access the hospital's sixth floor - where the two men were treated. The Carlos III Hospital was evacuated before the arrival of the first missionary, Miguel Pajares, who contracted the disease in Liberia, but not for Mr Viejo as the sixth floor had already been hermetically sealed. Mr Pajares, the first person in Europe to be treated for Ebola, died at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital in August despite receiving experimental drug ZMapp after he returned. The Spanish nurse was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month so that he could be treated for the deadly virus pictured. He died on September 26. Mr Viejo was a member of the Hospital Order of San Juan de Dios who worked in the Western city of Lunsar. Mr Viejo died at the hospital the following month after contracting the virus in Sierra Leone. Ebola spreads through contact with the bodily fluids of someone who has the virus and the only way to stop an outbreak is to isolate those who are infected. The current outbreak in west Africa, the worst ever, has infected nearly 7,500 people and caused more than 3,400 deaths. The Spanish nurse is understood to have tested positive for Ebola in a first analysis after going to hospital in Alcorcon near Madrid with a high fever early this morning. Doctors isolated the emergency treatment room. A Ministry of Health source told respected daily El Mundo: 'She arrived at the University Hospital Alcorcon Foundation with fever and has undergone tests. The first test has come back positive.' Spain's Health Ministry today held a crisis meeting as they awaited for the results to be confirmed. British nurse William Pooley, 29, who was infected with the virus while working in Sierra Leone, recovered last month after being flown back to London for treatment. He later jetted to the US to give blood to an American battling the disease. Thomas Duncan, the first person diagnosed in the west with the disease, contracted Ebola last month in Liberia and is now 'fighting for his life' at a hospital in Dallas after flying to the US to visit his fiancee. Spanish nurse, Manuel Garcia Viejo, is pictured being flown home from Sierra Leone in a plastic isolation chamber. It is understood that the female Spanish nurse was part of the team that treated him. The researchers at Northeastern University, in Boston, calculated the countries most at risk in the short term, are:. Leading charity Save the Children warned recently Ebola is spreading at a 'terrifying rate' with the number of recorded cases doubling every week. Speaking at a conference in London co-hosted with Sierra Leone last week, UK Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond called for more financial aid, doctors and nurses. Scientists have warned that the deadly virus could spread across the world infecting people from the U.S. to China within three weeks. There is a 50 per cent chance a traveller carrying the disease could touch down in the UK by October 24, a team of U.S. researchers have predicted. Using Ebola spread patterns and airline traffic data they have calculated the odds of the virus spreading across the world. They estimate there is a 75 per cent chance Ebola will reach French shores by October 24. And Belgium has a 40 per cent chance of seeing the disease arrive on its territory, while Spain and Switzerland have lower risks of 14 per cent each. A team of scientists at Northeastern University in Boston have used air travel information to predict where the deadly Ebola virus could reach in the next three weeks. Professor Alessandro Vespignani of Northeastern University in Boston, who led the research, said: 'This is not a deterministic list, it's about probabilities – but those probabilities are growing for everyone. 'It's just a matter of who gets lucky and who gets unlucky. 'Air traffic is the driver. 'But there are also differences in connections with the affected countries (Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), as well as different numbers of cases in these three countries - so depending on that, the probability numbers change.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"A Spanish nurse who treated an Ebola victim in Madrid became the first person in the world to contract the deadly virus outside of Africa. The 44-year-old nurse worked at Madrid's Carlos III Hospital, where two Spanish missionaries infected with Ebola died. The nurse was part of the team that treated Spanish priest Manuel Garcia Viejo, who was brought back from Africa last month to be treated for the virus. The Carlos III Hospital had extreme precautions in place, including evacuating the whole area and providing healthcare workers with protective overalls, gloves, and glasses. The current outbreak of Ebola in West Africa has led to nearly 7,500 infections and caused more than 3,400 deaths. This incident has sparked a renewed urgency in containing the virus and prompted health officials to evaluate the effectiveness of preventive measures."},{"prompt":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Cleaning groundwater in an aquifer requires bioremediation or chemical remediation.

The story follows eleven passionate, mostly anonymous but very talented soccer players and their journey from the cobblestone streets of impoverished Belgrade neighborhoods to the formation of the national team before the very first World Cup in faraway Uruguay. So far away that the country's capital, Montevideo, seems more a distant dream than a familiar reality. Named after the city where the inaugural World Cup was held, director Dragan BjelogrliÄ's adaptation of journalist Vladimir StankoviÄ's best-selling book centers on the relationship between the two top players: natural talent and poor boy Tirke (MiloÅ¡ BikoviÄ) and playboy superstar MoÅ¡a (Petar Strugar). The two young men eventually become friends when they're thrown together on the front line of the dominant local team, Beogradski sport klub - BSK (BSK Belgrade). As the club hierarchy is faced with the challenge of keeping the squad afloat, the opportunity arises to create a national team. However, team unity is strained when Tirke and MoÅ¡a clash over beautiful women. Rosa (Danina JeftiÄ), the voluptuous, small-town innocent who adores Tirke, but her soccer-mad uncle conspires to set her up with MoÅ¡a; and vampish Valeria (Nina JankoviÄ), a free-spirited bohemian who seduces MoÅ¡a and finds much fun in pitting him against Tirke. The initial doubt that surrounded their personal and professional lives is transformed into a shared ambition to prove themselves in Montevideo; as a result, a story about friendship, enthusiasm, persistence and love for the game is unraveled. My question: Does Tirke love or hate football? A:","completion":"Based on the movie plot provided, it is clear that Tirke loves football. He is described as a natural talent and a poor boy who is passionate about the sport. His journey from impoverished Belgrade neighborhoods to the formation of the national team highlights his dedication and enthusiasm for the game. Additionally, the story is about friendship, enthusiasm, persistence, and love for the game, which further emphasizes Tirke's love for football.

However, the premise does not provide any explicit information about any forces or actions between the two celestial bodies. The premise merely shares Jon's observation of the moons. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the red moon was pulling the black moon apart. This involves an active process or event occurring between the two moons. However, no such activity is included or suggested in the premise. There are no details in the premise related to the movement, force, or interaction between the red and black moons. It is only described how they appear visually, not what is happening between them. Furthermore, while the premise reveals Jon's relief or gratitude towards the gods, this does not provide any support for the hypothesis either. It gives insight into Jon's emotional or spiritual response, but does not contribute any information about physical or astronomical occurrences. In sum, the hypothesis entails an inference or assumption that goes beyond the scope of the description provided in the premise. The premise does not specify any sort of destructive or gravitational interaction between the two moons, as suggested by the hypothesis. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

Police arrest Georgia megachurch pastor after disturbance at home By John Murgatroyd and John Blake, CNN Atlanta (CNN)– Megachurch pastor Creflo Dollar was arrested in suburban Atlanta for an alleged assault on his 15-year-old daughter, police said Friday. Deputies in Georgia's Fayette County responded to a call about a domestic disturbance about 1 a.m. Friday. Dollar's daughter said she argued with her father over attending a party, said Investigator Brent Rowan of the Fayette County Sheriff's Office. The daughter says the argument got physical. She told the deputies that her father charged her, put his hands around her throat and began to choke her, according to a police report. She said he then slammed her to the ground, punched her and beat her with his shoe. CNN’s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories Dollar's daughter was able to get away and dial 911, Rowan said. Deputies noticed a scratch on the daughter's neck and arrested Dollar on charges of simple battery, family violence and child cruelty. Deputies also spoke with another daughter, 19, who corroborated her sister's account of what happened. Dollar was booked into the Fayette County jail early Friday. A judge set his bail at 5,000 during a morning hearing, and he was released. Dollar said in a statement released to the media from his attorney, \\"As a father I love my children and I always have their best interest at heart at all times, and I would never use my hand to ever cause bodily harm to my children. The facts in this case will be handled privately to further protect my children. My family thanks you for your prayers and continued support.\\" Dollar is a senior pastor of World Changers Church International in suburban Atlanta, which claims about 30,000 members and has an 18 million sanctuary that resembles a golden-domed spaceship atop a hill. He built an international religious empire, with broadcasts of his sermons beamed worldwide and speaking engagements in Europe. A barrel-chested man who favors impeccably tailored pinstripe suits in the pulpit, Dollar preaches the Prosperity Gospel, a message that says God will bless faithful Christians with wealth and debt-free living. Since he started his ministry in an elementary school cafeteria in 1986, Dollar has earned both praise and criticism. Follow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter Supporters say he has preached a message that's financially empowered his parishioners and challenged the idea that Christians should be ashamed to be rich. Critics call him \\"Cash-Flow Dollar,\\" a pulpit prima donna who once refused to allow parishioners to touch him. They say his message perverts the Gospel. Dollar has had brushes with the law before, according to a lengthy 2000 profile in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was once cited for contempt of court for refusing to give a deposition during the divorce proceedings of boxer Evander Holyfield, who attended his church, according to the AJC. The AJC profile also said that 100 police officers were admonished for receiving 1,000 apiece from Dollar. Dollar sent the money to honor the officers' community service, but the act was criticized because it came a month after two traffic tickets Dollar received were downgraded to warnings, the profile said.

Write a title for this article: Fortune’s Brainstorm Tech Conference (going on now in Aspen, Colo.) regularly brings together the best and brightest minds in tech innovation. Each week, Fortune turns the spotlight on a different conference attendee to offer his or her own personal insight into business, tech, and entrepreneurship. This week, we asked Chief Infotainment Officer at General Motors Philip Abram to answer 10 questions about life outside of work, the best advice he ever received, and industry tips for young entrepreneurs. His responses follow. What is the best advice you ever received? As a young engineer, I was advised to look for areas undergoing change and spend time on the “business side” of the company, because that is what drives decisions. I’ve spent my career close to that boundary between technology and business, the intersection of what is possible and what is profitable. What would you say to a group of young people looking to enter the tough job market? Even in a tough market, follow your interests and passions. You’ll be happier and more valuable to your employer. What was the most important thing you learned in school? How to learn. How to process and retain new information and be able to apply it to solve new problems. My undergrad electrical engineering knowledge is quite dated after all these years. Every day I learn something new and incorporate that into how I tackle the issues that come my way. What do you do for fun? Get outside as much as I can (yes, even in Detroit!). Cycling, hiking, seeing our national and regional parks. What is your greatest achievement? Working on a team that rapidly grew a startup (Sonos) selling premium products during the worst economic downturn in over 50 years. Sonos grew more than 50% year-over-year in 2009 in a consumer electronics industry that was shrinking by 30% while we lowered our operating expenses. What has been your biggest failure? So many to choose from…Taking too long to realize what I’m good at and what I’m not good at. Not having good self-awareness limited what I could contribute to many of the jobs I’ve had in the past. Even positions that were “successful” in many ways, I did not do all I could have done. What technology sector excites you most? I am attracted to sectors undergoing significant change. That’s what is exciting about my role at General Motors. It is a new intersection of technology (connectivity) and business (auto industry) with so much opportunity. The user experience in the vehicle will undergo radical change in the next 3-5 years. What do you do to live a balanced life? Have fun at work and it’s not really work. We are building a new team within GM dedicated to the innovation of connected services in the vehicle. It is a new frontier for the company and we are attracting new talents. We have fun and hopefully it is reflected in our products. A desire to come to the office each day is key to a balanced life. What is one characteristic that every leader should possess? Given my answer on failures, self-awareness of one’s strengths and weaknesses. Build on your strengths, and surround yourself with people to mitigate your weaknesses. Find peers and mentors that are willing to help you see your weaknesses. Is business school necessary for entrepreneurs? Never necessary, but certainly beneficial. In particular, if you have a technical background, business school will round out your knowledge on how business operates. Every entrepreneur needs to understand how to make money from their ideas.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If you wish to have full control of how fluid paint is dispersed onto your canvas, place it perfectly flat on your work surface. If you are aiming for a specific dripping effect, place the canvas upright or at an angle. Use an easel or prop the canvas up with something solid (e.g., a large piece of wood) to achieve the angle you want. Before starting your fluid painting, consider painting your plain canvas with one solid paint color (or “toned ground”) to make the end result look more professional. Use regular acrylic paint in an opaque color for this. Dip a large brush in the paint and cover the canvas in broad strokes from left to right, aiming to make the paint as smooth as possible. Let the canvas sit for 2-3 hours to dry before applying fluid paint to it. How paint disperses onto the canvas will depend on the method of application you use, the vessel you transfer it from, and the angle and distance at which you apply it. Most store-bought fluid paint is sold in squeeze bottles with small nozzles that allow you to dispense it in fine lines, but you can transfer the paint to any container you choose to create your artwork. Some techniques for getting fluid paint onto a canvas include: Pouring (applying a generous stream of paint to the canvas) Drizzling (pouring very light stream of paint onto the canvas) Dropping (e.g., from an eye-dropper) Puddling (Applying a puddle of paint to the canvas and letting it seep over it) Splashing (Projecting paint onto the canvas with enough force to bounce back off of it) Depending on the design you wish to achieve, you can use spreading tools or a dry paintbrush to disperse fluid paint across your canvas. To ensure greater control, spread or move paint very lightly in multiple, thin coats. Have an empty container or basin on hand to collect excess paint from the canvas, if necessary, using a clean spreading tool. Make sure that your tools are perfectly clean before you start painting.Tools should always be cleaned with warm water and hand soap immediately after use, before paint dries on them. Fluid paint is a very wet medium and requires more drying time than other paints. If you wish to layer paint designs over other work on the canvas, allow one to three days between coats so that the layers can dry thoroughly. Painting over other fluid paint that hasn’t dried completely can cause cracks or fissures on the surface of the paint.","completion":"To paint with fluid paint, first decide if you want your canvas flat or at an angle. If you want a drippy effect, prop up the canvas on something like a big piece of wood. Before starting, you can paint the canvas with a solid color to make it look more professional. Let it dry for 2-3 hours. There are many ways to put the paint on the canvas, like pouring a lot of paint, drizzling a little paint, using an eye-dropper, making a puddle of paint, or splashing the paint. You can use tools or a dry brush to help spread the paint around. You might want an empty container to catch extra paint that falls off the canvas. Clean your tools really well before and after painting, so they stay nice and clean. Fluid paint takes a long time to dry, so if you want more layers, wait 1-3 days between them to avoid cracking."},{"prompt":"Information: - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere. - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \\"Te Tai-o-Rehua\\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand.

Movie title: 20 Million Miles to Earth Movie plot: Off the coast of a small Italian fishing village, Sperlonga (in the province of Latina), not Sicily as it is erroneously mentioned, two fishermen watch in amazement as a spaceship pierces the skies and crashes into the sea. The men, Mondello (Don Orlando) and Verrico (George Khoury), row out to the site and pull two space travelers from the capsized craft before it shudders and sinks into the sea. Meanwhile, in Washington, D.C., Major General A. D. McIntosh (Thomas Browne Henry) discovers that the government's missing spacecraft, piloted by Colonel Bob Calder (William Hopper), has been located off the coast of Italy. As McIntosh flies to Italy, Pepe (Bart Braverman), a little boy who lives in the fishing village of Gerra, finds a metal capsule that has washed up on the beach. Upon opening the capsule, he finds a jelly-like glob inside and sells it to Dr. Leonardo (Frank Puglia), a visiting zoologist who is studying sea creatures. Meanwhile, Leonardo's medical-student granddaughter Marisa (Joan Taylor) is summoned to town to take care of the injured Calder and his companion, Dr. Sharman. When Calder regains consciousness, he finds Sharman in the last throes of the fatal disease that decimated his crew. That night, after Marisa returns home to the trailer that she shares with her grandfather, a small creature hatches from the glob and Leonardo locks it in a cage. By morning, the creature has tripled in size, and McIntosh arrives in Gerra, accompanied by government scientist Dr. Justin Uhl, and meets with Calder and Signore Contino, a representative of the Italian government. As Leonardo and Marisa hitch up the trailer containing the creature to their truck and head for Rome with their discovery, McIntosh informs the astonished Contini that Calder has just returned from Venus. Calder's spacecraft, crippled by a meteor, carried a sealed metal container bearing an unborn species of animal life from the planet.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help. Ambler was offered the opportunity to go with them, but felt that his duty as a doctor required him to stay with the main body.For the next week De Long's party struggled on, sometimes making barely a mile a day. Although they jettisoned more of their possessions on the way, De Long insisted on carrying his maps and journals. His entry for October 10 recorded that there was \\"nothing for supper but a spoonful of glycerine\\". A few days later Alexey, the group's principal hunter, shot a ptarmigan which provided soup. But Alexey was weakening, and on October 17 he died.On October 20, trapped by the weather and without supplies, the party came to a final halt.

His exile lasted nearly a year and a half. Long before that time there had come a reaction in his favour. The new consuls were well disposed towards him; Clodius's insolence had already disgusted Pompey; Caesar was absent with his legions in Gaul; his own friends, who had all along been active in his favour (though in his querulous mood he accused them of apathy) took advantage of the change, his generous rival Hortensius being amongst the most active; and all the frantic violence of Clodius and his party served only to delay for a while the return which they could not prevent. A motion for his recall was carried at last by an immense majority. Cicero had one remarkable ally on that occasion. On one of the days when the Senate was known to be discussing his recall, the 'Andromache' of Ennius was being played in the theatre. The popular actor Esop, whose name has come down to us in conjunction with that of Roscius, was playing the principal character. The great orator had been his pupil, and was evidently regarded by him as a personal friend. With all the force of his consummate art, he threw into Andromache's lament for her absent father his own feelings for Cicero.

Write highlights for this article: A Texas coroner declared the death of an adopted Russian boy accidental, prompting Moscow to demand a complete report from U.S. officials. Max Shatto, 3, who was adopted from Russia, lived in Texas with his adoptive parents. He reportedly died on January 21. Russia's Foreign Ministry expressed concerns over the ruling about his death, saying it did not receive the information from U.S. officials, but from the media. It asked the United States to provide Russian consular representatives the relevant forensic documents, including a death certificate. \\"We presume that this is not a final conclusion of the investigation. Still expect from the U.S. authorities -- both Texas and federal, including the U.S. Department of State -- the most complete information on the progress and results of the inquiry,\\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a statement. A medical examiner in Ector County determined the death was caused by a laceration of a small bowel artery due to blunt trauma to the abdominal area, said District Attorney Bobby Bland. After Texas boy's death, Russian official continues call for ban on adoptions. The bruising was consistent with a \\"self-inflicted\\" injury, according to Bland. Toxicology reports were negative and there were no substances found that could have contributed to the child's death. The sheriff's office said it is conducting more investigations with other agencies. The boy's death drew international attention after a Russian government child advocate said that the boy was \\"killed\\" or \\"murdered.\\" At a news conference last week, Children's Rights Commissioner Pavel Astakhov said he tweeted those words based on the initial reports he received about the death. He acknowledged he may have spoken too soon. Still, he wants his country to ban all international adoptions of Russian children. The boy's death aggravated U.S. State Department efforts to push through more than 500 adoption cases in which American families have already begun the process to adopt a Russian child before Moscow in December passed a law banning adoptions of Russian children by Americans. Families in limbo after adoption ban. That law bans adoptions by Americans ostensibly because of documented cases of abuse by adoptive parents. But others say the Russian move is in retaliation for a U.S. law that places restrictions on Russian human rights abusers. Americans adopted close to 1,000 Russian children last year, according to State Department figures. Though the number has been dropping in recent years, Russia remains the third most popular foreign country -- after China and Ethiopia -- for U.S. foreign adoptions. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The 1,817 square kilometres (702 sq mi) of the Alps covered by glaciers in 1876 had shrunk to 1,342 km2 (518 sq mi) by 1973, resulting in decreased river run-off levels.

The first thing you notice about New York's Ellis Island hospital is its sheer scale. Twenty-two buildings are perched proudly on the island's south side, their original vocations ranging from maternity ward, to psychiatric unit, to the contagious disease wing. The Ellis Island hospital complex, used between 1902 and 1930, was where immigrants were checked before being allowed onshore. Here, within view of the Statue of Liberty, babies were born, people died, and a constant stream of patients with new illnesses arrived. It was the biggest public health initiative the U.S. had ever attempted and now, it is open to the public for the first time in 60 years. The hospital's record is impressive. No epidemic on the U.S. mainland was ever attributed to an immigrant that came through its checking system. \\"There were fears of epidemics\\" the museum historian Barry Moreno told me. Cholera had broken out in New York in the 1890s, and \\"there were fears of smallpox...and typhus. But there was no epidemic that ever stemmed from here.\\" The hospital, he added, \\"played a very big role in screening immigrants.\\" The second thing that hits you is the hospital complex's authenticity. It looks like the dust has settled on a fire drill, from which no one returned. Single stools are left overturned. Buckets are left on top of closets, and bed frames lie rusty but intact in corners. The complex has survived extreme elements. Two years ago hurricane Sandy crippled the north side of the Island, closing the immigration museum there for a year. But the hospital stood firm, testament to a time when buildings were built \\"very sturdily,\\" Moreno says. One of the volunteer tour guides at the hospital, Tony Mrozinski, takes me into the morgue, where raked concrete benches tower over the area where autopsy tables once stood. \\"People always ask me,\\" he says, \\"when the concrete was restored. I tell them: 'it wasn't.'\\" The third thing you notice is what makes this place so addictive to the curious visitor. It's the blend of adversity and opportunity. Patients were subject to suffering and humiliation, but they received top-class treatment and the opportunity of a new life. Ellis Island has been described as an island of hope, an island of tears -- and the two fit in the same breath. This is not only a halfway house between origin and destination, but between captivity and free will, sickness and health. As part of its opening, the hospital French artist JR has created an installation inside its brick maze. JR has taken original photographs of the patients and doctors that walked its corridors, enlarging them to life-size and pasting them on the crumbling walls, windows and doors. Janis Calella, president of the government-funded Save Ellis Island group, says the use of historic photographs and their placement through the hospital \\"evoke some sort of an emotion,\\" making it easier to support the work. Permanent exhibitions are not permitted by the National Parks Service, which runs Ellis Island, and the images can be peeled off if required. However, there are no plans to do so, Calella says.

Fox also announced other changes to the show’s cast: Urban’s return to the contest was announced last month by Fox Chairman Kevin Reilly, who said the singer didn’t get a chance to show his personality in his first turn as a judge. Urban appeared overwhelmed last season by the Carey-Minaj crossfire that drew complaints from some viewers. “I think this season of ‘Idol’ is gonna be a blast,” Urban said in a statement Tuesday. “New team, new energy and a whole new field of artists to be discovered and given a chance!” Fox also announced that original judge Randy Jackson, who exited along with Carey and Minaj at the end of last season, will be back in a new role as in-house mentor to the contestants. Ryan Seacrest, also part of “Idol” from the start, will again host. “Surprise, surprise! I am so happy to be back as part of this amazing show that started it all,” said Jackson. “The original talent show is back with a vengeance and ready to discover the best talent in America.” Record executive Jimmy Iovine had served as mentor in recent seasons. Fox said that Universal Music Group’s Interscope Records, under Iovine’s direction as chairman, will continue to release “Idol” winner and contestant music. “Idol” has been declining in popularity, and the show’s producers might be hoping that viewers will find the new judging panel more likable: If you noticed the buzz about this news is considerably smaller than in years past, well, that’s not surprising. First, both names have been rumored for days. And second, “Idol” ratings have been consistently falling; the show suffered its least-watched ever this past spring, when Candice Glover was named the winner. Anyway, Connick Jr. has finally given in — his name has long been batted around as a potential judge, as he’s appeared on the show before as one of the most compelling celebrity mentors, and genuinely seemed to enjoy his time with the contestants. J-Lo returns for her second stint after playing judge Seasons 10 and 11. She took a break this past year, which featured the most judge-centric season in “Idol” history, as dueling divas Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj made the show all about them, while Keith Urban and Randy Jackson tried to stay out of the way. As a mentor, Connick was more dedicated to the singers than the other celebrities, Lisa de Moraes wrote when he appeared on the show in 2010: Connick, a.k.a. New Blue Eyes, treated his “Idol” gig as seriously as jury duty, in marked contrast to all those drive-by mentors who spent as little time as possible in the company of the Idolettes, preferring to simply use them as props for album-plugging.. . . “What I’m trying to do is feature the contestants by writing a supportive arrangement,” Connick said during a taped bit in which he was seen at the ivories, tickling out one of the arrangements for Tuesday’s performance show. “I should be lying by the pool. Do you think Shania Twain was up in here doing this?” he said, about last week’s phone-it-in mentor. Props to Connick for the first cross-mentor snipe in “Idol” history. And, by the way, for actually watching the show and knowing who was the previous week’s mentor -- you think quasi-mentor Usher knew he followed quasi-mentor Miley Cyrus? Me neither. The five down-to-the-wire Idolettes -- Aaron Kelly, Casey James, Michael Lynche, Crystal Bowersox and Lee DeWyze -- couldn’t stop talking about how funny, helpful, available and downright heroic Connick was, after that steady trail of see-ya-wouldn’t-wanna-be-ya mentors to whom they’d been subjected.

Since it was first confirmed at a Buckinghamshire nursery in March, the number of cases has slowly increased. And in late October, ecologists' fears were realised when an important barrier was breached - it was found in the wider environment and the UK's 80 million ash trees were at risk. The news last month that the disease, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, had been found in woodlands in East Anglia prompted Mr Paterson to impose an import ban on ash trees, and to carry out a nationwide survey to find out how far the disease had spread. He also convened an emergency summit, bringing together \\"key stakeholders\\", to consider what could be done. The resulting action plan, agreed at an emergency Cobra meeting, outlined where the government would focus its efforts. The plan seems to be pinning a great deal of hope on scientists finding natural resistance within the UK's population of ash trees. Once identified, researchers would then look to grow the next generation of ash trees that would be resilient to the pathogen. One of the government's leading scientists, Prof Ian Boyd, is optimistic. He told journalists: \\"By next season, we could potentially have resistant forms of ash growing in this country.\\" Mind the gap But ash trees, while considered fast-growing within the world of hardwood trees, take decades to reach maturity and produce the seeds that would sow naturally resistant trees. In the interim, ash dieback will continue to spread and trees would continue to become infected and not be replaced, as Dr Pocock explained. How ash dieback could threaten Britain's wildlife \\"Those that are susceptible to the disease will get hit, and those that are not or less susceptible will go on and will be able to fruit. That is the process of natural selection,\\" he told BBC News. \\"But the process of natural selection on trees will operate on much longer timescales. \\"If there was a disease that affected an annual plant, the selection pressure on that plant would be such that you would get resistance, and then you would get the spread of the resistant [offspring of the plant]. \\"You would see a dip in that species population for a couple of years, and then it would be likely to recover,\\" Dr Pocock explained. \\"You would expect to see the same thing in trees, but the timescale is at least decades rather than months or years.\\" So would ecosystems be able to cope with the loss of ash trees from the landscape while the naturally resistant trees matured? RSPB forestry officer Nick Phillips said UK woodlands were already in trouble. \\"The important point to remember here is that woodland wildlife is already in crisis,\\" he told BBC News. \\"One in six woodland flowers is threatened with extinction. Our woodland butterflies have halved since the 1990s. Many of our woodland birds have declined by 70% or more. \\"This is not the result of tree disease, this is something that has already been going on for some time. \\"Our woodland wildlife is already stressed and we don't know yet what effect additional stress will have on it.\\" Mission impossible And the outbreak is already shaping the future, as tree managers weigh up the risk of planting ash in woodlands. This year saw the Woodland Trust create 59 Diamond Woods and its flagship 460-acre (186ha) Diamond Park in Leicestershire to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. How to spot the signs A spokesman told BBC News that, in light of the news that the disease was here to stay, the Trust had taken the decision that it would suspend planting ash saplings and substitute them with other native species. He added that now that the planting season was opening, there were plans to plant three million trees over the coming months. \\"As it stands, we are running all tree planting events as normal. We will substitute any ash saplings for either oak, birch or possible shrubs such as hazel, dependent on the location and what fits best within the current landscape.\\" And the concern about planting new ash trees is spreading. Brighton is famed for being home to veteran elms that did not fall victim to the outbreak of Dutch elm disease, thanks to the combination of the city's geographical location and a very robust tree management regime. However, a spokeswoman for Brighton and Hove Council said such an approach would not work to prevent ash dieback infecting trees. \\"The recent outbreak of ash dieback is spread by the wind, and this type of dispersal is impossible to protect against. \\"At present, we are not purchasing any ash trees and would avoid the species until we know more about the disease.\\" So until scientists make a breakthrough and can propagate ash dieback-resistant trees, the situation for ash - a popular street tree - is likely to get worse before it gets better. Ash is one of just 30-odd native tree species, making the thought of losing it from the landscape a difficult pill to swallow for many people. \\"It is very difficult to predict what the impact will be if ash dieback is as serious as the worst fears,\\" Centre for Ecology and Hydrology ecologist Michael Pocock observed. \\"The vast majority if not all ecologists will be [recording the spread and impact of the disease] with a heavy heart because, ultimately, we are not ecologists to chart the progress of doom - we are ecologists because we care about the environment and we want to do something positive.\\" What was that article about?","completion":"The article discusses the spread of ash dieback disease, caused by the fungus Chalara fraxinea, which is threatening the UK's 80 million ash trees.

Now she has a chance to see this wish come true thanks to build On, an American non-profit organization that is building a school in her community. For 17 years, build On has been sending American high school students overseas to create schools in places where literacy and formal education are usually out of reach. The organization has built about 300 schools in Mali, Malawi, Nepal, Senegal, Nicaragua and Haiti. Its goal is to get young Americans in mostly urban areas to get involved in education. At the same time it can bring literacy to children and adults in poor villages in the developing world. Sounkala's school only has about 70 children; mud floors, poor lighting, few desks and an absence of books mean that the school is not the most ideal learning environment. Therefore they certainly could use build On's help. Samake hasn't been to school, but she wants a better future for her five daughters, including Ramatou, 12, and Mariam, 10. \\"When a woman attends school, she will teach what she learns to her children,\\" said Ramatou, who wants to become a doctor. \\"She will also know how to take better care of her family.\\" Build On tries to build schools for grades one to three. If things go well over those three years, they return to help build another school for grades four to six, and then set up evening adult literacy classes. Ramatou and Mariam will not learn inside the walls of build On school since they are already in the sixth grade, but Samake hopes that they will be able to attend evening classes to continue learning.

Q: where does the saying calling the kettle black come from? A:","completion":"The saying \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\" is an English idiomatic phrase or proverb that describes the act of accusing another while being guilty of the same fault or something similar. Its initial usage and development are traced back to literature of the 17th century. The phrase's origin is rooted in the old days when most cooking pots and kettles were forged from heavy metals like cast iron, copper, or even in tripods made of iron or brass. These utensils were placed directly over the fire to cook food or boil water. Consequently, pots and kettles grew dark and tarnished due to the continual exposure to fire and smoke, regardless of what they were initially made from; hence the concept of the \\"black\\" pot and kettle. The first known appearance of this phrase in literature dates back to 1620, in Thomas Shelton's translated version of Spanish novel named \\"Don Quixote\\" by Cervantes. The phrase was written as, \\"You are like what is said that the frying-pan said to the kettle, 'Avant, black-browes'\\". The word 'Avant' is an old version of 'avaunt,' which meant 'go away' or 'get out of the way' in Middle English. The exact phrasing we commonly use today, \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\", is witnessed around the mid-17th century. It appeared in William Penn's work \\"Some Fruits of Solitude\\" from 1693, where he writes, \\"A Covetous man to a prodigal, says, the pot calls the kettle black.\\" It is then found in numerous other texts, steadily cementing its place in English literature and the English language. The proverb metaphorically conveys that the accuser is to be similarly criticised for something they accuse another of, similar to saying that someone is being hypocritical. Over time, the phrase became renowned globally, manifesting across various cultures but maintaining its profound message about pointing out others' flaws while overlooking one's own. Such is the rich history and diverse cultural interpretation of the saying, \\"the pot calling the kettle black\\"."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His boss asked him to figure out problems in two similar programs, program A and program B. John found program A having parallel slowdown, but program B does not have parallel slowdown. He has to weigh the merits of using these programs. Would program B be slower or faster than program A? Answer:","completion":"To determine whether program B would be slower or faster than program A, it is essential to understand the term \\"parallel slowdown\\" and the implications it has on a program's performance. Parallel slowdown refers to the situation where a program takes longer to execute on a parallel computing system with multiple processors than it would on a single processor. This can happen for various reasons such as increased communication overhead between processors, contention for shared resources, or load imbalance among processors. Now let's compare program A and program B: Program A: Experiences parallel slowdown, which means it takes longer to execute on a parallel computing system than it would on a single processor. There are potential inefficiencies in the way tasks are divided among the processors or in communication between them. As a result, it may not utilize all available processing power effectively. Program B: Does not have parallel slowdown, which implies that it effectively utilizes the parallel computing system. Program B can distribute tasks more evenly among the processors and has better communication between them. Consequently, the program can take advantage of all available processing power. When comparing the two programs on a parallel computing system, program B is expected to be faster than program A because it does not experience parallel slowdown. It can efficiently use the processing power of multiple processors, while program A's performance might suffer due to its inefficiencies in task distribution and communication overhead. However, keep in mind that this conclusion holds when considering a parallel computing system. If the programs were to be executed on a single processor, the performance difference might vary depending on their respective algorithmic complexities and any other inherent optimization factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sprint continued to lose subscribers from its lucrative contract-based plans, but at a relatively low rate: 44,000 in the quarter. Sprint's total customer count, 53.4 million, is now back at where it was in 2007, before the exodus of Nextel customers turned into a torrent. The Overland Park, Kan.-based company has made steady gains in the last year and a half. Unfortunately for the company, most of the new customers are low-paying ones. They buy service from Sprint's low-cost Virgin Mobile, Boost Mobile or Assurance Wireless brands, or from non-Sprint brands that use the company's network. The latest subscriber results don't include the effect of the iPhone, which Sprint started selling Oct. 14. The phone is expected to further improve the carrier's ability to keep customers, but at a high price. Apple charges about 600 for a phone that Sprint sells for 200. Chief Financial Officer Joe Euteneuer said each iPhone will cost the company about 200 more than another smartphone. All the same, the company expects its four-year purchasing agreement with Apple to add 7 billion to 8 billion to its own bottom line. CEO Dan Hesse compared getting the iPhone to signing a star baseball player to the \\"Sprint team.\\" \\"He has an expensive contract, but he's worth every penny,\\" said Hesse, who often draws on sports analogies. The problem for Sprint is that the cost of selling the iPhone comes up front, while the benefits, like higher service fees and lower service costs, accrue over time. Sprint doesn't expect the iPhone to be a moneymaker until 2014. The added cost of the iPhone comes as Sprint is also starting to revamp its network for higher speeds. That adds up to financing needs of 5 billion to 7 billion in the next few years, Euteneuer said. Sprint hopes to cover the gap by refinancing 4 billion debt coming due, Hesse said. The remaining 1 billion to 3 billion could be raised in the form of financing from the companies Sprint buying its new network equipment from: Samsung Electronics Co., Alcatel-Lucent and LM Ericsson AB. Euteneuer said the terms of the deal with Apple are confidential, but said there's a minimum commitment to buy 15.5 billion in iPhones over four years. That works out to about 25 million phones, a figure in line with a report in The Wall Street Journal early this month that the company had committed to buying 30 million iPhones over four years. Figures on the effect of the iPhone on Sprint's finances were missing from the presentation on Oct. 7, contributing to investor consternation. On Wednesday, Euteneuer apologized for not providing more information then. Also Wednesday, Sprint said it had raised the limit on its credit line by 150 million and amended the terms so that an increase in the total amount of phone discounts doesn't affect its creditworthiness. It said it had 1 billion undrawn on the line. Sprint's net loss was 301 million, or 10 cents per share, for the third quarter. That's down from 911 million, or 28 cents per share, a year ago. It was the best performance by Sprint since it reported a profit of 64 million in the third quarter of 2007. Revenue rose 2.2 percent to 8.3 billion. Analysts polled by FactSet expected a loss of 22 cents per share on 8.4 billion in revenue. Sprint shares slipped 19 cents, or 7 percent, to close at 2.51 Wednesday. Two weeks ago, they hit a three-year low of 2.10. Hesse also said the company has started discussions with Clearwire Corp. on how to make Sprint phones compatible with Clearwire's planned new wireless data network, and a discussions on commercial arrangements are ongoing. That sent Clearwire shares up 32 cents, or 20 percent, to close at 1.96. Sprint owns 54 percent of Clearwire and uses its current data network for \\"Sprint 4G\\" service. But it doesn't control Clearwire's board, and the relationship between the two management teams has been cool. Earlier this month, Sprint said it would stop selling phones compatible with Clearwire's current data network at the end of next year, with no mention of plans to use the planned \\"LTE\\" or \\"Long-Term Evolution\\" network. That sent Clearwire shares into a dive. Sanford Bernstein analyst Craig Moffett said Sprint third-quarter results were \\"fairly good.\\" If the company can straighten out its network strategy and its Clearwire relationship, investors might start to look past the financing needs of the next two years and toward the benefits that should kick in in 2014, he said. \\"For the first time in a year, expectations are appropriately low, and there are now at least a few glimmers of hope,\\" Moffett said. |||||","completion":"Sprint Nextel Corp has reported its smallest quarterly loss in four years as the carrier continues its turnaround efforts and improves customer retention and attraction. Sprint added a net of 1.3 million subscribers in the three months from July to September, marking its best result since 2006 but lost 44,000 subscribers from its contract-based plans during the same period. The total number of customers now stands at 53.4 million, the same level as before the exodus of Nextel customers. This comes as the company begins to sell the iPhone and revamp its network for higher speeds, resulting in financing needs of between 5 billion and 7 billion over the next few years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person needs ice for a barbecue happens, how will it affect Less trays are filled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis states that a person needs ice for a barbecue, which may result in less trays being filled. Step 2: Identify possible direct effects If less trays are filled, there will be fewer ice cubes available. This could directly affect the amount of ice needed for the barbecue. Step 3: Identify possible indirect effects Fewer filled ice cube trays could indirectly affect how long it takes to produce enough ice for the barbecue if additional ice needs to be made. Step 4: Determine the overall impact on the process The perturbation has both direct and indirect effects on the ice-making process. The direct effect is that there will be fewer ice cubes to use immediately, which may be insufficient for the barbecue. The indirect effect is that it will take more time to produce enough ice, since multiple rounds of ice cube tray filling and freezing may be required.

News article: Chicago Bears: Former offensive coordinator Mike Tice downplays rift with quarterback Jay Cutler The noise inside Mike Tice's suburban Seattle home can be deafening these days. The former Bears offensive coordinator isn't bothered by the commotion. He knew what was in store when he huddled with his wife, Diane, and decided to use their newfound free time to remodel. \\"You might hear a bunch of screaming and drilling in a minute,'' Tice cautioned during a recent phone interview. \\"In fact, my contractor is banging on the door right now. I've got to go make some decisions. These are the only decisions I make now ... how far tile is going to go.'' Unfortunately for Tice, he wasn't a part of the Bears' rebuilding project. After coach Lovie Smith was fired on New Year's Eve, Tice and the rest of the assistant coaches were left in limbo. New coach Marc Trestman retained two of them — Jon Hoke (defensive backs) and Mike Phair (defensive line) — while four others quickly landed other NFL jobs. Tice, meanwhile, is one of four offensive coaches from Smith's staff who remain out of work. He was relieved of his duties Jan. 17 with one year on his contract, and the Bears owe him about 1 million. \\"Everyone says: 'But you get paid. You've got a contract,' \\" Tice said. \\"For me, the thrill of going in and trying to create something and the thrill of trying to get better is what it's all about.'' Tice approached every practice with the mind-set of moving forward, even if statistics showed his offense took a step back. A recent report alleged Tice and quarterback Jay Cutler were so much at odds last season that backup quarterback Josh McCown had to act as a liaison. A sideline incident in Dallas, where Cutler angrily walked away after Tice sat down and tried to explain something to him, would seem to back such a claim. But Tice said that incident was the only true rift he had with Cutler. \\"In regard to the comments that are out there about there being an intermediary between Jay Cutler and (me) because of a lack of communication, there wasn't a week that went by last year where Jay and I did not communicate,'' Tice said. \\"I never felt at all that there was ever a point in the season that Jay didn't support what I was trying to do.'' Tice would rather put his Bears stint in the past and look ahead to the next opportunity. He spoke with Chiefs coach Andy Reid about becoming the team's offensive line coach. Tice spent two seasons coaching the Bears line before being elevated to coordinator. \\"I thought I had a shot at that job,'' Tice said. \\"During the course of the interview, I recommended a guy I worked with, Andy Heck. And Andy got the job instead.'' Tice figured he had a chance with the Cowboys when offensive line coach Bill Callahan was promoted to offensive coordinator. A position never materialized — Callahan will oversee the line while assuming play-calling duties — so Tice had to conjure up a different strategy. \\"We said we were going to move out to Seattle and kind of regroup and join the YMCA and try to get back in shape,'' Tice said. \\"I wanted to spend some quality time with Diane and see how a normal person gets up in the morning and plans things without having to go through all those hours.'' An open schedule allowed Tice to revisit one of his other loves: horse racing. He attended the Kentucky Derby and even walked his friend Mike Pegram's horse Fiftyshadesofhay to the winner's circle after the Black-Eyed Susan Stakes in Baltimore. \\"That was fun, but other than that, I'm usually just shoveling black rock in my driveway,'' Tice said. \\"I'm just a normal guy trying to stay busy.'' Time away from football has allowed Tice to reflect on what he could have done better as a coach. He connected with his linemen with a hard-line approach and charmed the media with his comedic monologues. Yet critics will point to his struggles as a first-time coordinator. The Bears finished 28th out of 32 teams in total offense, 29th in passing offense and 22nd in third-down efficiency. \\"Anytime you fail at something, you always want to take a look at why you failed,'' Tice said. \\"I always try to correct Mike Tice before I try to correct somebody else. I learned a lot of lessons from it. I don't really want to go into them. \\"I would sum it up like this: Sometimes in life, we find ourselves trying to get along and trying to please as opposed to being who we really are.'' Tice realizes the Bears' offensive identity strongly contributed to Smith's firing. He knows Smith had his back even through the most trying times. \\"I loved working for Lovie Smith,'' Tice said. \\"(He) is a man of honor. (He) never blamed anyone for failure. He always took it head on and put himself first as the guy who had to get better. And I admired that about him. Not every single guy is willing to take the bullet.'' Tice still wants to take a shot at coaching, although his outlook toward the profession has changed. The former Vikings head coach reflected on how he helped a \\"baby'' grow in former Bears guard Lance Louis, now with the Dolphins. \\"I would love to be an offensive line coach moving forward,'' Tice said. \\"My aspirations of being a head coach are not going to drive me. What's going to drive me is working with a group of guys and developing an offensive line. That is where my energy, my enthusiasm is. \\"With that said, I'm out of work. If someone said, 'Hey, you want to coach tight ends?' I'm a good tight ends coach too, you know?'' What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\".

When the figure turns around the film introduces the audience to Lilja, who has recently been brutally beaten. The film then reveals her past. Lilja lives with her mother in a run down apartment block in an unnamed former republic of the Soviet Union (principal filming took place in Paldiski, Estonia). Lilja's mother tells her they are emigrating to the United States with the mother's new boyfriend, but instead she abandons Lilya in the care of her aunt. The selfish Aunt moves herself into the larger, nicer flat that Lilja and her mother had lived in, while forcing Lilya to move into a smaller, squalid apartment. A subsequent succession of humiliations and miseries are heaped upon Lilja. Her best friend encourages her to join her in prostituting herself for cash, but Lilja does not join her. When money is discovered in the friend's possession, she lies and implicates Lilya, whose reputation is subsequently ruined in the community and at school. She finally decides to become a prostitute to support herself. She forms a close, protective relationship with her friend Volodya, himself the victim of abuse. She buys Volodya a basketball, but Volodya's father punctures it with a pair of scissors. She meets Andrei who becomes her boyfriend and offers her a job in Sweden.

The flashbacks picks up when Lucky, born and raised on the Balkan Peninsula, tries to marry into money and goes to the U.S. to find himself a wealthy bride. He has no luck, despite his name, and instead makes an attempt to bluff his way forward, pretending to be count De Kloven, a rich aristocrat. As De Kloven, Lucky gets hired to escort the prominent socialite Mrs. Lola Morgan, but quits when she wants him to be her lover. Instead he tries a new disguise, as Rudolph Von Hertsen, and gets involved in another racket with a Dr. J.M. Randall, performing abortions and selling unwanted babies. When the racket is disclosed, Lucky moves on to the business of pimping young women into prostitution. He goes as far as to trick naive young women into laying their lives in his hands, selling them as sex-slaves, thus entering into the business of white slavery. He soon becomes the head of such an organization. His right-arm man, Nick goes to lengths to get new merchandise for the business, and kidnaps Dorothy, a young, blonde schoolgirl.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are no more trays left happens, how will it affect more water will remain with the salt. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process. If there are no more trays left to collect water vapor, it will disrupt the process of desalination, as the water vapor cannot be effectively separated from the salt. The process mentioned is a simplified version of distillation, a technique used to separate mixtures based on differences in their boiling points, which is often used for desalinating salt water. The steps are as follows: 1. Boil salt water: Heating the salt water causes it to evaporate, turning into water vapor. 2. Collect the water vapor: Usually, this is done using a condensation apparatus, such as trays or a cooling tube, which captures the water vapor. 3. Allow the water vapor to cool: The water vapor condenses back into liquid water as it cools down. 4. The water vapor turns into liquid water: As the vapor temperature drops, it condenses into droplets of pure water. 5. The salt is separated from the water: The salt particles are too heavy to evaporate, so they remain in the boiling container. In the context of the perturbation hypothesis, if there are no more trays left to collect the water vapor, it will lead to the following consequences: - The water vapor will not be effectively captured, which will make it difficult to separate clean water from salt. - The condensed water droplets may mix back with the salty water, diluting the efficiency of the entire process. - More water will remain mixed with the salt, reducing the overall volume of purified water collected. In summary, the lack of trays to collect water vapors is an indirect factor that disrupts the water desalination process and leads to less purified water being collected, as it makes the separation process less efficient."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film begins with June's short narrative prologue about the swan feather in the opening credits and then her farewell surprise party in San Francisco for June's upcoming reunion with her long-lost twin sisters in China.

These questions are not the same. Each question has a different topic and addresses different issues. Let us discuss each question and how they differ from one another. The first question asks about a funny TV program involving DIY paper-made cars. People compete in this show to see if they can successfully fly their paper cars over water without falling into it. This TV program is focused on entertainment and creativity. It involves participants designing and building their vehicles and then testing their creations in a fun and lively setting. On the other hand, the second question revolves around a hypothetical situation where only one or two people are left on Earth, and the availability of utilities like water and electricity for those remaining individuals is being questioned. Specifically, it explores whether a water tower would continue to supply water and if a house with a generator would still produce power. The first question's primary purpose is to draw attention to an amusing and whimsical TV program, whereas the second question is more concerned with the practical matter of survival in a post-apocalyptic world. Furthermore, the second question raises a multitude of complex issues related to infrastructure, resource availability, and human ingenuity in the face of adversity. In the theoretical scenario, water towers may initially provide water, but without proper maintenance, the quality of water would likely deteriorate over time due to contamination and infrastructure breakdown. Similarly, a home generator could continue to supply electricity, depending on its fuel source and ability to maintain the generator for an extended period. In summary, the two questions are indeed different.

Addams Family Values is a dark comedy directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and is a sequel to the 1991 hit film \\"The Addams Family.\\" The distinguished Addams Family characters were initially created by Charles Addams, a renowned cartoonist from the United States, featured in The New Yorker magazine. The eccentric and macabre family went on to inspire a television series, animated series, and several movies. In \\"Addams Family Values,\\" Amanda Buckman is a perky, bright, but somewhat cruel and snobbish camp-goer at Camp Chippewa, which the Addams siblings Wednesday (played by Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (played by Jimmy Workman) attend. The character Amanda is emblematic of everything the sinister Addams oppose, with her being an upbeat and conventional \\"all-American girl.\\" Throughout the movie, Amanda Buckman serves as a stark contrast to the morbid and deadpan personalities exhibited by the Addams family. One of the highlights of the film is the interaction between the two polar-opposite characters – Amanda Buckman and Wednesday Addams – in scenes where the two young girls are often at odds with each other, leading to memorable confrontations and exchanges.

Please answer the following question: Q: Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm, they are no more identical than siblings born at what? Choices: - other times of day - different places - other eras - different times A: Answer:","completion":"A: Different times Dizygotic twins, also known as fraternal twins or non-identical twins, develop when two separate eggs are fertilized by two separate sperm cells. This results in two embryos that share a womb but may not share the same genetic material, as siblings born from different pregnancies. Because dizygotic twins have the same genetic similarity as siblings born at different times, they are not more identical than children from the same parents who are born at different times. This means that these twins can have varying degrees of similarity in their physical appearance, temperament, and other characteristics. It is also possible for dizygotic twins to have different genders, unlike monozygotic (identical) twins who always have the same gender. Siblings, whether dizygotic twins or not, share approximately 50% of their DNA, as they inherit half of their genetic material from each parent. Given that genetic similarities in dizygotic twins are no greater than those in siblings born years apart, it could be said that dizygotic twins are essentially siblings who just happened to be born at the same time. To address the other choices from the question: - Other times of day: The time of day has no impact on the genetic similarity between siblings or twins. - Different places: Genetic similarity is not influenced by the location where the child is born. - Other eras: Genetic similarity between siblings remains constant regardless of when they were born. Differences in environment, societal norms, or technologies may create differences in appearance, health, or behavior, but the underlying genetic relationship is unchanged. In conclusion, dizygotic twins are no more identical or similar than siblings born at different times, as they share roughly the same amount of genetic material. Their similarities and differences lie in the fact that they develop in the same womb during the same pregnancy, experiencing a similar environment during gestation.

She was 35 years old and lived in a place called Wolverhampton. Nina was very tall, standing at 5 feet 10 inches, and she weighed only 8 stones. However, people kept telling her that she was too big to become a model. This made Nina very sad and worried, so she decided to starve herself, meaning she didn't eat enough food to be healthy. After some time, Nina realized that what she was doing to her body was not good. She was making herself sick by not eating enough. So, Nina made a very important decision. Instead of continuing to starve herself, she decided to gain weight naturally. This means she started eating healthy foods and taking care of her body. As Nina began to take better care of herself, she grew bigger and became a size 18. Instead of feeling sad about her size, Nina decided to embrace it and show the world that beauty comes in different shapes and sizes. This was a very brave thing to do! Nina then started working as a plus-size model. A plus-size model is someone who models clothes for people who are bigger in size. Nina became very successful in her new job. She worked for big companies like Evans, M&S, House of Fraser, and Harrods, which made her very happy. Today, Nina Blakemore is not only a successful model, but she is also an inspiration to other people who may be struggling with their weight or trying to fit into a certain mold. Nina's story teaches us that true beauty comes from being healthy and happy with who we are, no matter our size.

Article: With the growth of the European Union and increased globalisation, English is increasingly the lingua franc a in European businesses, and those who speak it have become the elite of the workforce. In the past, only a few specialists in a company were needed to communicate with foreign businesses.However, in these days of multinational companies, where workers are required to communicate with other employees from several countries, a common language is essential and English has become the logical choice. Nowadays, even blue-collar workers in many companies are required to speak English.For example, just over three years ago, a Dutch company.United Pan-European Communications (UPC), was contracted to build a TV studio in Amsterdam.The job involved many electricians--more than the company could find in the Netherlands.There were plenty of qualified electricians in nearby France and Belgium, but the American and Dutch executives of UPC wanted everyone on the job to speak and understand the same language.So, the UPC hired British electricians and flew them to Amsterdam every Monday, accommodating them in hotels all over the city, and flying them home on Friday evenings. Increasingly, workers who can speak English earn salaries 25-35% higher than those who can' t.They are also eligible for a wider range of high-level jobs. The problem is that, while the ability to speak English is fast becoming essential for getting a good job, there is a shortage of people who can speak it.According to a recent European Commission report, only about 41% of continental Europeans can speak English, and only 29% speak it well enough to carry on a conversation.Many companies are solving this problem by setting up English language schools within the workplace.English language schools all over Europe are expanding at a huge rate, and governments are looking at ways to improve English tuition in schools.

Here's how you can do that: Step 1: Subtract the constant term (21259) from both sides of the equal sign. This is to eliminate the constant on the left side and isolate the term with the variable, \`d\`. \`915d + 21259 - 21259 = 16684 - 21259\` This simplifies to: \`915d = -4575\` Step 2: After doing this subtraction, divide each side of the equation by the coefficient of \`d\`, which is \`915\`. This is to get \`d\` alone on one side. \`915d / 915 = -4575 / 915\` This simplifies to: \`d = -5\` Therefore, the solution to the equation \`915*d + 21259 = 16684\` for \`d\` is \`d = -5\`."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Article: With just a few minutes left before school was to start, my six-year-old, Dustin, was crying. \\"I don't want to go,\\" he said.

However he gave his wife a life interest which means she can stay in the house as long as she wants to so i share the house with her. Bit of backstory, everyone HATES his wife because she treated my family like shit for over 20 years. A few weeks ago my mother came by the house because she wanted to take one of his TVs to her house and the widow threw a tantrum, openly disrespecting my mother and threatening to call the police if she didn't leave. My mother told her she didn't want any trouble she just wanted the TV which was rightfully hers and that would be it. A lawyer came and settled it and my mother took the TV and that was that. Yesterday she sent my mother a cease and desist letter at her workplace as well as a restraining order preventing my mother from coming near the house. My mom used to be the only person in the family who actually liked her so this caused a rift. Now the wife is threatening me with a lawyer because i don't pay bills (I'm still a student so i don't work yet).My close family think she's doing all this because she wants the house for herself.

The tension and conflict between the family members are evident, with the grandfather's wife treating the family poorly and generating animosity. The grandfather's will clearly outlines the division of property, and AUTHOR has the legal right to sell the house, although the wife has a life interest. It might be worth considering alternative solutions or arrangements before selling the house, as selling it may potentially leave the wife with no place to live, further escalating the conflict.

Common special reasons include: Is this statement correct \\"can you own a handgun in new zealand\\"?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"can you own a handgun in New Zealand?\\" is correct. Law-abiding citizens in New Zealand can own handguns, but the process is highly regulated and requires obtaining appropriate endorsements. Firearms licensing in New Zealand is administered by the New Zealand Police, which implements strict controls on ownership, usage, and storage of firearms in the interest of public safety. To own a handgun in New Zealand, a person must first apply for a firearms license. Obtaining a firearms license involves a thorough procedure, including a fit and proper person test, background check, attendance of a firearms safety course, and a home security inspection. The standard firearms license, also known as 'A Category' firearms license, does not cover handguns. To possess or use a handgun, the license holder must apply for additional endorsements. For a handgun, the person would typically apply for either a B or a C endorsement. 1. B endorsement: This endorsement is for pistol club members who want to own, possess or use pistols for target shooting at an approved pistol club. To obtain a B endorsement the applicant must: a. Be a current financial member of a pistol club affiliated with the national body - Pistol New Zealand (PNZ) b. Complete a six-month probationary period c. Attend a minimum number of club shoots as a probationary member d. Receive a recommendation from the approved pistol club that assesses and endorses them as a responsible and active club member 2. C endorsement: This endorsement is for firearms collection purposes, which can include handguns. A collector must prove a genuine interest in the collection of firearms, be affiliated with a collector's organization, and provide sufficient evidence of their expertise in firearms. The applicant must meet stringent requirements for firearms storage, and firearms with a C endorsement cannot be used for shooting purposes. Apart from these endorsements, there are also other special reasons for owning a handgun. Some examples include: a. Members of theatrical groups who use firearms for props in productions b. Individuals who require the use of firearms for pest control purposes in a professional capacity c. Persons working for accredited firearms dealers, museums, or responsible for culling operations In conclusion, while it is possible to own a handgun in New Zealand, the process is heavily regulated and requires individuals to fulfill specific criteria and obtain appropriate endorsements. Assessments and stringent control measures ensure that New Zealand maintains its commitment to public safety while allowing responsible use of firearms within the guidelines set forth by the New Zealand Police and applicable laws."},{"prompt":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: Eleven-year-old Kevin has a vivid imagination and is fascinated by history, particularly Ancient Greece; his parents ignore his activities, having become more obsessed with buying the latest household gadgets to keep up with their neighbours.

Step 2: Compare the cat's movement speed in both terrains - The question states that the cat \\"moves slower through the river then through the jungle.\\" Step 3: Assess the effect of movement speed on heat generation - Generally, animals (including cats) generate more heat when they move faster. This is because their muscles are working harder, which generates heat as a byproduct. Step 4: Evaluate which terrain results in lower heat generation for the cat - Given that the cat moves slower in the river, it is likely that its muscles are working less hard in the river than in the jungle. As a result, the cat would generate less heat in the river. Answer: river"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write a title for this article: Benjamin Franklin wrote that \\"nothing is certain but death and taxes,\\" but that is only half-true. There is absolutely nothing dead-certain about taxes this year. Unless Congress acts soon, almost all of the \\"Bush tax cuts\\" and credits that were enacted in 2001 and 2003 will expire at the end of this year. Most financial analysts and Washington insiders say they don't expect that to happen. But if it does, you -- the American taxpayer -- are in for a tax hike. A big one. Here's what it will mean to you: -- The standard percent rates -- the baseline percentage of your income that goes to the government -- will universally rise, at an estimated cost of roughly 157 billion annually; from 10 percent to 15 (for lowest-income earners), from 25 percent to 28, from 28 percent to 31, from 33 percent to 36, and from 35 percent to 39.6 percent (for highest-income earners). -- Indexing of the alternative minimum tax (AMT), which ensures that taxpayers who benefit from itemized reductions and/or credits pay a separately calculated minimum tax, will expire. -- Taxes on capital gains and dividends will increase, potentially costing investors an estimated 35 billion annually. -- Married couples who saw their standard deduction raised to that of double the single amount will go back to paying higher rates, at a cost of roughly 32 billion a year. -- Expanded tax credits like the child tax credit, which previously increased to 1,000 from 500, will expire, costing American families an estimated 26 billion a year. -- The already-expired estate tax would revert back to 2009 levels, translating to a minimum estimate of 26 billion to heirs and heiresses. -- The personal exemption phase-out (PEP), which allowed high-income filers to deduct the full value of their personal exemptions and itemized deductions, will expire, potentially costing wealthy households about 21 billion. \\"As a general matter, everybody is affected, maybe except for certain seniors,\\" said Chuck Marr, director of federal tax policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. \\"All taxpayers have something at stake.\\" For the family of four bringing in a combined income of 75,000, the expiration of all Bush-era tax cuts will amount to a tax increase of 2,143 next year, according to the Tax Foundation's 2011 Income Tax Calculator. A family of four earning 150,000 would see its income tax burden increase by 4,510 to 23,150, according to the Tax Foundation. Single filers, meanwhile, would see their taxes rise by 605 at the 50,000 income plateau and by 1,355 at 75,000. A single filer earning 150,000, including 15,000 in long-term capital gains, would pay an extra 3,269, with a total tax liability of 28,340. A single parent of one child earning 25,000 would see his tax liability rise by 955, decreasing his tax refund of 1,856 to just more than 900. A low-income family of five earning a total of 45,000 would see their taxes increase by 2,538, equating to a total tax liability of 1,028. An upper-middle income family of four with two earners pulling in 150,000, including 15,000 in long-term capital gains, would see their taxes increase by 3,802. That family's total tax burden? Roughly 21,600. A high-income family of four, meanwhile, with a combined income of 300,000 and 20,000 in itemized deductions, would see their taxes jump by more than 11,000 if Congress allows all of the Bush-era tax cuts to expire. That equals a total tax liability of 68,392. For even higher earners -- such as a married couple with no children making 420,000 in total income and with 20,000 deductions apiece for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions -- that total tax liability grows to 106,815, or an increase of more than 16,600 from 2010. Further up the income ladder, a married couple earning 700,000 in wages with 300,000 worth of long-term capital gains and qualified dividends and 95,000 in deductions for mortgage interest and state/local income taxes would see their tax share grow by 61,206. Finally, a retired married couple with a combined income of 60,000 -- including 10,000 in qualified dividends, 25,000 in Social Security benefits and 10,000 in 401(k) distributions -- would see their tax liability increase by 2,676. \\"If all the tax cuts expire, everyone stands to lose,\\" said Mark Robyn, a staff economist for the Tax Foundation. \\"A lot of people like to paint the Bush tax cuts as having only benefited the rich, which is not true -- you can simply look at the estimates.\\" Citing estimates from the Office of Management and Budget, Robyn said letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire only for high-income people would raise 630 billion over 10 years, compared to 3 trillion during the same period if all the tax cuts were to expire. Robyn said one of the biggest tax cuts for middle-income earners was the creation of the 10 percent bracket, which will rise to 15 percent if Congress doesn't act. He also cited the significant impact of doubling the child tax credit to 1,000. That, too, will expire unless a compromise is reached in Washington. \\"That's a pretty significant tax cut,\\" Robyn said. \\"If that were to go back, I think a lot of people would feel that.

Step 2: Understand the link between trees and carbon dioxide. - Trees absorb carbon dioxide during the process of photosynthesis. - Higher amounts of trees would lead to lower amounts of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and vice versa. Step 3: Make a logical deduction based on the provided information. - Since planet A has much more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet B, it is likely that planet A has fewer trees than planet B.

The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

Background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Paragraph: Mary and Ann got some fruit as a gift from a friend.

Pogoing aside, Vicious had been involved in a notorious incident during that memorable second night of the 100 Club Punk Special. Arrested for hurling a glass at The Damned that shattered and blinded a girl in one eye, he had served time in a remand centre—and contributed to the 100 Club banning all punk bands. At a previous 100 Club gig, he had assaulted Nick Kent with a bicycle chain. Indeed, McLaren's NME telegram said that Vicious's \\"best credential was he gave Nick Kent what he deserved many months ago at the Hundred Club\\". According to a later description by McLaren, \\"When Sid joined he couldn't play guitar but his craziness fit into the structure of the band. He was the knight in shining armour with a giant fist.\\" \\"Everyone agreed he had the look,\\" Lydon later recalled, but musical skill was another matter. \\"The first rehearsals...in March of 1977 with Sid were hellish.... Sid really tried hard and rehearsed a lot\\". Marco Pirroni, who had performed with Vicious in Siouxsie and the Banshees, has said, \\"After that, it was nothing to do with music anymore. It would just be for the sensationalism and scandal of it all. Then it became the Malcolm McLaren story\\".Membership in the Sex Pistols had a progressively destructive effect on Vicious.

Kumoko Answer:","completion":"Title: The Web of Kumoko Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot: Act 1: Introducing the Enigma The movie opens in a small, coastal town named Havenwood. It's a quiet place known for its natural beauty and tight-knit community. Dr. James \\"Doc\\" Velie, a well-respected middle-aged veterinarian who runs the local animal clinic, is shown to be highly trusted by the townspeople, especially for his work with exotic animals. One day, when Doc Velie is having brunch with his close friends at the local cafe, he accidentally lets slip that someone named Kumoko is dead. To Doc Velie's surprise, none of his friends have heard of this person before, and they're instantly intrigued by the mysterious name. Act 2: Digging Deeper Curiosity piqued, Doc Velie's friends – Wendy, a journalist for the Havenwood Gazette; Thomas, a retired police detective; and Janet, a local historian – investigate further into Kumoko's identity. They find out that Kumoko was a reclusive marine biologist who had moved to Havenwood years ago but seldom interacted with the townspeople. Kumoko had dedicated her life to studying a unique species of spider found only in Havenwood, which is known to produce a potent venom that can be extracted for medicinal purposes. As they continue to delve into Kumoko's past, they discover Kumoko was suspected to be involved in illegal activities, specifically smuggling her spider venom research to a dangerous international group. This group was supposedly involved in creating untraceable poisons used for criminal purposes. The investigation also reveals that Kumoko had faked her own death years ago in order to escape from the criminal organization she had become entangled with. Act 3: The Truth Unveiled Things take a dramatic turn when a recent death in Havenwood is discovered to be the result of a lethal dose of the spider venom. Wendy, Thomas, and Janet suspect that Kumoko might still be alive and involved in the crime. They suspect that Doc Velie, with his knowledge of exotic animals, might also be working in secret with Kumoko. Wendy, Thomas, and Janet confront Doc Velie with their findings. Initially defensive, Doc Velie finally admits that he was aware of Kumoko's true identity, but he had only been helping Kumoko in her research to extract the antidote for the venom's deadly effects. He then reveals that Kumoko had discovered that someone in their town was the real mastermind behind the smuggling ring, and that her death had been staged so she could secretly investigate the criminal network. Act 4: A Web of Deceit Together, the friends work with Doc Velie to unravel the web of deceit spun by the smuggling ring. They eventually identify the ringleader as a high-ranking member of Havenwood's city council who had been using Kumoko's research for personal gain. In an action-packed final act, Kumoko, who had been living in hiding under a new identity, reemerges to help take down the ringleader and save Havenwood from further harm. The movie concludes with Kumoko receiving a hero's welcome from the community, Doc Velie's reputation restored, and the friends celebrating the truth finally coming to light."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to celebrate his discovery, the baron invites all his monster friends -- Dracula, the Werewolf, the Mummy, the Invisible Man, Dr Jekyll/Mr Hyde, the Creature from the Black Lagoon, and the Hunchback of Notre Dame -- to his Caribbean Island of Evil for a big party. The baron also has another reason for hosting such a gala. He has decided to retire as head of Monsters Incorporated and to pass on his secrets to his only \\"living\\" heir -- geeky, allergy-ridden pharmacist Felix Flankin, son of the baron's sister, the white sheep of the family. As the SS Herring bearing all the guests nears the island, the baron briefs his zombies about the necessity of remaining calm and collected no matter what happens. Only Yetch is having trouble keeping his head (and hands) attached. This is partly because it's been so long since Yetch has seen all their friends, but also because he is besotted with the baron's secretary, the lovely, well-stacked, red-headed, cool-as-a-cucumber Francesca [Gale Garnet].As the baron and Francesca prepare to greet their guests, they are joined by Frankenstein's Monster and his Mate [Phyllis Diller].

This talks about putting a plan or project into action in a country. - \\"on kuljettava käsi kädessä\\" means must go hand in hand. This means that two things are very closely connected and need to work together. - \\"kansallisten painopisteiden määrittelyn kanssa\\" means with the definition of national priorities.

How might one describe the sentiment of this review? It is really hard for me to write an honest review for this place. I have so many partial memories, that everything kinda blurs together... but I will soldier on and try my best. Part 1 Review: Restaurant So if you have had a chance to eat here, it isn't too bad. The food is a little bit salty, but when you are way wasted (which I was at the time), salt is good. It is typical Asian fusion with your obligatory sushi rolls. I had some grilled sea bass and a sushi roll which was decent. Besides, ordering dinner here was a decent and quick way to get full and get into the club. Part 2 Review: Club As I mentioned above, I have been to Tao a lot of times. It all kind of blends together, from raiding a bachelorette, to meeting Jesus and the Apostles hanging out with the 300 Spartans (it was one of the Halloweens I was at.... or maybe bits and pieces of two different Halloweens???), to being hungover as soon as I walked in at 11:00pm because I drank all day and then stopped for a couple hours.... you get the picture. I have had a lot of fun fun times at Tao and it is definitely a go to place for me. Even though it can get UBER crowded all the time, when they open up the Tao Beach area for night time (my favorite place), it is awesome.","completion":"To describe the sentiment of this review, we can break it down into two parts: Restaurant review and Club review. 1. Restaurant review sentiment: The sentiment here seems to be mildly positive. The reviewer acknowledges that the food is a little salty, but they also mention that it was decent overall, especially when taking their inebriated state into consideration. 2. Club review sentiment: The sentiment of this part is generally positive, with the reviewer mentioning the numerous occasions they have visited the club and their fondness for the Tao Beach area. They do point out that it can become overcrowded, but they seem to enjoy the experiences enough to label it as a go-to place. In summary, the overall sentiment of the review is fairly positive. The reviewer seems to have had enjoyable experiences at the fusion restaurant as well as the club, while acknowledging there are some minor imperfections."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.

Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective. Researcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the of more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Among the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?' The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades. \\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\\" said Bao. \\"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\\" Bao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death. A serving size is 28 grams. Nuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart.

Drama queens are dramatic by nature and need an audience for this. Asking someone you know is a drama queen how they're doing usually leads to trouble.","completion":"Instead, focus on creating a calm and supportive atmosphere around them. When dealing with a drama queen, it is important to remember that they tend to exaggerate their emotions and experiences. Due to their highly emotional nature, they may perceive everything as a major issue, even when it is not. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a measured and empathic approach when interacting with them. To start with, avoid engaging in gossip or discussions that may trigger their dramatic behavior. For drama queens, participating in such conversations is like adding fuel to their fire. Instead, try to steer the conversation towards topics less likely to incite melodrama. When a drama queen is on an emotional overdrive, practice active listening without over-involving yourself. Give them enough space to express their emotions while ensuring that you do not contribute to the escalation of the situation. Offer neutral responses to their outbursts, such as \\"I understand how you feel\\" or \\"That must be difficult,\\" without getting caught up in their drama. In case they become excessively emotional or disruptive, it might be necessary to set boundaries. Politely but firmly express that while you understand their emotions, it is essential to maintain a certain level of calm and respect in your interactions. You can say something like, \\"I can see that you're upset, but I think it would be best if we discuss this matter once you have had some time to calm down.\\" Another effective strategy is to redirect their focus on finding solutions rather than dwelling on the problem. Drama queens often indulge in their emotional storms without considering possible options for resolution. Encourage them to take a step back and look at the situation rationally by asking questions such as, \\"What do you think would be the best way to handle this?\\" or \\"How can we find a solution to this issue together?\\" Finally, it is crucial to remember that not all situations involving a drama queen demand your energy and attention. Sometimes, the best course of action is to simply walk away and allow them to resolve their issues on their own. In doing so, you will maintain your own emotional well-being and prevent yourself from being dragged into their whirlwind of emotions. Remember: taking care of your own mental and emotional health is just as important as helping someone else with theirs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: MATI, Greece (Reuters) - Greece’s prime minister told of the “unspeakable tragedy” the country faced after at least 74 people were killed by wildfires that swept through a resort, trapping people in cars and on the edge of cliffs as others were forced to jump off to survive. The scale of Monday night’s devastation in Mati became apparent at first light on Tuesday. Scores of gutted cars lined streets in the coastal town, east of Athens, melted by the intensity of the heat. Bodies lay on roadsides, and in one area, a group of 26 people were found dead - some locked in an embrace as the flames closed in. The group, which included children, were found near the top of a cliff overlooking a beach. They had ended up there after apparently searching for an escape route. “Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced,” the head of Greece’s Red Cross, Nikos Economopoulos, told Skai TV. The lucky ones were able to leap off the cliffs to survive, or rush into the sea from the beach. “We went into the sea because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water. It burned our backs and we dived into the water,” said Kostas Laganos, a middle-aged survivor. He compared the ordeal to the destruction of the city of Pompeii, where thousands were incinerated by the volcano of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. “I said ‘my God, we must run to save ourselves and nothing else’.” At least 74 people were killed, a fire brigade spokeswoman said, and the death toll was expected to rise. Poland said two of its citizens, a mother and her son, were among the victims. It was not clear how many people remained unaccounted for as boats combed beaches for any remaining survivors. Residents, their faces blackened by smoke, wandered the streets, some searching for their burned-out cars, others for their pets. The eerie silence was punctured by fire-fighting helicopters and the murmur of rescue crews. There were yellow body bags in several areas. Many in the area had been unable to escape the fast pace of the blaze even though they were a few meters from the Aegean Sea or in their homes, the fire service said. A Reuters photographer saw at least four dead people on a narrow road clogged with cars heading to a beach. One of the youngest victims was believed to be a six-month-old baby who died of smoke inhalation. At least 187 people were injured, officials said, among those 23 children. “Greece is going through an unspeakable tragedy,” Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said as he appeared on television to declare three days of national mourning. “Greece is living one of its most difficult moments,” he said. “There are absolutely no words to describe how we feel right now.” Flags atop the ancient Acropolis hill and parliament flew at half mast. The inferno was thought to be Greece’s deadliest, with the death toll higher than fires which ravaged the southern Peloponnese peninsula over several days in August 2007, killing dozens. By Tuesday afternoon, the Mati fire was contained, but the risk remained of it reigniting in scrubland parched by Greece’s searing summer heat. A burned house is seen following a wildfire at the village of Mati, near Athens, Greece July 24, 2018. REUTERS/Costas Baltas (GRAPHIC: Greece wildfires - tmsnrt.rs/2Ly4az6) “KILLER FIRE” Wildfires are not uncommon in Greece, and a relatively dry winter and hot summer helped create the current tinder-box conditions. The cause of the current blaze was not immediately clear and an Athens prosecutor ordered an investigation into it. Mati is a popular spot for Greek holidaymakers, particularly pensioners and children at summer camps. One of the missing included a woman with multiple sclerosis, dragged out of her wheelchair by her frantic husband as the flames closed in, but lost in the ensuing chaos. The fire service urged residents to report missing relatives and friends. Some took to Twitter and Facebook, posting photographs of young children and elderly couples they hoped to track down. Greece issued an urgent appeal for help to tackle fires that raged out of control in several places across the country, destroying homes and disrupting major transport links. Newspapers printed banner headlines including “Killer Fire” and “Hell”. Cyprus, Spain, Italy, Croatia and Portugal offered assistance after Greece said it needed air and land assets from European Union partners. “Our thoughts go to Greece and the victims of the terrible fires,” French President Emmanuel Macron said in tweets published in French and Greek. Pope Francis said in a telegram he was deeply saddened by the tragedy and prayed for the victims and their families.

Flames fanned by strong winds devastated the seaside village of Mati, devouring homes and cars. The coastguard said it and other ships rescued almost 700 people who had fled to the coast, and pulled 19 survivors and four bodies from the sea. A local mayor told the BBC there are fears the death toll could rise to 100. Mati is located in the Rafina region which is popular with local tourists, especially pensioners and children attending holiday camps. Rescuers there found the bodies of 26 adults and children, who had apparently hugged each other as they died, trapped just metres from the sea. Rafina's Mayor Evangalos Bournos told the BBC the village had \\"disappeared\\". He said more than 1,000 buildings had been destroyed or damaged - his own home among them. Hundreds of firefighters have been battling the blazes and the authorities are seeking international assistance. A fire brigade official confirmed the latest death toll. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has declared three days of national mourning. Image copyright EPA Image caption Smoke over a suburb of Athens Most shocking scene I have ever witnessed By Kostas Koukoumakas, Mati What is happening here in eastern Attica is a black hell. After I passed by hundreds of burning cars and houses earlier today, I reached the yard where police said so many people had been found dead. I could see some of them lying on the ground as fog covered the place and a toxic smell spread through the atmosphere. Most of them were tourists who had tried to find refuge but did not make it. \\"I am calling my cousin but he does not respond,\\" said Spiros Hatziandreou, who visited the spot. I could see flames in the trees and on the electricity poles all around. After that, police blocked access to everyone except rescuers. What happened in Mati? Fire swept through the village 40km (25 miles) north-east of Athens on Monday and was still burning in some areas on Tuesday. Desperate families trying to reach the safety of the sea were trapped by walls of smoke and flame. Others died in buildings or cars. After the 26 bodies were found in an open space, Nikos Economopoulos, head of Greece's Red Cross, said: \\"They had tried to find an escape route but unfortunately these people and their kids didn't make it in time. Instinctively, seeing the end nearing, they embraced.\\" Dimitri Piros, director of medical services for Ekav, Greece's nationwide ambulance service, told the BBC people had suffered horrific injuries because of the speed of the fire. The blaze struck like a flamethrower, he said, causing both smoke inhalation and skin burns. Coastal patrol boats and private vessels picked up hundreds of those who did manage to reach harbours or beaches. \\"Thankfully the sea was there and we went into the sea, because the flames were chasing us all the way to the water,\\" said one survivor, Kostas Laganos. \\"It burned our backs and we dived into the water... I said: 'My God, we must run to save ourselves.'\\" George Vokas, whose family escaped by sea but whose house and cars were burnt, told BBC News that two women he had tried to help had died. \\"We're talking about a biblical catastrophe in this wonderful area of Mati,\\" he said. Image copyright Reuters Image caption This woman in Mati was trying to find her dog on Tuesday Charred bodies lay just 15m (50ft) from the sea, photographer Pantelis Saitas told the Athens-Macedonian News Agency. At least 150 people were injured in the area. How are the authorities responding? Prime Minister Tsipras declared a state of emergency in Attica, saying all emergency services had been mobilised. A spokesperson for the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Georgia Trismpioti, told the BBC some people had lost everything. \\"The death toll rises every hour, many people lost their loved ones, many people lost their houses, lost everything, and they will need long-term support in order to recover,\\" she said. Greece has asked other European countries for helicopters and additional firefighters to help tackle the fires. Italy, Germany, Poland and France have all sent help in the form of planes, vehicles and firefighters, and Spain and Cyprus have offered Greece assistance, but with temperatures set to soar again, they are in a race against time to get the fires under control. Help is also needed in Sweden where at least one person has been killed and dozens injured by forest fires there as soaring temperatures continue across much of Europe. The wildfires are the worst to hit Greece since 2007, when dozens of people were killed in the southern Peloponnese peninsula. What caused the fires? Fires are a recurring problem during the hot, dry summer months in Attica. Officials quoted by AFP news agency have suggested the current blazes may have been started by arsonists looking to loot abandoned homes. \\"Fifteen fires had started simultaneously on three different fronts in Athens,\\" said government spokesman Dimitris Tzanakopoulos. Greece, he added, had requested drones from the US to \\"observe and detect any suspicious activity\\". Are you in the area? How have you been affected by the fires? Email haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. was born in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he was five years old the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a confections wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. The 509th Composite Group returned to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, but he and his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb. Tibbets then attended the Air Command and Staff School at Maxwell Air Force Base, Alabama. On graduating in 1947 he was posted to the Directorate of Requirements at Air Force Headquarters at the Pentagon. When the head of the directorate, Brigadier General Thomas S. Power, was posted to London as air attache, he was replaced by Brigadier General Carl Brandt. Brandt appointed Tibbets as director of Directorate of Requirements's Strategic Air Division, which was responsible for drawing up requirements for future bombers. Tibbets was convinced that the bombers of the future would be jet aircraft and thus became involved in the Boeing B-47 Stratojet program. He subsequently served as B-47 project officer at Boeing in Wichita from July 1950 until February 1952. He then became commander of the Proof Test Division at Eglin Air Force Base in Valparaiso, Florida, where flight testing of the B-47 was conducted. Tibbets returned to Maxwell Air Force Base, where he attended the Air War College. After he graduated in June 1955, he became Director of War Plans at the Allied Air Forces in Central Europe Headquarters at Fontainebleau, France. He left Lucy and his sons behind in Alabama, and he and Lucy divorced that year. During his posting to France, he met a French divorcee named Andrea Quattrehomme, who became his second wife. He returned to the United States in February 1956 to command the 308th Bombardment Wing at Hunter Air Force Base, Georgia, and married her in the base chapel on 4 May 1956. They had a son, James Tibbets. In January 1958, Tibbets became commander of the 6th Air Division at MacDill Air Force Base, Florida. and was promoted to brigadier general in 1959. This was followed by another tour of duty at the Pentagon as director of Management Analysis. In July 1962, he was assigned to the Joint Chiefs of Staff as deputy director for operations, and then, in June 1963, as deputy director for the National Military Command System. In 1964, Tibbets was named military attache in India. He spent 22 months there on this posting, which ended in June 1966. He retired from the United States Air Force (USAF) on 31 August 1966.

The United States Supreme Court in Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989), and reaffirmed in U.S. v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990), has ruled that due to the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, it is unconstitutional for a government (whether federal, state, or municipal) to prohibit the desecration of a flag, due to its status as \`\`symbolic speech.'' However, content-neutral restrictions may still be imposed to regulate the time, place, and manner of such expression.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of having less oven space available can have an indirect effect on the process of producing more power by the steam engine. With less oven space, the heating process might be less efficient, potentially resulting in a slower rate of water reaching its boiling point, which subsequently leads to slower steam production. This can negatively impact the power produced by the steam engine, as less steam is generated to force the pistons up and down.

The days are getting shorter and shorter, and temperatures are dropping. Winter is coming and it is easy for people to catch flu. Many people have started taking vitamin C pills as a precautionary way. But a research has shown that vitamin C pills do not provide as much protection as they think. They are even not as good as other ways, like often washing your hands. Some German scientists have given people information and a test on the subject helping to stop incorrect ways. Whether it is caused by cold or flu , a runny nose and sore throat are signs of catching a cold. Many people overestimate the advantages of vitamin C and other pills. For years it was believed that taking vitamin C pills not only provided protection against colds but also against cancers, helping people to live longer. But the result of the research showed disagreement on these beliefs . The result has now come out on the website wwww.informedhealthonline.org. \\"Some pills may not help people live longer. Some pills may even lead to earlier death,\\" says Professor Peter Sawicki. Scientists also say that the best way to get vitamins is through food instead of having vitamin pills. That is to say, we disagree with the way of taking vitamin C pills. There are many simple but useful ways to lower the risk of catching a cold.

Article: Everyone has good days and bad days. Sometimes, you feel as if you're on top of the world. But occasionally you feel horrible, and you lose things and you cannot focus on your schoolwork. For more than 20 years, scientists have suggested that high self-esteem is the key to success. Now, new research shows that focusing just on building self-esteem may not be helpful. In some cases, having high self-esteem can bring bad results if it makes you less likeable or more upset when you fail at something. \\"Forget about self-esteem,\\" says Jennifer Crocker, a psychologist at the University of Michigan, US. \\"It's not the important thing.\\" Feeling good Crocker's advice may sound a bit strange because it is good to feel good about yourself. Studies show that people with high self-esteem are less likely to be depressed, anxious, shy, or lonely than those with low self-esteem. But, after reviewing about 18,000 studies on self-esteem, Roy Baumeister, a psychologist at Florida State University, has found that building up your self-esteem will not necessarily make you a better person. He believes that violent and wicked people often have the highest self-esteem of all. He also said: \\"There's no evidence that kids with high self-esteem do better in school.\\" Problems All types of people have problems. People with high self-esteem can have big egos that can make them less likeable to their peers , said Kathleen Vohs, a psychology professor at Columbia University. People with high self-esteem tend to think more of themselves, Vohs says. People with low self-esteem are more likely to rely on their friends when they need help. What to do Researchers say it is best to listen to and support other people. Find positive ways to contribute to society. If you fail at something try to learn from the experience. \\"The best therapy is to recognize your faults,\\" Vohs says. \\"It's OK to say, 'I'm not so good at that,' and then move on.\\" Question: The new research comes to the conclusion that high self-esteem _ .

The Kinks' next single, \\"Waterloo Sunset\\", was released in May 1967. The lyrics describe two lovers passing over a bridge, with a melancholic observer reflecting on the couple, the Thames and Waterloo station. The song was rumoured to have been inspired by the romance between two British celebrities of the time, actors Terence Stamp and Julie Christie. Ray Davies denied this in his autobiography, and claimed in a 2008 interview, \\"It was a fantasy about my sister going off with her boyfriend to a new world and they were going to emigrate and go to another country.\\" Despite its complex arrangement, the sessions for \\"Waterloo Sunset\\" lasted a mere ten hours; Dave Davies later commented on the recording: \\"We spent a lot of time trying to get a different guitar sound, to get a more unique feel for the record. In the end we used a tape-delay echo, but it sounded new because nobody had done it since the 1950s. I remember Steve Marriott of the Small Faces came up and asked me how we'd got that sound. We were almost trendy for a while.\\" The single was one of the Kinks' biggest UK successes (hitting number two on Melody Maker's chart), and went on to become one of their most popular and best-known songs. Pop music journalist Robert Christgau called it \\"the most beautiful song in the English language\\", and AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine cited it as \\"possibly the most beautiful song of the rock and roll era\\".

While it was co-written by Ray Davies and recorded by the Kinks, it was also released as a Dave Davies solo single.

Movie title: Scream 2 Context: While attending a preview of the film Stab, a film within a film based on the Woodsboro murders depicted in the first film, two Ohio Windsor College seniors, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens are murdered by Ghostface. Phil is stabbed through the ear in a bathroom stall while trying to eavesdrop on strange whimpering noises. The killer, wearing a Ghostface costume, then returns to the screening and sits beside Maureen before mortally stabbing her. At first the audience believes she is part of the raucous acting out by audience members until she falls dead in front of the cinema screen. The following day, the news media including local journalist Debbie Salt, descend on Windsor College where Sidney Prescott, a theatre major, now studies alongside her best friend Hallie and her new boyfriend Derek, fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy, and Derek's best friend Mickey. Sidney receives prank calls but is oblivious to the recent killings until someone instructs her to watch the news. Two other Woodsboro survivors arrive at the campus: officer Dewey Riley to help Sidney, and reporter Gale Weathers to cover the case. Gale tries to stage a confrontation between Sidney and Cotton Weary, who is attempting to gain fame from his exoneration for the murder of Sidney's mother. After Gale forcibly brings Sidney to Cotton, Sidney angrily hits Gale. Later that evening, Sidney goes to a party with Hallie. At a sorority house, Ghostface kills fellow student Cici. After all the partygoers leave, the killer then crashes the party and attempts to murder Sidney, though Derek intervenes. The killer injures Derek but Dewey and the police arrive, causing the killer to flee. The next morning, Gale discusses the case with the police. Upon realizing that Cici's real name is Casey, she concludes that the killer is a copycat who targets students who share the same names as the Woodsboro murder victims.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the man who is killed by a whale in a book written by Melville? from the following article ? Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale. The \\"sea monsters\\" in Lamentations 4:3 have been taken by some to refer to marine mammals, in particular whales, although most modern versions use the word \\"jackals\\" instead. The story of Jonah being swallowed by a great fish is told both in the Qur'an and in the Bible. A medieval column capital sculpture depicting this was made in the 12th century in the abbey church in Mozac, France. The Old Testament contains the Book of Jonah and in the New Testament, Jesus mentions this story in Matthew 12:40.In 1585, Alessandro Farnese, 1585, and Francois, Duke of Anjou, 1582, were greeted on his ceremonial entry into the port city of Antwerp by floats including \\"Neptune and the Whale\\", indicating at least the city's dependence on the sea for its wealth.In 1896, an article in The Pall Mall Gazette popularised a practice of alternative medicine that probably began in the whaling town of Eden, Australia two or three years earlier. It was believed that climbing inside a whale carcass and remaining there for a few hours would relief symptoms of rheumatism.Whales continue to be prevalent in modern literature. For example, Herman Melville's Moby Dick features a \\"great white whale\\" as the main antagonist for Ahab, who eventually is killed by it. The whale is an albino sperm whale, considered by Melville to be the largest type of whale, and is partly based on the historically attested bull whale Mocha Dick.

Both -30*n and 10*n are terms involving 'n', so they can be combined. Which means, we will add -30n and 10n. -30*n + 10*n simplifies to -20*N. So the equation becomes: -20*n = -20 Step 2: Solve for 'n' Let's isolate 'n' by dividing both sides of the equation by -20.

Question: SEOUL — The recent U.S. missile strikes against Syria could increase pressure on North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons, or reinforce in Pyongyang the need for nuclear deterrence. The United States, France and Britain fired 105 missiles at three Syrian chemical weapons facilities on Saturday, in response to an alleged Syrian chemical weapons attack in the city of Douma that killed at least 40 people and wounded or sickened hundreds of others. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied any use of banned weapons. The combined military strike on Syria comes as the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump and the government of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un are preparing for an expected summit in late May or early June to discuss dismantling the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees. Trump’s willingness to use force against Syria can be seen to reinforce his “maximum pressure” campaign message, that in addition to imposing tough sanctions banning most North Korean exports, the U.S. would take military action, if necessary, to force Kim to terminate his nuclear program and end the continued development of a nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile that can reach the U.S. mainland. Calling the U.S. attack on Syria “a warning for Pyongyang,” the South Korean newspaper the Korea Joongang Daily, in an editorial on Monday said, “If Kim wants to be free from the fear of a potential raid, then he must be willing to denuclearize.” From this perspective the U.S. show of force in Syria will increase pressure on the leadership in North Korea to offer meaningful nuclear concessions at the Trump-Kim summit. “Unless it abandons at least part of its nuclear and missile capabilities then the Trump administration will not be satisfied,” said Bong Young-shik, a political analyst with the Yonsei University Institute for North Korean Studies in Seoul However the U.S. military strike on Syria could also reinforce concerns in North Korea that giving up its nuclear deterrent would make the...

What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process is: A. The brain sends an electrical signal (nerve impulse) to the muscles. Explanation of steps: 1. The brain sends an electrical signal (nerve impulse) to the muscles – This is the first step as it initiates the whole process of muscle contraction by instructing the muscles to move. 2. The nerve impulse reaches the synapse (junction between nerve and muscle cell) and releases a neurotransmitter called Acetylcholine which binds to receptors on the muscle cell membrane. 3. The muscle cell membrane generates an electrical signal (action potential) which travels deep into the muscle fiber through a network of T-tubules. 4. The action potential triggers the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), a specialized organelle within the muscle cell. 5. The increased concentration of calcium ions in the cytoplasm causes the two types of proteins, actin and myosin, in the muscle filaments to interact, forming cross-bridges and sliding against each other. 6. The motion of the filaments causes the muscle to shorten and contract. 7. To provide the necessary range of motion, opposing pairs of muscles (agonist and antagonist) work together – one contracts while the other relaxes to achieve coordinated body movement."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person that the man that was omitted from a friend's autobiography have a musical rivalry with?, using the article: While Lennon and Starr remained consistently friendly during the years that followed the Beatles' break-up in 1970, his relationships with McCartney and Harrison varied. He was initially close to Harrison, but the two drifted apart after Lennon moved to the US in 1971. When Harrison was in New York for his December 1974 Dark Horse tour, Lennon agreed to join him on stage, but failed to appear after an argument over Lennon's refusal to sign an agreement that would finally dissolve the Beatles' legal partnership. Harrison later said that when he visited Lennon during his five years away from music, he sensed that Lennon was trying to communicate, but his bond with Ono prevented him. Harrison offended Lennon in 1980 when he published an autobiography that made little mention of him. Lennon told Playboy, \\"I was hurt by it. By glaring omission ... my influence on his life is absolutely zilch ... he remembers every two-bit sax player or guitarist he met in subsequent years. I'm not in the book.\\"Lennon's most intense feelings were reserved for McCartney. In addition to attacking him with the lyrics of \\"How Do You Sleep?\\", Lennon argued with him through the press for three years after the group split. The two later began to reestablish something of the close friendship they had once known, and in 1974, they even played music together again before eventually growing apart once more. During McCartney's final visit in April 1976, Lennon said that they watched the episode of Saturday Night Live in which Lorne Michaels made a 3,000 offer to get the Beatles to reunite on the show. The pair considered going to the studio to make a joke appearance, attempting to claim their share of the money, but were too tired.

After Cole calls an ambulance, he receives a phone call from a friend who invites him out to drinks. Cole accepts on the condition that it is not a house party. Cole is frustrated to learn that it is a house party, and he goes downstairs to drink alone, where he meets Maya, the host. The two discuss an approaching asteroid. Maya says that modern stress would evaporate in the face of the meaninglessness of certain doom, and Cole says that everything would matter in that circumstance. The two dance to Maya's favorite song and soon begin dating. A series of flashforwards depict life in post-apocalyptic Scotland after the asteroid has arrived as Cole and Maya hide from alien spaceships, mixed with scenes in the present of their relationship leading up to those events. When they discuss children, Cole says he does not want any, and Maya reveals she is incapable. As the asteroid grows closer, Cole asks Maya to marry him. Maya jokingly accepts, and Cole insists that he is serious; now serious, Maya again agrees. Although initially dismissive of the danger, scientists become increasingly worried about a collision. Various missions to divert the asteroid end in failure, putting the world on edge. In the flashforwards, Cole and Maya's relationship deteriorates in the face of their hardship in finding food and shelter.

But here's a tip: You'd be wise not to expect much gratitude from them for what they receive. Gratitude can make us happier, healthier, and even fitter. But do the kids show their gratitude for the stuff we buy them? All the research I've done has convinced me that it won't happen. One mom told me that when she asked her 16-year-old son to thank her for buying him a cellphone, he said, \\"But that's what moms should do.\\" From a teenager's angle, it's a parent's responsibility to take care of the family. According to Dunham, Yale's assistant professor of psychology, \\"When teenagers code it that way, a gift is no longer something given freely and voluntarily\\"--it's just mom and dad living up to their obligation. Parents do have the right to demand good manners and children should thank sincerely whoever gives them something. But kids can't know how blessed they are unless they have a basis for comparison. And they don't learn that by a parent complaining that they're ungrateful. We need to give our children the gift of a wider world view. Show by example that gratitude isn't aboutstuff--which ultimately can't make any of us happy anyway.It's about realizing how lucky you are and paying your good fortune forward. You can collect all the charitable appeals and sit down together with the kids to go through them. You set the budget for giving and the kids decide how it's distributed. Once the conversation about gratitude gets started, it's much easier to continue all year.

Recently, a humpback whale found itself in distress, trapped by a buoy and rope attached to lobster pots. Fortunately, a dedicated team of marine conservationists and locals collaborated to free the magnificent creature and prevent further harm. This article sheds light on the rescue mission and highlights the importance of addressing marine debris that threatens both marine life and the ecosystems around us. The Rescue Mission: A team of marine conservationists, fishermen, and locals in the area quickly became aware of the humpback whale's plight when they saw it struggling against the ropes and buoy. The team quickly sprung into action. As is customary in these situations, they assessed the whale's physical condition and determined the safest approach to free it while minimizing stress and potential injury to the creature. Recognizing the sensitivity of the situation and the potential harm to both the rescuers and the whale, the team used a specialized set of tools specifically designed for whale disentanglement. These include specially adapted cutting tools to sever entangling ropes and help the animal swim away after it is freed. During the rescue operation, the team cautiously approached the whale, which was visibly agitated by the entanglement. They used their specialized tools and knowledge of the whale's anatomy to expertly cut the ropes that had become wrapped around the mammal's body. Several individuals worked in tandem to keep the animal as calm as possible and maintain a safe distance, ensuring no further damage was done to either party during the rescue. Upon freeing the whale, the team diligently monitored its condition to ensure it was able to swim away safely and without hindrance. Watching the whale regain its freedom and swim away into the ocean was a moment of relief and joy for all involved, knowing that their efforts had helped save the life of this magnificent creature. The Problem of Marine Debris: Though this rescue mission had a positive outcome, the entanglement of marine animals in fishing gear is an all-too-common problem that can have dire consequences. This scenario highlights not only the potential dangers posed by marine debris but also the importance of addressing this issue proactively. Abandoned, lost, or discarded fishing gear (also known as ghost gear) poses a significant threat to marine life worldwide. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, ghost gear accounts for approximately 10% of all marine debris. Marine animals such as whales, dolphins, turtles, seals, and seabirds are particularly vulnerable to entanglements, which can lead to physical injury, infection, and ultimately death due to drowning, starvation, or the inability to escape predators. In addition to entanglements, the ingestion of marine debris such as plastic bags, fishing lines, and other waste products is another significant threat to marine life. Many species confuse these items with food, and consumption can lead to harmful physical and chemical consequences, from blockages and injuries to the absorption of toxic chemicals. Conclusion: The successful rescue of the humpback whale provides a heartening example of the power of human cooperation and ingenuity in the face of adversity. The work of dedicated marine conservationists, fishermen, and locals was instrumental in saving the life of this endangered animal. However, this incident also serves as a stark reminder of the ongoing threat posed by marine debris and our shared responsibility to address the issue. By investing in responsible waste disposal, proper recycling, and the reduction of plastic consumption, we can all play our part in safeguarding our oceans and their inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Process: - The sun gives off radiation - The radiation is aborbed by the Earth - Some of the radiation goes back into space - Some is trapped by the atmosphere - If too much heat is trapped - Global warming occurs. Question: suppose less radiation absorbed by earth happens, how will it affect more radiation trapped by the atmosphere. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"When discussing the influence of the sun's radiation, it is important to consider the various factors that affect the Earth's energy balance and how these factors interact with one another. In the given scenario, we have two key processes at play: the absorption of radiation by the Earth and the trapping of some of that radiation by the atmosphere, which can lead to global warming. First, let's take a closer look at the process of radiation absorption and how it is influenced. The Earth absorbs solar radiation primarily in the form of visible and ultraviolet light, but some of this energy is also emitted back into space in the form of infrared energy. The quantity of radiation absorbed by the Earth depends on various factors such as the Earth's albedo, the angle of incidence, and atmospheric composition. On the other hand, we must consider the second process in question: the trapping of radiation by the atmosphere. The atmosphere, primarily through the presence of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane, allows shortwave solar radiation to pass through towards the Earth but effectively absorbs and re-emits some of the longwave radiation back to the Earth, trapping heat in the process. This phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect and is essential for maintaining the Earth's temperature within a habitable range for life as we know it. However, excessive greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can exacerbate the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and associated risks. Now, suppose there is less radiation absorbed by the Earth. This could come about due to various factors such as an increase in the Earth's albedo (e.g., through increased cloud cover or ice/snow coverage) or a decrease in the sun's output. A decrease in absorbed solar radiation should logically decrease the total amount of heat available for greenhouse gases to trap, resulting in a decreased greenhouse effect. So how would less radiation absorbed by the Earth affect the subsequent trapping of radiation by the atmosphere? In general, we can infer that this perturbation would lead to a reduced effect of the greenhouse phenomenon. Since there is less solar energy reaching and being absorbed by the Earth, there is a lower amount of heat available for greenhouse gases to trap and re-emit in the form of longwave radiation. This, in turn, should lead to less heat being retained by the atmosphere, which might mitigate or even offset the dangers of global warming. It is important to note that this simplified analysis does not account for all the complexities and feedback loops that exist within the Earth's climate system. In some cases, the perturbation could also result in more complex secondary effects or create conditions that further alter the initial changes in radiation absorption and atmospheric heat trapping. In conclusion, when considering the scenario of less radiation being absorbed by the Earth, the direct influence on the subsequent trapping of radiation by the atmosphere would generally be a decreased effect on the greenhouse phenomenon. However, it is important to remember that the Earth's climate system is highly complex, and numerous other factors and feedback loops might lead to more complicated outcomes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: You are presented with the question \\"What produces electricity by burning?\\" and the following answer choices: - Green beans - energy - Alcohols - Water - Most plants - Light - Sand - heat energy Now knowing that biofuel is used to produce electricity by burning and biofuels are alcohols, such as ethanol or other chemicals, derived from biomass or living matter, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What produces electricity by burning?\\" from the given choices is alcohols. Biofuels, which include alcohols like ethanol, are derived from biomass or living matter and can be burned effectively to produce electricity. These renewable and sustainable energy sources provide an alternative to traditional fossil fuels for electricity generation. Biofuels, such as ethanol, can be produced by processing organic materials, like corn, sugarcane, or other plants that are high in sugar or starch content. The fermentation process converts these sugars into alcohol, which can then be used as fuel. Moreover, biodiesel, another type of biofuel, can be made from oils or fats and is often used in diesel engines to reduce carbon emissions. When burned, these biofuels release energy in the form of heat, which can be converted into electricity using steam turbines or other types of generators. The process of burning biofuels to produce electricity has several advantages, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, decreased reliance on fossil fuels, and providing a renewable source of energy for various applications. Although some other answer choices from the list are related to energy production or might be elements of a larger energy production process, they are not directly relevant to the main question of what produces electricity by burning. For instance, heat energy and light are both forms of energy but are not the primary source for producing electricity through combustion. Additionally, water is essential for certain energy generation processes, such as hydroelectric power or cooling systems in power plants, but it does not directly produce electricity by burning. In conclusion, the most appropriate choice given the options is alcohols, as they are biofuels that can be effectively burned to generate electricity. This renewable and sustainable form of energy offers a practical alternative to traditional fossil fuels, helping to minimize environmental impact and reduce dependency on non-renewable energy sources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article:Protesters on the #OurNHS march wanted to draw attention to plans which could see hospital services in nearly two-thirds of England cut back. Union leaders say many NHS services \\"are on their knees\\". The Department of Health says it is investing an extra Â£4bn in the NHS. Organisers say that \\"at least 250,000\\" people took part in the march, which began in Tavistock Square and ended in Westminster, where speakers including Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn addressed the crowd. There is no official estimate of the numbers who took part. Mr Corbyn called for the government to provide more funding for the health service in next week's Budget. Speaking to the protesters in Parliament Square, he said: \\"The NHS is in crisis, in crisis because of the underfunding in social care and the people not getting the care and support they need. \\"It is not the fault of the staff. It is the fault of a government who have made a political choice.\\" The protest organisers say the government's proposed Sustainability Transformation Plans (STPs) across the NHS in England are a \\"smokescreen for further cuts\\" and the \\"latest instruments of privatisation\\". These proposals involve the complete closure of some hospitals and the centralising of some services such as A&E and stroke care on fewer sites. Last month the BBC revealed that hospital services in nearly two-thirds of England could be cut or scaled back. NHS England said the money saved from hospital budgets would be reinvested into community services. An NHS spokesman added that although budgets were increasing, they were not keeping pace with demand. He added: \\"NHS leaders want to redirect resources in some cases to try and make the money go further.\\" Unite leader Len McCluskey tweeted from the protest, saying: \\"I'm marching because I am furious.

Although the Department of Health claims it is investing an additional £4bn in the NHS, protesters argue that the government’s Sustainability Transformation Plans are a “smokescreen for further cuts” and perpetuate privatisation.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Society is the term to describe human beings gathered together by social networks tand power networks. It does not refer to everything everybody thinks or does, but, only refer to those things that everybody depends upon ,for example, public services, governments, and all kinds of communities. A society must keep even the poorest and weakest members willing to help even the richest and strongest, so it is very concerned with citizenship, rights, ethics ( )and time limits. These are basic ways to achieve fairness. If they break down badly, people will think the society is unfair and start taking things from each other, refusing to help each other, or seeing those who have more as cheats. When this happens, it is time for the society to break down or fail. Theft, violence and war are things that can make a society break down. A new society may be formed out of the collapse of an old failed one when people of different kinds reach an agreement about fairness and are willing to live together in harmony again. To adapt to the society, people should make sure that their behavior can be supported by the society, that is to say, there must be some social rules on which citizens base what they do. However, some people take risks that the society will support them when they do whatever they intend to. For instance, they may refuse to obey the law, and count on their fellow society members to free them in a court of appeal, which harms the society. Therefore we need a social contract which sets out rules for the society. One kind of the social contract is a constitution -which allows a jury or court to decide what is right or wrong according to the social rules.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: In what country did the dolphin hunting operations take place? Japan Answer:","completion":"Title: Echoes of the Rising Sun Step 1: Set the Stage: The story is set in the beautiful coastal city of Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. Our protagonist, Kenji, is a third-generation dolphin hunter, following the footsteps of his ancestors as heirs to the controversial tradition. Step 2: Introduce Conflict: Kenji's life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a mesmerizing dolphin with an unusually vibrant, golden skin during one of his hunts. Something clicks within him, and he can no longer perceive his profession in the same light. Step 3: Develop Characters: Kenji's despair and guilt are intensified by his childhood sweetheart, Yumi, who has always been an avid animal rights activist fighting against the very livelihood Kenji was born into, dolphin hunting. Step 4: Deepen the Plot: His guilt compels him to secretly release the golden dolphin back into the wild. The release of the dolphin also symbolically signifies Kenji's desire to break free from the shackles of his family tradition. Kenji then joins Yumi in her fight against dolphin hunting. Step 5: Introduce Antagonist: Kenji's father, Hiroshi, also a staunch follower of tradition and the head of the hunters association, is the primary antagonist. He views his son’s shift as a betrayal and, thus, a bitter ideological clash ensues between father and son. Step 6: Climactic Moment: The climax revolves around Hiroshi capturing the golden dolphin and ordering to end its life as a part of their annual hunting event. Enraged, Kenji stages a daring raid to save the dolphin and other captured dolphins, leading to an intense showdown between father and son. Step 7: Resolution: In the end, Kenji manages to save the dolphins and lead them to safety, triggering a swell of local and international support against dolphin hunting that ultimately leads to its prohibition in Taiji. Step 8: Conclusion: The narrative concludes with Kenji transforming the town's relationship with dolphins from one of violence to one of co-existence and mutual respect, symbolized by a popular dolphin watching tour in Taiji. Thus encapsulates the cycle of breaking away from traditions that no longer serve, infused with elements of drama, emotion, and the raw beauty of human-animal bonds. In this movie plot, the focus was not just on the setting (Japan) but also on its traditional dolphin hunting practice. The resolution gives viewers food for thought on animal rights and conservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

People often base their judgments of others on their experiences and interactions with them. When someone is constantly teased or treated poorly by another individual, they may be less likely to open up and trust others, which could eventually result in having a hard time making friends. Answer B, \\"rude,\\" refers to a characteristic that Tracy seems to possess, but it doesn't reflect the effects of Tracy's behavior on the other person in question. On the other hand, answer C, \\"be teased in return,\\" could happen as a specific repercussion of Tracy's actions, but it does not necessarily relate to or address the broader consequences and impact. The best answer should address the general effects of constantly being teased, which option A does by indicating that one might struggle to make friends due to the hostile environment that teasing can create.

Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later.

Supermarkets were yesterday accused of targeting parents by selling alcohol alongside school uniforms and sweets. Campaigners said the irresponsible tactic could encourage impulse buying and ‘normalise the role of alcohol’ at home. A Home Office investigation found bottles of Smirnoff vodka, Jagermeister and other spirits on sale in Tesco next to school clothes. Warning: Photograph showing rum, whisky and vodka next to Sainsbury's sweets. A Sainsbury’s store was found selling chocolate snowmen and other sweets next to bottles of Absolut vodka and Bacardi rum. Other promotions uncovered included a WHSmith store at a motorway service station selling Strongbow cider and Carlsberg lager alongside soft drinks and food. A Lidl store stocked boxes of Christmas Jaffa Cakes next to bottles of spirits, cider and sparkling wine. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office. Norman Baker, the Liberal Democrat crime prevention minister at the Home Office, said: ‘The situation where some irresponsible supermarkets sell alcohol next to children’s clothes or sweets can only encourage impulse buying. This is unacceptable and needs to stop.’ He added: ‘Industry needs to raise its game and do much more to help reduce problem drinking, and supermarkets have to recognise they have a significant part to play in this. ‘They need to promote and display alcohol more responsibly, do their bit to improve public awareness of the dangers of drink and support local areas in tackling alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder.’ Tom Smith, of Alcohol Concern, said: ‘Retailers have got to start taking this seriously and stop selling alcohol alongside everyday products such as children’s sweets and school uniforms. Selling booze like this drives impulse buying and serves only to normalise the role of alcohol in society. ‘The reality is that we’re facing historically high levels of health problems caused by alcohol misuse. If we’re to develop a culture of more responsible drinking, retailers have to play their part.’ Supermarkets have resisted government pressure to put alcohol in aisles separate from other items. Home Office figures show 963 big supermarkets sell alcohol round the clock. They make up 13 per cent of all bars, shops, hotels and pubs licensed to open 24 hours. Last year David Cameron abandoned plans for a 45p minimum price for a unit of alcohol amid resistance from the drinks industry, and a proposed ban on multi-buy discounts was also ditched. But Mr Baker’s comments signal a tougher line on alcohol promotions from within government. Tesco said: ‘Alcohol should not be next to school uniforms or any other products for children in our stores. We are looking into what happened in this store.’ Lidl said: ‘We take our role as a responsible retailer, and all matters of sales of age-restricted products, extremely seriously and will take any comments about the merchandising of our products on board.’ Sainsbury’s said: ‘We take the sale of age-restricted products very seriously. Anyone working on a checkout is trained to ask customers who look under 25 for ID before selling them alcohol.’ WHSmith said: ‘We have a very limited range of alcoholic drinks available in a small number of stores. We are committed to responsible marketing of these products; however, in some cases, the small store size makes it difficult to position alcohol far from soft drinks. ‘We comply with all legal requirements and ensure we are in line with best practice.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article discusses the criticism supermarkets in the UK received for selling alcohol alongside school uniforms and sweets, which raised concerns about encouraging impulse buying and \\"normalizing the role of alcohol\\" at home.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The review depicts the product in an unflattering light, as the reviewer expresses frustration with their lack of weight loss despite following the diet strictly for nine days. The reviewer's dissatisfaction stems from the perception that Dr. Atkins does not provide enough guidance or explanation for this lack of progress and only briefly mentions potential reasons like medications or hormonal issues. Moreover, the reviewer further tarnishes the product's reputation by pointing out the high prices of Atkins products on their website, such as the 2.69 carbo-bar, as well as the additional shipping and handling fees. The reviewer then proceeds to share a money-saving tip for purchasing ketone strips from Walgreens instead of buying more expensive \\"lipolysis strips\\" from Atkins. The tone of the review is negative, and the request for others to share their experiences of not losing weight implies that this individual believes there are others facing similar issues with the product. Overall, the review paints an unflattering picture of the Atkins diet and its related products, mostly because of the perceived ineffectiveness and high prices."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How are nats paid tribute to in Bamar culture?\\" is in \\"A diverse range of indigenous cultures exist in Myanmar, the majority culture is primarily Buddhist and Bamar. Bamar culture has been influenced by the cultures of neighbouring countries. This is manifested in its language, cuisine, music, dance and theatre. The arts, particularly literature, have historically been influenced by the local form of Theravada Buddhism. Considered the national epic of Myanmar, the Yama Zatdaw, an adaptation of India's Ramayana, has been influenced greatly by Thai, Mon, and Indian versions of the play. Buddhism is practised along with nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"In Bamar culture, nats are paid tribute through a combination of Buddhist practices and nat worship, which involves elaborate rituals to propitiate one from a pantheon of 37 nats. This form of worship is deeply rooted in the cultural and religious practices of the Bamar people in Myanmar, who have been influenced by the neighboring countries' cultures, such as Thailand, India, and the Mon people. Nat worship plays an essential role in Bamar culture, incorporating local beliefs and customs into a unique form of spiritual practice. Nats are considered spirits or deities that can have both positive and negative influences on people's lives. To ensure harmony and success in their daily activities, the Bamar people pay tribute to these nats through various rituals and ceremonies. One of the main ways the Bamar people pay tribute to nats is by erecting nat shrines or altars in their homes or public spaces. These shrines usually contain statues or images of the nats, accompanied by offerings such as flowers, fruits, and other food items. Incense is often burned as a form of offering, and people may light candles or oil lamps to show respect and devotion to the nats. In addition to these individual acts of worship, the Bamar people also participate in communal nat festivals, marked by lively music, dance, and theatre performances. These events often involve the reenactment of historical or mythical tales connected to the nat pantheon, highlighting the cultural significance of nat worship and its integration with Buddhism and local folklore. During these festivals, nat mediums, known as \\"nat kadaw,\\" play a crucial role in channelling the nats and serving as intermediaries between the human and spiritual worlds. Nat kadaw are usually dressed in elaborate costumes and makeup, performing traditional dances and songs that are believed to invoke the presence of the nats. They may also provide guidance and advice to the community members, addressing their concerns and offering solutions to problems attributed to the nats' influences. In conclusion, the Bamar people pay tribute to nats through a variety of elaborate rituals and ceremonies that combine Buddhist practices with the local customs and beliefs surrounding nat worship. These practices include the creation of nat shrines, offerings, and communal festivals featuring music, dance, and theatre, highlighting the deep connection between spirituality and culture in the Bamar society of Myanmar."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The couple's tranquility is shattered one day when a drug smuggler's plane crashes in a lake, right before their eyes. Robicheaux succeeds in rescuing a lone survivor, a Salvadoran girl, whom he and Annie quickly adopt and name Alafair. With the arrival of a DEA officer named Dautrieve and an inherent connection to Bubba Rocque, the leading drug kingpin in the area and Robicheaux's childhood friend from New Iberia, Dave becomes involved in solving the case and consequently finds himself and his family in danger. Robicheaux is assaulted by two thugs as a warning. With help from his former girl-friend Robin, an exotic dancer who still has feelings for him, he continues to investigate. His longtime acquaintance Bubba denies any involvement, but Dave warns him and Bubba's sultry wife Claudette that he is going to find out who is behind all this and do something about it.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

Crystal cat litter is made of silica gel. This material is extremely absorptive and will do an excellent job of pulling residual moisture out of a water-damaged phone. You can purchase crystal cat litter at any large grocery store or pet-supply shop. Do not use any other type of cat litter. Clay-based or powdery litters may stick to your phone and turn it into a wet, clay-covered mess. Instant oatmeal is more absorptive than regular rolled oats and more much absorptive than steel-cut oats. If you already have instant oatmeal in your home cabinet, it may be the most effective substance you can use to dry your phone. Be aware that if you use oatmeal to dry your phone components, you may end up with a phone covered in small, gooey bits of oatmeal dust. You can purchase unflavored instant oatmeal at your local grocery store. Synthetic desiccant packets are those 3⁄4 in (1.9 cm) packets that come in various commercial items including shoe boxes, dried foods (like beef jerky or spices), and electronic devices. The packets are typically filled with highly absorptive silica beads which will pull moisture out of your phone. You do not need to tear open the packets. Simply pile them up on top of your phone and let them pull the moisture out. This option will only work if you’ve been saving up silica gel packets in advance for several months. However, this isn’t a bad idea: many people own smartphones, and the chances of dropping your smartphone in water at some point are high. Or, if you haven’t been saving up silica gel packets, you can order them in bulk through major online retailers. Couscous is a type of crushed and dried wheat grain. The small, dry grains will work similarly to silica beads or instant oatmeal and pull any residual moisture out of your phone components. You can purchase couscous pearls at any grocery store or supermarket. The pearls shouldn’t get any couscous dust on your phone’s components, making this a cleaner option than instant oats. Be sure to purchase an unflavored and unseasoned variety.

Read this and answer the question The avian circulatory system is driven by a four-chambered, myogenic heart contained in a fibrous pericardial sac. This pericardial sac is filled with a serous fluid for lubrication. The heart itself is divided into a right and left half, each with an atrium and ventricle. The atrium and ventricles of each side are separated by atrioventricular valves which prevent back flow from one chamber to the next during contraction. Being myogenic, the heart's pace is maintained by pacemaker cells found in the sinoatrial node, located on the right atrium. The sinoatrial node uses calcium to cause a depolarizing signal transduction pathway from the atrium through right and left atrioventricular bundle which communicates contraction to the ventricles. The avian heart also consists of muscular arches that are made up of thick bundles of muscular layers. Much like a mammalian heart, the avian heart is composed of endocardial, myocardial and epicardial layers. The atrium walls tend to be thinner than the ventricle walls, due to the intense ventricular contraction used to pump oxygenated blood throughout the body. Avian hearts are generally larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass. This adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. Why are Avian hearts larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass?","completion":"Avian hearts are larger than mammalian hearts when compared to body mass because this adaptation allows more blood to be pumped to meet the high metabolic need associated with flight. Birds require a greater amount of oxygen and energy to sustain flight, and having a larger heart relative to body mass helps them achieve this by efficiently circulating oxygenated blood throughout their bodies."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests.

Mikhail Nikolayevich Baryshnikov (Russian: Михаи́л Никола́евич Бары́шников , Latvian: \\"Mihails Barišņikovs\\" ; born January 27, 1948), nicknamed \\"Misha\\" (Russian diminutive of the name \\"Mikhail\\"), is a Soviet and American dancer, choreographer, and actor. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Mikhail Baryshnikov was called Misha","completion":"Yes, the next sentence does indeed follow from the preceding text. In the provided information, it is stated that Mikhail Nikolayevich Baryshnikov, also known as Mihails Barišņikovs in Latvian, was affectionately nicknamed \\"Misha\\". This is a Russian diminutive of the name \\"Mikhail\\", signifying a more casual or intimate form of address, not unlike how \\"Bob\\" can be used as a diminutive for \\"Robert\\" in English. Mikhail Baryshnikov, a renowned dancer, choreographer, and actor, is a figure of great significance in the world of performing arts. Born in the Latvian SSR of the Soviet Union in 1948, Baryshnikov's extraordinary talent soon found him international recognition. Throughout his performing career, he has made significant contributions to the realms of ballet and dance, both in the Soviet Union and in America, where he eventually defected during a tour in Toronto, Canada in 1974. This nickname, \\"Misha\\", would have most likely been used by his family, close friends, colleagues, and possibly his fans, highlighting a sense of familiarity and fondness. It is common in Russian culture to use diminutives as terms of endearment, and in this case, signals a sort of affectionate respect towards a beloved figure in the field of performing arts. Therefore, stating \\"Mikhail Baryshnikov was called Misha\\" is perfectly accurate and follows the given text. It summarizes a key piece of personal information about Baryshnikov, that is, his commonly-used nickname, giving further insight into his persona, both personal and professional. This information not only brings us closer to understanding Baryshnikov as an artist and an individual but also provides cultural context about naming practices in Russian-speaking societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer: There are countless cake recipes; some are bread-like, some rich and elaborate, and many are centuries old. Question: how does egg substitute effect the cake if u put in Answer:","completion":"Using an egg substitute in a cake recipe can affect various aspects of the final product, including texture, taste, and appearance, depending on the type of substitute used. The key role of eggs in most cake recipes is to provide structure, tenderness, moistness, leavening, and other functionalities through proteins, fats, and water. 1. Texture: Eggs contribute to the structure and stability of a cake by forming a network of proteins when they coagulate during baking. Egg substitutes may not be able to replicate this effect entirely, which can lead to a less stable or denser cake compared to one made with regular eggs. 2. Taste: Eggs provide flavor to the cake, which may be difficult to replicate when using an egg substitute. However, many egg substitutes, such as applesauce or mashed bananas, can bring their unique, pleasant flavor to the cake, which could enhance or alter the overall taste. 3. Appearance: Some egg substitutes, like flaxseed or chia seed gel, can make the cake slightly darker due to their color, while other substitutes may not have any significant impact on the cake's appearance. Eggs also contribute to the browning of the cake surface, and some substitutes might not provide the same level of browning. 4. Leavening: Eggs contain proteins that help leaven the cake and create a tender, light texture. Many commercial egg substitutes are designed to provide similar leavening effects, but others, like mashed fruits, might not offer the same lift. 5. Moistness: Depending on the egg substitute used, the moistness of the cake can differ. Some egg substitutes, like applesauce, mashed bananas, or yogurt, can add moisture to the cake, while others may result in a drier texture. It is essential to consider the specific recipe and type of cake being made when choosing an egg substitute. Some egg substitutes work better in specific recipes, while others might not yield the desired results. For best results, use egg substitutes that have been tested and recommended for cake recipes or experiment with different substitutes to find the perfect match for your requirements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For small values of capacitance (microfarads and less), ceramic disks use metallic coatings, with wire leads bonded to the coating. Larger values can be made by multiple stacks of plates and disks. Larger value capacitors usually use a metal foil or metal film layer deposited on the surface of a dielectric film to make the plates, and a dielectric film of impregnated paper or plastic – these are rolled up to save space. To reduce the series resistance and inductance for long plates, the plates and dielectric are staggered so that connection is made at the common edge of the rolled-up plates, not at the ends of the foil or metalized film strips that comprise the plates.

Movie plot: Joseph Amadeus von Dracula, known as Pepito to his friends, is a trumpet player in 1930s Havana who spends his time away from the bandstand dabbling in quasi-terrorist plots to overthrow the Cuban government of dictator, Gerardo Machado. He is unaware that he is really a vampire, and that his uncle, Werner Amadeus von Dracula, the son of Count Dracula, has been using him as a test subject for a formula that negates the usually fatal effects of sunlight. A Chicago-based crime syndicate and a group of vampires with members from several countries in Europe have both learned of the formula and wish to possess it for different reasonsâthe Chicago group to suppress it and thus maintain their monopoly on indoor, artificial beach resorts, and the Europeans to market it as \\"Vampisol.\\" When Pepito learns of his true heritage (and his uncle's wish to give the formula away to vampires everywhere) he becomes the target of a multi-pronged manhunt, leading all parties involved on a wild chase through some of the seediest neighborhoods of Havana. At the film's climax, Pepito and his girlfriend find themselves cornered by the Chicago vampire cartel, led by vampire mobster Johnny Terrori. He tells Pepito to have some O positive blood as his last drink, the blood type which vampires consider to be the most delicious. However, when he spits it out in disgust, Terrori realizes that Pepito's dislike of drinking blood, the fact that he was harmed by a lead bullet earlier (vampires can only be harmed by silver bullets) and that he is completely impervious to sunlight (it instantly kills vampires) means that Pepito has stopped being a vampire. Terrori loses interest in the Vampisol formula, realizing that its effect is to turn vampires into humans.

There are several aspects in the sentence that give rise to this conclusion. To analyze the sentiment, it is essential to break down the sentence into smaller parts and study the impact of each segment on the overall sentiment. Firstly, the phrase \\"real visual charge\\" implies that the movie features impressive and engaging visuals, which is a positive aspect. The use of the word \\"real\\" serves to emphasize the authenticity and effectiveness of the visual elements. This phrase suggests that the visuals contribute significantly to the movie's appeal, which is a positive sentiment. Secondly, the expression \\"the filmmaking\\" refers to the entire process of creating the movie, including direction, cinematography, and editing. This, coupled with the \\"real visual charge,\\" indicates that the reviewer appreciates the overall effort and execution of the filmmaking process. Thus, this part of the sentence points towards a positive sentiment as well. Thirdly, the mention of a \\"strong erotic spark\\" is an indication of passion, chemistry, or sensuality in a particular scene. In this case, it references the \\"most crucial lip-reading sequence\\" of the movie. The intensity of the emotions portrayed creates a strong reaction, which the reviewer appears to praise. This phrase not only highlights the importance of that specific sequence but also emphasizes the movie's ability to elicit a powerful response from the audience. In conclusion, based on the analysis of the individual segments, the sentiment of the movie review sentence is positive. The review highlights the effective execution of the movie's visuals, the success of the filmmaking process, and the potent emotions evoked during a critical scene. These elements contribute to the reviewer's positive evaluation of the movie and indicate their approval and appreciation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Who congratulates Joker on his kill? Movie title: Full Metal Jacket Movie plot: In 1967, during the Vietnam War, a group of new U.S. Marine Corps recruits arrive at Parris Island, South Carolina, for basic training. After having their heads shaved, they meet Senior Drill Instructor Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who employs excessively forceful methods to turn the recruits into hardened, combat-ready Marines. Among the recruits are privates \\"Joker\\", \\"Cowboy\\", and the overweight, bumbling Leonard Lawrence, who earns the nickname \\"Gomer Pyle\\" after attracting Hartman's wrath. Unresponsive to Hartman's discipline, Pyle is eventually paired with Joker. Pyle improves with Joker's help, but his progress halts when Hartman discovers a contraband jelly doughnut in Pyle's foot locker. Believing the recruits have failed to improve Pyle, Hartman adopts a collective punishment policy: every mistake Pyle makes will earn punishment for the rest of the platoon, with Pyle being spared. In retaliation for Pyle's failures, the platoon hazes him with a blanket party, restraining him in his bunk while beating him with bars of soap wrapped in towels. After this incident, Pyle reinvents himself as a model Marine. This impresses Hartman but worries Joker, who recognizes signs of mental breakdown in Pyle, such as him talking to his M14 rifle. Following their graduation, the recruits receive their Military Occupational Specialty assignments; Joker is assigned to Basic Military Journalism, while most of the others (including Cowboy and Pyle) are assigned to Infantry. During the platoon's final night on Parris Island, Joker discovers Pyle in the bathroom, loading his rifle with live ammunition. Joker attempts to calm Pyle, who executes drill commands and recites the Rifleman's Creed. The noise awakens the platoon, and Hartman confronts Pyle, ordering him to surrender the rifle. Pyle shoots Hartman dead, and then kills himself.

It's a West Slavic language spoken mainly in the Czech Republic, and by Czech people in surrounding countries like Slovakia, Austria, and Germany, or around the world. Czech is a member of the Slavic language group, which also includes languages such as Polish, Russian, Croatian, Serbian, Bulgarian, and several others. Czech is one of the official languages of the European Union. The language consists of many dialects, which are all slightly different depending on the region of the Czech Republic where they are spoken: Central Bohemian, Moravian, Silesian, Cieszyn, and others. However, while the dialects can differ rather substantially in certain aspects, the standardized form of the language (Common Czech and Standard Czech) is taught in schools and used in official capacities such as in government documents, the media, literature, and scientific work. The sentence \\"Jo, vyjde to v neděli\\" translates to \\"Yes, it comes out on Sunday\\" in English. The word \\"Jo\\" is a colloquial and commonly used form of \\"yes\\". \\"Vyjde\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"vyjít\\", which can mean to come out, to be published or to leave. \\"V neděli\\" means \\"on Sunday\\".

Output:","completion":"Let's denote the price of the first, second, and third varieties of tea as P1, P2, and P3, respectively. We are given that P1 = 126, P2 = 135, and the prices are mixed in the ratio 1:1:2. Let's use 'x' as the common ratio factor amount of each tea variety. Then the amounts of each variety can be represented as follows: - First variety: x kg (126 Rs/kg) - Second variety: x kg (135 Rs/kg) - Third variety: 2x kg (P3 Rs/kg) The total price of the mixture is worth 153 Rs/kg. Let's denote the total weight of the mixture as W and its total value as V. We know that W = x + x + 2x = 4x V = (126 * x) + (135 * x) + (P3 * 2x) Now, since the mixture is worth 153 Rs/kg, we can write the following equation: Value of mixture / Weight of mixture = Mixture price per kg V / W = 153 Substituting the values of V and W in terms of x and P3: ((126 * x) + (135 * x) + (P3 * 2x)) / (4x) = 153 Simplifying the equation, we get: (261 * x + P3 * 2x) / 4x = 153 Now, multiply both sides by 4x to eliminate the denominator: 261 * x + P3 * 2x = 153 * 4x 261 * x + P3 * 2x = 612 * x Now, isolate P3 on one side of the equation: P3 * 2x = 612 * x - 261 * x P3 * 2x = 351 * x Now, divide both sides by 2x to find the value of P3: P3 = (351 * x) / (2 * x) Cancel 'x' from both sides P3 = 351 / 2 P3 = 175.5 So, the price of the third variety of tea per kg is 175.5 Rs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi. Hint: Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm.

Bathe as soon as you can after doing physically-demanding tasks.","completion":"Title: Protecting Your Skin: A Comprehensive Guide to Maintaining a Clear Complexion Introduction Most people endeavour to achieve a healthy, glowing complexion that not only enhances their appearance but also boosts their confidence. However, in this fast-paced world, many individuals overlook the importance of maintaining a simple and effective skincare routine. This article highlights the importance of washing your face twice daily with a gentle cleanser, avoiding touching your face unnecessarily, refraining from picking or squeezing blemishes, using water-based cosmetics, and promptly bathing after strenuous activities for a radiant and clear complexion. Washing Your Face Twice Daily with a Gentle Cleanser The first step in maintaining healthy skin is cleansing your face twice a day, ideally once in the morning and once before bed. This key skincare habit removes dirt, oil, bacteria, and dead skin cells that may accumulate on the skin's surface throughout the day. Gentle, pH-balanced cleansers help protect the skin's natural barrier, which is crucial in maintaining skin health and preventing breakouts. Using a harsh or overly abrasive cleanser can cause irritation, redness, and even dryness, leading to a compromised skin barrier and more frequent breakouts. Avoid Touching Your Face Throughout the day, our hands come into contact with different surfaces and objects, accumulating various types of bacteria, viruses, and dirt. When we touch our faces, these contaminants can quickly find their way into our pores, leading to irritation and breakouts. Minimizing the frequency of face touching can help reduce the spread of bacteria and ultimately lower the risk of acne and other skin issues. Make an effort to become consciously aware of this habit and practice good hand hygiene to maintain clean skin. Refraining from Picking or Squeezing Blemishes Picking or squeezing a pimple or blackhead may seem like a fast solution to eliminating blemishes, but it can actually do more harm than good by causing inflammation and scarring. When you break the skin during this process, bacteria can easily enter, increasing the risk of infection and worsening the blemish. Additionally, the pressure applied to the surrounding skin can result in the rupturing of the follicle wall, spreading the infection and causing more breakouts. To safely and effectively treat blemishes, opt for spot treatments containing salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide instead. Using Water-Based Cosmetics Makeup can provide a boost in self-confidence and allow for creative self-expression, but not all cosmetics are created equal. Oil-based products can clog pores and exacerbate acne-prone skin, resulting in more frequent breakouts. By choosing water-based and non-comedogenic makeup products, you're ensuring your cosmetics are less likely to clog pores and cause irritation. In addition to selecting the right products, it's essential to thoroughly cleanse your face of makeup before bedtime to prevent overnight buildup and breakouts. Bathing after Physically-Demanding Activities Sweating is a natural and necessary bodily function that helps regulate body temperature. However, when sweat and dirt are left on the skin for prolonged periods, they can clog pores and lead to breakouts. To avoid this, make it a priority to shower or bathe as soon as possible after engaging in physically demanding activities or sports. Use a gentle body wash and focus on cleansing areas that are prone to acne, such as the back, chest, and shoulders. Remember to change out of sweaty clothes and avoid prolonged contact with dirty exercise equipment to minimize the risk of skin irritation and acne. Conclusion Incorporating these skincare practices into your daily routine will not only help you maintain a clear and glowing complexion but also contribute to overall skin health. Cleansing your face twice a day, avoiding face touching, refraining from picking or squeezing blemishes, using water-based cosmetics, and bathing after physically demanding tasks are crucial steps to put the best face forward. As always, if you experience persistent or severe acne, consult with a dermatologist for professional advice tailored to your specific concerns."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: A new theory has emerged: that the world's first domesticated dogs were used in the slaughtering of mammoths at sites which may have suited early man to ambush the creatures. Picture: the Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk, The Siberian Times The cemeteries of bones have long puzzled scientists because they appear to show the giant shaggy relatives of today's elephants all died in the same place. The bones are different ages, spanning centuries, and recent evidence suggests that spear-hurling humans played a role in hunting these iconic animals. Now a new theory has emerged: that the world's first domesticated dogs were used in the slaughtering of mammoths at sites which may have suited early man to ambush the creatures. Professor Emerita Pat Shipman of Penn State University was intrigued by evidence from Predmosti, in the Czech republic, where a large fragment of bone was placed in a dog's mouth shortly after burial - some 27,000 years ago. She speculates that the animal was accorded special treatment for its hunting prowess. Evidence from Predmosti, in the Czech republic - a large fragment of bone was placed in a dog's mouth shortly after burial - some 27,000 years ago. Picture: Mietje Germonpre. She analysed archeological sites in Siberia and Europe where large numbers of mammoth bones were used in the construction of dwellings by ancient man. 'They're crazy sites,' said anthropologist Shipman in Science journal. 'The sheer number of dead mammoths is astounding.' In Berelekh - in the north of Siberia's Sakha Republic - are more than 160 of the tusked goliaths. 'One of the greatest puzzles about these sites is how such large numbers of mammoths could have been killed with the weapons available during that time,' she said. Theories on such 'mammoth megasites' have included floods washing bones to a certain spot or herds that fell through thin ice. But they seem to date to 44,000 years ago, around the time modern humans emerged. She found that 'few of the mortality patterns from these mammoth deaths matched either those from natural deaths among modern elephants killed by droughts or by culling operations with modern weapons that kill entire family herds of modern elephants at once'. The professor concluded in her research, outlined in Quaternary International, that the mammoths were killed in the same spot for many generations. 'There's something that's drawing them to that location,' she said. She believes the sites may have been on migration routes in spots where early humans and their domesticated dogs could attack. In Berelekh - in the north of Siberia's Sakha Republic - are more than 160 of the tusked goliaths. Picture: P. Lazarev, The Mammoth Museum in Yakutsk Skulls suggesting early dogs have been found at some of the mammoth graveyard sites, say reports. 'Many of the skulls bear healed fractures, a possible indication that these animals were cared for by humans,' reports Science. Shipman speculates that the mammoth megasites may be the first significant evidence of a cooperative relationship between man and dog. 'The canines could have corralled the mammoths at the ambush sites and held the prey in place while human hunters moved in for the kill, Shipman says. 'Once the mammoths were dead, the dogs could have protected the sites from scavengers.' She said: 'Dogs help hunters find prey faster and more often, and dogs also can surround a large animal and hold it in place by growling and charging while hunters move in. Both of these effects would increase hunting success.' And 'all of that mammoth meat would have brought predators from miles around.' 'In return, the humans may have provided these canines with food and protection. And slowly, a closer relationship may have begun to form,' stated Science. 'Dogs may indeed be man's best friend,' she said. Skulls suggesting early dogs have been found at some of the mammoth graveyard sites, say reports. Picture: Jeffrey Mathison Now a search will begin for more evidence of dogs which might support her hypothesis. Some authorities are sceptical, at least until seeing more evidence. 'I like it as an idea, but there's no smoking gun,' said one expert, Nicholas Conard, who works at the University of Tubingen in Germany. ||||| It’s known as the mammoth cemetery for good reason. Along the banks of a Siberian river not far from the Arctic Ocean lie thousands of bones, most of them belonging to the giant, shaggy relatives of today’s elephants. A new study argues that such mysterious graveyards were not the results of a natural catastrophe, but rather the work of early human hunters—who may have had help from some of the world’s first dogs. “This is the first time that someone’s gone out on a limb and suggested something different than what we thought before,” says Angela Perri, a postdoctoral fellow at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, and an expert on dog domestication. “But it’s still very speculative at this stage.” Study author Pat Shipman first became interested in what she calls “mammoth megasites” in 2009. About 30 such spots have been unearthed in central Europe and North Asia, some with tens of thousands of bones packed tightly on top of each other across areas as small as 60 square meters. The massive tusks and femurs of mammoths jut out among the remains of wild horses, deer, foxes, and other animals. “They’re crazy sites,” says Shipman, an anthropologist at Pennsylvania State University, University Park. “The sheer number of dead mammoths is astounding.” More than 160 of the tusked goliaths lie in the mammoth cemetery—a site known as Berelekh—alone. How did they get there? Some scientists think it was an act of nature—perhaps a flood that swept dozens of animals to a particular spot, or an unlucky herd that fell through thin ice. But recent evidence has suggested that people may to be blame. Shipman says the mammoth megasites begin to appear about 44,000 years ago, just about the time that modern humans entered this part of the world. What’s more, archaeologists have found evidence of huts made of mammoth bones at some of these locations, as well as cuts and burn marks on the bones that could only have been made by people. To get a clearer picture, Shipman combed through the literature on more than a dozen mammoth megasites, paying particular attention to the age and sex of the mammoths unearthed there. She then compared these demographics with those seen with the deaths of large numbers of elephants, the mammoth’s closest living relative. Natural disasters such as droughts kill the youngest and oldest elephants, but other sudden die-offs—such as a herd falling through ice or a cull of elephants to control their population—kill indiscriminately, leaving behind the carcasses of young and old, male and female. Elephant hunters, meanwhile, tend to kill each animal in a different place. “To my surprise, hardly anything matched these patterns,” Shipman says of the mammoth bones. What’s more, the dating on the bones indicated that they had been laid down over hundreds of years. That suggests that the animals were killed over and over in the same spot over many generations, she reports in Quaternary International. “There’s something that’s drawing them to that location.” Shipman says the data point to a scenario in which humans killed the mammoths, but not in the way people do today. Instead of culling them or hunting them across vast plains, ancient peoples may have ambushed the creatures. The reason so many bones are found in the same location may be that these spots were ideal for such ambushes. Perhaps they were surrounded by thick brush, in which spear-hurling humans could hide, or maybe they lay along a commonly traveled migration route. Shipman also thinks the hunters may have had some help from dogs. It’s still unclear exactly when or where dogs became domesticated, but some recent archaeological evidence suggests it may have happened around the same time and place as the mammoth megasites. A skull recovered from a cave in southern Belgium, for example, has both wolf- and doglike features, and it dates to about 32,000 years ago. Though genetic evidence indicates that this animal may not have been an ancestor of today’s dogs, the find suggests that the process of canine domestication could have begun tens of thousands of years ago. Significantly, Shipman says, similar skulls have been found among the mammoth bones at several megasites. Many of the skulls bear healed fractures, a possible indication that these animals were cared for by humans. Shipman speculates that the mammoth megasites may be the first significant evidence of a cooperative relationship between man and dog. The canines could have corralled the mammoths at the ambush sites and held the prey in place while human hunters moved in for the kill, Shipman says. Once the mammoths were dead, the dogs could have protected the sites from scavengers. “All of that mammoth meat would have brought predators from miles around,” she says. In return, the humans may have provided these canines with food and protection. And slowly, a closer relationship may have begun to form. Finding more large and strong doglike animals at these sites would support her hypothesis, Shipman says. Such finds will be necessary to convince archaeologists like Nicholas Conard that the new work is more than just a leap of faith. “I like it as an idea, but there’s no smoking gun,” says Conard, who works at the University of Tübingen in Germany and who has personally excavated mammoth megasites. Perri agrees. “We don’t know enough about what early dogs—or even the wolves of the time—looked like,” she says. “This is extrapolating from too few examples.” Still, Conard says, “there are so few ideas about how these sites formed, and what Shipman is arguing is possible and testable. It’s a move in the right direction.” |||||","completion":"A new theory suggests that the world's first domesticated dogs were used in the hunting of mammoths at sites which may have been suitable for early man to ambush the creatures.

Information: - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC. - Zeus (\\"Zeús\\", ; Modern , \\"Días\\" ) was the sky and thunder god in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods of Mount Olympus. His name is cognate with the first element of his Roman equivalent Jupiter. His mythologies and powers are similar, though not identical to those of the Indo-European deities such as Indra, Jupiter, Perun, Thor, and Odin. - In Greek mythology, Melete () was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses before the Nine Olympian Muses were founded. Her sisters were Aoide and Mneme. She was the muse of thought and meditation. Melete literally means \\"ponder\\" and \\"contemplation\\" in Greek. - Mnemosyne (or ), source of the word \\"mnemonic\\", was the personification of memory in Greek mythology. A Titanide, or Titaness, she was the daughter of the Titans Uranus and Gaia. Mnemosyne was the mother of the nine Muses, fathered by her nephew, Zeus: - In Greek mythology , Mneme / nimi / ( ) was one of the three original ( Boeotian ) muses , along with her sisters Aoide and Melete before Arche and Thelxinoë were identified , increasing the number to five . Later , the Nine Olympian Muses were named . She was the muse of memory . - Anaximander (\\"Anaximandros\\"; c. 610 c. 546 BC) was a pre-Socratic Greek philosopher who lived in Miletus, a city of Ionia (in modern-day Turkey). He belonged to the Milesian school and learned the teachings of his master Thales. He succeeded Thales and became the second master of that school where he counted Anaximenes and, arguably, Pythagoras amongst his pupils. - In Greek mythology, Aoede (\\"Aoid\\") was one of the three original (Boeotian) muses, which later expanded to five, before the Nine Olympian Muses were named. Her sisters were Melete and Mneme. She was the muse of voice and song. According to Greek mythology, she is the daughter of Zeus, the King of the Gods, and Mnemosyne, the goddess of memory. - Arche is a Greek word with primary senses \\"beginning\\", \\"origin\\" or \\"source of action\\". (: from the beginning, r : the original argument), and later first principle or element, first so used by Anaximander (Simplicius in Ph. 150.23), principles of knowledge (Aristot. Metaph. 995b8). By extension, it may mean \\"first place, power\\", \\"method of government\\", \\"empire, realm\\", \\"authorities\\" (in plural: ), \\"command\\". The first principle or element corresponds to the \\"ultimate underlying substance\\" and \\"ultimate undemonstrable principle\\". In the philosophical language of the archaic period (8th-6th century BC), \\"arche\\" (or \\"archai\\") designates the source, origin or root of things that exist. In ancient Greek philosophy, Aristotle foregrounded the meaning of \\"arche\\" as the element or principle of a thing, which although undemonstrable and intangible in itself, provides the conditions of the possibility of that thing. What is the relationship between 'mneme' and 'zeus'?","completion":"The relationship between Mneme and Zeus lies within the realm of Greek mythology, which is an essential part of the ancient Greek religious and cultural beliefs. Mneme and Zeus are both mythological figures that play distinctive roles in the Greek pantheon. Mneme, one of the three original Boeotian Muses, is known as the Muse of memory. She, along with her sisters Melete and Aoide, preceded the later establishment of the Nine Olympian Muses. Muses were considered to be the personifications of knowledge and the arts, and they inspired human creativity, wisdom, and intellect. As the Muse of memory, Mneme represented the importance of remembering and preserving essential elements from the past. On the other hand, Zeus was the supreme deity in ancient Greek religion, who ruled as king of the gods on Mount Olympus. He was the god of the sky and thunder and held the ultimate authority over both gods and humans. Zeus was considered to be the most powerful among all gods and played a significant role as the central figure of the Greek pantheon. The relationship between Mneme and Zeus can be found in their roles as parent and child in Greek mythology. Mnemosyne, the Titaness, and the personification of memory, is the mother of the Nine Muses, one of whom is Mneme. Zeus, as the father of the Nine Muses, plays the role of Mneme's father. It is through the union of Zeus and Mnemosyne that the Nine Muses, including Mneme, were born. The offspring of this union bridges the gap between the Titans and the Olympian gods, representing aspects of both divine lineages. This connection between Mneme and Zeus also points to a deeper symbolism within Greek mythology: the convergence of power (Zeus) and memory (Mneme). By fathering Mneme, Zeus shows his influence not only in the realm of gods but also in human knowledge and wisdom. Memory, as represented by Mneme, is crucial in the preservation of history, knowledge, and culture, which in turn reflects the ideals and values that the ancient Greeks held in the highest regard. Zeus, as the divine embodiment of power and authority, combines with memory to create a lasting impact on humanity's artistic and intellectual development. In summary, the relationship between Mneme and Zeus in Greek mythology can be defined by their roles as daughter and father, as well as the symbolic union of memory and power. This relationship highlights the significance of both divine figures in the Greek pantheon and their influence on human wisdom and cultural heritage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There are several reasons for this: 1. Timeframe: The statement talks about \\"the last centuries of philosophy,\\" whereas the question specifically asks for philosophers of the last 100 years. Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) and David Hume (1711-1776) are not from the past 100 years. Antony Flew (1923-2010), on the other hand, fits the time frame but is still not a suitable example for other reasons, as mentioned below. 2. Context: The statement mentions that the respective philosophers raised questions regarding the arguments for God's existence, which implies that they were critically examining, and perhaps even challenging, these arguments. This context does not necessarily mean that they were arguing for the existence of God themselves. 3. Antony Flew's stance: Antony Flew was a well-known atheist philosopher known for his arguments against the existence of God. However, late in his life, he changed his position and started leaning towards deism, which is the belief in a non-interventionist creator based on reason instead of revelation or religious authority. This change of view doesn't necessarily mean that he was arguing for the existence of God in the traditional sense, like the question implies. In contrast, here are three philosophers from the last 100 years known for defending the existence of God: 1. Alvin Plantinga (1932-present): Plantinga is an American philosopher known for his work in the philosophy of religion. He formulated the \\"Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism\\" and the \\"Free Will Defense,\\" arguing that belief in God can be rational even without empirical evidence. Plantinga's work in defending theism has been influential in contemporary philosophy. 2. Richard Swinburne (1934-present): Swinburne is a British philosopher who has defended the existence of God using various arguments from natural theology, which include the teleological argument, the cosmological argument, and the argument from consciousness. He has written numerous books on the philosophy of religion, including \\"The Existence of God\\" and \\"The Coherence of Theism.\\" 3. William Lane Craig (1949-present): Craig is an American philosopher and theologian known for his work on the cosmological argument, specifically the Kalam Cosmological Argument, which posits that the universe must have had a cause for its existence. He has participated in numerous debates with atheists and skeptics, presenting several arguments in favor of theism. These philosophers are more appropriate examples for answering the question at hand, as they are from the last 100 years and have presented or defended arguments supporting the existence of God."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: You are supposed to identify the category of a high-school level math question. There are five possible categories (1) algebra (2) arithmetic (3) measurement (4) numbers, and (5) probability. Use the following guidelines: (1) 'algebra' questions will typically contain letter variables and will ask you to find the value of a variable (2) 'arithmetic' questions will ask the sum, difference, multiplication, division, power, square root or value of expressions involving brackets (3) 'measurement' questions are questions that ask to convert a quantity from some unit to some other unit (4) 'numbers' questions will be about bases, remainders, divisors, GCD, LCM etc. (5) 'probability' questions will ask about the probability of the occurrence of something. A question must belong to only one category. Problem:Let p = 54 + -49. Solve -13 - 12 = -p*h for h. Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the category of the question The problem contains letter variables (p and h) and asks to find the value of a variable (h). So, this problem belongs to category (1) 'algebra'. Step 2: Simplify the given equations We are given the equation p = 54 + -49, which can be simplified as p = 54 - 49. So, p = 5. Step 3: Use the value of 'p' to find 'h' We are given the equation -13 - 12 = -p*h, which can be simplified as -25 = -5*h. We need to solve this equation for h. Step 4: Solve for 'h' To solve the equation -25 = -5*h, we will first divide both sides of the equation by -5: -25 / -5 = (-5*h) / -5 So, 5 = h Step 5: Conclusion The variable h has a value of 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Alex stared through the cabin window at the darkness. Soon his dad would call him. And he didn't want to go. He wished he hadn't come to the lake for the weekend. \\"We're ready,\\" Dad said as he came in from the porch. \\" Grab your rod.\\" Alex turned away from the window and slowly picked up his fishing rod. \\"Have fun!\\" Mom said. \\"Sure,\\" said Alex, trying to make his voice bright. \\"We should have done this before.\\" Dad said. \\"Let's catch a big one!\\" Dad picked up his tackle box, rod, and bait can from the porch. He clicked on the flashlight. They walked down the hill toward the lake in the narrow beam of light. The only thing Alex could see was the circle of weeds and rocks at their feet, lit by the flashlight. Insect voices filled his ears---clicks, hums, buzzes, whines. Hundreds of bugs waited in the darkness to attack. \\"Ow!\\" he blurted as he felt a sting on his arm. \\"Mosquitoes,\\" Dad said. \\"I have brought some spray to keep them off.\\" When they reached the boat, Alex stumbled as he climbed over the side. \\"I don't like this much,\\" he said. \\"It's so dark.\\" Dad squeezed his shoulder. \\"Don't worry. It's not as dark as you think. After a while your eyes will get used to the night.\\" Suddenly something rushed past Alex's head. He gasped. \\"What was that?\\" \\"Probably a bat,\\" Dad said.

They're too busy grabbing dinner.\\" He pushed the boat off the gravel and jumped in. Alex gazed back at the cabin. A square of light from the window glowed in the darkness. Dad rowed to the middle of the lake and stopped. \\"We'll just let the boat drift. Keep the flashlight in the bottom of the boat. The fish won't bite if they see light flashing around.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Ask a question about Sexual orientation.","completion":"What are the different types of sexual orientation, and how can one understand and respect the diversity among them? Sexual orientation is a term used to describe a person's consistent pattern of emotional, romantic, and/or sexual attractions to men, women, both genders, or neither gender. It is a spectrum, with a range of orientations that people can identify with, and a fundamental aspect of an individual's identity. Understanding and respecting the diverse range of sexual orientations can foster a more open-minded, empathetic, and inclusive society. This detailed answer provides an overview of some common sexual orientation categories and offers guidance on fostering understanding and respect for this diversity. 1. Heterosexuality: This is the most common sexual orientation, referring to individuals who are attracted to members of the opposite sex. For example, a heterosexual man would be attracted to women, while a heterosexual woman would be attracted to men. 2. Homosexuality: This refers to people who are attracted to members of the same sex. Gay men are sexually and/or romantically attracted to other men, while lesbians are women who are attracted to other women. It is essential to respect and accept homosexuality as a legitimate and valid sexual orientation, just like heterosexuality. 3. Bisexuality: This is a sexual orientation characterized by attraction to both men and women. It does not necessarily mean that the attraction is equal or that a bisexual person is sexually involved with both genders simultaneously. Like any other orientation, bisexuality is a valid expression of human sexuality. 4. Pansexuality: Pansexual individuals have the capacity for attraction to others, regardless of their gender identity or biological sex. They may be attracted to people who identify as male, female, transgender, genderqueer, or other gender non-conforming identities. This term is more inclusive than bisexuality, as it acknowledges the diverse range of gender identities that exist beyond the gender binary. 5. Asexuality: Asexual people experience little to no sexual attraction to others. This does not mean that they are incapable of forming deep emotional bonds or engaging in intimate relationships; rather, their attraction to others is not based on a desire for sexual interaction. It is crucial to understand and acknowledge the existence of asexuality as a valid sexual orientation. To foster understanding and respect for sexual orientation diversity, here are some helpful tips: 1. Educate yourself: Educating oneself about different sexual orientations is key to forming respectful and empathetic perspectives. Engage in conversations with people of diverse sexual orientations, read relevant literature, and participate in seminars or workshops. 2. Use inclusive language: When communicating with others, be mindful of your language and terminology. Avoid assumptions based on appearances and treat people as individuals with their unique preferences. 3. Challenge stereotypes: Recognize and confront the stereotypes and misconceptions that can reinforce prejudice and discrimination. Support the people in your life who may be facing discrimination due to their sexual orientation. 4. Be a listener: When discussing sexual orientation, it is vital to be an active, empathetic listener. If you are unsure about the correct language or terminology to use, it's better to ask questions and seek clarification rather than making assumptions. 5. Advocate for policies and practices supporting inclusivity: Encourage and support organizations, businesses, and institutions to adopt policies and practices that respect and celebrate the diversity of sexual orientations. By understanding, respecting, and celebrating the various sexual orientations that exist, we can come together to create a more tolerant and inclusive society, where everyone is free to express their true selves without fear of judgment or discrimination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The keys to reaching or staying at a healthy weight are regular exercise and good eating habits. Teens should get 60 minutes or more of physical activity a day. Note the word \\"activity\\". As long as you're getting your body moving, it doesn't have to mean doing difficult exercise or going to the sports hall every day. All that matters is that each week you get the right balance of activity, including aerobics , strength building, and flexibility exercise. Make exercise a habit by arranging some time every day. On days when you have soccer practice or an aerobics class, you may have no trouble exercising for an hour or more. But most of us are busy, and 60 minutes a day for exercise seems like a lot of time. The good news is that it's OK to divide it into shorter exercise breaks throughout the day. Just as you might have a healthy snack to stop yourself from getting hungry, exercise snacks can keep energy levels high. So get up 15 minutes early and do some stretching activity. Walk fast or run slowly for 15 minutes after lunch. Do the same thing after school -- or walk or bike home. Add to that taking the stairs, PE class, and walking between classes during the day, and you've probably reached your 60 minutes. Here are five simple ways to make an exercise lifestyle change: Options: A exercising for a long time is bad for people's health B it has the same effect as soccer practice C people usually haven't much time to exercise D no one can spare lots of time to exercise Answer: C people usually haven't much time to exercise Question: A:","completion":"According to the article, what is a common challenge faced by teens in incorporating regular exercise into their daily routines, and how can it be addressed?

House Oversight Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) said Wednesday he will not run for reelection next year, ending a fast-rising political career, at least for now. “After long consultation with my family and prayerful consideration, I have decided I will not be a candidate for any office in 2018,” he wrote on Facebook. “I have made a personal decision to return to the private sector.” Story Continued Below The move by the highly ambitious politician came as a shock to many in Washington. Chaffetz defeated a more moderate GOP incumbent in a 2008 primary and rose to prominence as a fierce inquisitor of President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. He also was seen as a possible candidate for the Senate. “I have long advocated public service should be for a limited time and not a lifetime or full career,” he wrote. “After more than 1,500 nights away from my home, it is time. I may run again for public office, but not in 2018.” Asked whether he would run for governor in 2020 in an interview with Utah’s KSL Newsradio, Chaffetz said, “Maybe,” adding, “I’m not trying to close the door or open the door to anything in the future… a couple years from now you can make that decision.” Chaffetz also pre-emptively dismissed speculation about why he would leave Congress. “For those that would speculate otherwise, let me be clear that I have no ulterior motives,” he wrote. “I am healthy. I am confident I would continue to be re-elected by large margins. I have the full support of Speaker [Paul] Ryan to continue as Chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.” In the radio interview, he encouraged listeners that hear any rumors about him to \\"put that aside.\\" \\"I love serving in Congress, but I love my family more,\\" Chaffetz said. \\"I didn't want to go there forever, I really meant it when I said I wanted to get in, serve, and get out.\\" He added that the contentious political environment had nothing to do with his decision to leave Capitol Hill, and he touted his work on the powerful Oversight Committee, including his controversial investigations of the Benghazi attacks, Hillary Clinton’s private email server and the IRS. Democrats responded to Chaffetz's announcement by accusing him of failing to investigate the Trump administration's improprieties. \\"Chaffetz refused to hold Trump and his family accountable for using the presidency to pad their bank accounts at the expense of Americans,\\" said DNC Deputy Communications Director Adrienne Watson. She said DNC Chairman Tom Perez and Sen. Bernie Sanders are heading to Salt Lake City on Friday to campaign against Trump. Chaffetz's 3rd District in Utah, which runs from the Salt Lake City suburbs to the state's southern and eastern borders, is one of the most Republican in the country: Neither Obama nor Clinton scored even a quarter of the vote there in 2012 or 2016, and Chaffetz has won reelection with at least 70 percent of the vote four times in a row.

The district has not been open for two decades and could draw a large crowd of interested Republican office-seekers as a result. A Democratic physician, Kathryn Allen, raised a whopping 561,000 in the first quarter to run against Chaffetz, but she will face that built-in partisan disadvantage in a general election. Aidan Quigley and Scott Bland contributed to this report. ||||| On Capitol Hill, Mr. Chaffetz has shown an opportunistic streak, often rushing toward television cameras with an eager smile. During the election, he vacillated several times before backing President Trump. He said he would not be able to look his teenage daughter in the eye should he vote for Mr. Trump after revelations arose that Mr. Trump had boasted in 2005 of sexually assaulting women. Then he voted for him. And he vowed to investigate Hillary Clinton whether she won or not. With a ready foil in Mrs. Clinton, whose brushes with controversy have sustained many Republican congressional careers, Mr. Chaffetz appeared primed to emerge as a chief tormentor for a new Democratic White House. Instead, as much as perhaps any member of Congress, his fortunes turned with Mr. Trump’s victory. During his time heading the committee, Mr. Chaffetz has focused often on two pet issues: criticizing the Secret Service for security lapses and holding Mrs. Clinton to account. After the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, announced in July that the bureau would recommend that Mrs. Clinton not be charged over her use of a private email account when she was secretary of state, Mr. Chaffetz led House Republicans in rejecting Mr. Comey’s conclusion. Five days after the announcement, Mr. Chaffetz asked the Justice Department to investigate whether Mrs. Clinton had lied in her testimony before Congress about the 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Chaffetz had been one of the first lawmakers to raise questions about the Obama administration’s role in Benghazi, traveling to Libya less than a month after the attacks to evaluate security standards. “It’s the nature of being the committee chairman to conduct oversight of the administration,” he said last year, describing his role as a pursuit of facts, not a political agenda. But with Mr. Trump’s surprise victory in November, Mr. Chaffetz found himself in an uncomfortable position: a watchdog who often sounded disinclined to watch over a fellow Republican. ||||| When receiving donations of more than 200, candidates must report who gave, how much they gave and when. Of those bigger, itemized donations to Allen — some 66,300 — about 82 percent came from people outside of Utah. Boasting of 15,194 donors, Allen said she got at least one contribution from a resident in every state (as well as some foreign funds, which, according to campaign finance law, had to be returned). None of Allen's contributions came from political action committees (PACs), though a few celebrities, including Nancy Sinatra, donated. \\"I think people underestimate me and underestimate other Democrats,\\" said Allen, a 63-year-old physician and resident of Cottonwood Heights. Her campaign went viral in early March when in less than a week, Allen went from 20,000 in an exploratory account to declaring her candidacy with 410,000 in donations. The reason for the spike? Chaffetz appeared on national television and remarked that \\"rather than get that new iPhone,\\" low-income Americans may have to prioritize spending on health care. Though he later sought to clarify the comment, angry people from across the country jumped on the fundraising site CrowdPac and flooded Allen with money. It also catapulted Chaffetz, chairman of the House Oversight Committee, into action. The congressman had raised just 29,550 from the start of the year until the end of February. Then, beginning on March 6, his fundraising picked up significantly. He collected 123,050 in the last three weeks of the reporting period. His campaign seized on Allen's success, sending emails to constituents encouraging them to rally around him. The messages warned that \\"this campaign is going to be unlike any other that I've ever seen,\\" and some focused on Rosie O'Donnell, a television star who has feuded with President Donald Trump in the past. Chaffetz, with an active campaign team, spent all of the money he raised in the quarter and dipped into his reserves for 6,000 more. Still, he said his 402,700 in the bank is \\"plenty.\\" \\"We're right where we need to be,\\" Chaffetz said. \\"This has never been a problem for me. The election is still a long time away.\\" None of the five Democrats that Chaffetz has faced and demolished since his first win in 2008 spent more than 60,000, and the congressman also has never captured less than 65 percent of the vote in his largely Republican district. Allen's well-funded candidacy is unique and so is Chaffetz's dipping approval ratings. Just 52 percent of Chaffetz's constituents — far below previous ratings — approve of his performance, according to a March poll from Utah Policy. Allen looks to capitalize on that \\"dissatisfaction,\\" particularly the tumult following the congressman's town hall in February and what residents see as unmet demands for him to investigate Trump as the House Oversight Committee chairman. \\"The game has changed,\\" Allen said. \\"I think [my donations] reflect sentiments against the direction our government is going — and Chaffetz is a big part of that.\\" Her experience in politics is limited to a three-year stint as a congressional aide in California, where she grew up, and two years spent working on a county housing program in the 1970s. She has worked as a doctor in Utah since the 1980s. Other contenders in the congressional race include Republican Damian Kidd , who collected 15,500 in the first quarter and has spent all but 1,590 of it. Chaffetz may also face a conservative challenge from former independent presidential candidate Evan McMullin (who said he might run against Chaffetz or Sen. Orrin Hatch). McMullin raised 5,000 and has 10,169 in cash on hand, though his presidential account also shows a debt of nearly 670,000. ctanner@sltrib.com ||||| SALT LAKE CITY — Rep. Jason Chaffetz said the raucous reception he received at Thursday evening's town hall meeting was \\"bullying and an attempt at intimidation\\" from a crowd opposed to President Donald Trump's election. \\"You could see it online a couple days before, a concerted effort in part to just cause chaos,\\" the Utah Republican said Friday. \\"Democrats are in disbelief that they have nothing but flailing and screaming to deal with this.\\" The relentless jeering at his and other recent congressional town halls around the country recall the tea party's reaction to President Barack Obama and Democrats, and comes as protests continue over Trump's policies. Those protests include the women's marches held around the world that drew thousands of demonstrators to the Utah Capitol on the opening day of the 2017 Legislature last month. Chris Karpowitz, co-director of BYU's Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy, sees the parallels with the tea party movement, but he said it's too soon to say what impact the unrest coming from the left will have at the ballot box. \\"I think there is a sense of unease and frustration about the Trump administration, and that concern is coming out in a variety of different ways, including in big demonstrations in major cities. But it's also touching us here in Utah,\\" he said. That such strong anti-Trump sentiment is coming from one of the most Republican states in the country is surprising, said Tim Hagle, a University of Iowa political science professor and an active member of the GOP. \\"The fact that it's happening in Utah as well as a lot of places signals there are a lot of people on the left who are still angry and energized,\\" Hagle said. \\"They're saying they want to be heard.\\" Jason Perry, head of the University of Utah's Hinckley Institute of Politics, said politicians need to pay attention. \\"I think for a while this is going to be the new norm, people inserting themselves in the process and demanding some accountability from elected officials,\\" Perry said. He, too, said it's unclear what that means for candidates in GOP-dominated Utah, where the tea party was able to unseat longtime Sen. Bob Bennett, a Republican, in 2010. \\"I would not say there's reasons for Republicans right now to be concerned,\\" Perry said. \\"But there are reasons for them to continue to listen.\\" Chaffetz said the crowd that filled the auditorium at Brighton High School in Cottonwood Heights and spilled over into a protest outside included people brought in from other states to disrupt the meeting. \\"Absolutely. I know there were,\\" he said, suggesting it was \\"more of a paid attempt to bully and intimidate\\" than a reflection of the feelings of his 3rd District constituents. Asked who would foot the bill to fill the audience with outside agitators, Chaffetz said, \\"do some reporting\\" and described how one participant made it a point to say he was not being paid by a national Democratic organization. But Rep. Marie Poulson, D-Cottonwood Heights, said she believed most of the estimated 1,000 attendees inside the high school auditorium — and at least that many who protested outside — were Chaffetz's constituents. \\"I've heard some of my colleagues (at the Utah Legislature) say here today that they had shipped in liberals to give him a bad time,\\" Poulson said. \\"I serve that area and I listen to their frustrations.\\" She said when she invited her own constituents to attend a legislative gathering held in Holladay on Thursday night, many in the politically moderate area said they were going to Chaffetz's town hall meeting instead. \\"I had so many get back to me and say, 'We've been so upset by what Rep. Chaffetz is doing. We want him to investigate equally, with as much zeal as he did in the past, with this current administration,'\\" Poulson said. And although Poulson said she doesn't approve of what she termed \\"some of the disrespect\\" shown to Chaffetz at the town hall meeting, she does \\"recognize that a lot of people are upset and angry.\\" Don Peay of Utahns for Trump, who has close ties to the Trump family, said he walked out of the meeting that was punctuated by chants including \\"do your job\\" \\"you work for us\\" and \\"vote him out.\\" \\"It was an angry mob of anarchists. It wasn't just Trump. They hated everything,\\" Peay said. \\"The behavior at the meeting was a hundred times worse than anything ever out of Trump's mouth.\\" Some who attended the rally have taken issue with that characterization. Trump's critics and some supporters have lashed out at him over his crude comments about women, his mocking of a handicapped reporter, his temperament, among other issues. At one point during the campaign, Chaffetz said he couldn't look his wife and daughter in the eye and vote for Trump after his crude comments from a 2005 videotape were released. Chaffetz ultimately voted for Trump. Another longtime Trump supporter, Senate Majority Leader Ralph Okerlund, R-Monroe, said \\"some of the discontent is just a result of disappointment in the election.\\" But Okerlund said there's an edge to how that's being expressed. \\"This is taking it to a new level. All of the demonstrations and some of the vehemence that we have not seen before,\\" he said. \\"We're just seeing this continued escalation of discontent by the side that isn't in charge.\\" Much of the focus of the town hall was on whether Chaffetz, as chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, would hold the president accountable. Chaffetz said that was \\"ironic\\" since earlier Thursday he had called for \\"disciplinary action\\" against a White House counselor who apparently violated federal ethics rules by urging people to buy Ivanka Trump merchandise in a TV interview. \\"I’ll never satisfy their desire to bring down Donald Trump. I’ll never satisfy that. It will never be good enough,\\" he said, noting that the president is exempt from conflict of interest laws and his business interests have long been widely known. \\"People are asking me to use the power of Congress to do a full-on fishing expedition to investigate him personally on things that are not required by law. I think my doing that would be an abuse of power,\\" Chaffetz said. The congressman said while it's \\"important that people have an opportunity to voice their concerns, I think they should be somewhat embarrassed by how a lot of people handled themselves.\\" Chaffetz said he was trying to provide that opportunity by holding the town hall meeting. \\"And I did hear them, but it was hard to hear through all the shouting and yelling,\\" including, he claimed, during the Pledge of Allegiance. \\"That’s who these people are,\\" he said. \\"We’re better than that. That’s not what the average Utahn is like.\\" A video of much of the Pledge of Allegiance posted on Facebook appears to show some members of the audience shouting at the end of the pledge, mostly emphasizing the last few words \\"indivisible, with liberty and justice for all\\" and then cheering afterward. Posted by Andrew Ehninger on Saturday, February 11, 2017 Chaffetz said he will continue to make himself available to voters but may now avoid providing a venue \\"for these radicals to further intimidate.\\" On Friday, he addressed the Utah State Board of Education, joking about his warm welcome.

Movie title: Apollo 13 Context: On July 20, 1969, astronaut Jim Lovell hosts a house party where guests watch on television as Neil Armstrong takes his first steps on the Moon. After the party, Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon and walk on its surface. On October 30, 1969, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that he and his crew will fly the Apollo 13 mission instead of Apollo 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. Days before launch, Mattingly is discovered to have been exposed to rubella, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert, as a safety precaution. Lovell initially resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband's safety, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for launch. After the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, an engine on the second stage cuts off prematurely, but the craft still reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage re-fires, sending Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert docks the Command/Service Module Odyssey with the Lunar Module Aquarius and pulls it away from the spent stage. Three days into the mission, the crew sends a live television transmission from Odyssey, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert performs a standard housekeeping procedure, one of two liquid oxygen tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling. The other tank is soon found to be leaking. Mission Control aborts the Moon landing, Lovell and Haise hurriedly power up Aquarius as a \\"lifeboat\\" for the return home, and Swigert shuts down Odyssey before its battery power runs out.

Input: Passage: Henry XVI already had a dispute with Louis VII's father Stephen III. On 17 April 1414, Henry and other enemies of Louis VII founded the Parakeet Society. On 8 July 1415, the society was changed into the League of Constance, an alliance for mutual defense against Louis VII. In 1417 in Constance, Louis insulted Henry by calling him \\"the son of a cook\\". When Louis then accused Henry of having shed human blood, Henry and fifteen of his followers physically attacked Louis and injured him severely. After this attack, Louis described Henry as a pluethunt , which did little to defuse the conflict. Henry XVI evaded punishment for the attack on Louis VII only through the intercession of Frederick of Brandenburg and his cousins Dukes Ernest and William III in Munich and especially by paying 6000 guilders to King Sigismund. Henry XVI wanted revenge. The conflict escalated into a war when an army from Bavaria-Ingolstadt burned down the castle of the Burgrave of Nuremberg.

Since every poker game is different, it’s important to develop good instincts rather than try to memorize and apply tricky systems. Observe experienced players and imagine how you’d react in their position. Then, watch how the experienced players react to build your own instincts. While you do this, consider how successful you’d have been if you were playing and reacted as you did. Would you have won, or would you have lost? Then, decide how you can improve your strategy going forward. and cut the deck before they’re dealt. Shuffling the cards mixes them up to make the game more fair. To do a basic shuffle, split the deck into 2 stacks. Next, hold a stack in each hand close together and facing each other. Use your thumbs to flip through the cards, combining the deck into one. After the cards are shuffled, get someone who isn’t the dealer to cut the deck by separating it into 2 stacks and placing the bottom stack on top. Do several shuffles to make sure the cards are mixed up. You can cut the deck more than once if you’d like. The dealer typically does the shuffling and bets last, which is called the “button” position. After each hand, you’ll pass the dealer/button position to the next player on the left. If the dealer is always the same person, like in a casino, the button position will still pass clockwise around the table. You can say this if you are the first better or if all those already betting have checked. If you say \\"check\\" when it's your turn at the beginning of a new hand, that means you are choosing not to place a bet at that point. Instead, you pass the chance to open to the next player. In the following rounds, if you say “check,” that means you’re staying with the bets you already paid into the pot during this hand, and you won’t pay more until someone else raises during their turn. If another player does raise on that hand, then you nor anyone else can say \\"check\\" or maintain your “check”—so when the play comes around to you again you have to either match or raise the latest bet or fold your hand. For example, you could raise the ante 1 or at least the agreed minimum raise. If you choose not to open, take turns in clockwise order, until someone else has opened or every player checked. If everyone checks, then it is time to choose to discard and draw 1 to 3 cards, or \\"hold pat\\" on the cards you have. When there are fewer than 3 cards available to draw, replacements will be drawn. The dealer will have to shuffle the discards and add them to the bottom of the draw stack. Calling means making a bet equal to the last bet or raise. For example, if the person right of you just bet 10 and it's now your turn, you would say \\"call\\" or “I call” to match that bet. Then you would place 10 in chips or cash in the pot. This is also known as “sweetening the pot.” Raise or re-raise requires finishing this round and making another round to now allow any others to \\"call\\" or \\"raise\\" the amount of that last bet to stay in the game, or else \\"fold\\". The ones who already called can check on this turn and the hand is finished unless someone re-raises. If someone before you bets 20 and you think you have a winning hand or you want to bluff, you can raise when it's your turn by saying “raise to 30.” However, do not say “I see your 20, and I’ll raise you 10…” Despite being popular in movies, this is actually frowned upon as sloppy table talk. Folding means forfeiting your cards and giving up that pot with any bets you've made into it. Wait to be dealt into the next hand if you have chips or have not reached your limit of losses. To fold when it’s your turn, put your cards face down on the table and place them onto the discard pile. You can fold at any point in a hand when it’s your turn. This means exchanging your poker chips for money. If you still have chips but don’t want to play anymore, take your chips to the bank and tell them you’re ready to cash in. The bank will determine how much money your chips represent, then they’ll hand you cash. You can usually return and watch the game after you cash in.

Answer:","completion":"The best way to preheat the oven is: a). press the bake button on the oven, set to the desired temperature, then wait until the oven beeps at you to know that it is at the desired temperature. The justification for this choice is as follows: 1. Pressing the bake button activates the oven's baking function, which is designed to heat the oven evenly and maintain a consistent temperature throughout the entire space. This is ideal for preheating, as it ensures that the food will cook evenly once placed inside the oven. 2. Setting the oven to the desired temperature is important so that you can achieve the proper heat required for your specific recipe. Different types of food and baked goods require different temperatures to cook properly. 3. Waiting for the oven to beep or signal that it has reached the desired temperature is crucial since it confirms that your oven is now ready for baking. Placing food into the oven before it has reached the appropriate temperature can result in unevenly cooked or undercooked food."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Background: Lane was born Morton Donald Isaacson at the Manhattan \\"Flower Hospital\\" in New York City to a Jewish father (Jacob) and a Catholic mother (Dolly), who later converted to Judaism. Jacob \\"Jack\\" Isaacson was a sergeant in the New York City Police Department (NYPD) and Dolly was a homemaker. He was raised in The Bronx, where he attended DeWitt Clinton High School and was classmates with Judd Hirsch and Garry Marshall. By his mid-teens, due to his mother's influential personality, Isaacson had decided he wanted to be in show business. Context: In 1965 the Irish comedian Dave Allen presented a talk show on Sydney television for TCN-9. He was eventually sacked and Nine producer John Collins looked for replacement hosts to fill in for the rest of the season. After a series of temporary hosts, Collins found Lane working in The Dunes Nightclub in Hawaii. While in the United States, Collins asked Las Vegas performer Wayne Newton if there was anybody he should consider as a replacement; Newton's answer was \\"Don Lane\\". Lane was offered the job after filming and sending in an audition tape for the TCN-9 executives. He was given the host's chair for six weeks. He planned to base his version of the show on Johnny Carson's Tonight Show. Lane's run was variously referred to as The Tonight Show, Tonight with Don Lane and Sydney Tonight. Within a month, Nine settled on Lane as permanent host. After four weeks, his original six-week contract was extended to forty weeks. Tonight with Don Lane featured comedy sketches, interviews with visiting entertainers and musical numbers often performed by Lane with the Tonight Show Orchestra. The announcer for the show was Mike Walsh, who later went on to host his own successful variety show. Due to technical restrictions, Lane's tonight show was only broadcast throughout New South Wales, just as In Melbourne Tonight(IMT) was restricted to Victoria. Work on a coaxial cable linking Melbourne with Sydney had begun in June 1959 and was completed on 5 February 1963. On 7 July 1965, Lane appeared on a then-innovative live split-screen link with Graham Kennedy via the cable. Lane and Kennedy sang the song \\"Seventy-Six Trombones\\" as a duet. They took full advantage of the new technology and the duet included the performers throwing jugs of water and Kennedy holding up a sign saying \\"Go Home Yank\\", to which Lane laughed. Lane also performed another duet with Kennedy at the Logies ceremony in 1967. In March 1968, Lane was charged with importing marijuana into Australia. He was arrested at Sydney Airport and remanded in custody. He strenuously protested his innocence, claiming that the drugs were planted into his jacket pocket by a former business associate who wanted revenge. He was found not guilty on all charges, being defended by barrister Marcus Einfeld. Question: What was Tonight with Don Lane?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Tonight with Don Lane was a TV show in Australia. It was like a fun party where people could watch from their homes. Don Lane was the host, and he would do funny skits, talk to famous guests, and sometimes even sing and dance with a big band playing music. The show was like a big friend gathering for people to enjoy at night. It became very popular, and Don Lane stayed as the host for a long time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Answer the following question: What Polish and naturalized French physicist had a small rocky island near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago named after her? Answer:","completion":"Marie Skłodowska Curie, a Polish and naturalized French physicist, had a small rocky island named after her near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago. Born on November 7, 1867, in Warsaw, Poland, Marie Curie was a pioneering scientist who made groundbreaking discoveries in physics and chemistry. She is best known for her research on radioactivity, a term she coined, and the discovery of the elements polonium (named after her homeland, Poland) and radium. Marie Curie moved to Paris, France, in 1891 to study at the prestigious Sorbonne University. In 1895, she married Pierre Curie, a French physicist, and they formed a powerful scientific partnership. Together, they conducted extensive research on radioactivity and discovered the phenomenon of induced radioactivity in 1898. Marie Curie's work in radioactivity and her findings on the radioactive properties of thorium, uranium, and the newly discovered elements earned her the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics, which she shared with Pierre Curie and Antoine Henri Becquerel. In 1911, she also received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her discovery and characterization of polonium and radium. Throughout her career, Marie Curie faced several challenges, including gender discrimination and struggles to secure funding for her research. Despite these obstacles, she persevered and continued to make significant scientific contributions, becoming the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and the first person to win Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields. Her work has had a lasting impact on science, medicine, and the world at large, with her discoveries in radioactivity being critical to the development of cancer radiotherapy, the study of nuclear energy, and the understanding of the properties and structure of atoms. In honor of her immense contributions to science and her extraordinary achievements, a small rocky island near the eastern end of the Géologie Archipelago in Antarctica was named after her. The island, called Île Curie (Curie Island), is a testament to Marie Curie's enduring legacy and the significance of her work in the fields of physics and chemistry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\".

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How do you keep the car between the lines on the road?","completion":"Keeping a car between the lines on the road requires a combination of mental awareness, hand-eye coordination, and understanding of the car's dimensions and functioning. The key is to maintain consistent and smooth control of the car while being attentive to the road conditions and traffic. Here is a step-by-step guide to help someone accomplish this goal: 1. Familiarize yourself with the car: Get accustomed to the size and dimensions of the car, the position of the mirrors, and how the controls work, including the steering, accelerator, and brakes. Height and seat adjustments should be made to ensure clear visibility of the road and that all controls are within comfortable reach. 2. Check the mirrors: Before hitting the road, position the side and rearview mirrors to have a clear view of the surrounding traffic. Mirrors help in keeping track of nearby vehicles and maintaining spatial awareness. 3. Hold the steering wheel correctly: A crucial aspect of keeping a car between the lines is holding the steering wheel properly. Place your hands at the 9 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions for optimal control. Maintain a firm grip on the wheel but avoid holding it too tightly, as it can cause fatigue and reduce control. 4. Look ahead and scan the road: Always keep your eyes focused on the road ahead and continuously scan your surroundings, including the road lines, traffic, pedestrians, and any potential obstacles. By staying alert and aware, you will be better prepared to make necessary adjustments to your course. 5. Use reference points: Utilize landmarks and reference points, such as the edge of the hood or the side mirrors, to help align your car with the road lines. Keep a mental note of these points to ensure your car remains in the correct position. 6. Maintain a safe distance: Keep a safe distance from the vehicle in front of you to allow for sufficient reaction time in case of sudden stops or changes in traffic flow. This distance also helps in maintaining a clear sightline to the road lines. 7. Apply smooth steering inputs: To keep the car between the lines, smoothly and gradually turn the steering wheel in the desired direction. Making jerky or sudden movements can cause you to lose control and venture out of your lane. 8. Stay within the speed limit: Driving at appropriate speeds allows for better control of the car and easier lane maintenance. Adjusting speed depending on the road, traffic, and weather conditions is essential. 9. Regularly check your blind spots: Frequently check your blind spots by quickly glancing over your shoulder in addition to using the side mirrors, especially when changing lanes or merging onto highways. This ensures you are aware of vehicles outside your immediate field of vision. 10. Avoid distractions: Minimize distractions such as mobile phones, loud music, or engaging in activities that could divert your attention away from the road. Staying focused on driving is vital to keeping your car between the lines. 11. Practice, practice, practice: Like any skill, becoming proficient at maintaining your car within the lines requires practice. Commit to regular driving sessions in various conditions to build confidence and improve your proficiency. By following these steps and practicing consistently, drivers can learn to keep their car between the lines effectively and safely navigate the roads."},{"prompt":"Select from: a). No; b).

Ma had put a stack of clean clothes at the foot of the bed for me. I dressed without caring what I put on. The only important items were my cowboy boots and my Roy Rogers belt with two holsters for cap guns, even though I only had one cap gun left, and its trigger was broken. When I used the toilet, I sat on the front edge of the seat, watching the water beneath me, and scooted off as soon as I was done. I had seen a cartoon in a book at Grandpa Abner's that showed a fish leaping out of a toilet bowl and a woman staring at it with big eyes. I thought that was funny and I knew it was impossible, but I didn't think there was any reason to take chances. Ma called, \\"Little Bit has to use the bathroom.\\" I yelled, \\"I'm almost done.\\" Ma called, \\"Are you off the toilet?\\" I yelled, \\"Yes!\\" Ma opened the door and brought Little Bit in. Squeezing toothpaste onto my toothbrush, I said, \\"I wasn't done yet.\\" Ma said, \\"Your father's making breakfast in the restaurant.\\" That meant we should hurry, so I slid the brush over my teeth while Little Bit sat next to the sink, and then I ran out of the house.

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

Neil Young and Stephen Stills met in 1965, at the Fourth Dimension in Thunder Bay, Ontario. Young was there with the Squires, a Winnipeg group he had been leading since February 1963, and Stills was on tour with The Company, a spin-off from the Au Go Go Singers. When Stills' band broke up at the end of that tour, he moved to the West Coast, where he worked as a session musician and auditioned unsuccessfully for, among other bands, the Monkees. Told by record producer Barry Friedman there would be work available if he could assemble a band, Stills invited fellow Au Go Go Singers alumnus Richie Furay and former Squires bass player Ken Koblun to come join him in California. Both agreed, although Koblun chose to leave before very long and joined the group 3's a Crowd. In early 1966 in Toronto, Young met Bruce Palmer, a Canadian who was playing bass for a group called the Mynah Birds. In need of a lead guitarist, Palmer invited Young to join the group, and Young accepted. The Mynah Birds were set to record an album for Motown Records when their singer Ricky James Matthews--James Ambrose Johnson, Jr., later known as Rick James--was tracked down and arrested by the U.S. Navy for being AWOL. With their record deal canceled, Young and Palmer headed for Los Angeles, where they encountered Stills. Drummer Dewey Martin, who had played with garage rock group the Standells and country artists such as Patsy Cline and the Dillards, joined at the suggestion of the Byrds' manager, Jim Dickson. The group's name was taken from a brand of steamroller made by the Buffalo-Springfield Roller Company. The new group debuted on April 11, 1966, at The Troubadour in Hollywood.

With the rise of disco in the US and punk rock in the UK, hard rock's mainstream dominance was rivalled toward the later part of the decade. Disco appealed to a more diverse group of people and punk seemed to take over the rebellious role that hard rock once held. Early punk bands like The Ramones explicitly rebelled against the drum solos and extended guitar solos that characterised stadium rock, with almost all of their songs clocking in around two minutes with no guitar solos. However, new rock acts continued to emerge and record sales remained high into the 1980s. 1977 saw the début and rise to stardom of Foreigner, who went on to release several platinum albums through to the mid-1980s. Midwestern groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon and Styx helped further cement heavy rock in the Midwest as a form of stadium rock. In 1978, Van Halen emerged from the Los Angeles music scene with a sound based around the skills of lead guitarist Eddie Van Halen. He popularised a guitar-playing technique of two-handed hammer-ons and pull-offs called tapping, showcased on the song \\"Eruption\\" from the album Van Halen, which was highly influential in re-establishing hard rock as a popular genre after the punk and disco explosion, while also redefining and elevating the role of electric guitar.

What 's the maximum amount of money we have made from selling the watermelons ?","completion":"Step 1: Calculate the total revenue from selling watermelons To determine the maximum amount of money made from selling the watermelons, we need to find out how many watermelons were sold at each price. We know that: - 1 watermelon was sold for 3 - 2 watermelons were sold for 5 - A total of 20 watermelons were sold. Step 2: Find the number of watermelons sold at each price point We should consider the highest revenue-generating scenario, which would be selling more watermelons at the 2 for 5 price point. Let's assume 'x' watermelons were sold at 1 for 3, and the rest were sold at 2 for 5. So, we can write the total number of watermelons sold as x + 2 * (20 - x). x + 2 * (20 - x) = 20 Step 3: Solve the equation Now we need to solve the equation to find the value of 'x': x + 40 - 2x = 20 x - 2x = 20 - 40 -x = -20 x = 20 This means that 20 watermelons were sold at 1 for 3, and 0 watermelons were sold at 2 for 5. We can now calculate the total revenue. Step 4: Calculate the maximum revenue Total revenue (1 for 3) = 20 watermelons * 3/watermelon = 60 Total revenue (2 for 5) = 0 * 5 = 0 So, the maximum amount of money made from selling the watermelons is 60."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context: In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chargers, the Broncos traveled to Reliant Stadium for an AFC match with the Houston Texans. The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. A 35-yard field goal by Bullock narrowed the Broncos' lead, but the Broncos increased it with two field goals from Prater in the final minute of the first half &#8212; a 25-yarder and a 44-yarder. A 15-yard touchdown pass from Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub to wide receiver Keshawn Martin was the only scoring play of the third quarter, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 16-13. After Broncos' safety Mike Adams intercepted Schaub early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos subsequently pulled away, with Manning throwing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Eric Decker &#8212; a 10-yarder and a 20-yarder. Later in the fourth quarter, Manning threw his 51st touchdown pass of the season &#8212; a 25-yarder to tight end Julius Thomas, in which Manning set a new NFL record for touchdown passes in a single season. With the win, coupled with the Kansas City Chiefs' loss to the Indianapolis Colts, the Broncos clinched the AFC West division title. This was the 13th division title in the Broncos' franchise history, surpassing the Oakland Raiders for the all-time lead in AFC West championships since the 1970 AFL-NFL merger. It also marked the first time in franchise history that the Broncos have clinched three consecutive AFC West division titles. How many points did the Texans have at the half?","completion":"To find out how many points the Texans had at the half, we need to look at the scoring plays for the Texans in the first and second quarters: 1. In the first quarter, Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock scored a 45-yard field goal. 2. In the second quarter, Bullock scored another field goal, this time a 35-yard one. Each field goal is worth 3 points. So, to calculate the total points for the Texans at the half, we add the points from both field goals: 45-yard field goal (first quarter) = 3 points 35-yard field goal (second quarter) = 3 points Total points for the Texans at the half = 3 + 3 = 6 points"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a person who constantly needs to keep in touch with different groups of friends, family, and work colleagues, I expected Telegram to be a reliable and convenient communication platform. However, my experience was contrary to my expectations, and I find it necessary to share my dissatisfaction with everyone to save them from the tumultuous ride I had with this app. Firstly, the app's signup process was a herculean task, which quickly became a vexing battle against time. The One-Time Password (OTP) that I was supposed to receive simply failed to reach my phone multiple times. Every time I requested another OTP, I encountered the same issue, leaving me utterly annoyed and frustrated. I would expect a messaging app to at least handle its basic communication features with ease, but this first step already proved to be a striking problem. Once I finally managed to register and enter the app, I was confronted with a user interface that was far from intuitive. It was a convoluted mess that made me dread using the app the moment I first laid my eyes on it. The features were overcomplicated and disorganized, making it difficult to locate specific functionalities. In today's world - where every other app aims for simplicity and a seamless user experience - it was astonishing to see how the Telegram developers missed the mark. Moreover, the messaging experience was consistently marred by slow message delivery and app crashes. My messages frequently got stuck in limbo before finally being delivered after ages. And not only that, the app crashed on multiple occasions, even after I tried to reinstall it. It was inconvenient and frustrating, to say the least. The thought of losing critical information had me stressed out and made me question my decision to use Telegram in the first place. Additionally, the security features of org.telegram.messenger were wholly underwhelming. As someone who values privacy, I was shocked to learn that the app's end-to-end encryption was only implemented in their \\"secret chats\\" feature, leaving my regular conversations vulnerable to malicious parties. This revelation heavily deterred me from discussing any sensitive information within the app. Lastly, the customer support was a disaster. They were unresponsive and unhelpful, offering absolutely no solutions when I contacted them regarding my numerous app-related issues. I spent hours trying to communicate with them, but my efforts were completely futile. With all these issues combined, I am confident in saying that the org.telegram.messenger app should be avoided at all costs. It is an inferior communication platform that taints the messaging experience with its unreliable, frustrating, and insecure foundation. If you are looking for a better alternative, I highly suggest exploring other options readily available in the app stores, as they are leaps and bounds ahead of Telegram Messenger."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Translate to Romanian","completion":"\\"Aceasta reprezintă conducerea Uniunii Europene în conformitate cu metoda comunitară.\\" Metoda comunitară se referă la procesul decizional și la modul în care sunt adoptate politicile în cadrul Uniunii Europene. Această metodă implică un grad ridicat de cooperare între instituțiile europene, cum ar fi Comisia Europeană, Consiliul Uniunii Europene și Parlamentul European. În esență, metoda comunitară reprezintă baza cooperării și guvernării în cadrul UE. Principiile metodei comunitare includ: 1. Supranaționalitate: Deciziile luate în cadrul UE sunt realizate de instituții supranaționale care își sprijină membrilor să lucreze împreună pentru a aborda provocările cu care se confruntă întregul continent european. Acest concept diferă de cooperarea interguvernamentală, în care guvernele naționale își păstrează controlul asupra deciziilor și acțiunilor. 2. Partajarea suveranității: Statele membre își transferă o parte din suveranitatea lor națională în favoarea instituțiilor UE în domenii specifice, cum ar fi comerțul sau mediul, pentru a permite crearea și implementarea de politici comune. 3. Respectarea dreptului comunitar: Legislația UE este direct aplicabilă în toate statele membre, iar sistemele juridice naționale trebuie să respecte și să pună în aplicare aceste legi. Dacă există conflicte între dreptul UE și legile naționale, dreptul comunitar primează. 4. Procesul decizional bazat pe consens: În cadrul metodei comunitare, deciziile sunt luate în strânsă colaborare între instituțiile europene și statele membre. Acest lucru se face, de obicei, prin votare și negociere, cu scopul de a se ajunge la un consens și de a asigura că toate părțile interesate au un cuvânt de spus în proces. 5. Rolul central al Comisiei Europene: Comisia Europeană are un rol central în procesul decizional al metodei comunitare, deoarece este responsabilă pentru elaborarea propunerilor legislative și pentru asigurarea respectării legislației UE. De asemenea, Comisia răspunde în fața Parlamentului European, ceea ce contribuie la responsabilitatea democratică în cadrul UE. În concluzie, metoda comunitară reprezintă o abordare centrală în conducerea și adoptarea politicilor în cadrul Uniunii Europene, bazată pe colaborarea strânsă între statele membre și instituțiile europene, respectarea supranaționalității și partajarea suveranității și aplicarea uniformă a dreptului comunitar în întregul bloc."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But he never forgets the old days. He likes to talk about them. He often talks about his favourite birds, the robins (----). \\"When I was a boy, these houses were not here. There were wide fields and tall trees. Every spring robins would come. Thousands of them would fly up to the north from the south. They spent the winter in the south. Some would build their nests in the trees near our houses. Then people started to cut down trees, and they built more houses. The robins stopped coming. They couldn't build their nests near our houses because there were no trees.\\" \\"Now there are too many houses and too many roads. There are no places for the robins. They do come any more .\\" Answer:","completion":"Question: In the article about Mr. Ellis's hometown, which of the following best describes the changes that have occurred over time? A. The number of robins has increased due to the presence of more houses. B. Robins no longer visit the area due to the loss of trees and increased human development. C. The town has become less populated and more focused on preserving nature. D. The number of trees has increased, resulting in more nesting spots for robins. Answer: B. Robins no longer visit the area due to the loss of trees and increased human development. Justification: In this question, we need to consider the changes in Mr. Ellis's hometown as described in the article. Option A is incorrect because the article states that the robins stopped coming due to a lack of trees for nesting. Option B is the correct answer as the article clearly mentions that the increase in houses and cutting down of trees has caused the robins to stop coming to the area. Option C is incorrect because the article states that more houses have been built, indicating an increase in population, rather than a decrease. Option D is incorrect because the article mentions that trees were cut down, reducing nesting spots for robins, rather than increasing them."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Most kids hate doing housework.

She believed her best chance to be heard was through sheer repetition, so Rachel Crooks took her seat at the dining table and prepared to tell the story again. She was used to difficult audiences, to skeptics and Internet trolls who flooded her Facebook page with threats, but this was a generous crowd: a dozen women, all friends of her aunt, gathered for a casual dinner party on a Friday night. The hostess turned off the music, clanked a fork against her wineglass and gestured to Crooks. “Would you mind telling us about the famous incident?” she asked. “Not the sound-bite version, but the real version.” “The real version,” Crooks said, nodding back. She took a sip of water and folded a napkin onto her lap. Rachel Crooks is one of the 19 women who accused President Donald Trump of sexual assault. “It all happened at Trump Tower,” she said. “I had just moved to New York, and I was working as a secretary for another company in the building. That’s where he forced himself on me.” Crooks, 35, had been publicly reliving this story for much of the past two years, ever since she first described it in an email to the New York Times several months before the 2016 election. “I don’t know if people will really care about this or if this will matter at all,” she had written then, and after Donald Trump’s election she had repeated her story at the Women’s March, on the “Today” show and at a news conference organized by women’s rights attorney Gloria Allred. Crooks had spoken to people dressed in #MeToo sweatshirts and to her rural neighbors whose yards were decorated with Trump signs. In early February, she launched a campaign to become a Democratic state representative in Ohio, in part so she could share her story more widely with voters across the state. And yet, after dozens of retellings, she still wasn’t sure: Did people really care? Did it matter at all? Despite her story, and the similar stories of more than a dozen other women, nothing had changed. Trump, who had denied all of the accusations, was still president of the United States, and Crooks was still circling back to the same moments on Jan. 11, 2006, that had come to define so much about her life. Rachel Crooks holds a photograph of herself from the time when she worked at Trump Tower. “He was waiting for the elevator outside our office when I got up the nerve to introduce myself,” she said now, remembering that day when she was 22 years old and Trump was 59. “It’s not like I was trying to upset the apple cart. I don’t know. Maybe I was being naive.” The hostess shook her head and then reached for Crooks’s hand. “You did absolutely nothing wrong,” she said. “Thank you,” Crooks said, even though she sometimes still wondered. She reached for her water glass and lifted it up into the air to use as a prop. “He took hold of my hand and held me in place like this,” she said, squeezing the sides of the water glass, shaking it gently from side to side. “He started kissing me on one cheek, then the other cheek. He was talking to me in between kisses, asking where I was from, or if I wanted to be a model. He wouldn’t let go of my hand, and then he went right in and started kissing me on the lips.” She shook the water glass one final time and set it down. “It felt like a long kiss,” she said. “The whole thing probably lasted two minutes, maybe less.” “Like you were another piece of his property,” the hostess said. “And with those orange lips!” another woman said. Everyone at the table began to talk at the same time about Trump, and Crooks pushed her chair back and nodded along. She understood by now that for everyone else this was a story about the president — about what he had or hadn’t done during those two minutes, and what that said about his morality and the character of the country that voted him into office. But the story Crooks was still trying to understand was her own, about what those two minutes had meant for her. The hostess clinked her glass again to quiet the room. “Sorry, but can we go back to the kiss for a second?” “Sure,” Crooks said, and then she started to tell it again. Crooks gets ready for work at her home in Tiffin. There were 19 women in all who made public accusations of sexual misconduct, or “The Nineteen,” as they had come to be known on T-shirts and bumper stickers. Most had come forward with their stories after Trump launched his presidential campaign in 2015, and the experiences they described having with him spanned five decades. They claimed Trump had “acted like a creepy uncle,” or “squeezed my butt,” or “eyed me like meat,” or “stuck his hand up under my skirt,” or “groped with octopus hands,” or “pushed me against a wall,” or “thrust his genitals,” or “forced his tongue into my mouth” or “offered 10,000 for everything.” In response, Trump had called the accusations against him “total fabrications” based on “political motives” to destroy his campaign and then his presidency. “Nothing ever happened with any of these women,” Trump tweeted once. “Totally made up nonsense to steal the election. Nobody has more respect for women than me!” One woman accused Trump of assaulting her in the middle of a commercial flight after they met as seatmates in the 1970s. Another said it happened in a conference room during the middle of a job interview. Another, a journalist for People magazine, said Trump forced his tongue into her mouth as they finished an interview for a feature story about his marriage to Melania. The list of accusers included a reality-TV host, a runner-up on “The Apprentice,” a yoga instructor, an adult-film star and several women who had competed in Trump’s beauty pageants: a Miss New Hampshire, Miss Washington, Miss Arizona and Miss Finland. And then there was Crooks, who had never been on reality TV, never drank alcohol, never met anyone famous until she moved from her childhood home in Green Springs to New York City in the summer of 2005. Nobody else in three generations of her family had ever seen the appeal in leaving Green Springs, population 1,300, but nobody else was quite like her: striking and self-assured at 6 feet tall; all-state in basketball, volleyball and track; the high school salutatorian and “Most Likely to Succeed.” She wanted to backpack across Europe, earn her doctorate, work in high-end fashion and live in a skyscraper that looked out over something other than an endless grid of brown-and-green soybean fields. “New York is where you can make things happen,” she had written to a friend back then, and a few weeks after graduating from college she persuaded her high school boyfriend, Clint Hackenburg, to move with her. They rented a room in a cheap group house way out in Bay Ridge, and she took the first job she could find on Craigslist to pay rent, at an investment firm in Trump Tower called Bayrock. Her secretarial tasks were to make coffee, water the two office palm trees, polish the gold-trimmed mirrors, straighten the tassels on the Oriental rug at the entryway and sit at a mahogany welcome desk to greet visitors who came through the glass front doors. She found the work mindless and demeaning, but all around her was the promise of New York. There was Oprah Winfrey, filming a TV show next to the two-story Christmas wreath in the main lobby. There was George Clooney, strolling past the office. There was Trump, an occasional business partner with Bayrock, standing right outside the glass doors every few days with his bodyguard as he waited for the elevator to take him back to his 100 million penthouse on the 66th floor. She remembered that sometimes he looked in and smiled at her. At least once she thought she saw him wave. “If you’re working in that building, you’ve got to at least meet him,” Hackenburg told her, and after five months Crooks finally got up from her desk and went out to say hello. It was early in the morning, and the office was mostly empty. She walked toward Trump, who she remembers was standing by himself in the small waiting area near the elevators. She held out her hand, intent on introducing herself not as a fan or as a secretary but as a business partner. “Mr. Trump, I wanted to say hi, since our companies do a little work together,” she remembered telling him that day, and then, before she understood what was happening, she remembered Trump becoming the second man ever to kiss her. “Fiction,” was what Trump’s campaign called her story when Crooks first told it publicly in 2016. “It is absurd to think that one of the most recognizable business leaders on the planet with a strong record of empowering women in his companies would do the things alleged,” the campaign said. But Crooks’s version of that day was prompting more and more questions in her mind. Why did she sometimes feel as if he was still holding her in place? Why had she spent so much of the past decade recoiling from that moment — back behind the receptionist desk, back inside of her head, back home to the certainty and simplicity of small-town Ohio? It was just a dreadful kiss, or at least that’s what she kept trying to tell herself to quiet the confusion that had grown out of that moment, turning into shame, hardening into anxiety and insecurity until nearly a decade later, when she first started to read about other women whose accusations sounded so much like her own. Kissed at a party. Kissed in a dance club. Kissed during a business meeting. Kissed while attending a Mother’s Day brunch at Mar-a-Largo. “For the first time, I started to think it wasn’t my fault for being clueless and naive, or for something I did wrong in seeming that way to him,” Crooks said in one of her first public statements about Trump in 2016. Maybe together with the other accusers their stories had power, Crooks thought. Maybe, if the accusations alone weren’t enough to hold Trump accountable for his behavior, the women could force the country to pay attention with better messaging and greater theatrics. Late in 2017, Crooks agreed to join several accusers for television interviews and news conferences in New York. “A call to action,” the invitation read, because their goal was to demand a congressional investigation into Trump’s alleged sexual misconduct. Crooks wrote herself some reminders for effective public speaking: “Use detail and repetition.” “Make it personal.” “Focus on solutions.” She volunteered to speak first, squared her shoulders and then turned to face the cameras with the poise of the athlete she had been. “By now all of you are probably familiar with my story,” she said before beginning it again. The 24th floor. His lips coming toward hers. His hands holding her in place until the elevator arrived to take him upstairs. “Feelings of self-doubt and insignificance,” she said. “I know there are many worse forms of sexual harassment, but doesn’t this still speak to character?” she said. “I don’t want money. I don’t need a lawsuit. I just want people to listen. How many women have to come forward? What will it take to get a response?” Crooks at her office at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, where she works as a recruiter. A Trump flag hangs on a house in Green Springs, Ohio, the town where Crooks grew up. Left: Crooks at her office at Heidelberg University in Tiffin, Ohio, where she works as a recruiter. Right: A Trump flag hangs on a house in Green Springs, Ohio, the town where Crooks grew up. The response that came was waiting every day on Crooks’s computer, so one morning back home in Ohio she woke up and walked downstairs to her laptop. The front door was locked, the shades were drawn, and she sat next to the dog she had recently bought with hopes that a pet might help reduce her anxiety. She navigated to Facebook. “Good morning, Rachel!” read a greeting at the top of her page, and then she clicked open her messages. “Very unbelievable story,” read the first. “Try and get rich some other way.” “You ignorant, attention seeking cow.” “Nobody would touch you, especially not Trump. You look like a boy. A gun to your head would be good for our nation.” She had tried changing the privacy settings on her Facebook page and logging off Twitter, but there was no way to barricade herself from so much hostility. It came into her email inbox at the tiny college in Ohio where she worked as a recruiter of international students. It came when she walked her dog around the block or took her nephews trick-or-treating. “So many stares and weird comments that give me social anxiety,” was how she explained it once to a friend, because now each interaction required a series of calculations. Two thirds of people in Seneca County had voted for Trump. Ninety-four percent of Trump supporters told pollsters that their views were “not impacted” by the sexual harassment allegations against him. So Crooks wondered: Did the majority of her friends, co-workers and neighbors think she was lying? Or, even worse in her mind, did they believe her but simply not care? “An honest, timeless, values-first community” was how one tourism slogan described Seneca County, and Crooks had always believed those things to be true. Her father had worked 39 years as a mechanic at Whirlpool and then retired with a decent pension. Her sister was raising four children in the same converted farmhouse where Crooks had grown up. Everybody in town knew her family — four generations of Crooks clustered within a few square blocks — so a local newspaper had interviewed community members about Crooks’s allegations against Trump. “A fine, wholesome young girl,” her high school volleyball coach told the paper, and that seemed to Crooks like the most Ohio compliment of all. But then the story ended and the comments began, and Crooks kept reading because she knew some of the commenters, too. “I’m a friend of the family. She’s lying.” “If he was going to make a move on a woman, it wouldn’t be her!” “We know Trump has class, so why would he waste his time on some average chick like this?” In her “values-first” community, it now felt to Crooks as if politics had become a fissure that was always deepening, the facts distorted by both sides, until even her own family no longer agreed on what or whom to believe. Her parents and sister supported her, even if they disliked talking about politics. Her grandmother, a staunch conservative, hugged Crooks after reading the original article about Trump’s harassment in the New York Times but then sometimes talked admiringly about Trump. Another of her relatives was often posting laudatory stories about the president on Facebook and dismissing many of the attacks against him as purely political, until one day Crooks decided to email her. “Your candidate of choice kissed me without my consent,” Crooks wrote, and then she began to wonder whether there was some way to tell her story, or some piece of evidence, that could change her relative’s mind. During one news conference, she had asked Trump to release the security videotapes from the 24th floor that day, but he never responded. She had not heard from him, or anyone representing him, since she came home from New York. “What can I ever do to prove this happened and that it impacted my life?” she said. Maybe the proof was the email she had sent to her mother, from the Bayrock office in New York, at 1:27 that afternoon in 2006: “Hey Ma, my day started off rough…had a weird incident with Mr. Trump.” Or the email she sent a few hours later to her sister at 3:05 p.m.: “I must just appear to be some dumb girl that he can take advantage of…ugh!” Or the email she sent a few days after that to another relative: “Ah yes, the Donald kiss…very creepy man, let me tell you!” Or the recorded conversation between Trump and Billy Bush on an “Access Hollywood” bus late in 2005, months before Crooks says she met Trump by the elevators: “You know, I’m automatically attracted to beautiful women. I just start kissing them. It’s like a magnet. Just kiss. I don’t even wait. And when you’re a star, they let you do it. You can do anything.” “By all means, have your opinions,” Crooks wrote to her relative instead, because more and more she believed no version of her story could bridge the widening divide. “It makes me ill, to be quite honest with you . . . when my own family members not only vote for but publicly defend this person,” she wrote. “For my own sanity, I will not engage you further on this.” Rachel Crooks, back right, meets with the Get Rachel Elected group at her home in Tiffin. Crooks announced in early February that she is running for state representative in Ohio. And then there was one of her other relatives, her aunt, Barbara Radebaugh, who was often encouraging her niece to engage and to fight. “Keep speaking your truth!” Radebaugh wrote to her, and she invited Crooks to Columbus in late January to participate in the second annual Women’s March. The two of them had traveled together from Ohio to the inaugural march in Washington on a bus with several dozen strangers, and now many of those women gathered again in Columbus for a small reunion a few hours before the march. “What a transformative, empowering year,” Radebaugh said to the group, because one of the women from that bus ride had become a Democratic fundraiser, another had started volunteering for reproductive rights, another had joined the board of the local Pride parade, and two more were running for seats in the Ohio House of Representatives. Crooks had yet to officially launch her campaign, but Mary Relotto had already raised 20,000, knocked on thousands of doors and filed all of her paperwork. She was scheduled to give a kickoff speech in Columbus, and now she asked Crooks whether she would be willing to share her story about Trump during the march. “You are an inspiration to me,” Relotto told her. “I want to champion you, to champion each other. Your voice and your story in this is huge.” “Thank you,” Crooks said. “I don’t always feel that way, but —” “It’s huge. So let me ask you: Do you want to engage with the people?” “I don’t know. This feels more like your moment.” “Thank you, but the people need to see a face. You have a powerful story. It’s up to you how far you want to take it. What do you want to do?” It was the same question Crooks’s sister had asked over the phone that morning in 2006, minutes after Trump got onto his elevator and Crooks retreated back to an empty office at Bayrock to call home. “What do you want to do?” her sister had asked, and together they had gone through the options. Report the harassment to building security guards who wore Trump’s name on their uniforms? Tell her managers at Bayrock, where Trump was a key business partner? Confide in Bayrock’s founder, Tevfik Arif, a personal friend of Trump and his wife, Melania? The only thing she could think to do instead of reporting it was go quietly back to her desk for the afternoon and then back to the rental house to tell Hackenburg. Maybe she had done something to encourage Trump, she said. Maybe she wasn’t coming across as smart, serious or professional. “Her self-confidence was absolutely rocked,” Hackenburg said. She went back to Bayrock during the next weeks and tried to duck into the office kitchen whenever she noticed Trump waiting at the elevator. She remembered him smiling at her one day and smiling politely back. She remembered him coming in another day to ask for her phone number, saying he wanted to pass it along to a modeling agency, and because her co-workers were standing nearby and she couldn’t think up an excuse, she gave it to him. Why couldn’t she stand up for herself? What was wrong with her? Why hadn’t she shouted at him, or quit her job, or pushed him away, or bit his lip? She blamed Trump for making her feel powerless. She blamed herself for caving into shame and self-doubt. Ten months after moving to New York, she was on her way back to rural Ohio — the place she had never imagined living, and the place she had remained ever since. Rachel Crooks plays with her dog Carlow at the Tiffin Bark Park. She didn’t think of it as a tragedy. She had gone on to graduate school in Ohio, bought a home close to her family, in the nearby town of Tiffin, and begun a career that allowed to her travel around the world, but she also believed some small part of her had never come back from New York. “It was one of the first real failures or defeats of my life, where the world wasn’t what I hoped it was going to be, and I started to really doubt myself,” she said. For several years she had barely told anybody about Trump, because she assumed nothing would come of her story. Now she had spent 18 months repeating it and proving herself right. “I am not sure I’ve changed one person’s mind,” she said. But what choice did she have, except to let it go silent as if it never happened at all? She didn’t want to retreat anymore from that moment, to cycle back into self-doubt. So she would go on television. She would speak at the news conferences. She would deal with the hate mail. She would run for office. She would repeat her story over and over whenever she was asked, even now, to a few women in Columbus marching alongside her in the snow. “It happened right by the elevators,” she said, beginning the story again, even if she was telling it mostly for herself. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Article: After we finished thirteen miles of hiking, we were tired and our muscles ached as we made our way back to New England. The car ride to the airport followed by a two-hour flight left our legs more worse condition than they were when we first came off the mountain we just climbed. When we heard that two seats in first class on our next flight were available for a bit higher price, we jumped at the opportunity. Our spirits lifted immediately. After all, flying first class was a new experience for us, and we would end our adventure in comfort and style. As we boarded the plane, we noticed that the stewardess was working non-stop to ensure the comfort of the first class passengers. She could not walk by a seat without receiving an order. How much she must love her job! She smiled kindly at each one while attending to their needs. As the stewardess walked by our seats near the end of the flight, I looked at her and said, \\"Thank you and I hope you have a great night.\\" She stopped, bent down, looked at me and said, \\"Excuse me.\\" I repeated my words and she smiled in a rather funny way, almost as if I had asked her a question that she did not know how to answer. After a few moments she returned to our seats. \\"I can tell you work with the public,\\" she said. \\"Why do you think so?\\" I asked. She answered very quietly, \\"Because you are the only passenger here to say something nice to me tonight and I really appreciate your kindness.\\" The sense of belonging to the elite group of people in first class disappeared as we heard her words.

The picture is so full of cross-references, self-mockery and movies within movies (including a stalking that's recorded on video) that it can't help turning into a precious two-hour in-joke. 5. The movie's only wrinkle is that it is, in a crude fashion, post-modernist. Pardon me while I alert the media. 6. By the time Scream arrives at its final twist, Craven has done too many contortions of his own to give the finale much shock value. 7. The movie contains the usual stock horror characters, but they are supplied with dialogue, often surprisingly smart and funny, that serves as a running, biting commentary on slasher conventions. 8. Remains a highly polished piece of meta-slasher mayhem. 9. Scream may be a cut above the gore fests that line the dimly lit back wall at your video store, but it is a far cry from genre classics like Halloween or Craven's own Nightmare On Elm Street. 10. It is a fright film that takes elements from classics that evoked the screamin' meemies and reinvents melodramatic applications offering a new spin to slice-and-dice antics.

Scherer was personally awarded the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves by Adolf Hitler for the command of the defense of Kholm .","completion":"Yes, both sentences have the same meaning. Here's the step-by-step breakdown and justification of the changes made in the original sentence to obtain the second sentence: 1. In the first sentence, \\"For Kholm's command of the defense,\\" is moved to the end of the sentence to become \\"for the command of the defense of Kholm.\\" This rearrangement maintains the meaning, which indicates that Scherer was awarded for commanding the defense of Kholm. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Scherer was personally awarded\\" is moved to the beginning of the sentence. This change keeps the focus on Scherer as the main subject who received the award. 3. The phrases \\"knight's cross of the Iron Cross with oak foliage\\" and \\"Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves\\" mean the same thing. The capitalization of \\"Knight's Cross\\" and \\"Oak Leaves\\" does not change the meaning. The difference in wording between \\"oak foliage\\" and \\"Oak Leaves\\" is just a synonym for the same decorative element of the award.

We have a little letter friend named \\"i\\" and we are trying to find out how many candies \\"i\\" has. Here's the problem: -91 * i = 57 * i - 29 * i + 2380 1. First, let's count how many candies \\"i\\" gets from others. We have 57 * i from one friend and -29 * i from another. So, let's add them together: 57 * i - 29 * i = (57 - 29) * i = 28 * i Now our problem looks like this: -91 * i = 28 * i + 2380 2. Next, let's help \\"i\\" by adding 91 * i to both sides of the equation. This will cancel out the -91 * i on the left side: -91 * i + 91 * i = 28 * i + 91 * i + 2380 0 = 119 * i + 2380 3. Now, we have 119 * i + 2380. We want to find out how many candies \\"i\\" has, so we need to remove 2380 from the total. To do that, we'll subtract 2380 from both sides: 119 * i + 2380 - 2380 = 0 - 2380 119 * i = -2380 4. Lastly, we want to find out how many candies \\"i\\" has, so we need to divide both sides by 119: 119 * i / 119 = -2380 / 119 i = -20 So, our little letter friend \\"i\\" has -20 candies, which means \\"i\\" actually owes someone 20 candies!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Connecting the pipes using fittings like T-joints and elbow joints will ensure the frame is secure and rigid. 4. Attach the tarp: The tarp serves as the screen material and should be carefully attached to the frame. The tarp should be stretched tightly across the frame and secured with clips or bungee cords to prevent any wrinkles or sagging, which could affect the projection quality.

Differentiation is a method that helps you figure out how fast things are changing, like the speed of your toy car. Now, let's talk about when to use differentiation. We use differentiation when we want to know how things change, like when your toy car speeds up or slows down, or when you're squeezing playdough and it changes shape. Now, let's discuss the second question about the differential. The differential is just a small piece of the whole process of differentiation. It's like a tiny step you take to see how much something changes. For example, think of two markers, one in red and one in blue, close to each other on the floor. The differential is the small space between them that helps you see how far apart they are.

Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Egypt, circa 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep engages in an affair with Anck-su-Namun, the mistress of Pharaoh Seti, despite strict rules that other men are forbidden to touch her. When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors. The soldiers are massacred and O'Connell makes a final retreat inside the city, only to be cornered by a group of Medjai. However, they flee when Imhotep's evil presence manifests itself, leaving him to die in the desert.In 1926, Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, Evelyn Carnahan is presented with an intricate box and map by her bumbling brother Jonathan, who says he found it in Thebes.

Texas home builder Dan Phillips transforms trash into artful treasures, creating beautiful floors with wood pieces, kitchen counters from ivory -colored bones and roofs out of license plates . The fantastic houses which spring from his imagination are made almost entirely of materials which would otherwise have ended up in a garbage area. \\" People have been doing this for hundreds of thousands of years; using whatever is available to build shelter, \\" Phillips said.\\"If you think about carefully what could be used, then building materials are everywhere. The thirteen homes he has built so far would fit better in an art museum than the residential streets of Huntsville, a conservative town of about 35 ,000 people.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Uhuru is the son of Jomo Kenyatta, Kenya's founding father and first president of the republic of Kenya (in office 1964-1978), with his fourth wife, Mama Ngina Kenyatta. His family hails from the Kikuyu, a Bantu ethnic group. His given name \\"Uhuru\\" is from the Swahili term for \\"freedom\\", and was given to him in anticipation of Kenya's upcoming independence. Uhuru attended St Mary's School in Nairobi. On 20 May 2012, Uhuru Kenyatta attended the elaborately assembled and much-publicised launch of The National Alliance party in a modern high-tech dome at the Kenyatta International Conference Centre. His presence at the TNA launch was a strong indication that he would contest for the party's presidential nomination ticket in his quest for the presidency in the 2013 General Elections. The Justice and Constitutional Affairs Minister Eugene Wamalwa and Eldoret North Constituency MP William Ruto led more than 70 MPs in attending the function. The Speaker of the East African Legislative Assembly, Abdi Ramadhan, Cabinet Ministers Mohamed Yusuf Haji, Jamleck Irungu Kamau, Dr. Naomi Shaaban, Samuel Poghisio, Professor Sam Ongeri and Dr. Mohammed Kuti and MPs Charles Cheruiyot Keter, Aden Bare Duale and Mohamed Maalim Mohamud also attended the event. Speeches at the launch revolved around the need for a thriving economy, the need for the rights of people of all classes in society to be championed, the need for peaceful co-existence, the need for visionary and committed leadership, the need for transformative leadership, the need for a youthful crop of committed professionals in leadership, the need for free and fair nomination and election processes in the General Election, the need for an economically empowered youth and a call to bring an end to divisive and sectarian interests in politics to safeguard Kenya from sliding to dictatorship.

Several people seem to vanish into thin air, leaving only a faint scent of danger in the air. As the police frantically search for answers, a local underground journalist named Alice stumbles upon an enigmatic figure who goes by the name of Luther. Luther, a once well-respected engineer and researcher, emerges from the city's vast network of sewers, tormented by his past. Haunted by a series of unfortunate events, Luther had found solace in the cold darkness of the underground tunnels, away from the unforgiving society that cast him out. As Alice investigates Luther's past, she discovers that he had been working on a top-secret government project – a project that could have catastrophic ramifications for the entire city. This diabolical invention, buried deep within the sewers, holds the key to the sudden string of disappearances that has gripped the city. Their encounter puts Luther and Alice into a reluctant alliance, as they strive to right the wrongs of Luther's past, while unraveling the mystery of the missing people. As they venture deeper into the labyrinth of the underworld, they must confront dangerous thugs, toxic surroundings, and the nauseating truth of human greed and corruption. As the stakes grow increasingly higher, Luther grapples with his inner demons and finds redemption in the most unexpected of places – his genius talent for engineering and inventive mind come to their aid in the darkest of moments. The duo must gather the courage to surface the truth and expose the powerful menace that lurks in the sewers before it can consume the city and all its inhabitants. In a thrilling climax, Luther and Alice confront the mastermind behind the evil project and destroy the sinister machine, leading to their triumph and the rescue of the city's missing people. The film culminates in the redemption of Luther, as his once tarnished reputation is resurrected, and he becomes the protector of the vulnerable city.

Summarize this article: Card counters are notorious for playing blackjack for hours and hours, often without eating or enjoying the amenities available at the resort. Acting like a tourist just looking for a simple good time may take the suspicion off of you. You want to blend in. Busting out your three-piece Armani suit is not what you want to do when starting your card counting career at your local casino. Leave the Italian suede at home and act like a regular Joe. Dealers are trained to shuffle the deck upon an unexplainable increase in the bet. For this reason, only up your bet in small increments and at seemingly random points in the game. This may seem counter to making money, but if you get thrown out, you'll be making zero. No, card counting isn't illegal, but it is heavily frowned upon and you can be asked to never return. This is why we had you practicing with the TV, radio, and several messy, loud-mouthed children. If you are so busy counting your lips are practically moving, it's a dead giveaway. Go ahead, get a drink, make small talk. Enjoy yourself. Counters have a reputation for being \\"zoned in\\" to the game. He will remain fixated on their cards while everyone else is looking at a gorgeous woman. Don't be that guy. You need to be proficient enough at counting that you can carry on a conversation. Chat with the dealer about how their day is going. If the pit boss comes up, chat with him, too. Many dealers know how to count cards. A dealer that likes you will be more likely to wait before shuffling on a favorable deck and shuffle sooner on a bad one. A dealer can help you or hurt you. Motivate the dealer to be for you. Same goes for the entire pit crew -- get them on your side, your not-so-heinous crime may slide under their radar. At any time, there are hundreds of cameras going on in the casino in addition to the eyes of the dealers, those in the pit (behind the tables), and the security staff. If they'll catch a waitress for serving a customer every 18.37 minutes, they'll definitely have the attention span to monitor you. Because of this, it's very important to be on your best behavior. If a casino suspects you're counting, they probably won't come right out and say it. They may have someone start a conversation with you to distract you, assign you a high-speed dealer, shuffle spontaneously or change the betting rules. If any of these happen, back down slowly, but immediately. When you hit a table, stay there for a spell. Why would you leave? And when you make your moves at this table, take a second to think about it. Normal blackjack players haven't spent the past three months staring at this exact set up in black and white. Everything you do needs to be nonchalant and casual. Do not jump from table to table every time the deck sours. This will bring you to the attention of the casino personnel fast. Make minimum bets until the deck is richer. Increase casually because you're doing well -- not because you know what's about to come.","completion":"Card counters often spend long hours at blackjack tables, often foregoing eating or enjoying other amenities of the resort. To avoid suspicion, it's advised to act like an ordinary tourist, avoiding flashy clothing and making small, random bets. Increasing unusually can cause the dealer to shuffle the deck and affect the game. While card counting is not illegal, it is widely disapproved and can result in being asked to never return to the casino. Therefore, it's important to not become overly engrossed in counting, instead maintaining a casual demeanor and engaging in conversations with the dealer and pit boss. Many dealers know how to count cards and if they're friendly with you, they might delay shuffling on a favorable deck. Casinos are full of surveillance and keen staff, so any suspicious behavior could be noted. If casinos suspect you're counting, they might try to divert your attention or change rules. If this happens, retreat carefully. It's recommended to stay at one table and keep your demeanor and betting casual, as frequent table changes could be attention-grabbing."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

David Monroe Shoup (30 December 1904 - 13 January 1983) was a decorated general of the United States Marine Corps who was awarded the Medal of Honor in World War II, became the 22nd Commandant of the Marine Corps, and, after retiring, became one of the most prominent critics of the Vietnam War. Born in Indiana to an impoverished family, Shoup joined the military for financial reasons. Rising through the ranks in the interwar era, he was twice deployed to China during the Chinese Civil War. He served in Iceland at the beginning of U.S. involvement in World War II, and as a staff officer during the Pacific War. In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience. The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor. For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there. Was their plan successful?","completion":"Yes, their plan was successful. David Monroe Shoup and his fellow Marines faced heavy resistance on the beaches of Tarawa, but they were able to rally and push inland. With Shoup's strong leadership, they kept launching aggressive attacks against the Japanese defenders. By the second day of the attack, the American troops were winning the battle, and more reinforcements arrived to help them. Eventually, they secured Tarawa, which was an important victory during World War II.

Movie title: Terminator Salvation Movie plot: In 2003, Dr. Serena Kogan (Helena Bonham Carter) of Cyberdyne Systems convinces death row inmate Marcus Wright (Sam Worthington) to sign his body over for medical research following his execution by lethal injection. One year later, the Skynet system is activated, perceives humans as a threat to its own existence, and eradicates much of humanity in the event known as Judgment Day (see Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines). In 2018, John Connor (Christian Bale) leads an attack by the Resistance on a Skynet base. John discovers human prisoners and the plans for the development of a new type of Terminator incorporating living tissue, but is the only apparent survivor of the attack after the base is destroyed in a small nuclear explosion. However, Marcus emerges from the wreckage of the base and proceeds on foot to Los Angeles.John returns to Resistance headquarters located aboard a nuclear submarine and tells General Ashdown (Michael Ironside), the current leader, of his discovery. Meanwhile, the Resistance has discovered a radio frequency capable of shutting down Skynet machines. They plan to launch an offensive against the Skynet base in San Francisco in four days, in response to an intercepted \\"kill list\\" indicating that Skynet plans to kill the Resistance's command staff in four days' time. John learns that his own name is second on the list, following Kyle Reese. The Resistance leaders are unaware of Kyle's importance to Skynet, but John knows that it is because Kyle will later become his father (see The Terminator). John meets with his officer Barnes (Common) and wife Kate (Bryce Dallas Howard) and sends radio broadcasts to Resistance members and surviving civilians around the world.Arriving in the ruins of Los Angeles, Marcus is saved from a T-600 Terminator by Kyle Reese (Anton Yelchin) and his mute companion Star (Jadagrace Berry). Kyle relates to Marcus the events of Judgment Day and the ensuing war between humans and machines. Hearing John's radio broadcast, the three leave Los Angeles in search of the... Answer:","completion":"In the sci-fi action film \\"Terminator Salvation\\", it is Dr. Serena Kogan who convinces Marcus Wright to sign over his body for medical research. The character of Dr. Kogan is portrayed by actress Helena Bonham Carter, while Marcus Wright is played by Sam Worthington. The film, which is set predominantly in the year 2018, sheds light upon Marcus Wright's backstory through a series of flashbacks to the year 2003. At this time, Wright is seen as an inmate on death row, awaiting execution by lethal injection for his crimes. It is here when he is visited by Dr. Serena Kogan, a representative of Cyberdyne Systems, a high-tech corporation. Dr. Kogan is shown to be terminally ill, dreadfully seeking a cure or way to prolong her life. She presents Wright with a prospect that promises him a chance to ensure his life would still hold some meaning after his execution. In the deal, despite his death, his physique would contribute to the advancement of medical research and potentially assist in improving or saving lives in the future. Being convinced by Dr. Kogan's heartfelt appeal and the perspective of redemption, Marcus consents to sign his body over for research. Unbeknownst to him, this decision ultimately results in his consciousness being implanted into a Terminator, and he becomes a linchpin in Cyberdyne's development of Skynet, an artificial intelligence system that perceives humanity as a threat leading to a catastrophic event known as Judgment Day. In the grand scheme of the film's narrative, Marcus plays a major role in the following events, including saving the life of Kyle Reese, who is significant to the survival of John Conner, the leader of the Resistance against Skynet. Despite having been manipulated into becoming a pawn for Cyberdyne Systems, Marcus retains his humanity and fights for the cause of the Resistance, underlining the moral complexities of identity and the human spirit. This is just a portion of the intricate plot within \\"Terminator Salvation\\", where each character's motivations, actions, and fate are interwoven into a thrilling narrative about survival, redemption, and the thin line between man and machine. If the film proposal you're considering contains such complex character arcs, a well-built plot, and evokes philosophic contemplations along with high-paced action scenes, it is definitely worth considering for investment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This courageous act not only highlights the importance of vigilance in ensuring the safety of premises, but also demonstrates the ways in which a company slogan can be turned into a powerful statement in a high-pressure situation. The Incident It was a day just like any other when the unsuspecting employee encountered the event that would forever change their life. As they went about their regular duties, a masked individual entered the establishment, brandishing a weapon and demanding cash from the premises. Faced with a situation like nothing they had ever experienced before, the employee knew they had to think quickly and remain calm to protect themselves, their colleagues, and the customers present in the store. As their mind raced through possible courses of action, inspiration struck from an unlikely source. The Power of a Slogan \\"Go run on Dunkin!\\" This phrase, made famous by the popular international coffee and doughnut company Dunkin' Donuts, has been used to promote the idea that their products can provide the fuel to keep people going throughout their busy lives. In that moment, the employee seized the opportunity to use this familiar slogan in a powerful statement of defiance against the would-be robber. With a confident smile, the employee repeated the phrase, \\"Go run on Dunkin'!\\" as they continued to stand their ground. The Effect Taken aback by the boldness of this impassioned declaration, the robber found themselves unsure of how to proceed. Whether it was the familiarity of the slogan or the employee's unwavering courage that threw them off, the cracking of their confidence was evident. As they hesitated and glanced around nervously, it became clear that the power dynamics in the room had shifted dramatically. With the help of their coworkers, the employee was able to use the momentum of their bold action to dissuade the would-be thief from committing the crime. Recognizing that they had lost their advantage, the robber began to retreat, but not without the employee issuing one last reminder to, \\"Go run on Dunkin'!\\" The Aftermath and the Importance of Preparedness In the aftermath of this harrowing incident, the employee has been hailed as a hero for their quick thinking and courage under pressure. Their actions have encouraged other businesses and individuals to educate themselves on appropriate safety procedures and responses to such situations. Though it may not always be advisable to engage an assailant directly, the importance of remaining calm and actively assessing the situation in order to make the best decision cannot be understated. The story of the employee who used the words \\"Go run on Dunkin'\\" to foil a robbery attempt serves as a reminder that, with the right attitude, even the most challenging situations can be overcome. Whether it's a company slogan or personal motto, the power of words, paired with determination and courage, can make all the difference in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church is inside the article: During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

Single/multi-select question: If \\"A man in black taking his leashed cat on a walk.\\", can we conclude \\"A man walking his pet.\\"? Choose from: 1). yes; 2). it is not possible to tell; 3). no;","completion":"1). Yes. In the given statement, \\"A man in black taking his leashed cat on a walk,\\" there are a few key pieces of information that will help us make our conclusion. First, let's consider the subject of the statement: \\"A man in black.\\" Although the color of his clothes does not necessarily matter, this part of the statement does clarify that there is a man in the scenario. Next, we need to analyze the action that the man is performing: \\"taking his leashed cat on a walk.\\" Here, we can determine that the man is engaging in an activity where he is walking and is accompanied by his cat, which is leashed. There is a clear indication that the man is taking the cat for a walk, and that the cat is a pet under his care. Given these descriptions, it is reasonable to conclude that the scenario depicted can be simplified to \\"A man walking his pet.\\" This is because the man is walking and is also in the company of a leashed animal (the cat), which is, in this case, his pet. The cat does not lose its status as a pet just because it is not a typical choice of an animal companion for walking. Therefore, we can choose option 1).

Given the question: Information: - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west.

Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica. Havana is the largest city and capital; other major cities include Santiago de Cuba and Camagüey. Cuba is the largest island in the Caribbean, with an area of , and the second-most populous after Hispaniola, with over 11 million inhabitants. - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

Help as much as you can. Question: Information: - Terns are seabirds in the family Sternidae that have a worldwide distribution and are normally found near the sea, rivers, or wetlands. Previously considered a subfamily of the gulls, Laridae, they are now usually given full family status and divided into eleven genera. They are slender, lightly built birds with long, forked tails, narrow wings, long bills, and relatively short legs. Most species are pale grey above and white below, with a contrasting black cap to the head, but the marsh terns, the Inca tern, and some noddies have dark plumage for at least part of the year. The sexes are identical in appearance, but young birds are readily distinguishable from adults. Terns have a non-breeding plumage, which usually involves a white forehead and much-reduced black cap. - Genovesa Island , named after the Italian city of Genoa , in honor of Christopher Columbus , ( referred to in English as Tower Island ) is a shield volcano in the Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific Ocean . The island occupies about 14 square kilometres ( 5 sq mi ) , and its maximum elevation is 64 m ( 210 ft ) . The horse - shoe shaped island has a volcanic caldera whose wall has collapsed , forming the Great Darwin Bay , surrounded by cliffs . Lake Arcturus , filled with salt water , lies in the centre , and sediment within this crater lake is less than 6,000 years old . Although no historical eruptions are known from Genovesa , there are very young lava flows on the flanks of the volcano . - A maar is a broad, low-relief volcanic crater caused by a phreatomagmatic eruption (an explosion which occurs when groundwater comes into contact with hot lava or magma). A maar characteristically fills with water to form a relatively shallow crater lake which may also be called a maar. The name comes from a Moselle Franconian dialect word used for the circular lakes of the Daun area of Germany. Maars are shallow, flat-floored craters that scientists interpret as having formed above diatremes as a result of a violent expansion of magmatic gas or steam; deep erosion of a maar presumably would expose a diatreme. Maars range in size from across and from deep; most maars commonly fill with water to form natural lakes. Most maars have low rims composed of a mixture of loose fragments of volcanic rocks and rocks torn from the walls of the diatreme. - The Arctic Ocean is the smallest and shallowest of the world's five major oceans. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) recognizes it as an ocean, although some oceanographers call it the Arctic Mediterranean Sea or simply the Arctic Sea, classifying it a mediterranean sea or an estuary of the Atlantic Ocean. Alternatively, the Arctic Ocean can be seen as the northernmost part of the all-encompassing World Ocean. - Antarctica (US English , UK English or ) is Earth's southernmost continent. It contains the geographic South Pole and is situated in the Antarctic region of the Southern Hemisphere, almost entirely south of the Antarctic Circle, and is surrounded by the Southern Ocean. At , it is the fifth-largest continent. For comparison, Antarctica is nearly twice the size of Australia. About 98% of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages in thickness, which extends to all but the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula. - A sinkhole, also known as a cenote, sink, sink-hole, shakehole, swallet, swallow hole, or doline (the different terms for sinkholes are often used interchangeably), is a depression or hole in the ground caused by some form of collapse of the surface layer. Most are caused by karst processesfor example, the chemical dissolution of carbonate rocks or suffosion processes. Sinkholes vary in size from both in diameter and depth, and vary in form from soil-lined bowls to bedrock-edged chasms. Sinkholes may form gradually or suddenly, and are found worldwide. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Bárðarbunga, Bardarbunga (Anglophone spelling), is a stratovolcano located under Vatnajökull, Iceland's most extensive glacier. The second highest mountain in Iceland, above sea level, Bárðarbunga is also part of a volcanic system that is approximately long and wide. Description. Bárðarbunga is a subglacial stratovolcano located under the ice cap of Vatnajökull glacier within the Vatnajökull National Park in Iceland. It rises to above sea level, making it the second highest mountain in Iceland, about lower than Hvannadalshnjúkur. The caldera is about 80 square kilometres, up to 10 km wide and about deep. The surrounding edges rise up to 1,850 metres but the base is on average close to 1,100 metres. The volcano is covered in ice to a depth of 850m, hiding the glacier-filled crater. The associated volcanic system and fissure swarm is about 190 km long and 25 km wide. - Ecuador, officially the Republic of Ecuador (which literally translates as \\"Republic of the Equator\\"), is a representative democratic republic in northwestern South America, bordered by Colombia on the north, Peru on the east and south, and the Pacific Ocean to the west. Ecuador also includes the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific, about west of the mainland. - A caldera is a large cauldron-like depression that forms following the evacuation of a magma chamber/reservoir. When large volumes of magma are erupted over a short time period, structural support for the crust above the magma chamber is lost. The ground surface then collapses downward into the partially emptied magma chamber, leaving a massive depression at the surface (from one to dozens of kilometers in diameter). Although sometimes described as a crater, the feature is actually a type of sinkhole, as it is formed through subsidence and collapse rather than an explosion or impact. Only seven known caldera-forming collapses have occurred since the start of the 20th century, most recently at Bárðarbunga volcano in Iceland. - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - The Galápagos Islands (official name: \\"Archipiélago de Colón\\", other Spanish name: \\"Islas Galápagos\\") are an archipelago of volcanic islands distributed on either side of the Equator in the Pacific Ocean surrounding the centre of the Western Hemisphere, west of continental Ecuador, of which they are a part. The islands are known for their vast number of endemic species and were studied by Charles Darwin during the voyage of the \\"Beagle\\", as his observations and collections contributed to the inception of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. - The Americas, also collectively called America, encompass the totality of the continents of North America and South America. Together they make up most of Earth's western hemisphere and comprise the \\"New World\\". - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - A crater lake is a lake that forms in a volcanic crater or caldera, such as a maar; less commonly and with lower association to the term a lake may form in an impact crater caused by a meteorite, or in an artificial explosion caused by humans. Sometimes lakes which form inside calderas are called caldera lakes, but often this distinction is not made. Crater lakes covering active (fumarolic) volcanic vents are sometimes known as volcanic lakes, and the water within them is often acidic, saturated with volcanic gases, and cloudy with a strong greenish color. For example, the crater lake of Kawah Ijen in Indonesia has a pH of under 0.5. Lakes located in dormant or extinct volcanoes tend to have fresh water, and the water clarity in such lakes can be exceptional due to the lack of inflowing streams and sediment. - The Arctic (or ) is a polar region located at the northernmost part of Earth. The Arctic consists of the Arctic Ocean, adjacent seas, and parts of Alaska (United States), Canada, Finland, Greenland (Denmark), Iceland, Norway, Russia, and Sweden. Land within the Arctic region has seasonally varying snow and ice cover, with predominantly treeless permafrost-containing tundra. Arctic seas contain seasonal sea ice in many places. - The Antarctic (US English , UK English or and or ) is a polar region, specifically the region around the Earth's South Pole, opposite the Arctic region around the North Pole. The Antarctic comprises in the strict sense the continent of Antarctica and the island territories located on the Antarctic Plate. In a broader sense the Antarctic region include the ice shelves, waters, and island territories in the Southern Ocean situated south of the Antarctic Convergence, a zone approximately wide varying in latitude seasonally. The region covers some 20% of the Southern Hemisphere, of which 5.5% (14 million km) is the surface area of the Antarctic continent itself. All of the land and ice shelves south of 60°S latitude are administrated under the Antarctic Treaty System. In a biogeographic sense, the Antarctic ecozone is one of eight ecozones of the Earth's land surface. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The Southern Ocean, also known as the Antarctic Ocean or the Austral Ocean, comprises the southernmost waters of the World Ocean, generally taken to be south of 60° S latitude and encircling Antarctica. As such, it is regarded as the fourth-largest of the five principal oceanic divisions: smaller than the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans but larger than the Arctic Ocean. This ocean zone is where cold, northward flowing waters from the Antarctic mix with warmer subantarctic waters. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.

For example, you could try one of these pranks: Put toothpaste on your friend’s fingers, then tickle their face. You could also use peanut butter or whipped cream. Put shaving cream into his/her shoes. If someone opens their mouth to snore, squirt sour spray! Draw on them with a black (not permanent) marker. Make a silly design on their face or arms. Anything you can access without waking them up. Draw a mustache and a beard. Just make sure it is the kind of marker that will rub off easily. Prank calls are a great way to create hilarious memories with your friends. Just make sure you don’t call anyone that will be offended by your prank call. You should only call people who will appreciate the humor since it’s all in good fun. Try calling someone and asking someone if their refrigerator is running. When they say yes, tell them that they better go catch it! You could also make prank calls using the cell phone of a person who already fell asleep at your sleepover. Just make sure you don’t do anything that could get them in trouble. Pranks that scare someone for a moment can be hilarious. But be careful to keep the joke lighthearted. You want the people that you prank to be able to realize it is a joke right away, rather than being legitimately scared. For example, you could try one of these pranks: Put makeup on your face to make yourself look like an insane clown. Then wake up your friends! Hide in the shower behind the shower curtain and pop out when someone comes in to use the bathroom. Just make sure to do it before they start using the bathroom to avoid any awkwardness. Sometimes people do funny things in their sleep and it can be really funny to record it or to talk about it the next morning. But, even if no one does anything funny in their sleep, you can always pretend they did as another prank! Tell someone they said funny stuff in their sleep.

Three decades later, the local government is pouring funds into the tourism sector. Ancient monuments and museums are being restored, and various copies of Buddhist and Tang heritage are being constructed to help Chinese tourists rediscover their national heritage. One of those ancient monuments is the Big Wild Goose Pagoda-Xi'an's most sacred monument-which was built in 652 by the monk Xuanzang ,who travelled across India for 18 years and returned with a precious collection of Buddhist sacred texts. In 1966,the Red Guards burnt the pagoda's scriptures, silk wall hangings and other relics in a bonfire that raged all night. But that destruction has largely been forgotten as tourists flock to the newly restored pagoda. The only original remainders-the empty shell of the seven-storey pagoda-light up at night, standing out in the city's skyline. Xi'an is also displaying the glories of the ancient Tang Dynasty, with a 165-acre Tang Paradise Theme Park that is visited by flocks of tourist groups. Although every bit of this Tang heritage is recreated, it is artistically pleasing, landscaped with ponds and lakes, classical gardens, bridges, palaces and pavilions. Explore the vast area on a golf cart, hopping on and off to see shortened operas from the Tang Dynasty days, laser shows on the lake, highly structured man-made waterfalls, as well as murals and statues of historical figures ,philosophers and poets.

Write a summary based on this article: * Vote is a boost to right-wing Swiss People's Party * Likely to damage Swiss image By Sam Cage ZURICH, Nov 30 (Reuters) - A Swiss vote to ban the construction of new minarets puts the spotlight on the Alpine country's social and political divisions and could herald a new surge in populist, anti-immigrant sentiment. The unexpected vote and high turnout in Sunday's referendum gives a boost to the right-wing populist Swiss People's Party (SVP), a relatively new political force that has shaken up the country's traditionally cosy power-sharing system. [ID:nGEE5AS05E] \\"It could well be the beginnings of a new right-wing surge,\\" said Clive Church, a Swiss politics expert from Kent University. The SVP, which has grown rapidly since the 1980s to become Switzerland's largest party, has been accused of racism for its strident anti-immigration campaigns, including a poster showing a white sheep kicking black sheep off a Swiss flag. It campaigned against extending the right of European Union citizens to live and work in non-EU member Switzerland, which voters approved in February despite SVP posters of three long-beaked sinister-looking ravens picking at a small map of Switzerland. [ID:nL7312972] The SVP won the largest share of the vote in a 2007 general election but its fortunes have since faded: a faction split off to form another party, at one point it lost all its cabinet seats and it has had little success in referenda. Until now. The SVP poster for Sunday's vote featured a Swiss flag covered in missile-like minarets and the portrait of a woman covered with a black chador and veil, associated with strict Islam, continuing the line of provocative election literature. While Switzerland's Muslim community of some 300,000 is relatively small there is wider concern about immigration in a country where foreigners make up more than a fifth of the total 7.7 million population. Nationwide voter turnout was about 53 percent, higher than a more usual 35 to 45 percent, and 22 of 26 cantons, or provinces, voted in favour of the initiative. The decision went against recent polls, which had indicated a slim majority opposed a ban. There was marked division between urban areas like Zurich and French-speaking areas -- which are traditionally more liberal -- and rural, German speaking cantons like Schaffhausen, where some 70 percent of voters supported the initiative. \\"It represents a two finger gesture against the towns, foreigners, the powerful, the better educated and the like. The pattern of voting confirms that,\\" said Swiss culture and politics expert Jonathan Steinberg of the University of Pennsylvania. IDENTITY CRISIS Switzerland has suffered an identity crisis since the end of the Cold War robbed its neutrality of much meaning, helping fuel the rise of the SVP. Continued... ||||| ZURICH -- Muslim leaders from around the world condemned a vote in Switzerland to ban the construction of minarets in the Alpine country, raising fresh fears of a backlash against Swiss interests around the world. Voters in Switzerland approved a referendum Sunday to ban the building of new minarets on mosques. Nearly 58% of voters, and all but four of the country's 26 cantons, supported the initiative, with support for the ban reaching 70% in some regions. Banning Minarets in Switzerland View Slideshow Urs Flueeler/Associated Press A poster of the conservative initiative was spray-painted with a peace sign and a sticker reading \\"thank you\\" in the village of Amsteg. The European Court of Human Rights could strike down Sunday's vote, which incurred swift condemnation in Switzerland and abroad. More photos and interactive graphics The outcome was a surprise in a country that has had far fewer problems with the integration of its Muslim minority than its European neighbors. As a result, the government braced for a possible backlash against Swiss businesses, even as companies themselves took a low-key response to the outcome, hoping not to stir tension. Political and religious leaders of Muslim countries were quick to condemn the vote. Maskuri Abdillah, head of Indonesia's biggest Muslim group, Nahdlatul Ulama, said the vote reflected \\"a hatred of Swiss people against Muslim communities.\\" Egypt's top cleric, Ali Gomaa, called the referendum an \\"insult\\" to Muslims, while the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, the largest international Muslim group with 57 member states, called the vote a \\"recent example of growing anti-Islamic incitements in Europe by extremist, anti-immigrant, xenophobic, racist, scare-mongering ultraright politicians who reign over common sense, wisdom and universal values.\\" \\"It is a bad answer to a bad question,\\" Babacar Ba, the Geneva ambassador of the Islamic conference told Swiss journalists Monday. \\"I fear that this kind of thing is simply a gift to extremism and intolerance.\\" The Swiss foreign ministry began Monday to try to ease tensions with the Muslim world. Top diplomats in Bern have contacted leaders of Islamic organizations, including the Islamic conference. Swiss diplomats in Muslim countries also have reached out to local foreign ministries to assure governments that the referendum doesn't restrict the right of Muslims in Switzerland to practice their religion. Despite the rhetoric, there were no reports Monday of incidents against Swiss interests. The Swiss government, which waged an aggressive campaign against the initiative, has feared a backlash similar to that suffered by Denmark several years ago after the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet Muhammad, when consumers boycotted Danish goods and protesters attacked Danish embassies in some countries. In the run-up to the Swiss referendum, the government studied the Danish leadership's reaction to that incident to prepare for a possible yes vote. As a result, Swiss diplomats in recent months have worked to calm concerns in Muslim countries about the initiative. On Monday, Swiss companies kept a low profile in the wake of the vote, declining to discuss any possible retaliation while urging the government to work to calm tensions. A number of Swiss companies, such as engineering group ABB Ltd. and food maker Nestlé SA, have large interests in Muslim countries. Nestlé has about 50 factories in the Muslim world and is the world's largest producer of halal food, or food permissible under Islamic law. Nestlé has recently begun expanding its halal business in Europe, to cater to the Continent's growing Muslim population. \\"Nestlé cannot be associated with any form of discrimination,\\" the company said. Switzerland's main employer's association, Economiesuisse, called for the government to \\"limit the potential damage\\" by keeping a dialogue open with Muslim leaders. At a business conference in Zurich, Hans-Ulrich Meister, head of Switzerland for Credit Suisse Group, played down concerns. Clients in the Muslim countries \\"typically are huge investors and very professional,\\" he said. \\"They can differentiate between direct democracy banning minarets and religious freedom, but the political bodies in Switzerland have to explain this.\\" Nonetheless, the government suggested Swiss business could suffer somewhat as a result of the vote. \\"I am assuming our trade relations with other countries will become more difficult,\\" said Justice Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf at a news conference. —Summer Said and Katharina Bart contributed to this article.

My problem was that it didn't come when it was supposed to and then it had to be shipped to my second address. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"Based on the given information, let me analyze the review and provide a detailed explanation of whether it portrays the product in a flattering or unflattering light. The title of the review indicates that it is about a \\"Horror story,\\" which could be interpreted as either a book or the reviewer's experience of the entire purchasing process. However, there are both positive and negative aspects mentioned in the review. Let's first look at the positive aspect: - \\"The book was all that it was supposed to be\\" - This statement suggests that the reviewer is satisfied with the content and quality of the book. It implies that the book met their expectations, possibly regarding its storyline, characters, and the author's writing style. This part of the review casts the product (the book) in a flattering light, as it reflects the reviewer's satisfaction with the product itself. However, there are some negative aspects in the review as well: - The reviewer mentions that the book \\"didn't come when it was supposed to,\\" which indicates that there might have been a delay in the delivery of the product. This can be seen as an unflattering aspect for the product, but it is essential to note that this issue might not necessarily be tied to the product itself. Instead, it could be related to the shipping or delivery service employed. - Additionally, the reviewer states that the book \\"had to be shipped to my second address,\\" again pointing out another issue with the delivery process. Similar to the previous negative aspect, this issue might not directly reflect the product itself but rather the performance of the shipping or handling services utilized. In summary, this review portrays the product in both a flattering and unflattering light. However, it is essential to differentiate between the product and the services provided by external parties. The book, as a product, is depicted in a flattering light, as the reviewer has expressed satisfaction with its content and quality. However, the unflattering references in the review highlight issues related to the shipping and delivery processes rather than the novel itself. Therefore, the unflattering aspects would not tarnish the book's reputation but could negatively impact the customer's overall experience and perception of the seller or the delivery service."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: The coalition is split on the issue, with the Conservatives backing a straight Â£20bn replacement of Trident. The Lib Dems favour a cheaper option, with a study on possible alternatives due to be published in the summer. Labour says it would consider different options for the future if they provided better value for money while retaining for the UK a \\"credible\\" deterrent. Q&A: Trident replacement If it did so it would mean a break with past Labour policy - the then Prime Minister Tony Blair committed the party to a like-for-like replacement in 2006. Trident is a sea-based nuclear weapons system, acquired by the Thatcher government in the early 1980s. It has three parts - submarines, missiles and warheads, and although each component has years of use left, they cannot last indefinitely. The current generation of four submarines would begin to end their working lives some time in the 2020s. In 2007 MPs backed by 409 to 61 for \\"conceptual\\" work to begin on a replacement system, and the go-ahead for the Â£3bn procurement of important items began after the 2010 election. But the coalition government also decided to delay the ultimate decision on whether to proceed and how many submarines to order until 2016, after the expected date of the next election. The Financial Times quotes one of Labour leader Ed Miliband's advisers as saying: \\"We just want to put it in the bag of money saving measures we are advocating to show we are serious about deficit reductions.\\" A Labour spokesman told the BBC that the party would look at the outcome of the government's report on possible alternatives to Trident before reaching a decision. He said the party remained \\"committed to retaining an independent nuclear deterrent\\" but would be looking at \\"value for money\\" if the report does come up with a viable alternative. Possible alternatives include ending the requirement to have nuclear weapons on submarines at sea round-the-clock, or using different submarines and cruise missiles.","completion":"So, there are three big teams called Conservatives, Lib Dems, and Labour. They are trying to decide what to do with a big, important thing called Trident, which is a tool that helps protect the UK. The Conservatives want to spend a lot of money to fix it.

Born into a loving family, they lead different lives but share an unbreakable bond. Lucy, the elder, is pragmatic, ambitious, and a successful lawyer with a firm in Manhattan, while Mina is a free-spirited, artistic soul with dreams of becoming a renowned painter. The movie opens on a regular day in the girls' lives, teasing their unique personalities and different worlds. However, their lives take an unexpectedly dramatic turn when their father, with whom they are very close, suddenly falls ill. With their mother having passed away several years earlier, the tragedy brings the sisters closer. Mina, hoping to alleviate her father's depression, starts to paint a family portrait, something their mother always wanted. Throughout the process, Lucy and Mina reminisce about their childhood while addressing the tensions stemming from their divergent lifestyles and choices. Gradually, as their father's health deteriorates, secrets start to unravel. An old scandal concerning their mother, their father, and a mysterious stranger surfaces, which leaves the sisters in shock. Lucy, equipped with her legal skills, attempts to uncover the truth behind these hidden snippets of their family history. Mina, meanwhile, deals with the revelations by adding elements to the painting, making it darker and more complex, mirroring the reality they face. Mina's artwork begins to garner attention, including from a renowned art critic who senses the raw emotions behind her work. As she gets swept into the world of fame, Lucy starts to feel left behind, sparking tension. The conflict between them escalates, leading to a big blow-up where they hurt each other with truths that have long been unsaid. While the sisters drift apart, their father's condition worsens. This makes Lucy and Mina realize the frailty of life and the importance of their bond. They reconcile, and together, confront their family's past, uncovering a truth more profound than they had imagined—one that permanently changes their understanding of their parents and each other. The movie ends with their father’s demise, leaving behind a tight-knit pair of sisters who come to terms with their past, pursue their dreams, and hold onto the bond they share. Mina's painting becomes a tribute to their father, symbolizing their journey, and is showcased in a prestigious gallery in New York City. Together, they realise the importance of family, the power of the truth, and how deeply a bond can be tested but still remain unbroken.

Her mother raised her, her brother Eevin, and her sister Nayrok alone after separating from their father, William Wright Jr. To provide for her family, the children's maternal and paternal grandmothers often helped look after them. Badu had her first taste of show business at the age of four, singing and dancing at the Dallas Theater Center and The Black Academy of Arts and Letters (TBAAL) under the guidance of her godmother, Gwen Hargrove, and uncle TBAAL founder Curtis King. In May 2013, Badu announced she was writing her next project, but not placing a time constraint on it. In July 2014, Badu revealed she was still working on the album and had been recording in April in Africa where she was \\"laying down drum tracks\\". Badu also said that prior to her trip to Africa she would have meetings with her record label to set a deadline for the album. Later that year Badu expanded on the album, stating she was working with producer Flying Lotus, who she met via MySpace years ago; they later met in L.A. at guitarist Steve Wilson's house. In 2015 Badu appeared on \\"Rememory\\", a song from Donnie Trumpet & The Social Experiment's album Surf. In July 2015, Badu released a free mixtape of her favorite recordings, describing the set as \\"carefully and lovingly selected high frequency tones for the soul.\\" The mixtape features mostly vintage funk, soul and jazz songs. On March 26, 2015, Erykah Badu performed at The Bomb Factory in her hometown, Dallas, Texas, for the Deep Ellum venue's grand opening. The sold-out show also featured fellow Dallas native, singer-songwriter Sarah Jaffe. In early October, Badu released a remix of Drake's single \\"Hotline Bling\\", and later released a mixtape, But You Caint Use My Phone, on November 27, 2015, making it available for digital download and streaming exclusively through Apple Music. After one week of exclusive release on iTunes, But You Caint Use My Phone was released to other digital retailers and streaming services on December 4, 2015. The mixtape was released without the knowledge of her label Universal, due to Badu sending the record straight to iTunes. It also marked Badu's first release under her own record label, Control Freaq. But You Caint Use My Phone received generally positive reviews from critics and debuted at number 14 on the Billboard 200, selling 35,000 equivalent album units in its first week. Badu also hosted the 2015, 2016 and the 2017 Soul Train Music Awards. Badu held her annual \\"Still Boomin'\\" sold-out birthday bash concert at The Bomb Factory on February 26, 2016, marking her second performance at the venue since its grand opening 11 months earlier.

He said that what made him happy was doing things for others, and that doing so gave him a nice feeling inside. However, no one really believed him, they thought he was silly. He spent all day helping others, dispensing charity to the poorest, and looking after abandoned animals. Very seldom did he ever do anything for himself. One day, he met a famous doctor who thought the boy's case was so peculiar that he decided to investigate him. So, with a complex system of cameras and tubes, the doctor managed to record what was happening inside the boy. What he discovered was surprising. Each time the boy did something good, a thousand tiny angels gathered around the boy's heart and started tickling it. That explained the boy's happiness, but the doctor continued studying until he discovered that we all have our own thousand angels inside us. Unfortunately, he found that, as we do so few good things, the angels spend most of their time wandering about, bored. And so it was that the secret to happiness was discovered.

Whoever wins the polls in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh will, for the next five years, rule a population that's larger than the combined size of Britain, France, Germany and Sweden. The stakes are high and in their desperation to grab the eyeballs of the 222 million plus people, some of India's top politicians are indulging in mudslinging and name calling, some of which are very, well, creative. The BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi compiles a list of bizarre barbs and rants the political leaders are throwing at each other. Earlier this week, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech at an election rally in Fatehpur took a macabre turn when he brought up graveyards and cremation grounds. \\"If land is given for a cemetery in a village, it should also be given for a cremation ground. If there's electricity during Ramadan, it should be supplied during Diwali too. If there's electricity on Holi, it should be there on Eid also. There should be no discrimination,\\" he said. The comment was meant to be a criticism of the state government led by Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav whom Mr Modi has accused of trying to appease the Muslim minority community. But it was played and replayed on television news channels with his political rivals and many commentators accusing the prime minister of trying to divide voters along religious lines. His supporters defended him - they said his speech was misunderstood and all that he was trying to say was that discrimination must end. For those not familiar with the Uttar Pradesh politics, they would be forgiven if they walked into a rally of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and thought they had stumbled into a conference about animals. The elephant has been a recurring theme at his election rallies from day one. The pachyderm is the election symbol of his biggest regional rival, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), led by Dalit icon Mayawati who is a four-time chief minister of the state. During her last term in power from 2002 to 2007, Ms Mayawati spent more than a billion dollars building concrete parks where scores of elephant statues were erected. \\"For seven years, I've been watching these elephants. Those which were sitting, are still sitting. And those which were standing, are still standing,\\" Mr Yadav says at every election rally, pointing out the \\"wasteful expenditure\\". But on Monday, he mentioned a new animal - the donkey. Without naming anyone, he talked about an advertisement by Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan to promote a Wild Ass Sanctuary in Gujarat, the prime minister's home state. \\"I request the century's biggest superstar, please don't do any ad campaigns for Gujarat's gadhas (donkeys),\\" he said. His comments were immediately described as an \\"outrageous dig\\" at PM Modi with many wondering if the public discourse could get any more pungent. Well, on Tuesday, it did - when colourful politician Laloo Yadav called BJP chief Amit Shah a genda (rhinoceros). Post script: He also called PM Modi a eunuch. In this season of name calling, Ms Mayawati, popularly known as Behenji (Hindi for older sister), also has a new name for Mr Modi. An icon to millions of Dalits (formerly untouchables), she said the initials in his name Narendra Damodardas Modi actually stood for \\"Mr Negative Dalit Man\\". \\"I have defined the prime minister's name taking into consideration his work, behaviour and policy,\\" she said. The name game, however, was started by Mr Modi who earlier said that her Bahujan Samaj Party, which loosely translates as \\"party of the majority of people\\", has turned into the Behenji Sampatti Party (Behenji Assets party). Ms Mayawati said Mr Modi was \\"indulging in cheap things and petty talk\\" because he was \\"perturbed by the rising popularity of her party\\". India's Water Resources Minister Uma Bharti, who is campaigning for PM Modi's BJP, recently told a gathering in the backward Bundelkhand region that [Donald] Trump and [Vladimir] Putin were watching the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections. According to a report in The Indian Express Ms Bharti said: \\"Trump and Putin are watching; that if India has to become a great power then UP should not be backward.\\" She also invoked the names of [Karl] Marx and [Vladimir] Lenin while praising the recent government decision to ban high value currency notes to curb corruption. \\"One of the biggest economic revolutions in the world was brought about by Marx and Lenin. But their revolution was a bloody one. The one that PM Narendra Modi has brought through demonetisation is a bloodless economic revolution.\\" Now, Bundelkhand is among the most backward regions in the state and people here are barely literate. No wonder then, as the Express reported, \\"Her references to Marx, Lenin, Trump and Putin left many flummoxed in the crowd\\". And us too.

In 1945, now a sergeant with the unit, Leo becomes an icon across the Soviet Union when he is photographed planting the Soviet flag atop the Reichstag during the Battle of Berlin. He becomes a Hero of the Soviet Union. In 1953, Leo, now married to Raisa and living in Moscow, is a captain in the Ministry of State Security, commanding a unit tasked with tracking down and arresting dissidents. They arrest a veterinarian, Anatoly Brodsky, and during the arrest, one of Leo's subordinates, the cowardly but ambitious Vasili Nikitin, shoots a farmer, Semyon Okun, and his wife in whose barn Brodsky has been hiding, orphaning their two young daughters.

This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Film stock is an analog medium that is used for recording motion pictures or animation. It is a strip or sheet of transparent plastic film base coated on one side with a gelatin emulsion containing microscopically small light-sensitive silver halide crystals. The sizes and other characteristics of the crystals determine the sensitivity, contrast and resolution of the film. The emulsion will gradually darken if left exposed to light, but the process is too slow and incomplete to be of any practical use. Instead, a very short exposure to the image formed by a camera lens is used to produce only a very slight chemical change, proportional to the amount of light absorbed by each crystal. This creates an invisible latent image in the emulsion, which can be chemically developed into a visible photograph. In addition to visible light, all films are sensitive to X-rays and high-energy particles. Most are at least slightly sensitive to invisible ultraviolet (UV) light. Some special-purpose films are sensitive into the infrared (IR) region of the spectrum. - Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying, playback, broadcasting, and display of moving visual media. - A Time Out of War is a 1954 American short war film directed by Denis Sanders.

Because inferior sequels or prequels of larger-budget films may be released direct to video, references to direct-to-video releases are often pejorative. Direct-to-video release has also become profitable for independent filmmakers and smaller companies. - Charles Robert Redford Jr. (born August 18, 1936) is an American actor, director, producer, businessman, environmentalist, and philanthropist.

What is product market fit? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions are related, as they both involve product-market fit, but they are distinct in what they inquire about. Let me explain each question and their relationship. The first question: \\"No product-market fit: change product or market first?\\" This question is asking for advice on which element to modify first when a product is not fitting into the market or, in other words, is not meeting consumer demand. The query is asking for an opinion on whether it is more strategic to adjust the product to better match the market or to choose a different market to target with the product. The implication here is that there might be a mismatch between the product's value proposition and the market's needs or preferences, and changing one of the two elements might solve this issue. Deciding whether to change the product or the market first depends on many factors, such as the competition, the product's strengths or weaknesses, and the potential of other markets. The second question: \\"What is product market fit?\\" This question is asking for a definition of product-market fit. Product-market fit refers to the situation where a product successfully fulfills a large and sustainable demand in its target market. In other words, the product's value proposition appeals to, and resonates with, a sufficient number of consumers or businesses within a particular market. Achieving product-market fit is an essential milestone for startups and businesses, as it signifies that they have found a scalable and profitable business model. In summary, the two questions are connected in that they both address product-market fit, but they are different in focus. While the first question is about the strategies for rectifying an absence of product-market fit (changing product or market), the second question asks for an explanation of the term itself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: A. front door B. residence C. zoo D. restaurant E. barn","completion":"The most logical option in line with common sense for someone to find and see a big cat would be Option C: zoo. A zoo is a facility where various types of wild animals are kept in captivity for visitors to observe and learn about them in a controlled environment. Zoos often have a variety of large cat species such as lions, tigers, leopards, and jaguars, which could satisfy someone's desire to see a big cat up close. Option A, the front door, might occasionally provide a view of domestic cats or small wild cats, but it is highly improbable to find a large cat, such as a lion or tiger, casually wandering outside one's front door. Option B, the residence, is also an unlikely place to find a large cat like a lion or a tiger, unless the individual in question happens to live in an unconventional location like a sanctuary or wildlife reserve, which is not typical. Option D, the restaurant, is not an appropriate setting for encountering large, wild cats. It might be a place for enjoying a meal and socializing, but it is highly unlikely that a big cat would be present in such a location. Option E, the barn, may contain domestic farm animals such as cows, pigs, and goats, but it is also not a fitting place to come across a large cat species like lions or tigers. In conclusion, out of the given options, it would make the most sense for someone to visit a zoo if they wish to see a big cat in a safe and controlled environment.

Context: The formation of the Alps (the Alpine orogeny) was an episodic process that began about 300 million years ago. In the Paleozoic Era the Pangaean supercontinent consisted of a single tectonic plate; it broke into separate plates during the Mesozoic Era and the Tethys sea developed between Laurasia and Gondwana during the Jurassic Period. The Tethys was later squeezed between colliding plates causing the formation of mountain ranges called the Alpide belt, from Gibraltar through the Himalayas to Indonesia—a process that began at the end of the Mesozoic and continues into the present. The formation of the Alps was a segment of this orogenic process, caused by the collision between the African and the Eurasian plates that began in the late Cretaceous Period.

It can be difficult to tell for sure whether or not a cat is feral or simply adventuring away from home. Both lost pet cats and feral cats may behave aggressively toward you or run off out of fear when you approach, so determining that a cat is feral may require subtle cues. Feral cats may appear to be better groomed than a lost pet cat that hasn’t gotten accustomed to living outdoors yet. If you start feeding the cat, pet cats will grow to trust you and behave like a pet whereas feral cats will remain skittish. Feral cats have existed around humans for thousands of years, and often don’t require any assistance from people to survive. These cats are not really homeless, they’re wild animals. Feral cats are not socialized to people, so they cannot be adopted as pets easily. Feral cats often live in social groups called colonies. If you see one, there are likely a number of other feral cats in the area. Feral cats probably do not need your help unless it appears sickly or weak. Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) is a phrase used to describe a common population control method utilized with feral cats. TNR can improve a cat’s health, the health of its colony, and prevent an overpopulation of feral cats that could lead to some cats starving. After a feral cat has been vaccinated and neutered it can be adopted or returned to the area it was trapped. First, contact your local vet or animal shelter. They may offer TNR services for the community free of charge or for a reduced cost. They also may be able to offer assistance and traps. Next, you’ll need to safely Trap a Feral Cat. Negative behaviors associated with mating such as fighting and yowling stop after the cat has been neutered. After treatment the vet will help you determine if the cat should be re-released or put up for adoption. If a feral cat appears to be injured or sick, you may choose to help the cat regain its health. Remember that feral cats are wild animals, so the injury could make it aggressive. Also remember to keep your own health in mind when dealing with feral cats, especially ones that seem ill. Make sure to wash your hands after coming into contact with a feral cat. If the cat appears to simply be malnourished, do not attempt to bring it inside, but consider leaving food and water out for the cat to eat and drink when you aren’t around and it feels more comfortable. If the cat seems seriously ill or injured, do not approach it. Either entice the cat into a carrier or cage with food or place it there gently if it is not moving, then bring the cat to a local animal hospital for treatment. There are many shelters and animal hospitals that will care for stray cats at reduced or no cost. You can also call animal control in your town if you would rather not approach the animal yourself.

(Foto: Omar Torres / Getty Images) México - Juan Francisco Palencia hizo oficial hoy su retiro de las canchas y dijo que es una decisión perfectamente bien planteada y bien pensada y que no hay vuelta atrás. En conferencia de prensa, en el auditorio de las instalaciones del club en La Cantera, el ahora ex jugador explicó que va a estar fuera del país por un tiempo para disfrutar de su familia y que por el momento no tiene pensado estar en el banquillo de algún equipo, sino que quiere preparase de la mejor forma y en un futuro dirigir a Pumas de la UNAM. \\"Quiero descansar un poco, del mucho tiempo que llevo jugando, haciendo cosas para aprender, pues en este momento no estoy preparado para estar en un banquillo, quiero seguirme preparado para eso, pero en este momento no, quizá a futuro que esté más preparado, esa es mi intención\\". Palencia, se mostró sereno a lo largo de la conferencia y solamente estuvo a punto de que le ganara la emoción, en el momento de explicar cómo fue su despedida con el resto de sus ahora ex compañeros. El jugador dijo que se va contento por haber realizado todo lo que un futbolista puede hacer en este deporte, el futbol que le dio tanto y se dijo agradecido con la vida por esta oportunidad de jugar, a la directiva universitaria, a su familia, a sus compañeros y amigos, así como de los medios de información. \\"Me voy contento porque en toda mi carrera, pude realizar lo que todo futbolista puede hacer, conseguir tres títulos, dos de ellos con Pumas, jugar fuera, una Libertadores, un Mundial, una Confederaciones, pero retirarme con Pumas es un privilegio para mí\\". Francisco Palencia explicó que su retiro comenzó a pensarlo en los últimos torneos, cuando el cuerpo y todo su ser le comenzó a decir que ya era momento de dejar el futbol, que tantos privilegios le ha dado. \\"Sé cuando llega el día del retiro, mi corazón, mi cuerpo y mi mente me dictan y vi señales estos últimos torneos que me decían, que ya era hora (tiene 38 años), esa fue la principal razón que me llevó a tomar la decisión\\". \\"Me voy fuera de mi país, no a entrenar ni a ningún club, sino que voy a disfrutar de mi familia, convivir con mis hijos y seguirme preparando, ver entrenamientos de otros equipos de México y el futbol internacional y en futuro prepararme bien como técnico\\".

Cuestionado sobre si aceptaría un partido de homenaje con la Selección Nacional como en su momento se le hizo al guardameta de Santos Laguna, Oswaldo Sánchez, rechazó tal posibilidad, \\"no soy de despedidas, quiero retirarme como lo hice en el último partido contra Xolos, logrando algo en el autorendimiento, no en partidos con homenaje\\". \\"Tampoco me gustaría un juego con la Selección, no me gustan esas cosas, me gusta la competencia, soy competitivo y retirado no voy estar al nivel de la Selección\\". En sus palabras de despedida, Francisco Palencia hizo alusión a Cruz Azul y dijo \\"es como una ex novia que la ves y le dices que te vaya bien, estoy enamorado de Pumas y estoy agradecido con ellos (la directiva), porque es fácil enamorarse de este equipo y tengo mucho que agradecerles\\". En sus primeros años de profesional, Francisco Palencia (archivo), defendió los colores de Cruz Azul, equipo al que dice ver como una exnovia.

Jack Griffith, known as \\"Papa\\" to all, is a family man in a Texas town, but an irresponsibly eccentric one when he has had a drink too many. To impress his six-year-old daughter Corinne, he spends the family's savings to buy his own circus, simply so the little girl can have her own pony. His elder daughter Augusta becomes distraught as her father makes some questionable business deals under the influence of alcohol. This causes strife within the Griffith household and makes her beau's father (the local bank president) forbid his son to associate with the Griffith family.

A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving! I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift.

The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering. It’s a bit ‘planty’, I think it’s the scent of the Rose Geranium that comes through the most, and personally I don’t absolutely love the fragrance, but it’s pleasant enough and it does help the head to feel calmed (even when nursing a husband with man flu!).

If the soil holding the plant is healthy and biologically diverse, the plant will have a higher chance of surviving stressful conditions.The plant responses to stress are dependent on the tissue or organ affected by the stress. For example, transcriptional responses to stress are tissue or cell specific in roots and are quite different depending on the stress involved.One of the primary responses to abiotic stress such as high salinity is the disruption of the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell. High concentrations of Na+, for example, can decrease the capacity for the plant to take up water and also alter enzyme and transporter functions. Evolved adaptations to efficiently restore cellular ion homeostasis has led to a wide variety of stress tolerant plants.Facilitation, or the positive interactions between different species of plants, is an intricate web of association in a natural environment. It is how plants work together. In areas of high stress, the level of facilitation is especially high as well. This could possibly be because the plants need a stronger network to survive in a harsher environment, so their interactions between species, such as cross-pollination or mutualistic actions, become more common to cope with the severity of their habitat.Plants also adapt very differently from one another, even from a plant living in the same area. When a group of different plant species was prompted by a variety of different stress signals, such as drought or cold, each plant responded uniquely. Hardly any of the responses were similar, even though the plants had become accustomed to exactly the same home environment.Rice (Oryza sativa) is a classic example. Rice is a staple food throughout the world, especially in China and India. Rice plants experience different types of abiotic stresses, like drought and high salinity. These stress conditions have a negative impact on rice production. Genetic diversity has been studied...

Mars is called 'the red planet'.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Mars is called 'the red planet' based on its distinct and vivid red color. This reddish hue, which is an unmistakable characteristic of Mars, plays a significant role in earning it this particular moniker. The red color of Mars primarily results from the abundant presence of iron oxide, commonly known as rust, on its surface. The planet's surface is mainly composed of basalt rock, which contains a large percentage of iron. Over billions of years, the iron within these rocks interacted with oxygen and underwent oxidation, creating iron oxide. The iron oxide particles then spread across the surface due to geological and atmospheric processes, giving Mars its widespread reddish appearance. Mars' atmosphere also plays a part in accentuating the planet's red color. While the atmosphere is thin and about 95% carbon dioxide, it contains a significant amount of iron-oxide dust particles. These particles scatter sunlight, further enhancing the red hue that we observe from Earth. The presence of these particles in Mars' atmosphere can also cause planet-wide dust storms, further distributing the iron-oxide and maintaining the planet's red coloration. In addition to its physical appearance, the red color of Mars holds symbolic significance. Throughout history, various ancient civilizations associated Mars with their gods of war, due to its conspicuous red color. For example, the ancient Romans named the planet after their god of war, Mars, believing that the red color represented blood and warfare. The ancient Greeks named the planet Ares, after their own god of war. In summary, Mars is called 'the red planet' due to its characteristic bright red color, which results from the abundance of iron oxide on its surface and in its atmosphere. This reddish hue bears both scientific and historical importance. It serves as an identifier for the planet's unique geological and atmospheric processes and connects Mars to various mythologies and cultural beliefs held by ancient civilizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among the key components of the limbic system are the amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, cingulate cortex, thalamus, and the fornix. Each of these structures plays a unique role in the overall functioning of the limbic system, and their collective contribution makes it a key player in several crucial aspects of human biology and behavior. The limbic system regulates the following primary functions: 1. Emotion: The amygdala is intimately involved in emotional processing and regulation. It interprets sensory information and assigns emotional valence to it, enabling the brain to differentiate between positive and negative stimuli. The amygdala is crucial for generating fear responses and has been linked to the development and mediation of anxiety disorders, phobias, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 2. Memory: The hippocampus is the primary structure responsible for the formation and consolidation of new memories. It plays an essential role in converting short-term memory to long-term memory and helps form spatial memory, which allows an individual to navigate through their environment. Damage to the hippocampus can lead to memory impairments, such as anterograde amnesia, in which new memories cannot be formed. 3. Motivation and Reward: The limbic system is involved in the reward and pleasure circuits of the brain. The hypothalamus and the ventral tegmental area (VTA) release dopamine, a neurotransmitter associated with motivation and pleasure. The release of dopamine in response to rewarding stimuli reinforces behaviors and promotes learning of those actions that lead to positive outcomes. 4. Hormone Regulation: The hypothalamus, a key structure within the limbic system, serves as a critical link between the nervous system and the endocrine system. It synthesizes and releases various hormones which regulate essential functions such as growth, metabolism, stress response, sleep-wake cycles, and reproductive processes. The hypothalamus also generates the releasing and inhibiting hormones that govern the pituitary gland's production and release of other hormones. 5. Arousal and Attention: The thalamus, another component of the limbic system, relays sensory information from the body to the cerebral cortex. The thalamus also contributes to an individual's level of arousal and attention via its interaction with the reticular activating system, which regulates wakefulness and consciousness. 6. Social behavior: The cingulate cortex is involved in various aspects of social cognition and behavior. This area has been implicated in processes such as empathy, moral decision-making, and the experience of social pain (e.g., feeling rejected or excluded). Dysfunction within the cingulate cortex has been associated with certain mental health disorders, including depression and schizophrenia. 7. Homeostasis: The limbic system serves as a central regulatory structure for maintaining the body's internal state and responding to internal and external environmental changes. This includes integration of autonomic and endocrine responses, regulating body temperature, blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and energy balance. In conclusion, the limbic system regulates a myriad of essential functions related to emotion, behavior, motivation, memory, and homeostasis. With its integral role in human biology and behavior, understanding the limbic system and its components advances our understanding of mental health disorders and cognitive decline, providing potential targets for therapeutic interventions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft.

Answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where did Page, Fatt, and Cook do their last performance together at?, using the article: In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook. Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children. According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\". Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group. Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter. Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed. Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce. The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Patti Page, the top-selling female artist of the 1950s with more than 100 million records sold, died on January 2nd, 2013, when she was 85. She was one of the most beloved singers of the post-war era. Take her \\"Tennessee Waltz\\" for example, it sold more than 10 million copies and was her biggest hit . Born in Claremore, Oklahoma, a small town near Tulsa, Page once dreamed of a career in commercial art. Her first job in the art department at a local radio station soon led to her performing 15-minute program on her own. At age 20, Page was discovered by big-band leader Jack Rael, who gave up his job to become her manager. The next year, she signed her first recording contract with Mercury Records and enjoyed her first hit record soon. She stayed with Mercury for the next 14 years and recorded hit after hit including: \\"With My Eyes Wide Open, I'm Dreaming\\" and \\"Old Cape Cod\\". Her last hit was \\"Hush... Hush, Sweet Charlotte\\" , recorded for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. And then, there was \\"Doggie in the Window\\". The creative tune was a huge hit, but with its repeated barking sounds and silly lyrics , the song has been used by many people as an example of all that was wrong with pop music in the early 1950s. Throughout the 1950s, Patti Page made regular appearances on a variety of television shows and in 1957 she was chosen to host the musical program \\"The Big Record\\". The following year, Page appeared in her own CBS television series \\"The Patti Page Show\\". She continued to record and perform into the 21st century, most recently releasing an album of songs for children, a Christmas record, and a new \\"best of\\" collection.

The two presented scenarios in the question - \\"A group of people pulling on a rope\\" and \\"People are eating at a restaurant\\" - are unrelated and convey different situations. Thus, it is not possible to conclude that a group of people is pulling on a rope if people are eating at a restaurant. The first scenario talks a group of people who are engaged in an activity that requires physical effort, such as a tug of war or some team-building exercise. This situation usually occurs in recreational, competitive, or training environments. It can involve teams or individuals competing against each other or working together to achieve a common goal. The second scenario, on the other hand, describes a typical situation at a restaurant where individuals or groups are having a meal. In this context, people are focused on eating and socializing rather than participating in a physical activity like pulling on a rope. There is no direct connection between these two situations, and one cannot be inferred or deduced from the other. The statement 'People are eating at a restaurant' does not provide any information about whether or not a group of people is simultaneously pulling on a rope.

Answer the following question: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court.

A:","completion":"The sense of smell has a significant impact on various aspects of an animal's life, including mate selection, reproduction, growth, habitat awareness, survival, movement, hormonal changes, and certain traits. However, if we consider the most overarching aspect that encompasses a majority of these elements, the best answer would be survival. The sense of smell is of paramount importance for an animal's survival, as it enables them to recognize and respond to key stimuli in their environment, such as detecting food sources and potential predators. It also plays an essential role in finding and selecting a suitable mate, which is directly linked to successful reproduction. Moreover, an excellent sense of smell helps animals perceive subtle changes in their habitat, giving them critical insights into resource availability, competition, and natural disasters. This ability ultimately allows them to make informed decisions about movement patterns and habitat changes. Hormonal changes and growth are also linked to an animal's sense of smell; many animal species rely on olfactory cues to initiate mating or territorial behavior, often driven by hormonal triggers. Additionally, the sense of smell provides young animals with the innate knowledge necessary for their growth and development, learning predatory, social, and foraging behaviors from their parents or group members. Certain traits linked to an animal's sense of smell can also increase their survival chances. For instance, animals with better olfactory skills may have a competitive edge over others, providing them with improved foraging abilities, predator avoidance, and mating success. In conclusion, while the sense of smell impacts several aspects of an animal's life, the most crucial and all-encompassing answer is survival. An enhanced sense of smell aids in detecting food, predators, mates, and other ecological signals, ultimately determining the overall success – in terms of fertility, adaptability, and population persistence – of a species. As such, the sense of smell is of utmost importance for the survival of animals, allowing them to thrive amidst a complex and constantly changing environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an email with the subject line \\"Reduction of OOM?\\".","completion":"Subject: Reduction of OOM? - Strategies and Solutions for Minimizing Out-of-Memory Issues Dear [Recipient's Name], I hope this email finds you well. I am reaching out to discuss the recent concerns about the out-of-memory (OOM) issues our team has been encountering. The purpose of this email is to highlight the possible causes of these problems and recommend a set of strategies to help us prevent these issues from recurring. Firstly, please allow me to clarify some misconceptions about OOM errors. The term \\"out-of-memory\\" is somewhat of a misnomer, as it implies that insufficient memory exists on the system. However, this is not always the case. The underlying issue is frequently attributed to the mismanagement of available memory by applications and processes. With that in mind, I have delineated below some of the common causes of OOM errors and suggested measures that our team can take to reduce and eventually eliminate them: 1. Memory leaks: When our software fails to release memory that is no longer in use, the memory is gradually consumed until the system reaches a critical point. To avoid memory leaks, it is essential to develop thorough testing procedures, perform regular updates and patches, and adopt continuous monitoring tools. 2. Inefficient algorithms: When processes demand a disproportionately large amount of memory, they can contribute to OOM errors. By profiling our applications to recognize memory bottlenecks and implementing more efficient algorithms, we can effectively reduce memory consumption and improve application performance. 3. Inadequate memory allotment: Allocating too little memory to applications can also lead to OOM issues. It is crucial to review our current allocation schemes and make necessary modifications so that applications have an appropriate amount of memory to run smoothly. 4. Garbage collection: Java-based applications utilize garbage collection (GC) as a mechanism to manage and free memory occupied by unused objects. If GC becomes overwhelmed and is unable to keep up with memory demands, OOM errors can occur. Investigate various garbage collection algorithms and runtime configurations to optimize GC performance and minimize the likelihood of OOM errors. 5. Hardware upgrades: Sometimes, there is simply not enough memory available for a system to operate efficiently. In this case, investing in memory upgrades for our systems could help improve performance and prevent OOM issues. Analyze our current hardware usage and determine whether an upgrade might be an appropriate solution. By implementing these strategies, I believe we can successfully reduce the occurrence of OOM errors, improve system performance, and maintain customer satisfaction. To move forward, I propose that we schedule a meeting with the team to discuss this issue and establish an action plan. Please let me know your thoughts on this matter and suggest a suitable date and time for the meeting. I look forward to addressing this challenge collaboratively and finding the right solutions for our team.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: When you get a regular checkup, the nurse will almost always take your blood pressure before the doctor comes in. Ask for the reading after the nurse takes your blood pressure and discuss the results with your doctor. This is the best way to get an accurate reading and sound medical advice at the same time. If you aren’t having any symptoms of low blood pressure, like dizziness or fatigue, it’s probably fine to just wait for your next physical to get your blood pressure taken. Many local drug stores and pharmacies have machines that you can use for free to check your blood pressure. Simply slide your arm into the opening and press the start button to wait for the machine to take your reading. This is a great way to get a basic idea of where you’re blood pressure is at. If nobody is waiting to use the machine, sit down for 5 minutes or so before taking your blood pressure to get a more accurate reading. These are available from nearly every pharmacy or supermarket, and can cost as little as 20. These devices are a great way to keep track of your blood pressure numbers from the comfort of your own home. Simply wrap the band around your bicep and turn the machine on to take your reading. Sit still and relax for 5 minutes before you take your blood pressure so that physical exertion doesn't affect your reading. Additionally, put your feet flat against your floor while you take the reading and don't cross your legs. When checking your blood pressure, the systolic reading, which is the top number, should be 90-120. The diastolic reading, which is the bottom number, should be around 60-80. If the systolic reading is lower than 90 or your diastolic reading is lower than 60, you have low blood pressure Systolic blood pressure measures the pressure that is exerted on the arteries by the force of your blood being pushed through by your heart. Think of your body as a pipe. The systolic reading is how hard the water presses on the pipe when it’s flowing. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure that exists in your arteries when your heart rests between beats. If it helps, think of it as how hard the water pushes on the pipe when the tap on your sink is off. Keep in mind that everyone's body is different, and you will experience fluctuations over the course of each day. However, blood pressure numbers should be kept as close to these averages as possible. Summary:","completion":"Blood pressure reading is a common procedure when you receive a regular health checkup. The nurse typically takes your reading before your doctor's consultation, and discussing these results with your doctor can provide both an accurate reading and helpful medical advice. Unless you're experiencing symptoms of low blood pressure like dizziness or exhaustion, you typically only need to check your blood pressure during your routine physicals. In between doctor visits, you can check your blood pressure at local pharmacies and drug stores, many of which provide machines for free public use. The process involves inserting your arm into the device and pressing the start button. For more precise results, allow yourself to rest for about 5 minutes before taking the reading, if there's no one else waiting to use the machine. Additionally, home blood pressure monitoring devices are readily available, costing as little as 20. These machines allow you to regularly track your blood pressure in the comfort of your home. To use them, wrap the band around your bicep and switch on the machine. Remember to sit quietly and relax for about 5 minutes before taking your reading, ensuring physical activity doesn't affect the result, and keep your feet flat on the floor without crossing your legs. In terms of reading, the systolic figure, the top number, should be within 90-120, while the diastolic figure, the bottom number, should be around 60-80. Systolic blood pressure reflects the pressure exerted on the arteries when your heart pushes blood through, resembling the water pressure when flowing through pipe. Diastolic blood pressure, on the other hand, represents the pressure in the arteries when the heart rests between beats, akin to the force against a pipe when no water is flowing. It's important to remember that your body is unique and blood pressure can fluctitate throughout the day. However, you should strive to maintain your numbers as close as possible to these general averages for optimal health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q:Information: - Fightstar are a British rock band from London, formed in 2003. The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are commonly known to implement additional metal and alternative rock elements into their sound, as well as several other genres. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much skepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, \\"They Liked You Better When You Were Dead\\" (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their four studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise. - McFly is an English pop rock band formed in London in 2003. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, ukulele, guitar and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar and vocals), and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other. - Son of Dork were a British pop punk band formed by James Bourne after his previous band, Busted, split in January 2005. The name of the band came from a scene in the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\" where the chant \\"Son of Dork\\" is used. Their debut single, \\"Ticket Outta Loserville\\", was released in November 2005, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Their second single, \\"Eddie's Song\\", reached No. 10 in January 2006. - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes. - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network. - James Elliot Bourne (born 13 September 1983 in Rochford, Essex, England) is an English singer-songwriter and co-founder of pop rock bands Busted and Son of Dork as well as a solo electronic project, Future Boy. From 2013-2015 he was a member of supergroup McBusted, which consisted of himself, Busted bandmate Matt Willis, and McFly. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards. - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played. - \`\` You Said No '' ( also known by its original title , \`\` Crash and Burn '' ) is a song by English pop punk band Busted . It was released on 21 April 2003 as the third single from their debut studio album Busted ( 2002 ) . The song was written by band members James Bourne , Matt Willis and Charlie Simpson , along with Steve Robson and John McLaughlin , and produced by Robson and Graham Stewart . \`\` You Said No '' became Busted 's first song to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart . With previous singles \`\` What I Go to School For '' and \`\` Year 3000 '' having peaked at number three and number two , respectively , Busted also became the first band ever to enter the UK charts 3 - 2 - 1 with their first three singles . - Charles Robert \\"Charlie\\" Simpson (born 7 June 1985) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He is the youngest member of multi-BRIT Award-winning band Busted, and is the lead vocalist, guitarist in alternative rock band Fightstar. AllMusic has noted that Simpson is \\"perhaps the only pop star to make the convincing transition from fresh-faced boy bander to authentic hard rock frontman\\".

Question: Some people don't jog, but they don't get fat because _ . Yes or no, is the answer \\"they work hard\\"? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the answer is \\"they work hard.\\" In the article, it is mentioned that some people do not jog, but they do not get fat because they work hard on their jobs. Engaging in various work activities that require physical effort or mental exertion can help an individual maintain a healthy weight without necessarily jogging or following a specific exercise routine. It is important to note that everyone's body and lifestyle are different, and what works for one person might not necessarily work for another.

Nonetheless, consulting with a healthcare professional, such as a doctor, is always a wise decision before starting any new fitness regimen or making significant changes to one's lifestyle. Medical advice and guidance can help an individual make informed choices tailored to their specific needs, fitness levels, medical history, and goals. In the case of Paul Miller, his doctor advised him to jog, and this strategy worked for him, contributing to his improved health and weight management.

I read this background article the other day: The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. I am facing a new situation today: An anthropologist gathered observations for two native tribes from southern Africa. He noticed that both tribes spend the majority of the day outside, and therefore they are both exposed to fairly high amounts of UV light. He also quickly realized that one key difference between the tribes was that members of tribe A had dark skin, while members of tribe B had light skin. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Members of which tribe will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency? Answer:","completion":"Given the information from the background article, we can deduce the answer step by step. Step 1: The epidermis contains melanocytes, which produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. Step 2: People with darker skin have melanocytes that produce more melanin. Step 3: Melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin. Step 4: UV light exposure stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D. Step 5: People with darker skin have more melanin and thus have a reduced ability to absorb UV light. Step 6: Due to their reduced ability to absorb UV light, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency. Hence, using the above reasoning, we can conclude that members of Tribe A, who have dark skin, will be at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency compared to members of Tribe B, who have light skin."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

All members of the class are terrestrial, but they attained terrestriality independently of insects. Myriapoda is the only arthropod class not represented by a sequenced genome. We present an analysis of the genome of the centipede Strigamia maritima. It retains a compact genome that has undergone less gene loss and shuffling than previously sequenced arthropods, and many orthologues of genes conserved from the bilaterian ancestor that have been lost in insects. Our analysis locates many genes in conserved macro-synteny contexts, and many small-scale examples of gene clustering. We describe several examples where S. maritima shows different solutions from insects to similar problems. The insect olfactory receptor gene family is absent from S. maritima, and olfaction in air is likely effected by expansion of other receptor gene families. For some genes S. maritima has evolved paralogues to generate coding sequence diversity, where insects use alternate splicing. This is most striking for the Dscam gene, which in Drosophila generates more than 100,000 alternate splice forms, but in S. maritima is encoded by over 100 paralogues. We see an intriguing linkage between the absence of any known photosensory proteins in a blind organism and the additional absence of canonical circadian clock genes. The phylogenetic position of myriapods allows us to identify where in arthropod phylogeny several particular molecular mechanisms and traits emerged. For example, we conclude that juvenile hormone signalling evolved with the emergence of the exoskeleton in the arthropods and that RR-1 containing cuticle proteins evolved in the lineage leading to Mandibulata. We also identify when various gene expansions and losses occurred. The genome of S. maritima offers us a unique glimpse into the ancestral arthropod genome, while also displaying many adaptations to its specific life history..

Article: \\"Colour\\" and \\"color\\",\\"favourite\\" and \\"favorite\\"... Have you ever wondered why Americans spell those words without a \\"u\\"? Is it because they are lazy? Of course not. In fact,the difference in spelling was created by Noah Webster (1758-1843). He is a teacher who reformed English to make American identity stronger. Linguists celebrated his 250th birthday on October 16. After the Revolutionary War (1775~ 1783),Webster believed that Americans should have their own dictionary,rather than rely on British versions . He dropped the British \\"u\\" in some words. And he changed \\"centre\\" into \\"center\\" for children to learn English by spelling words more like they sounded. Webster wasn't shy about expressing his opinions. In defining preposterous (unreasonable),he wrote: \\"A republican government in the hands of females is preposterous.\\" Webster spent 28 years on the project before completing the 70,000-word dictionary in 1828 with his American-style spellings. He also added local words. His dictionary was widely used in schools. Linguists believed it helped a new nation achieve unity and cultural independence at a time when most were focused on political freedom. \\"He was the shaper of our language and the shaper of American identity,\\"said Joshua Kendall,who is working on a biography about Webster. \\"He at last bonded us through our language.\\" Question: When did Noah Webster probably begin his project of the dictionary?

Zynga Delights In Zany Awards Plan Mark Pincus (Image via CrunchBase) If you’re a star employee at a bank, utility or cement company, you can look forward to a whispered year-end bonus chat with your boss. At Zynga, it’s a different story. The creator of Farmville2 and other online games has turned employee recognition into a once-a-quarter public extravaganza that’s been known to include spandex costumes, stock awards as large as 100,000 — and a variety of public salutes. In a few weeks, right after first-quarter earnings are released, Zynga’s San Francisco headquarters will once again become the scene of an exuberant all-hands meeting. Company executives will honor top performers with the likes of “the Rockstar Award,” “the Green Beret Award” and a half-dozen other treats. Some winners earn a 5,000 trip to a vacation spot of their choosing; others get as much as 100,000 in vested stock. Zynga’s continued ebullience comes at a surprising time. The company’s once-breakneck growth in revenue slowed to just 12% last year. Zynga’s working alliance with Facebook has hit a bumpy stretch. Shares of Zynga trade at just 3.36 a share, down sharply from the December 2011 going-public price of 10, albeit up 40% from even lower levels at the start of 2013. Nonetheless, Zynga argues that a hell-raising tribute to employees’ best work is one of the smartest things the game maker can do. Zynga’s business is intensely hits-driven. So it’s worth encouraging the extra cleverness that can turn a moderately popular game into a global blockbuster. Zynga likes the fact that its awards are openly discussed among employees and shared virally, says the company’s chief people officer, Colleen McCreary. Such visibility “engenders pride,” she says. Besides, McCreary adds, “We spend a lot of time thinking about how we reward our players in our games, and we want to emulate that in our workplace.” Zynga’s celebrations aren’t open to the public, but McCreary pulled back the curtain a bit in a mid-March talk at the Wavelength leadership conference in Lambourn, England. “It’s like putting on the Oscars,” she said. Each quarterly meeting has a stated theme that calls for employees to costume themselves accordingly. One meeting was a high-school throwback with lettermen’s jackets abounding; another was a tribute to 1920s speakeasies, with some female employees in ball gowns. Zynga’s best-known awards, which have attracted media attention in the past, include the Zynga Spirit prize, which comes with 100,000 in vested stock. It’s given quarterly to three to five standout employees who embody all of Zynga’s core values. About 15 employees are singled out each quarter for the Atlas award, which comes with the 5,000 vacation. It’s given to employees who were “heavy lifters,” doing whatever was necessary to achieve great results. Meanwhile, 20 employees a quarter qualify for the Rockstar award, which consists of four tickets to a showcase concert or sporting event, along with two nights in an upscale hotel. Zynga has been busy coining other awards, too. Since the fourth quarter of 2010, it has been handing out the wryly named Innovator’s Award, which goes to teams or individuals that tried something daring. Some of these projects succeeded; others (such as an expansion of the Frontierville game) failed. Either way, Zynga says it wants to encourage employees to take smart risks. Last year, Zynga tried an even more idiosyncratic award: free use of company CEO Mark Pincus’s Tesla electric car for a limited period. Insiders decline to say whether that will be repeated anytime soon. Even with the profusion of awards, Zynga isn’t the gentlest place to work in the northern California tech boom. The company is famous for its long hours and demanding deadlines, as well as for CEO Pincus’s strong personality. Some 161 current and former Zynga employees have posted company reviews on Glassdoor.com, and only 54% of them say they would recommend the company to a friend. All the same, McCreary says she and Pincus think Zynga is on the right track with awards that involve highly public recognition, combined with personalized gifts that have meaningful economic value. Cash alone tends to have a more fleeting impact, McCreary says. If there’s no official discussion of who gets awards, employees don’t get as clear a signal about what conduct and performance wins rewards. By contrast, Zynga’s winners not only get trophies and applause from their peers — they also are lauded on an internal webpage called … what else? … AwardsVille. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses Zynga, the creator of Farmville2 and other online games, and their unique approach to employee recognition.

How do I know who I follow that do not follow me back on Instagram? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions are asking for different types of information pertaining to the Instagram application. 1. The first questions asks how to hide the list of users one is following on Instagram. This is related to the privacy settings and visibility of your Instagram account. 2. The second question asks for information on how to identify which Instagram users one is following who do not follow them back. This is related to the follower reciprocal relationship on Instagram. Here are the step-by-step solutions: For the first question about hiding Instagram following: 1. Unfortunately, Instagram does not currently have a feature that allows users to hide their following list. Unless your account is private, your followers, followings, and post lists are visible to everyone. But, you can choose the option to take your account private, which means only approved followers can see your content and follower/following lists. Here are the steps: 2. Open Instagram and go to your profile 3. Click on the three horizontal lines in the top right corner. 4. Select ‘Settings’ 5. Then, tap ‘Privacy’ 6. Under ‘Connections’, select ‘Account Privacy’. 7. Tap to toggle on ‘Private Account'. Due to the Instagram policy, the follower/following list may still be visible to the user you follow, when you follow them or they follow you. For the second question about how to know who you are following that does not follow you back: 1. This process is not directly provided by Instagram. Instagram doesn't show unfollowers. However, there are third-party apps available to determine this. Some commonly used ones include Follower Insight, Unfollowers & Ghost Followers for Instagram, etc. Before using such tools though, one should take into consideration issues related to app reliability, data privacy and security, and compliance with the social media platform's rules/agreements. Using such tools could potentially violate Instagram's terms of service, and may result in restricted functionalities or a ban. Such platforms usually require access to your Instagram account data including username, password and other personal data which may be susceptible to breaches or misuse. Therefore, the best practice would be to manually check your followers list against your following list to determine people that you follow who do not follow you back. This, however, may be time consuming if you follow a large number of users. Please note that Instagram changes its features and policies frequently, this information is accurate as of the time it was written. It's best to check for the latest updates from Instagram's official resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The BCA mobile command center sits outside St. Cloud Hospital Sunday, Oct. 18, 2015, after an early morning incident where a sheriff deputy was fatally shot, in St. Cloud. Minn. Authorities say a suspect... (Associated Press) Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, describes how an inmate fatally shot deputy Steven Sandberg at St. Cloud Hospital, as Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner, left,... (Associated Press) After the suspect was taken into custody he died, despite efforts by medical personnel to revive him. The struggle happened early Sunday at St. Cloud Hospital in the suspect's room, said Drew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. He said the suspect was not handcuffed at the time. Investigators are still trying to determine what led up to the shooting. \\"Several shots were fired during that struggle and then security officers were able to get into the room, and the suspect was tased with a Taser, and taken into custody,\\" Evans said at a news conference. \\"After he was taken into custody he became unresponsive. Medical personnel performed lifesaving operations on him and he died at that time.\\" Evans said the Aitkin County deputy killed was Steven Martin Sandberg, a 60-year-old investigator with the sheriff's office. The suspect was identified as Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, who lived near the city of Aitkin. Evans said autopsies were being performed on both of them and the medical examiner would determine more about how the suspect died. The superintendent said Hammond was subdued by two hospital security guards with the help of another Aitkin County deputy, who had just arrived to relieve Sandberg. Sandberg had been with department since 1981 and an investigator for 20 years, Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said. Evans and hospital vice president Kurt Otto declined to say why Hammond was being treated at the hospital in St. Cloud, which is about 60 miles northwest of Minneapolis. Otto said the hospital had asked the sheriff's office to send deputies to monitor Hammond because of the \\"seriousness\\" of the domestic incident, which happened sometime earlier in the week. They would not say how long Hammond had been in the hospital except that it was more than a day. He said investigators had a lot of work ahead of them, including interviewing hospital staffers who were on duty at the time. Hammond had been convicted of felony crimes including escaping from custody in 1990, third-degree burglary in 1989 and terrorist threats in 1990, according to court records. All the convictions were for crimes committed in Aitkin County. Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton condemned the deputy's death and offered condolences to his family. \\"I deplore the terrible, senseless murder of Deputy Sheriff Steven Sandberg,\\" Dayton said in a statement. A woman answering the phone at Sandberg's home said nobody from the family was ready to comment. Hammond's home does not have a listed phone number. ||||| A violent “whirlwind of events” in a St. Cloud Hospital room early Sunday morning left two men dead, including a 24-year veteran of the Aitkin County sheriff’s office. The man who shot him was tased by another sheriff’s deputy and died at the scene, authorities said. “A suspect being treated at St. Cloud Hospital shot and killed a sheriff’s deputy who had been monitoring the welfare of the suspect who was a subject of an investigation outside the St. Cloud tri-county area,” said Jill Oliveira, spokeswoman for the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA). The BCA said the incident was confined to the suspect’s hospital room, and no one else was injured. The deputy was identified as Steven M. Sandberg, 60, who had been with the Sheriff’s Office since 1991 and working as an investigator for the past 20 years. The suspect was Danny Leroy Hammond, 50, BCA Superintendent Drew Evans said during a news conference in St. Cloud. Hammond, of rural Aitkin, was in the hospital for medical reasons following a domestic situation, Evans said. The deputy was identified as Investigator Steven Martin Sandberg, who was 60 years old and is survived by a wife and daughter. He had worked with the Aitkin County Sheriff's Office since 1991. Photo provided by family members to KSTP. Hammond was not in police custody, Evans said, but he was being monitored by law enforcement “at the request of St. Cloud Hospital.” He was not handcuffed, Evans added. A struggle ensued after the suspect got out of his bed, Evans said, and Hammond got hold of Sandberg’s gun and squeezed off several rounds. A deputy from the same Sheriff’s Office tased Hammond, and the suspect “became unresponsive,” Evans said. Life-saving efforts were begun in the emergency room, but Hammond died, the superintendent said. Aitkin County Sheriff Scott Turner said the incident was a “whirlwind of events in [a] very tragic situation.” Sandberg leaves behind a wife and daughter, Turner said. A hearse carrying Sandberg’s body from St. Cloud to the Ramsey County Medical Examiner’s office on Sunday afternoon was escorted by dozens of police vehicles in a motorcade along Interstate 94. Hammond’s criminal history includes felony convictions for burglary and fleeing custody, both cases from roughly 25 years ago. Law enforcement scanner conversation of the unfolding pre-dawn scene was captured by the MN Police Clips website. “We do have an officer down in South 527,” came the word from the hospital to dispatch. “We have deputy that is shot … the shooter is in handcuffs.” Dispatch described the shooter as “an inmate ... and the inmate is now in custody.” An officer on the scene said the “guy got gun away from deputy, shot deputy” and the suspect went into cardiac arrest. The weapon was recovered, the officer added. In a statement issued Sunday afternoon, Gov. Mark Dayton said, “I deplore this terrible, senseless murder. ... This tragedy reminds us that Minnesota’s law enforcement officers risk their lives every day and night to keep us safe.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"A suspect in a domestic incident, who was being treated at a hospital in Minnesota, grabbed a gun from a sheriff's deputy, killed the officer, and prompted hospital security officers to subdue him with a stun gun. The suspect was taken into custody and later died, despite efforts by the medical personnel to revive him. The incident happened at St. Cloud Hospital early Sunday in the suspect's room.

As the world braces for a likely escalation of the conflict, grave questions are being asked about the potential repercussions. Analysts fear a backlash that could further destabilize the volatile region, even triggering a wider scale war involving regional powers. The stakes are high, and the potential for unintended consequences remains a significant concern. As America prepares to act, the imminent question is on the feasibility and potential fallout of intervention. Following past experiences in Iraq and Afghanistan, the US is treading on thin ice, aware of the potential risks and complications. This decision could either weaken Assad’s regime, offering a window for opposition forces to regain ground, or it could further plunge Syria into a deeper abyss of civil unrest and violence. Furthermore, how this intervention is responded to by Assad's key allies, including Russia and Iran, could potentially reshape the geopolitical landscape of the Middle East. This decision does not just impact Syria alone, but also has potential implications for international relations and global politics. The UN, on the other hand, has repeatedly called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict, emphasizing the importance of diplomacy over military intervention. In spite of this, it seems the US is poised to act unilaterally, emphasizing the urgency to respond to the alleged chemical weapons attack. At the same time, it becomes crucial to evaluate the legal framework that the US is basing its actions on. It remains a moot point whether intervention without explicit sanction from the UN Security Council could potentially constitute a violation of international law. The prospect of intervention thus shines a spotlight not only on the Syrian conflict, but also has far-reaching implications which will impact the international political stage and potentially alter the rules of engagement in warfare. The debate rages on, insisting that concrete evidence is necessary to establish Assad’s hand in the alleged chemical weapons attack. While the world watches and waits, uncertainty and apprehension continue to dictate the narrative as geopolitical dynamics hang precariously in the balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, without more context to fully understand the specifics behind the reviewer's sentiment, it is not possible to assign a concrete ★-rating to this review. Nevertheless, considering that the reviewer has used the word \\"great\\" to express their satisfaction, it suggests that the review would likely fall closer to the higher end of the rating scale. Here are three possible scenarios, each taking into consideration the limited information provided in the review: 1. If we were to assume that the reviewer is attributing their excitement to a service or product that exceeded their expectations, it would likely rate as ★★★★★. This rating indicates an outstanding experience that surpasses standard expectations. 2. Alternatively, if the reviewer is genuinely satisfied but not utterly impressed with the experience, a ★★★★ rating might be more appropriate. This rating still signifies a high level of satisfaction, albeit with some minor aspects lacking or leaving room for improvement. 3. Lastly, if we were to infer that the reviewer has had varying experiences with the service or product but considers it to be overall satisfactory, a ★★★ rating might be fitting. This indicates a generally favorable experience, though inconsistencies or shortcomings still exist. In summary, while we cannot definitively assign a ★-rating to the review \\"Great!!!!!,\\" it can be surmised that the reviewer had a positive experience.

The brunt of that was aimed at Google, which makes the Android software that powers smartphones from a range of manufacturers including Motorola, Samsung Electronics and HTC. First, Jobs expressed skepticism about how Google reports its number of Android users. This is an issue Jobs has raised in prior speeches, yet he freely addressed the point of comparison, saying Apple has activated 75,000 more iOS devices over the last 30 days compared to Google's last reported Android activation number. Jobs, who made his comments in an unusual appearance on Apple's quarterly earnings call with investors, then took issue with the geeky argument of open versus closed, which refers to how transparent a system's source code is to developers. \\"I think it's going to be a challenge for them to create a competitive platform and to convince developers to create apps for yet a third software platform, after iOS and OPTIONS: - Adobe.\\" - Android.\\" - Apple.\\" - CNN.\\" - Google.\\" - HTC.\\" - Jobs.\\" - Motorola.\\" - Nokia.\\" - RIM.\\" - Samsung Electronics.\\" - Steve Jobs.\\" - iOS.\\"","completion":"- RIM.\\" In this passage, Steve Jobs is talking about competition in the smartphone market.

Step-by-step breakdown and justification: 1. Kidneys filter waste out of blood. Justification: This step is essential for removing toxins and excess substances from the blood, ensuring that only necessary components are present in the bloodstream. 2. Composition of blood is regulated. Justification: Regulating the composition of blood helps maintain balance among its components, such as water, electrolytes, and proteins. This ensures the proper functioning of bodily processes. 3. Volume of water in blood is kept constant. Justification: Maintaining a constant blood volume, regulated by the kidneys, prevents dehydration and overhydration, which can negatively affect the body's functions. 4. PH is kept at a constant level. Justification: Keeping the pH level constant in the blood is essential for the proper functioning of cells, proteins, and enzymes. Kidneys regulate the blood pH by excreting hydrogen ions and reabsorbing bicarbonate ions. 5. Kidneys help regulate blood pressure. Justification: Kidneys play a vital role in regulating blood pressure by controlling fluid balance and secreting the enzyme renin. This regulation ensures that blood pressure stays within a healthy range. 6. Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells.

Please add spaces between words: Mosthouseplantswillalsothriveinaneast-facingwindow,wheretheygetdirectsunlightinlimitedquantities.","completion":"Most house plants will also thrive in an east-facing window, where they get direct sunlight in limited quantities. East-facing windows are particularly beneficial for a variety of house plants, as they provide an ideal balance of sunlight and shade. In this location, plants are able to receive direct sun exposure in the morning, followed by more indirect light as the day progresses. Direct sunlight is essential for the proper growth and development of many house plants. It aids in photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy, and helps to maintain their overall health and vitality. In limited quantities, direct sunlight can contribute to the vibrant, lush appearance that many house plant enthusiasts desire. However, too much direct sunlight can also be harmful to some plants, as it can lead to issues such as scorched leaves, wilting, and even stunted growth. East-facing windows provide a balance of direct sunlight and indirect light that allows most house plants to flourish without causing sun damage. The morning sunlight that east-facing windows offer is also generally gentler and less intense than the harsh, direct sunlight that plants may receive in south- or west-facing windows. This makes east-facing windows a suitable location even for more delicate or shade-loving plant varieties. Some of the house plants that will thrive in an east-facing window include: 1. Spider plants (Chlorophytum comosum) 2. Pothos (Epipremnum aureum) 3. Calathea varieties 4. Peace lilies (Spathiphyllum) 5. Boston ferns (Nephrolepis exaltata) 6. African violets (Saintpaulia) 7. Prayer plants (Maranta leuconeura) 8. Snake plants (Sansevieria) To further ensure the success of house plants in an east-facing window, it's essential to maintain proper care by monitoring the temperature, humidity, and watering schedule. With the right balance of light and care, most house plants will thrive by growing healthily and displaying vibrant colors in an east-facing window."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, the correct answer is: A). negative. This statement implies that the reviewer believes the movie lacks any positive qualities or redeeming features. It seems that they were disappointed with the film's content, execution, or overall experience. The phrase \\"nothing good can happen\\" conveys a sense of dissatisfaction, as if the reviewer was not entertained, engaged, or moved by the events or characters within the movie. When evaluating a movie, critics and viewers may consider a variety of aspects. These include the film's plot, character development, acting, visual effects, music, pacing, and themes. If a reviewer states that nothing good can happen in a movie, they might be implying that one or more of these elements failed to meet their expectations or standards. This could lead to a negative review and potentially deter other potential viewers from watching the film. It is essential to note that individual opinions and perceptions about a movie can vary greatly. A statement from a single movie review might not entirely capture the film's overall quality or other viewers' experiences.

Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story Supporters of President Obama’s health care law had predicted that expanding insurance coverage for the poor would reduce costly emergency room visits because people would go to primary care doctors instead. But a rigorous new experiment in Oregon has raised questions about that assumption, finding that newly insured people actually went to the emergency room a good deal more often. The study, published in the journal Science, compared thousands of low-income people in the Portland area who were randomly selected in a 2008 lottery to get Medicaid coverage with people who entered the lottery but remained uninsured. Those who gained coverage made 40 percent more visits to the emergency room than their uninsured counterparts during their first 18 months with insurance. The pattern was so strong that it held true across most demographic groups, times of day and types of visits, including those for conditions that were treatable in primary care settings. The findings cast doubt on the hope that expanded insurance coverage will help rein in emergency room costs just as more than two million people are gaining coverage under the Affordable Care Act. And they go against one of the central arguments of the law’s supporters, that extending insurance to large numbers of Americans would reduce emergency room use, and eventually save money. In remarks in New Mexico in 2009, Mr. Obama said: “I think that it’s very important that we provide coverage for all people because if everybody’s got coverage, then they’re not going to the emergency room for treatment.” The study suggests that the surge in the numbers of insured people may put even greater pressure on emergency rooms, at least in the short term. Nearly 25 million uninsured Americans could gain coverage under the law, about half of them through Medicaid. The first policies took effect on Wednesday. “I suspect that the finding will be surprising to many in the policy debate,” said Katherine Baicker, an economist at Harvard University’s School of Public Health and one of the authors of the study. Advertisement Continue reading the main story An administration spokeswoman, Tara McGuinness, said that the time frame was too short to expect much of a change, and that over the longer term, use would most likely decline. She pointed to a longer-term study in Massachusetts, which expanded coverage for its residents in 2006, that found an 8 percent decline in emergency department use over a period of several years. “Medicaid saves lives and improves health outcomes,” Ms. McGuinness said. “Plenty of studies show that.” But many economists say that the emphasis on emergency room use, both in policy and in political speeches, is misplaced, as it makes up only a small part of health care costs in the United States. A federal government health survey found that emergency departments accounted for about 4 percent of total health spending in 2010, far less than inpatient hospital visits, which accounted for about 31 percent. Certain populations, however, like low-income people with chronic illnesses, have much higher rates of use. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Baicker and Amy Finkelstein, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, another author, said the increased use of emergency rooms is driven by a basic economic principle: When services get less expensive, people use them more. Previous studies have found that uninsured people face substantial out-of-pocket costs that can put them in debt when they go to the emergency room. Medicaid reduces those costs. Medicaid coverage also reduces the costs of going to a primary care doctor, and a previous analysis of data from the Oregon experiment found that such visits also increased substantially. “This is just one piece of an increase we found across every type of care,” said Bill J. Wright, an author of the new study who is the associate director of the Center for Outcomes Research and Education in Portland, a part of Providence Health and Services, a large health care provider. The study’s authors emphasized that Medicaid had many benefits. Previous analyses from the experiment found that gaining coverage reduced the incidence of depression and increased feelings of financial stability. The study drew on data from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment that included about 90,000 low-income Oregonians and randomly assigned about 30,000 of them access to Medicaid. Health experts say the experiment’s design — random assignment of coverage through a lottery — allowed them to isolate and evaluate the effects of the program. Such designs are the gold standard in medical research, but are rarely used for domestic health care policy. Some experts noted that the study measured only the first 18 months after people gained coverage, and that old habits of relying on the emergency room are often hard to shake. It also takes time to find a primary care doctor and make an appointment. “How to use a plan and when to seek emergency department care involves a learning curve that doesn’t happen overnight,” said Sara Rosenbaum, a health researcher at George Washington University who was not involved in the study. Amitabh Chandra, a professor and director of health policy research at the Harvard Kennedy School of Government, said people may often use the emergency room because they need its services. Medicine has become increasingly complex, with teams of specialists using highly sophisticated equipment for treatments that often go beyond the capabilities of the family doctor. “We often say, ‘If this person had just received preventative care at a doctor’s office, we would not have seen emergency room use,' ” said Dr. Chandra, who was not involved in the study. “But there is only so much that prevention can do.” Professor Rosenbaum pointed out that a lot of the recent growth in emergency department use has been among the privately insured people, not the uninsured. She said insurers often recommend going to the emergency room for quick specialty care, like for stomach pain. Dr. Wright said that many participants in Oregon were already connected to a primary care doctor, and that it was unlikely that the rise in use had much to do with a lack of access to a physician. The study’s lesson, he said, was that new coverage needed to be accompanied by broader changes to the way care was delivered, like those in Oregon and under Mr. Obama’s new law. Heidi Allen, an assistant professor at Columbia University and an author of the study, said much of the non-urgent emergency department use among patients she interviewed happened because those patients could not get same-day appointments with their primary care doctors. Dr. Chandra, who helped conduct another analysis of emergency department use in Massachusetts after the overhaul, called the Oregon study, with its strong design and clear result, “breathtaking.” In contrast, studies from Massachusetts have come up with conflicting findings. His study, for example, found that emergency room use did not change. “You would conclude what you wanted to conclude depending on which side of political aisle you were on,” he said, adding, “Now we have an answer.” ||||| As the health-care law expands Medicaid to cover millions more Americans, a new Harvard University study finds that enrollment in public program significantly increases enrollees' use of emergency departments. The research, published Thursday in the journal Science, showed a 40 percent increase in emergency department visits among those low-income adults in Oregon who gained Medicaid coverage in 2008 through a state lottery. This runs counter to some health-care law supporters' hope that Medicaid coverage would decrease this type of costly medical care, by making it easier for low income adults to see primary care providers. \\"I would view it as part of a broader set of evidence that covering people with health insurance doesn't save money,\\" says Jonathan Gruber, a health economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who has also studied Oregon's Medicaid expansion but is not affiliated with this study. \\"That was sometimes a misleading motivator for the Affordable Care Act. The law isn't designed to save money. It's designed to improve health, and that's going to cost money.\\" The Science study is part of a much larger research project that looks at Oregon's 2008 Medicaid expansion, where the state had limited funding to expand the public program to a set number of low-income residents. Oregon used a lottery to determine who would gain access to coverage, and that created a unique opportunity for researchers: The chance to study what happens when some people are randomly assigned to receive health insurance, and others are not. Previous research on the Oregon Medicaid expansion has found that enrolling in the public program increased hospital visits, primary care trips and prescription drug use. That left an unanswered question: Were new Medicaid enrollees going their primary care doctor instead of the emergency department, or, were they using more of all types of health-care services? This study suggests the latter answer: With financial barriers removed, Medicaid patients see their primary care doctor more -- and also go to the emergency department at an increased frequency. Medicaid enrollees made, on average, 1.43 trips to the emergency department during the 18-month study period, compared to an average of 1.02 visits among those who entered the Medicaid lottery but did not gain coverage. Medicaid coverage also increased the probability of having any visit to the emergency department by 7 percent. The researchers also looked at the types of visits and found no decline in use of the emergency department for primary care treatable conditions among those who had enrolled in Medicaid coverage. \\"Part of what makes emergency department use interesting is there are different theories about what to expect,\\" lead study author Sarah Taubman, also at the Harvard School of Public Health. \\"There's one theory that it increases, because insurance pays for emergency room care that would lead people to use more than if they faced the full cost. The other theory is that, by paying for primary care visits, insurance may lead to a decrease in emergency department use. We looked at this and, taken altogether, we see a net increase. Twenty-five states and the District of Columbia expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, extending coverage to all adults who earn less than 133 percent of the federal poverty line, about 15,000 for an individual and 31,400 for a family of four. Two more states, Indiana and Pennsylvania, are seeking to move forward with the health-care law program at a later date. Although the Affordable Care Act initially mandated that all states expand their Medicaid programs, the Supreme Court ruling in June 2012 found that provision to be too restrictive, allowing each state to decide whether to participate. Some governors have cited a reduction in emergency department visits as a reason to expand the public program. \\"Today, uninsured citizens often turn to emergency rooms for non-urgent care because they don't have access to primary care doctors -- leading to crowded emergency rooms, longer wait times and higher costs,\\" one fact sheet from Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) states. \\"By expanding Medicaid, those without insurance will have access to primary care, lowering costs and improving overall health.\\" And, when Congress was debating the Affordable Care Act in 2009, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius cited the high number of uninsured Americans being seen at the emergency department as a reason to pass the law “Our health care system has forced too many uninsured Americans to depend on the emergency room for the care they need,” she said in a July 2009 statement. “We cannot wait for reform that gives all Americans the high-quality, affordable care they need and helps prevent illnesses from turning into emergencies.” Gruber, the MIT economist, doesn't see the Harvard study as a compelling case against expanding Medicaid. There are still other benefits to insurance coverage, he says, that aren't about saving public funding. Separate research on the Oregon expansion, published last spring in the New England Journal of Medicine, found Medicaid enrollees to have significantly lower rates of depression and were more able to pay their medical bills. \\"The overall notion is we're getting people more health care,\\" Gruber says. \\"There are huge improvements in mental health. For those who want to argue that expanding Medicaid is a free lunch, this is bad. But that was never the right argument.\\" ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A new study in the journal Science has found that expanding insurance coverage through Medicaid led to an increase in emergency room visits, contrary to the predictions of supporters of the Affordable Care Act, who expected that greater coverage would lead to a reduction in costly emergency room visits.

Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Twenty-three percent of Georgia's active lawyers reported in giving 50 hours of pro-bono service, whereas 23% of the lawyers nationally volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually\\" correctly answer the question \\"How do Georgia's lawyers compare to lawyers nationally in pro-bone participation?\\"?

Write a title for this article: Andy, 13, was shot and killed Tuesday by sheriff's deputies who believed the gun was real. Photograph: Robert Galbraith /Reuters The Federal Bureau of Investigation is conducting an independent investigation of the fatal shooting of a 13-year-old boy by a sheriff's deputy in northern California. Sonoma County sheriff Steve Freitas said in a statement Friday afternoon that he will cooperate fully with federal investigators and welcomes their participation in the probe of Andy Lopez's killing, which happened on Tuesday afternoon. The shooting has generated numerous protests and marches in the suburban town of Santa Rosa, with many residents questioning the deputy's decision to fire on the youth. Freitas also expressed sympathy to the Lopez family and thanked the Santa Rosa community for keeping protests peaceful. Police say Lopez was carrying a pellet gun that looked like an AK-47 assault rifle. A timeline released Thursday by the Santa Rosa police shows that only 10 seconds passed from the moment that the sheriff's deputy and his partner called dispatch to report a suspicious person to the moment they called back to say shots had been fired. FBI spokesman Paul Lee said he did not know why his agency decided to get involved or whether local authorities had requested its help. More than 100 angry middle and high school students walked to City Hall on Friday, the Santa Rosa Press Democrat reported. Hundreds of people protested earlier in the week. City police and the Sonoma County district attorney's office are also investigating. The Santa Rosa Police Department said two deputies in a squad car encountered the hoodie-wearing Lopez just after 3:14 pm. Witnesses say at least one of the deputies took cover behind an open front door of the cruiser, and one yelled twice \\"drop the gun.\\" Ten seconds after their initial report to dispatch, one of the officers called in \\"shot have been fired.\\" Sixteen seconds later, the deputies were calling for medical help. Lopez was later pronounced dead at the scene. The Sonoma County coroner said he found seven \\"apparent entry wounds,\\" two of them fatal. The deputies, who have not been identified, have been placed on paid administrative leave, which is standard after a shooting, officials said. Assistant Sheriff Lorenzo Duenas told the Press Democrat that the deputy who shot the teen is a 24-year veteran and his partner, who did not fire his weapon, is a new hire. Santa Rosa police Lt Paul Henry told the newspaper the deputy who opened fire later told investigators he believed his life as well his partner's was in jeopardy. The deputy said the teen didn't comply with commands to drop the gun and was turning toward the deputies while raising the barrel. \\"The deputy's mindset was that he was fearful that he was going to be shot,\\" Henry said at a Wednesday news conference. Geoffrey Alpert, a professor of criminology at the University of South Carolina, said officers are typically justified in the use of deadly force when they sincerely believe lives are at stake. If the teen was raising the barrel of the gun toward officers, they had little choice about firing, Alpert said. \\"If it's a pink bubble gum gun and an obvious fake to most, then there is no reason to shoot,\\" he said. \\"But if the gun looks real the barrel is being pointed at you ... it's unfortunate, but a perceived threat trumps age and the officers have to protect themselves.\\" Hundreds of community members marched Wednesday night to remember the teen and protest the shooting. They covered more than three miles (five kilometers) from Santa Rosa City Hall to the field where Andy Lopez was killed. Some lit candles and placed flowers at a makeshift memorial with printed pictures of the victim, stuffed animals and a balloon that read \\"RIP Andy L\\"","completion":"\\"Tragic Loss of Innocence: The Controversial Shooting of 13-Year-Old Andy Lopez by Sheriff's Deputies\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card Sentence 2: It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first, my first step is to understand the meaning of entailment in this context. Entailment in linguistics refers to the relationship between two sentences where the truth of one sentence (the entailed sentence) is guaranteed by the truth of another (the entailing sentence). The first sentence, \\"oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card\\", is a question. The question inquires about the possibility of doing \\"that\\" on a credit card. The second sentence, \\"It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.\\", is a declarative sentence asserting that it's not possible to do \\"that\\" on a credit card. Given these sentences, if the first sentence were true, i.e., someone genuinely asked whether \\"that\\" could be done on a credit card, it does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. The second sentence could be true or false independently of the first sentence— it's possible that \\"that\\" can be done on a credit card, or perhaps it cannot be. Therefore, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The truth of the second sentence (\\"It is not possible that you can do that on a credit card.\\") is not guaranteed by the truth of the first sentence (\\"oh my uh-huh can you do that on a credit card\\"). They are not in an entailment relationship because the truth of one does not necessarily ensure the truth of the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write some highlights for the following article: Lewis Hamilton is adamant his situation and mindset have not changed now he is again leading the Formula One World Championship. So long the hunter over the course of the current campaign, Hamilton is back in front for only the second time this season in the wake of the events in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix. After bitter rival and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg retired after 14 laps following a wiring loom failure in the steering column of his car, Hamilton went on to take the chequered flag. Lewis Hamilton dominated in Singapore to take a lead in the championship over teammate Nico Rosberg. The 29-year-old now has a three-point lead going into the final five races of the season, starting with next weekend's race in Japan, and followed swiftly a week later by the inaugural Russian Grand Prix. But despite the man now being hunted, Hamilton said: 'Nothing changes. 'I have believed, since the time I started training for this season, that I can win the world championship this year. 'And with a great car like this, even with some of the difficulties I've had, you know you are still within shooting range. 'You have to keep that positivity, belief and hope - hope is one of the most powerful things in the world - and I carry that with me each weekend. The Brit says he was always positive and won't change his mindset now he leads the way. 'I haven't lost that vision or that dream, that's still there, and I didn't leave Singapore thinking the title is more of a possibility. 'In my mind I'm still hunting for it and I've got to go just as hard, if not harder, over these final races. I've just got to keep going.' After winning the last two races from pole position, Hamilton would appear to have momentum on his side. But given Mercedes' unreliability of late, he is also aware of how quickly a situation can turn. 'Momentum is not something I generally talk about because it can be snatched away,' added Hamilton. Hamilton may have the momentum but Rosberg has shown how quickly it can all change over a season. 'Look at Nico. He had momentum from good results, and then one DNF (did not finish) and it was snatched away. 'I've also had that, so you just have to take it one race at a time. 'But I'm happy I've been at my best, getting the (recent) pole positions, maximising all the races. 'I now want to make sure these last five races - if I never do any more races in my life - are as good. They have to be the ones.'","completion":"1.

Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: This should be marked on the packet of envelopes, or on the envelope itself. Size 14 envelopes measure 5\\" x 11.5\\" and are considered the standard size. They will be rectangular in shape and will often be sold in packages at your local post office. You can also mail a letter in an envelope that is smaller than a size 14, such as a size 10 envelope (4.125\\" x 9.5\\"), with a regular stamp. If possible, fold your letter so it fits in a standard rectangular envelope, as this may cut down on the price of postage. Envelopes larger than size 14 are considered large envelopes, or flats, and will be more expensive to mail. Card sized envelopes, made for small greeting cards or wedding invitations, will also likely have additional postage fees. This is because pieces of mail that have an odd shape or are square shaped and made of rigid card can jam mail processing machines and need to be processed separately. You can do this at the post office or on a small office scale. The weight and size of your letter (plus the envelope) will affect the price of postage, or how much you will pay for a stamp. Often, the heavier the letter is, the higher the price of postage will be. Letters in a standard envelope that weigh less than 13 ounces can be sent via First Class Mail at one flat rate. Letters in a standard envelope that weigh more than 13 ounces will be upgraded to Priority Class Mail, and the price for postage will be more than the flat rate. There are three basic levels of mail, according to the US Post Office. First Class Mail is often what is used to send letter-size pieces that are rigid and square. To send a letter First-Class, it must weigh no more than 13 ounces. The price for sending First Class Mail is the same, regardless of the distance the letter is traveling. The arrival time for First Class Mail is two to three days for destinations within the U.S. Sending mail First Class is ideal for a single letter as all you need is a standard stamp and access to a post box. Priority Mail is ideal if you want your letter to get to the addressee by the following business day. To send a letter by Priority Mail, it must weigh no more than 70 pounds. At the post office, you can add on extra services to your Priority Mail item, such as USPS Tracking and Registered Mail, especially if your letter contains legal or sensitive information that must reach its destination. The price of Priority Mail postage is based on the distance the mail must travel; the further the distance, the more you will pay for postage. This is broken down by nine “zones”. For example, “Zone 1” is local, or the area close to you, and “Zone 9” is the furthest distance away from your location. Standard Mail is used for larger quantities of mail, at least 200 pieces or 50 pounds of mail at one time. Envelopes must weight less than 16 ounces. Large envelopes, also called flats, cost more than letters. People use Standard Mail to send flyers, advertising documents, newsletters, catalogs, and bulletins. You can only send domestic mail by Standard Mail and you cannot send one single envelope through Standard Mail.

Assuming that: In erosion, a slower moving stream will only carry smaller particles. A:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to analyze the relationship between the speed of a stream and the size of particles it can carry. Step 1: Understanding the concepts of erosion and sediment transport Erosion is the process by which soil, rock, or other materials are removed from a location due to forces like water, wind, and ice. In the case of a stream, the water's flow can erode materials from the surrounding environment and carry them downstream. Step 2: Evaluating the effect of stream speed on particle size A fast-moving stream is more capable of carrying larger particles. This is because the increased energy and momentum allow it to move more massive objects along its course. As the stream slows down, its carrying capacity for larger particles decreases, and it becomes more difficult for it to transport these materials downstream. As a result, slower-moving streams are more likely to carry smaller particles, while faster-moving streams are more capable of carrying both larger and smaller particles. So, based on our analysis: A slow-moving stream is capable of carrying smaller particles than a fast-moving stream, as the carrying capacity for larger particles decreases with a decrease in stream speed."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It is bordered to the south by the counties of Ceredigion and Powys in Mid Wales, and to the east by the counties of Shropshire in the West Midlands and Cheshire in North West England. - Gwynedd is an area in north-west Wales, named after the old Kingdom of Gwynedd. As a local government area, it is the second biggest in Wales in terms of geographical area and also one of the most sparsely populated. A majority of the population are Welsh-speaking. The name Gwynedd is also used for a preserved county, covering the two local government areas of Gwynedd and the Isle of Anglesey. Culturally and historically, the name can also be used for most of North Wales (for instance, the area covered by the Gwynedd Constabulary), roughly corresponding to the territory of the Kingdom of Gwynedd at its greatest extent. The current area is 2,548 square km (983.78 sq miles, slightly smaller than Luxembourg) with a population as measured in the 2011 Census of 121,874. - Publius (or Gaius) Cornelius Tacitus (c. AD 56 c. AD 120) was a senator and an historian of the Roman Empire. The surviving portions of his two major worksthe \\"Annals\\" and the \\"Histories\\"examine the reigns of the Roman emperors Tiberius, Claudius, Nero, and those who reigned in the Year of the Four Emperors (AD 69). These two works span the history of the Roman Empire from the death of Augustus, in AD 14, to the years of the First JewishRoman War, in AD 70. There are substantial lacunae in the surviving texts, including a gap in the \\"Annals\\" that is four books long. - In the United Kingdom, a scheduled monument is a 'nationally important' archaeological site or historic building, given protection against unauthorised change. - Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex in Gwynedd , Wales . The fort was constructed under governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78 , and was abandoned around AD 140 . A millennium later , in the Norman period , the site was reoccupied and refortified with a motte within the old walls . It is a scheduled monument in the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority . - The Principality or Kingdom of Gwynedd (Medieval Latin: \\"Venedotia\\" or \\"Norwallia\\"; Middle Welsh: \\"Guynet\\",) was one of several successor states to the Roman Empire that emerged in sub-Roman Britain in the 5th century during the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - An archaeological site is a place (or group of physical sites) in which evidence of past activity is preserved (either prehistoric or historic or contemporary), and which has been, or may be, investigated using the discipline of archaeology and represents a part of the archaeological record. Sites may range from those with few or no remains visible above ground, to buildings and other structures still in use. - Gwynedd Constabulary was the Home Office police force for the counties of Caernarfonshire, Anglesey and Merionethshire, Wales. - Gnaeus Julius Agricola (13 June 40 23 August 93) was a Gallo-Roman general responsible for much of the Roman conquest of Britain. Written by his son-in-law Tacitus, the \\"De vita et moribus Iulii Agricolae\\" is the primary source for most of what is known about him, along with detailed archaeological evidence from northern Britain. - The Roman conquest of Britain was a gradual process, beginning effectively in AD 43 under Emperor Claudius, whose general Aulus Plautius served as first governor of Roman Britain. Great Britain had already frequently been the target of invasions, planned and actual, by forces of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire. In common with other regions on the edge of the empire, Britain had enjoyed diplomatic and trading links with the Romans in the century since Julius Caesar's expeditions in 55 and 54 BC, and Roman economic and cultural influence was a significant part of the British late pre-Roman Iron Age, especially in the south. - Luxembourg, officially the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, is a landlocked country in western Europe. It is bordered by Belgium to the west and north, Germany to the east, and France to the south. Its capital, Luxembourg City, is, together with Brussels and Strasbourg, one of the three official capitals of the European Union and the seat of the European Court of Justice, the highest juridical authority in the EU. Its culture, people and languages are highly intertwined with its neighbors, making it essentially a mixture of French and Germanic cultures. The repeated invasions by its neighbor countries, especially in World War II, resulted in the country's strong will for mediation between France and Germany and led to the foundation of the European Union. What is the relationship between 'tomen y mur' and 'archaeological site'? Answer:","completion":"Tomen y Mur and archaeological site share a relationship in that Tomen y Mur is an archaeological site itself. By definition, an archaeological site is a location where evidence of past human activity is preserved and investigated using the discipline of archaeology. In this case, Tomen y Mur is a Roman fort complex located in Gwynedd, North Wales, and showcases preserved remnants of historical significance from different periods in history. Constructed under the Roman governor Gnaeus Julius Agricola in AD 78, Tomen y Mur was abandoned around AD 140 but later reoccupied during the Norman period and refortified with a motte within the old Roman walls. As a scheduled monument under the care of Snowdonia National Park Authority, Tomen y Mur serves as an important archaeological site providing insight into the Roman and Norman occupations in the region. Archaeological sites such as Tomen y Mur contribute to our understanding of past societies, their cultures, and historical events. By studying the physical remains at these sites, archaeologists are able to piece together information about the people who lived there, their beliefs, social structures, and interactions with neighboring communities. In summary, the relationship between Tomen y Mur and archaeological site is characterized by Tomen y Mur being a prime example of such a site, where its historical remains serve as a testament to the Roman and Norman influence in North Wales and offer valuable insights into their respective societies and the transformation of the landscape over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Bird city had may economic ties with Pine city. Pine city was located in the mountains, and was inhabited by nature lovers and people that protected the environment. Bird city was situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea. They relied mostly on conventional agriculture and used fertilizer for their crops. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city contributed less to marine pollution? Hint: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Pine city. Given the information provided, Pine city contributed less to marine pollution than Bird city. Pine city is located in the mountains and is inhabited by nature lovers and people who protect the environment. This implies that the residents of Pine city are more conscious about their impact on the environment and likely take measures to reduce pollution. In contrast, Bird city is situated on the banks of a large river flowing into the sea and relies mostly on conventional agriculture, using fertilizers for their crops. The use of these agricultural chemicals can contribute to marine pollution, as they can be carried by the river into the ocean. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals from fertilizers leads to hypoxia and the creation of dead zones, which has a significant impact on marine life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Out of boredom, two scientists from the New Contagious Diseases Research Centre devised themselves a new game. One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door. They were tough opponents and even tougher fans - they took from the lab and carried away with them several flasks and some equipment, as it turned out - to set up their own game station in pit number 5. According to the above context, answer the following question. One bacillus can play without getting overly exhausted for how long? Select from the following. (1). A few hours; (2). not enough information; (3). Ten minutes; (4). One week; Answer:","completion":"(1). A few hours"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Just like how you have some chores to do before you can play or watch TV, Cynthia has some tasks she must do first. You see, Cynthia has a pet bunny named Fluffy, and she has to make sure Fluffy has enough food, water, and a clean home. Mary doesn't have a pet, so she doesn't have to worry about taking care of one. Cynthia also needs to help her mom around the house more because her mom isn't feeling well. It's like when you help your mom or dad clean up after dinner, but Cynthia does it for more tasks during the day. Also, Mary lives in a house that has a sunny and open backyard where she can play outside and roam about. Cynthia, on the other hand, lives in an apartment that doesn't have much space to play outside. So, she can't run around as much as Mary. But even though Cynthia has more responsibilities, she still finds time to play and have fun, just like you do.

Story highlights Archie Andrews will die in upcoming issue of \\"Life With Archie\\" \\"Life With Archie\\" is a look at Archie's possible future scenarios Series will end one issue after Archie's death Since 1941, comic book fans have followed the exploits of teenaged Archie Andrews and his friends. This July, they'll find out how he dies. \\"Life With Archie\\" #36 hits stores on July 16, and CNN can reveal exclusively that it tells the story of how Archie sacrifices himself to save a friend. Few details are known, but it seems fitting that Archie would go out a hero. The 37th issue one week later will end the series. The \\"Life With Archie\\" series has been telling the stories of possible future Archie scenarios for the past few years, and so Archie will continue to be alive in the comics set in the present day. JUST WATCHED 'Archie' slated for a violent death Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH 'Archie' slated for a violent death 00:10 CNN spoke with Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater (son of Archie creator John Goldwater) about the upcoming issues. CNN: Can you explain the \\"Life With Archie\\" series for the uninitiated? Goldwater: \\"Life With Archie\\" is Archie's future -- it gives readers a look into what his life would be like after high school and college, which has never really been explored. Most fans are familiar with Archie as a high schooler, hanging out at Pop's Chocklit Shop with his friends. \\"Life With Archie\\" shows what happens when Archie becomes an adult and starts dealing with grownup issues. Each issue is normally split into two storylines -- one telling a tale of Archie married to Veronica another with him ending up with Betty. The final issue, however, will show readers Archie's final fate in both timelines -- and they're the same. CNN: Why kill Archie? Goldwater: I think it's the natural conclusion to the \\"Life With Archie\\" series. Archie dies as he lived -- heroically. He dies saving the life of a friend, and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us -- the best of us. Our strengths and our faults. Writer Paul Kupperberg, with input from myself, has crafted an emotional, impactful and classic story that I know will survive the test of time. This isn't a random one-off or \\"what-if\\" story that we're doing as a gag. This is the story that we mapped out carefully and with much thought. This is the death of Archie as we see it, and we're treating it with that same level of gravitas and import. It's a once-in-a-lifetime event, and we are being very considerate about it. CNN: What are you hoping to accomplish with this storyline? Goldwater: First and foremost, like with anything we do at Archie, we want to tell a great, memorable story. That being said, this story in particular is of the utmost importance to us as a company and as a keeper of the Archie brand. We want to not only show how Archie's life ends, but also what he means to the world around him. We want to celebrate his life. After the events of \\"Life With Archie\\" #36, fans will leap forward a year to see the aftermath, and how his friends have moved on since his surprising death. What's Jughead doing? How are Betty and Veronica dealing with the loss? It's not about the attention-grab of the death but about telling a great, evocative story that reminds people why this character is important to the fabric of pop culture -- and showing how heroic a normal guy like Archie can be, and how important it is to realize that. This isn't a story we're going to retcon a few weeks from now. This happened. This is the conclusion to the \\"Life With Archie\\" story and timeline, and it will allow us as a company and the world to take a moment to look at Archie's life as a whole and recognize him as one of the most important characters -- not in just comics -- but in popular culture. We want people to feel the same emotional roller coaster we felt putting this story together -- to feel the range of emotions, from happiness, sadness, anger, joy and pride. We want people to react to this in a strong way because Archie is so important to them. CNN: How do you hope fans will react ultimately? Goldwater: We expect some level of shock, outrage and surprise -- followed by understanding. As a company, we are not afraid to take risks. We're not scared to shake things up to draw attention to the great stories we're building here at Archie. I hope fans will be intrigued by this news, pick up the issues in July and realize they've been given one of the best comics on the stands. They'll be handed a piece of comic book history, featuring some of the most well-known characters in the world saying goodbye to an icon. We want fans to talk about this for years to come. We think this story is bigger than anything we've ever done -- it's bold, dramatic and best of all, a fitting end to the life of Archie. CNN: What do you think Archie Comics has been doing by shaking things up over the recent years? Archie: We're a sleeping giant. Years ago, before I stepped in as CEO, Archie was seen as a dormant, nostalgia brand stuck in amber. We were in suspended animation. People thought the stories were still set in the '50s! Now, while the characters -- like Betty, Archie, Veronica, Jughead and Reggie -- are at their core the same, Riverdale has changed. It's caught up with the times. The town of Riverdale you read about now is like any other in America. It's diverse, it's not problem-free, and it represents America in an honest way. Archie is about being welcoming, diverse and entertaining. We've managed to strike that balance in our storytelling for the last five years and managed to not only get attention, but keep people entertained. From the introduction of Kevin Keller, the first regular gay character in comics to now, the death of Archie, we've not been afraid to take risks. The big thing is, though, our risks pay off because the stories, art and execution are spot-on. We back up what we say. CNN: What will be the long-term impact of this story? Goldwater: Well, this is the end. This is how Archie dies in the pages of \\"Life With Archie.\\" We will not be retconning, reversing or backtracking on this story in terms of \\"Life With Archie.\\" The main Archie line, however, telling stories of Archie in high school, will continue. \\"Afterlife With Archie\\" [the \\"Archie\\" zombie series] will continue, and we will keep on taking risks with different and new interpretations of our characters. But as far as we see it, this is how Archie dies. That's how we approached this story and how we're treating it. ||||| It breaks my heart a little to learn that Archie Andrews, the freckle-faced teenager who has graced comic books since 1941, is going to die. At least temporarily. In an event comic book that seems inspired by his constantly resurrecting superhero peers, Archie Comics will kill off its hero to end the “Life With Archie” series, which flash-forwarded into different versions of Archie’s future as an adult. (Credit: Courtesy of Archie Comics) “Archie dies as he lived — heroically,” Archie Comics CEO Jon Goldwater told the New York Post. “He dies saving the life of a friend and does it in his usual selfless way. Archie has always been a representation of us — the best of us. Our strengths and our faults.” But part of what has been best about Archie Comics is the way it has tended to avoid the sorts of escalating stakes that characterize superhero comics (even when the Punisher showed up in Riverdale, no one got whacked). As Archie Comics let its titular redhead grow up enough to explore what his life might be like had he married Betty Cooper or Veronica Lodge, Archie Andrews remained a kind of forerunner to “How I Met Your Mother” main character Ted Mosby (Josh Radnor). Precisely because the stakes in Archie’s life were so low, the comics could focus on his quest for true love without making the question of which girl Archie might pick seem silly. The choice between what Michael Chabon described in “The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay” as “the two big-toothed, wasp-waisted goddess-girls, light and dark, entangled forever in the enmity of their friendship” is easy to caricature as average and rich, nice and mean, tomboyish and feminine. But Betty and Veronica represent two competing visions of the American dream that Archie must choose between. Is he aiming for middle-class security with Betty, and a lifestyle they can support on relatively modest careers? Or does Archie truly want to leap classes and try to fit with Veronica and the Lodge family, who are convinced that their wealth is their due? Archie Comics complicated this choice over time, introducing Cheryl Blossom, who was even richer than Veronica, as a potential love interest for Archie and breaking with its past discomfort about interracial dating and telling a story in which Archie marries fellow musician Valerie Brown and has a daughter with her. But whomever Archie paired up with and how we got there, the Archie comics have always been a story that treated decisions about courtship and dating as if they were serious and consequential. Their counterparts in the world of superhero comics may have garnered critical respect and political attention on the big screen by tackling issues like use of drones and the privatization of military equipment. But as Matt Zoller Seitz pointed out in his review of “Man of Steel” last year, “virtually alone among big-name superheroes, [Superman is] a romantically and sexually mature man who seems to like and be comfortable around women.” We all know that Archie Andrews’s preternaturally extended teenage years are a fantasy. But making the comics, however temporarily, about death rather than life, turns away from the franchise’s core purpose. Superhero and crime comics teach us about all the ways we can die. Archie Andrews, in all his bumbling, indecisive, lovelorn foolishness, has always been a character who taught us how we want to live. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"In the upcoming issue of \\"Life With Archie,\\" the comic book character Archie Andrews will die as a hero, sacrificing himself to save a friend.

Article: How would you like to teach yourself, rather than have teachers? According to the UK's Department of Education and Skills, students will teach themselves in the schools of the future. This means that there will be no more problems such as finding enough teachers. Estelle Morris, the UK Education Secretary, opened the 2002 Education Technology Conference in London recently. To start the conference, she presented a video showing a computer--generated model of the school of tomorrow. Greater use of computer technology and classroom assistants will help students develop their own way of learning, Morris said. She added that this is a more exciting as well as a more interesting way of learning. At the same time, teachers will be \\"freed from their traditional role as the source of all knowledge\\". Children of all abilities will \\"form the curriculum around their individual needs.\\" They will \\"learn in their own time, at their own speed and in their own environment\\". At home or at school, they will follow their learning programmes by looking at online libraries and watching lessons by world-class teachers and subject experts. Instead of going on field trips, students will use virtual reality. If they don't understand something, they can ask other students--\\"take part in virtual communities with learners with similar needs\\"--or e-mail their teachers. They will hand in their work electronically to be \\"auto-marked\\". The classroom of the future is fast becoming a reality. And the Department of Education will soon produce a guide to help schools adapt buildings for new technology, Morris said. These ideas are based on the UK government's plan to create an education system that provides students with a strong grounding of knowledge and skills at primary school level. And provides the chance for students to develop their individual skills at secondary school level.

Here is a news article: Mothers who sleep on their back or right-hand side on the night before giving birth are twice as likely to have a stillborn child compared with those who slept on their left, according to a study. Researchers found that the risk of stillbirth for those sleeping on the left side was 1.96 per 1,000 births, and 3.93 per 1,000 births for any other position. Tomasina Stacey, a midwifery lecturer at University of Auckland, who led the study, cautioned pregnant women not to be over-concerned by the finding. \\"It was an observational study, not one that can show cause and effect – all it does is show an association. It would be premature to jump up and down and say that everyone has got to sleep on their left. It's a starting point for future research.\\" In the UK, there were more than 4,000 stillbirths in 2009; almost a third of these occurred late in the pregnancy term, after 37 weeks. \\"Stillbirth is a much bigger problem than most people realise, and many are unexplained,\\" said Stacey. \\"In the UK and New Zealand, there has been very little change in the rate in the last 15 years.\\" For the study, published in the British Medical Journal, she and her colleagues spoke to 155 women who had stillborn babies in Auckland between 2006 and 2009. They were asked about, among other things, their positions on going to sleep and waking up in the final weeks and month before the death of their baby. For the control group, the researchers randomly selected two women who were at the same number of weeks in their pregnancy and questioned them about their sleep in the days and month before the interview. The researchers wanted to examine the effects of sleep disorders in pregnant women, such as sleep apnea or snoring, which could be a factor in stillbirths, because these conditions can reduce the amount of oxygen getting to the baby. Instead, the study showed that sleep position on the night before birth was the decisive factor. Stacey said a possible explanation could be that when a woman does not sleep on her left side, the foetus could compress her inferior vena cava taking blood back to the heart, and a reduced flow means less oxygen gets to the mother's – and in turn the baby's – other organs. \\"If you've got a strong healthy baby, then the slightly reduced blood flow is fine; but if you've got a baby that is compromised in some other way, then maybe that reduction in blood flow can be the tipping point,\\" said Stacey. The left lateral position is known in clinical settings to be the optimal position for looking after a woman in labour and is associated with foetal wellbeing in labour, she added. An accompanying editorial in the journal by Lucy Chappell of King's College London says \\"any simple intervention that reduces the risk of stillbirth would be extremely welcome\\", but argues that the finding should be treated with caution. \\"A forceful campaign urging pregnant women to sleep on their left side is not yet warranted,\\" she said, adding that the study needed to be replicated to be conclusive. Alexander Heazell, of the University of Manchester School of Medicine, also pointed to a weakness – the fact that mothers were asked to recall their sleep position 25 days after a stillbirth. Stacey said her advice to those women who found it uncomfortable to sleep on their left was \\"not to worry about it too much\\". But, she added, at a population level, the associations between position and stillbirth might be important. \\"We could make a difference to the stillbirth rate by encouraging people to sleep on their left.\\" ||||| By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, June 14 (HealthDay News) -- For pregnant women, reducing the risk for stillbirth may be as simple as sleeping on their left side, New Zealand researchers suggest. In fact, women in the study who didn't sleep on their left side had twice the risk of having a stillborn infant, the researchers noted. Overall, \\"the increase in risk [from right-sided sleeping] is small for the individual,\\" stressed lead author Tomasina Stacey, a graduate student in the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Auckland. However, \\"as many women do not sleep on their left side in late pregnancy, it may have an important impact on a population level,\\" she reasoned. \\"This is a new and potentially exciting hypothesis, but further research is required before all women are advised to sleep on their left side in late pregnancy,\\" Stacey concluded. Experts say improved blood flow to the fetus might play a role in any benefit of left-sided sleep, although that remains a theory. The report is published in the June 14 online edition of the BMJ. For the study, the researchers interviewed 155 women who delivered a stillborn baby at at least 28 weeks' gestation. They compared these women with 310 pregnant women with typical ongoing pregnancies. The women were asked about their sleep position during the last month of their pregnancy, the last week of their pregnancy, and on the night they believed the stillbirth occurred. In addition, the women were asked about snoring, daytime sleepiness, if they regularly slept during the day during the last month of pregnancy, how much sleep they got at night and how many times they got up to use the toilet at night. The researchers found no connection between snoring or daytime sleepiness and risk of late stillbirth. However, women who slept on their back or on their right side on the night before a stillbirth were twice as likely to have a late stillbirth, compared with women who slept on their left side. The absolute increase in risk of stillbirth to any one woman remained small, however: Stillbirths occurred in 1.96 per 1,000 cases among women who slept on their left side, versus 3.93 per 1,000 cases for those who slept in the other positions, the investigators found. Women who got up to use the toilet once or less on the last night of their pregnancy were also more likely to have a late stillbirth, compared with women who got up more frequently, the researchers added. And there was a significant link between sleeping regularly during the day and late stillbirth risk, and also longer-than-average sleep at night, the authors said. Still, Stacey was quick to point out that \\"an observational study such as this cannot determine cause-and-effect but it has identified an area that urgently requires further exploration.\\" Lucy Chappell, a clinical senior lecturer in Maternal and Fetal Medicine in the division of women's health at King's College London and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that \\"this is an interesting finding, but we should be cautious about making a large jump to saying that this is the cause of stillbirth. And we should not rush out to run a large campaign to say pregnant women should sleep on their left side.\\" Chappell noted, however, that there are biological reasons that could support the finding. \\"We have long believed that blood flow to the baby, womb and placenta may be better when pregnant women are on their left,\\" she said. Study coauthor Ed Mitchell, professor of child health in the department of pediatrics at the University of Auckland, believes the finding might help cut the number of stillbirths. \\"If this finding is real and there is a causal relationship between maternal sleep and stillbirths, then the rate of stillbirths might be reduced by a third, which is tremendous given that the rate of stillbirth has hardly changed over the last 20 years,\\" he said.

Write a title for this article: “At present there is no cure for Parkinson’s Disease,” says the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. A French nun named Sister Marie Simon-Pierre knows what it’s like to read those words, as she was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease when she was just 40. It was 2001, and Pope John Paul II was already visibly shaking from the disease, so Sister Marie knew where she was headed, and it wasn’t pretty. John Paul died in April of 2005, and Sister Marie began praying that he intercede for her. So did other nuns in her congregation, the Petites Soeurs des Maternites Catholiques. Then, she says, she woke up on June 3 cured, healed from one day to the next. The Vatican had its medical specialists look into the nun’s condition and determined that it was in fact a miracle. While there have been other miracles reportedly worked through the intercession of the late pope, this is the “official” one that allows Pope Benedict to beatify John Paul, or declare him blessed, on May 1. With another miracle, John Paul can be canonized, or made a saint. The miracles are frequently medical cures, inexplicable scientifically. They have to be sudden, complete, and lasting. While John may have done a great deed for Sister Marie – a miracle, really – she’s repaying the favor by coming forward and letting everyone know what happened. She doesn’t look someone who likes the limelight, and you probably won’t be seeing her on the late-night talk shows. But Sister Marie seems to be ready to go through what she has to in order say thanks to her miracle worker. John Paul needed a miracle to get through this point of his sainthood process; in a certain sense, she provided it.

After learning that Texian troops had attacked Castañeda at Gonzales, Cos made haste for Béxar. Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor. This caused an uproar in the garrison, as many supported the governor. Dimmitt declared martial law and soon alienated most of the local residents.

There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody). - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America.

More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest). - The Hale Telescope is a , 3.3 reflecting telescope at the Palomar Observatory in California, US, named after astronomer George Ellery Hale. With funding from the Rockefeller Foundation, he orchestrated the planning, design, and construction of the observatory, but did not live to see its commissioning. The \\"Hale\\" was groundbreaking for its time, with double the diameter of the next largest telescope and pioneering the use of many technologies such as vapor deposited aluminum and low thermal expansion glass. It is still in active use. - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light. - Arizona (O'odham: \\"Al onak\\" [ai onak]) is a state in the southwestern region of the United States.

The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Reflecting telescopes come in many design variations and may employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a \\"catoptric\\" telescope. - The Ivy League is a collegiate athletic conference comprising sports teams from eight private institutions of higher education in the Northeastern United States.

Captain Marvel, also known as Shazam (), is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Artist C. C. Beck and writer Bill Parker created the character in 1939. Captain Marvel first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (cover-dated Feb. 1940), published by Fawcett Comics. The first post-Crisis appearance of Captain Marvel was in the 1986 Legends miniseries. In 1987, Captain Marvel appeared as a member of the Justice League in Keith Giffen's and J. M. DeMatteis' relaunch of that title. That same year (spinning off from Legends), he was given his own miniseries titled Shazam!: The New Beginning. With this four-issue miniseries, writers Roy and Dann Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake attempted to re-launch the Captain Marvel mythos and bring the wizard Shazam, Dr. Sivana, Uncle Dudley, and Black Adam into the modern DC Universe with an altered origin story. Roy Thomas, a veteran comic book writer and editor, had been lured from Marvel Comics to DC in 1981 with the specific contractual obligation that he would become the main writer of Shazam! and the Justice Society of America characters. Before the Crisis, Thomas wrote several of the DC Comics Presents stories featuring the Marvel Family. The most notable change that the Thomases, Giffen, and DeMatteis introduced into the Captain Marvel mythos was that the personality of young Billy Batson is retained when he transforms into the Captain. This change would remain for most future uses of the character as justification for his sunny, Golden-Age personality in the darker modern-day comic book world, instead of the traditional depiction used prior to 1986, which tended to treat Captain Marvel and Billy as two separate personalities. This revised version of Captain Marvel also appeared in one story-arc featured in the short-lived anthology Action Comics Weekly #623-626 (October 25, 1988 - November 15, 1988), in which a Neo-Nazi version of Captain Mazi was introduced. At the end of the arc, it was announced that this would lead to a new Shazam! ongoing series. Though New Beginning had sold well and multiple artists were assigned to and worked on the book, it never saw publication due to editorial disputes between DC Comics and Roy Thomas. As a result, Thomas' intended revival of the Marvel Family with a new punk-styled Mary Bromfield/Mary Marvel (aka \\"Spike\\") who was not Billy's sister, and an African-American take on Freddy Freeman/Captain Marvel Jr., did not see print. Thomas departed DC in 1989, not long after his removal from the Shazam! project. Other attempts at reviving Shazam! were initiated over the next three years, including a reboot project by John Byrne, illustrator of Legends and writer/artist on the Superman reboot miniseries The Man of Steel (1986). None of these versions saw print, though Captain Marvel, the Wizard Shazam, and Black Adam did appear in DC's War of the Gods miniseries in 1991. By this time, DC had finally ceased the fee-per-use licensing agreement with Fawcett Publications and purchased the full rights to Captain Marvel and the other Fawcett Comics characters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What else happen in the 1980s","completion":"The article does not provide any other specific information about what happened in the 1980s related to Captain Marvel/Shazam or any other events.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The center of an atom is held together by powerful forces. This gives them a huge amount of stored energy. This type of energy is called nuclear energy. This energy can be released and used to do work. This happens in nuclear power plants where they split apart the nucleus of an atom. This splitting apart is called nuclear fission. Another type of nuclear energy happens in the Sun. Here the atoms nuclei are not split apart. Instead, the nuclei of the atoms are fused, or joined together. This process is called nuclear fusion. Some of the suns energy travels to Earth. This energy from nuclear fusion warms the planet and provides the energy for photosynthesis. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Yes, it seems that you have a good understanding of nuclear energy, both in terms of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion. To further clarify and expand upon this topic, let's delve into more details about these processes and their applications. 1. Nuclear Fission Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy nucleus, like that of uranium or plutonium, into two smaller nuclei, or fission fragments, along with the release of a large amount of energy. This process is initiated by bombarding the heavy nucleus with a neutron, which causes the nucleus to become unstable and split apart. The energy released during nuclear fission is due to the conversion of some of the mass of the nucleus into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc². The energy released includes kinetic energy of the fission fragments and the emission of high-energy gamma photons and neutrons. Some of these neutrons can go on to cause further fission reactions, creating a sustained chain reaction. Nuclear fission is the principle behind the operation of nuclear power plants. The heat generated from the fission process is used to produce steam, which in turn drives turbines connected to electrical generators, thereby producing electricity. The use of nuclear fission to generate electricity offers several benefits, such as increased energy efficiency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels. However, the handling and disposal of radioactive waste, as well as the potential for accidents and misuse, remain significant challenges. 2. Nuclear Fusion Nuclear fusion is the process of combining two light nuclei, such as hydrogen isotopes, to form a heavier nucleus, along with the release of a tremendous amount of energy. This process occurs naturally in the cores of stars, including our Sun. The high temperatures and pressures present in the core of a star force the nuclei to come close enough together for the strong nuclear force to overcome electrostatic repulsion, allowing them to merge. The energy released during nuclear fusion also results from the conversion of mass into energy, as described by E=mc². The net energy released in a fusion reaction is typically greater than that of a fission reaction, which is why fusion has the potential to be an even more efficient energy source than fission. Researchers around the world are working on developing nuclear fusion technology for use as a clean and virtually limitless energy source. Many experimental reactors, such as ITER (International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor), are being built to study and develop the technology necessary to achieve controlled nuclear fusion on Earth, mimicking the process that occurs naturally in the Sun. The primary challenges in achieving controlled nuclear fusion include the high temperatures and pressures needed, as well as the development of materials that can withstand these extreme conditions. In conclusion, both nuclear fission and fusion are powerful processes capable of releasing vast amounts of energy. While fission is currently utilized in nuclear power plants to generate electricity, fusion holds the promise of an even more efficient and sustainable energy source in the future. However, the safe and responsible use of these technologies remains paramount to address concerns related to radioactive waste, accidents, security, and environmental impacts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What march was invoked when unemployment became a political issue in the 1980s? , can you please find it? Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march.

Build a movie plot around this: Did Rose commit suicide? no Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Last Petal of Rose\\" Step 1: A film plot structure begins with the setup or exposition. Set up: This plot revolves around Rose, a bright, cheerful, and vivacious woman, who had so much to offer to the world. She was an eminent artist residing in New York, captivating people with her enchanting performances and also a beloved figure in her neighborhood, always ready to lend her help to anyone in need. Her sudden mysterious disappearance and assumed death leave the city shocked. Initial investigations indicate suicide, which seems highly unlikely. With no body found and no note, it all feels too suspicious. Step 2: Introduction of the protagonist and rise of the conflict Plot Development: Jacob, a seasoned investigative journalist who has been following Rose's career as an artist for an extended period, finds the conclusions of the police investigations difficult to swallow. Known for his ability to reveal the truth, he decides to dive deeper into Rose's life and her supposed suicide. The \\"conflict\\" here is to uncover the dubious circumstances around Rose's disappearance, setting the stage for the unfolding mystery and investigation. Step 3: Progression of the plot and introduction of key elements Plot Progression: Jacob, through his investigation, uncovers many secrets. He begins to find out that Rose had many anonymous threats and creepy fan encounters. Jacob suspects that there's foul play involved and believes that Rose might have been targeted and possibly kidnapped. The plot thickens further as Jacob receives a mysterious note hinting towards a large-scale art theft racket which Rose might have accidentally unearthed. Step 4: The climax of the plot Climax: Jacob manages to track down the art theft racket, and in a powerful climax, he rescues Rose, who had been held captive by the art racketeers. The racket feared their cover being blown due to Rose's in-depth research for her new play on historical art pieces, leading to a series of events construed as Rose's suicide. Step 5: The resolution or denouement Resolution: The culprits are caught and their crimes exposed, providing justice to all the people duped by them. Rose, scarred but resilient, gradually returns to her life, vowing to use her art to raise awareness about such criminal activities. Jacob and Rose form a bond through the ordeal, promising to face any future adversity together. This plot carefully navigates the intrigue around the question, 'Did Rose commit suicide?' It creates a mystery thriller which intriguingly answers this query with a resounding 'No'. Through this story, we keep the audience on their toes, engaging them in an enthralling tale of art, mystery, and resilience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Sony Introduces Digital Binoculars That Record Photos & HD Videos Sony entered the binocular market on Friday, introducing its DEV-3 and DEV-5 digital binoculars, both capable of capturing 7.1-megapixel still images and 1080 HD videos in either 2D or 3D. The binoculars are the “world’s first digital binoculars with HD video recording, zoom, autofocus and SteadyShot image stabilization,” according to the company’s announcement. SteadyShot image stabilization is the the optical stabilization system that’s found in Sony Handycam camcorders and Cyber-shot cameras — it helps keep images clear and stable, even when viewing at high magnifications. The binoculars come with a rechargeable battery pack that allows up to approximately three hours of 2D recording on a single charge. Also included with both models is a battery charger/adaptor, A/V connecting cable and USB cable for PC connection. There are only slight differences between the two binocular models. While both the DEV-3 and DEV-5 feature 10x optical zooms, the DEV-5 can digitally zoom up to 20x. The biggest difference is the DEV-5′s built-in GPS receiver, which enables it to automatically geo-tag videos and photos. Lastly, the DEV-5 comes with a number of fancy accessories not included with the DEV-3, including a carrying case, neck strap, finder cap, a lens cover and large eye cups. You really have to be an enthusiastic birdwatcher or sports fanatic to shell out for these puppies, though. The DEV-3 comes in at 1,400, and the DEV-5 will be priced at a whopping 2,000. We’re not convinced that a 600 price jump is justified for the addition of DEV-5′s GPS feature, advanced zooming and a few accessories.

It was first performed ( after Handel had left for Italy ) at the Theater am Gänsemarkt in January 1708 . It was probably directed from the harpsichord by Christoph Graupner . The opera was the first part of a double opera , with the second part , Die verwandelte Daphne , intended to be performed on the following evening . Keiser inserted a play in low German , called die lustige Hochzeit , into the opera , afraid that the audience would get tired otherwise . Handel was not pleased , according to Romain Rolland . Only fragments of the score survive , but a copy of the libretto exists in the Library of Congress . The libretto was by Hinrich Hinsch , a lawyer , who also wrote the text for Keiser 's first opera in Hamburg : Mahumet II ( 1696 ) , based on the life of Mehmet II. Hinsch had been writing librettos since 1681 . He died in 1712 . - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann. - Reinhard Keiser (9 January 167412 September 1739) was a popular German opera composer based in Hamburg. He wrote over a hundred operas. Johann Adolf Scheibe (writing in 1745) considered him an equal to Johann Kuhnau, George Frideric Handel and Georg Philipp Telemann (also associated with the Oper am Gänsemarkt), but his work was largely forgotten for many decades. - Christoph Graupner (13 January 1683 in Kirchberg 10 May 1760 in Darmstadt) was a German harpsichordist and composer of high Baroque music who was a contemporary of Johann Sebastian Bach, Georg Philipp Telemann and George Frideric Handel. - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. The Peace of Westphalia finally settled the Thirty Years' War in 1648. Three years later, the Holy Roman Empire found itself on the brink of war when Wolfgang Wilhelm claimed that the normative year imposed by the treaty took precedence over the Treaty of Xanten in regard to church properties. Since more parishes were in Catholic hands in 1624 than a decade before, Wolfgang Wilhelm hoped to stabilize his control over Jülich and Berg. The Aulic Council was still reviewing the evidence when Frederick William declared himself a protector of the Protestant population living in the two duchies. In June 1651, 3,800 Brandenburg troops invaded Berg, killing two civilians, bombarding Wolfgang Wilhelm's palace and seizing a herd of cows belonging to his wife. After rallying at Kaßlerfeld, the Brandenburgers created an encampment at Angermund and unsuccessfully beleaguered Düsseldorf. The Neuburg envoy in Vienna described the incident as a \\"Cow War\\", comparing Brandenburg's ruler to a cattle rustler. By July, Brandenburg had reinforced its expedition by 2,700 troops, mobilizing 16,000 more across its various territories. Wolfgang Wilhelm employed the help of Charles IV, Duke of Lorraine, who launched a counter invasion of Mark with the intention of obtaining provisions for his army. The estates of all five duchies refused to provide money to either side, while Duisburg's city council requested Dutch protection. The Dutch condemned the actions of their former ally, while Sweden persuaded both sides to disengage through their envoy Melchior von Hatzfeldt. By the end of the year, Neuburg and Brandenburg had disbanded their troops. The Aulic Council distributed the church property on the basis of the current year, ending the conflict. Further negotiations in 1666 and 1672 confirmed the 1651 arrangements, putting an end to the dispute.
