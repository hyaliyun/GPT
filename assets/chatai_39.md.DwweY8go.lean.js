In a domestic violence case (in which I was the accused, but by God I was innocent) with my ex girlfriend, the lawyer whom I hired and paid his dues, openly played a wheeling and dealing game for two and a half years with the prosecutor and had mercilessly thrown me in front of the prosecutor. My ex girlfriend was sexually abused by her own uncles at the age of 5 to 9, had a lot of illusions and psychological problems, along with Bi-Polar Disorder, however, dispite my requests, she never had ever visited a psychologist or psychiatrist in her then 24 years of lifetime, fearing she would be forced to unveil the uncles’ child sexual abuse act and this would cause her dismissal from her immediate family. Although I mentioned this to my “so called” lawyer, he refused to mention her unstable psychological condition in the court. I believe by doing so, he also committed a crime by preventing a child sexual abuse case go unveiled. After all these and after having me pushed into loosing my otherwise strong case, I was sentenced with restriction order to my own home, loosing all I had paid for it, loosing my stuff inside home, aforced probation and a forced domestic violence course for no good reason, my so called bloody lawyer also sent to the court a paper indicating that I owed to him and never had paid his dues.

Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the..., what would be the answer ?

While a resurgence in the financial industry greatly improved the city's economic health in the 1980s, New York's crime rate continued to increase through that decade and into the beginning of the 1990s. By the mid 1990s, crime rates started to drop dramatically due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Important new sectors, such as Silicon Alley, emerged in the city's economy. New York's population reached all-time highs in the 2000 Census and then again in the 2010 Census.

I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused.

In mid-1943, Shoup was transferred to the staff of Major General Julian C. Smith, commander of the 2nd Marine Division, and tasked to help plan the invasion of Betio on Tarawa Atoll. Shoup's aggressive leadership style would complement the offensive strategy his superiors were seeking in taking the atoll. He was tasked with drawing up initial plans, designating the landing beaches on Betio for the 2nd Marines, and overseeing some rehearsals at Efate. However, after Colonel William W. Marshall, commander of the 2nd Marines, suffered a nervous breakdown before invasion, Smith promoted Shoup to Colonel and gave him command of the regiment, in spite of Shoup's lack of combat experience. The invasion commenced on 20 November 1943, with Shoup disembarking from Maryland, the flagship for the invasion. His force met heavy resistance on the beaches. His LVT was destroyed by shore fire, and he had to proceed without transportation. As he was wading ashore at around 11:00, he was struck by shrapnel in the legs and received a grazing wound from a bullet in the neck. In spite of these wounds, he rallied the Marines and led them ashore. He was able to coordinate the troops on the beaches and organize them as they began to push inland against an anticipated Japanese counterattack. He continuously organized aggressive attacks on the defenders, and was noted for his bravery and vigour during the conflict. On the second day of the attack, he organized an advance inland, despite heavy casualties among the American troops. By the afternoon, they were winning the battle, and reinforcements began to arrive in force. That night, Shoup was relieved by Colonel Merritt A. Edson, the division's Chief of Staff, who commanded the 2nd Marines for the remainder of the campaign. Six years later, Shoup made a cameo appearance in the movie \\"Sands of Iwo Jima\\" reprising his actions that first night on Tarawa, although he had originally been brought onto the movie as a technical advisor. For his leadership during the assault and the push inland Shoup was awarded the Medal of Honor and the British Distinguished Service Order. For his role in planning the invasion he was awarded the Legion of Merit with \\"V\\" device. He also was awarded the Purple Heart for the combat wounds he suffered during the course of the campaign. Ten years after the assault, Shoup remarked of the operation, \\"there was never a doubt in the minds of those ashore what the final outcome of the battle for Tarawa would be. There was for some seventy-six hours, however, considerable haggling with the enemy over the exact price we would have to pay.\\" In 1968, he returned to Tarawa to dedicate a memorial to the battle and to the American and Japanese troops who had died there.

They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

We need to list the elements from the 1st to the 24th in reverse order. To clarify index value in the list, Python uses 0-indexing, which means the first element in the list is addressed as 0. So, when we say the ith and jth element, in terms of python indexing it will be i-1 and j-1. Here, though, i and j are already 0-indexed. Before extracting, we must remember that list slicing in Python includes the start index but excludes the end index. Therefore, we need to increase the end index by 1 to include the jth element. Given that, to solve the problem: 1. We slice the list from ith index to (j+1)th index. 2. Then, we reverse the list using Python List's reverse() function. Here is the python code which can do the required task: \`\`\`python A = ['689', 'e', '2855', 'T', 'S', 'g', '6001', '9283', '5579', 'P', 'P', '9913', '8385', 'Z', '383', '3937', 'O', 'Y', '4585', 'M', '9695', 'b', 'Z', 'A', 'C', 'd', 'a'] i, j = 1, 24 selected_elements = A[i:j+1] selected_elements.reverse() \`\`\` The elements from the 1st to the 24th, in reverse order, in list A, are what \`selected_elements\` will hold after executing the code.

Do you want a piece of bread?\\" The dog was very hungry and went to the boy, but he didn't give it any of his bread. Instead, he kicked the dog. It ran away and the boy laughed. Then Mr Stilwell came out of his house and said to the boy, \\"Do you want a dollar?\\" The boy was happy and said, \\"Yes, I do.\\" \\"Come here,\\" Mr Stilwell said. The boy went to Mr. Stilwell, but Mr Stilwell didn't give him a dollar. Instead, he hit him with a stick. The boy cried and said, \\"Why did you hit me? I didn't ask you for any money.\\" \\"No,\\" Mr. Stilwell said, \\"and the dog didn't ask you for any bread, but you kicked it.\\" Question: What can we learn from the passage? Options: A: We should never play tricks on others. B: Mr Stilwell was so bad to hit the boy. C: Mr Stilwell was the boy's father. D: People in Western countries like dogs. The answer is:","completion":"A: We should never play tricks on others. The passage demonstrates a lesson in treating others fairly and not playing tricks or being cruel to them. In the story, the boy tricks the hungry dog by offering it bread, but then kicks it instead of feeding it. Mr. Stilwell then does a similar action to the boy, teaching him a lesson about how it feels to be on the receiving end of such behavior. This situation emphasizes the importance of not playing tricks on others."},{"prompt":"Given a sentence in Bulgarian, generate a new Bulgarian sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up. Select from the following. (I) unacceptable (II) acceptable","completion":"A linguist would find the sentence \\"Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up.\\" to be acceptable (II) in terms of English grammar. First, let us break down the sentence to better understand its structure and components. The sentence consists of two main clauses: 1. Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good. 2. So tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up. Both clauses share the same structure, starting with an adverb (\\"tonight\\") followed by a noun clause acting as the subject (\\"what Bob cooked yesterday\\"), a verb, and a complement. In the first clause, \\"still tastes good\\" describes the condition of the food, while in the second clause, \\"will be eaten up\\" indicates the future action related to the food. The two clauses are connected with a coordinating conjunction, \\"so,\\" which demonstrates the cause-and-effect relationship between the two clauses. The fact that the food still tastes good (the cause) leads to the decision to eat it (the effect). Though the sentence might seem cumbersome and repetitive to some, each element fulfills a grammatical function, and there is no violation of syntax rules. Thus, a linguist would likely recognize the sentence as acceptable in terms of English grammar. Nonetheless, it is important to note that what constitutes a grammatically acceptable sentence may vary among different linguistic communities and registers. In some contexts, particularly casual or colloquial speech, speakers might prefer shorter and simplified sentences. For example: \\"The food Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so we'll eat it tonight.\\" The alternative sentence conveys the same meaning but uses more concise phrasing. However, such stylistic preferences do not negate the grammatical acceptability of the original sentence. In conclusion, the given sentence, \\"Tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday still tastes good, so tonight, what Bob cooked yesterday will be eaten up,\\" is acceptable (II) from a grammatical standpoint. While it may be considered repetitive or overly complex, it follows the rules of English syntax and communicates its intended meaning effectively."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the right side of the equation, you have two terms with the variable u, which are -1038*u and 1207*u. Combine these terms by adding them together: -1038*u + 1207*u = (1207 - 1038)*u = 169*u Now the equation becomes: 1521 = 169*u Step 2: Isolate the variable u on one side of the equation. To isolate u, you need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of u, which is 169: 1521 / 169 = 169*u / 169 Step 3: Simplify and solve for u. Divide 1521 by 169: 1521 ÷ 169 = 9 So the equation becomes: 9 = u The solution to the equation 1521 = -1038*u + 1207*u is u = 9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Those of you who are regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that I suffer from a very sensitive, itchy scalp and I am constantly on the hunt for haircare products that are natural and non-irritating but that also treat my hair well and leave it feeling soft, shiny and clean. So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage.

Article: Money spent on advertising is money spent as well as any I know of. It serves directly to assist a rapid distribution of goods at reasonable prices, thereby establishing a firm home market and so making it possible to provide for export at competitive prices. By drawing attention to new ideas it helps enormously to raise standards of living. By helping to increase demand it ensures an increased need for labor, and is therefore an effective way to fight unemployment. It lowers the costs of many services: without advertisements your daily newspaper would cost four times as much, the price of your television license would need to be doubled, and travel by bus or tube would cost 20 per cent more. And perhaps most important of all, advertising provides a guarantee of reasonable value in the products and services you buy. Apart from the fact that twenty-seven Acts of Parliament govern the terms of advertising, no regular advertiser dare promote a product that fails to live up to the promise of his advertisements. He might fool some people for a little while through misleading advertising. He will not do so for long, for mercifully the public has the good sense not to buy the inferior article more than once.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders, who was asked to leave a Virginia restaurant days ago, told reporters on Monday that \\"calls for harassment and a push for any Trump supporter to avoid the public is unacceptable.\\" She was referring to comments from Congresswoman Maxine Waters, who previously has called for President Donald Trump's impeachment. Waters told supporters, \\"If you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd. And you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore, anywhere.\\" The most prominent Democrat in the House of Representatives, however, disagreed with Walters. \\"Trump's daily lack of civility has provoked responses that are predictable but unacceptable,\\" Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi said on Twitter on Monday. \\"As we go forward, we must conduct elections in a way that achieves unity from sea to shining sea.\\" Pelosi's tweet included a link to a CNN story about Waters encouraging harassment of Trump administration officials. Trump also responded to Water's remarks, saying on Twitter that the congresswoman — whom he referred to as an \\"extraordinarily low IQ person\\" — had called for his supporters to be harassed.

You generally have a right to do whatever you please in the place you call home, as long as you’re not hurting anyone else. That means there’s no better place to shed your clothes than your own backyard. If you have enough well-screened space, you might even be able to do some sunbathing or go for a pleasant stroll. A wooded grove or field set far back from the road can make a perfect place to strut your stuff. In most countries, it’s almost always against the law to be in public places, like the park or the local convenience store, without clothing. There, you’ll be free to roam around at will without fear of judgment or legal repercussions. You’ll also have a chance to speak with other nudists and gain some insight into their way of life. They may even be able to offer you useful pointers on how to go naked in more places and situations. Many towns have resorts that are specifically designated for practicing nudists. Run a quick internet search to see if there’s one of these sites near you. Always be respectful of others who have chosen to live as nudists. It takes a lot of courage to be naked in front of others, and there’s no room for harassment or ridicule. Plan your next vacation for somewhere like the South of France or Australia’s Samurai Beach, where nudity is not only permitted but encouraged. You’ll save room in your suitcase by not having to pack a swimsuit, and by the time you leave you’ll have the most even tan of your life. Just don’t forget to bring sunscreen!

I came away feeling exactly the same way as before, let down. The plot never really grabbed me like I thought it would. Also, I never really cared for the character of Joe. Emotionally and physically scared by an abusive father, Joe grows attached to his foster family, and even becomes his adopted father Will's personal driver. When Will is murdered Joe decides to uncover the mystery behind his death on his own. Sounds like it could be interesting huh? Well, seems like most of you have but I just coulded get into this one. When it was over I was relieved, and that's not a good feeling. Sorry, maybe the third time will be a charm, but I don't see myself reading this again just to come away with the same opinion. Answer: Answer:","completion":"No, this product review is not positive.

It can be inferred that the reviewer may have found it to be an enjoyable experience, or have appreciated some aspect of the film, such as the acting, script, or cinematography. There could be varying reasons for the positive reception. The movie might have an original and captivating storyline, which is engaging to its audience. Another possibility is that the film may have well-developed characters and impressive performances from its cast, resulting in an emotional connection between viewers and the on-screen personas.

Jackson denied the claims and settled the civil case out of court for a payment of 15 million plus legal fees; the settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. No criminal charges were filed. In 2005, following further allegations, prompted by the 2003 documentary Living with Michael Jackson in which he was holding hands with a boy named Gavin Arvizo and talked about his sleepovers with children, Jackson was acquitted of child sexual abuse charges.In 2013, choreographer Wade Robson filed a civil lawsuit alleging that Jackson had sexually abused him for seven years, beginning when he was seven years old. In 2014, a case was filed by James Safechuck after seeing an interview with Robson, alleging sexual abuse over a four-year period from the age of ten. Both had previously testified in defense of Jackson — Safechuck as a child during the 1993 investigation, Robson both as a child in 1993 and as a young adult in 2005. In 2015, Robson's case against Jackson's estate was dismissed on the grounds that it had been filed too late, and in 2017 it was ruled that neither of the corporate entities formerly owned by Jackson could be held accountable for Jackson's alleged actions.In the film, Robson, Safechuck, and their respective families describe their relationship with Jackson.

Question: George V's father liked? Context: The last major building work took place during the reign of King George V when, in 1913, Sir Aston Webb redesigned Blore's 1850 East Front to resemble in part Giacomo Leoni's Lyme Park in Cheshire. This new, refaced principal façade (of Portland stone) was designed to be the backdrop to the Victoria Memorial, a large memorial statue of Queen Victoria, placed outside the main gates. George V, who had succeeded Edward VII in 1910, had a more serious personality than his father; greater emphasis was now placed on official entertaining and royal duties than on lavish parties. He arranged a series of command performances featuring jazz musicians such as the Original Dixieland Jazz Band (1919) – the first jazz performance for a head of state, Sidney Bechet, and Louis Armstrong (1932), which earned the palace a nomination in 2009 for a (Kind of) Blue Plaque by the Brecon Jazz Festival as one of the venues making the greatest contribution to jazz music in the United Kingdom. George V's wife Queen Mary was a connoisseur of the arts, and took a keen interest in the Royal Collection of furniture and art, both restoring and adding to it. Queen Mary also had many new fixtures and fittings installed, such as the pair of marble Empire-style chimneypieces by Benjamin Vulliamy, dating from 1810, which the Queen had installed in the ground floor Bow Room, the huge low room at the centre of the garden façade. Queen Mary was also responsible for the decoration of the Blue Drawing Room. This room, 69 feet (21 metres) long, previously known as the South Drawing Room, has a ceiling designed specially by Nash, coffered with huge gilt console brackets.

In his lecture Memoir upon the formation of a deaf variety of the human race presented to the National Academy of Sciences on November 13, 1883 he noted that congenitally deaf parents were more likely to produce deaf children and tentatively suggested that couples where both parties were deaf should not marry. However, it was his hobby of livestock breeding which led to his appointment to biologist David Starr Jordan's Committee on Eugenics, under the auspices of the American Breeders' Association. The committee unequivocally extended the principle to man. From 1912 until 1918 he was the chairman of the board of scientific advisers to the Eugenics Record Office associated with Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York, and regularly attended meetings. In 1921, he was the honorary president of the Second International Congress of Eugenics held under the auspices of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. Organisations such as these advocated passing laws (with success in some states) that established the compulsory sterilization of people deemed to be, as Bell called them, a \\"defective variety of the human race.\\" By the late 1930s, about half the states in the U.S. had eugenics laws, and California's compulsory sterilization law was used as a model for that of Nazi Germany.

Continue the following story. The shirt soaked in more of the water in one round than the towel did. It turned out the pick from the following. 1. shirt is more absorbent.. 2. towel is more absorbent..","completion":"At first, it seemed impossible, but it quickly became apparent that the shirt was indeed more absorbent than the towel. Henry, who was using the shirt to clean up the mess, couldn't believe his eyes. His logic told him that the purpose of a towel was to be absorbent; how could a simple shirt outperform it? Curiosity piqued, he started to investigate the fabric of the shirt carefully. It was made of a thick cotton material with a unique weave, allowing it to retain more water than he initially suspected. The fibers absorbed the water quickly, thus enabling the shirt to soak up more water than the terry cloth towel he had been using. The towel, on the other hand, had an entirely different story. Whether it was because of age or frequent usage, the towel's absorbency had declined significantly. The once-plush fabric had become flattened and stiff over time. Henry realized that he had been recently noticing that his towel took longer than usual to dry him off after showers. Eager to learn more, he conducted some research on textile materials and the factors that contribute to their absorbency. Henry discovered a myriad of reasons behind the differences in absorption levels. The thickness of the fabric, quality of the materials used, and the weaving patterns could all affect the absorbency rate. He also found some interesting information about hydrophilic fibers, which are fibers that attract and hold water. Cotton, as it turned out, is a hydrophilic fiber, making it highly absorbent. As he continued his research, he stumbled upon several studies evaluating the water-wicking properties and absorbency of various fabrics. He learned that manufacturers had even developed new materials, such as microfiber and highly absorbent synthetic blends, to increase the absorption capabilities of towels, clothing, and other textile products. A newfound appreciation for textiles blossomed within Henry, and he became determined to find the perfect towel. He sought a product that would bring together the greatest minds and most advanced materials to create unparalleled absorbency – a towel far superior to his current one. Throughout the following weeks, Henry explored various online stores and explored the innovations in the textile industry. He learned about the features that would ensure excellent drying experience, such as better absorbency, quick-dry technology, and even antimicrobial properties to keep his new towel fresh. Finally, feeling confident in his research, he purchased an advanced microfiber towel that had exceptional online reviews and features that he craved. Upon receiving his new towel, he was amazed at how thin and soft it was while maintaining incredible absorbency. At last, he felt satisfied, having discovered the path to the perfect towel. One day, he looked at the shirt that had sparked his journey and smiled. He never thought a soaked shirt could lead to such an educational and fulfilling adventure, but there it was. Now, equipped with his newly purchased towel, Henry felt ready to tackle any water-related challenges that life may throw his way. Meanwhile, the old towel was given a new purpose and repurposed into cleaning rags for different household chores, proving that every textile item has its own unique value and potential."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shortly before midnight Friday, Bristol police officers responded to a call about an intoxicated woman sleeping at City Sports. The woman, identified as 22-year-old Kelsey James, was taken to Bristol Hospital for treatment and evaluation, according to a Bristol police press release. More than five hours later, James was lucid and asked hospital staff about her 2-year-old daughter, police said. Police officers obtained a description of James' car, which was parked in the City Sports parking lot. Police found the toddler sleeping in a car seat. The child was taken to Bristol Hospital for evaluation and was being held for Connecticut child welfare authorities, police said. James, a Bristol resident, was arrested Saturday and charged with risk of injury to a minor and leaving an unsupervised child in a motor vehicle. She was released on a 50,000 surety bond for appearance in Bristol Superior Court on September 2, police said. Attempts to reach James for comment were unsuccessful. Should the government step in to prevent hot car deaths? On Wednesday, the Connecticut medical examiner ruled the death of a 15-month-old boy who was left in his father's car in July a homicide. The cause of Benjamin Seitz's death was hyperthermia because of environmental exposure, the state medical examiner said. On July 7, Kyle Seitz was supposed to drop his son off at day care in Ridgefield, Connecticut, but the dropoff never occurred, his wife, Lindsey Rogers-Seitz told CNN last month. Seitz drove to work, and at the end of the day, picked Ben up at day care, only to realize he was not there. That was when Seitz found his son in the car. He rushed the child to the hospital, but Ben had died. No criminal charges have beeen filed in the boy's death, but state prosecutors said the investigation was continuing. Benjamin Seitz's death came in the wake of the June case of 22-month-old Cooper Harris, whose death after being left in a hot car in Georgia drew international attention.","completion":"A little girl was found sleeping in a car while her mommy was sleeping inside a bar because she drank too much.

Interview: Gilbert and George It is George who opens the door of their expansive, oddly church-like house on one of east London's most beautifully preserved streets, looking, as always, like an eccentric vicar on a day off. The stiff suit, posh voice and formal handshake are all straight out of another time when protocol was all, and civility the norm rather than the exception. 'Welcome, welcome,' he says, but, as soon as the door closes behind you, you wonder what kind of world you are being welcomed into. He leads me down a long, wood-lined hallway, though a door that leads into a small courtyard, and into another even more expansive house which has been converted into a studio. There Gilbert, looking, as always, like a slightly mad bank manager, is waiting. He is smaller, more effusive, and, for all his adopted English formality, still sounds definably Italian, almost comically so. \\"Allo,' he beams, and bids me sit down at a long table, where I am given an invite to their new show. It features a black cross on a white background overlaid with the show's title: 'Sonofagod Pictures', and underneath, the subtitle, 'Was Jesus Heterosexual?' It is pure Gilbert & George: slightly provocative, slightly perverse, a little bit bonkers but in an ordered and obsessive way. A bit like their studio environment, their work, themselves. 'We like the title, \\"Sonofagod\\"', says Gilbert, looking pleased as Punch, 'because, if you say it in a certain way, it sounds like son-of-fag-got.' This amuses him greatly and he dissolves into silent giggles. George smiles down on him like an indulgent headmaster. 'Always the double meaning,' he says. 'That's what life's about. Not dogmatism.' I notice they have used the word 'mufti' in one of their new works, a very Gilbert & Georgian word. 'Oh, a wonderful word, indeed,' says George, smiling. 'But we found out it has another meaning apart from the English one. It's also a person who can issue a fatwa. Terrifying, really.' We have assembled on their home turf to talk art, religion, and maybe even politics, the three topics guaranteed to ruin any drink-fuelled dinner party. Luckily, Gilbert & George don't drink like they used to back in the Seventies, which was in an ordered, obsessive and drop-down-dead-drunk way, in the cause of Art. In their day, it is said, they could have taught the YBAs a thing or two about oblivion. Now, as they approach the age when ordinary people consider retiring - Gilbert is 62, George 64 - their art and life share a more sombre hue, though they still seem determined to shake things up. 'Mufti' is only the start of it. 'We think the Pope should be dragged into the court of human rights,' says George, when I ask why he is so exercised by religion. 'All the suffering these people have invented and perpetuated. Think of the Pope's policy on condoms: how can you not be angry?' Gilbert nods: 'Saying you should make holes in the condoms! Holes! Absurd, no?' It could be a conceptual art piece, I say, a condom with a hole in it. They both laugh, then fall oddly silent. So, it's Catholicism you're against, I ask. Isn't that a bit of an easy target? Surely you should be confronting Muslim extremism? Now, that would be brave - or foolhardy. 'Oh, they're all the same,' says George. 'Same tradition. A bit more totalitarian.' He walks over to the studio door and begins reading from a poster pinned to it in his best C of E voice: 'Verily, it is time to rejoice in the coming state of Islam. There will be no negotiation with Islam. It is only a short time before the flag of Islam flies over Downing Street...?' He walks back to the table. 'Extraordinary, no?' Gilbert nods in agreement. 'It came through the letter box. Unbelievable! Every Friday they hand these leaflets out on Brick Lane.' He shakes his head in bemusement. 'The old generation of Muslims were subdued but not the young generation. Sometimes they go around at night and smash in doors. Ours!' Hadn't you better be careful, I say, in these uncertain times, what with blasphemy laws and incitement laws, not to mention roving gangs of fundamentalists, actual fatwas... 'Oh, we're always careful,' says Gilbert, ' We don't like to confront or be offensive. Ever.' I am just about to mention the 'Naked Shit Pictures' they made in the Nineties, or the 'Dirty Word Pictures' from the Seventies but George is already off on a tangent. 'We had a visit from the Bishop of Stepney recently,' he says. 'I told him we had quite a following among the clergy, which is true. He said, very sweetly, \\"I'm not surprised at all, dear boy.\\"' Gilbert giggles. 'We always seem to have at least one vicar at our openings, don't we, George?' 'Always,' says George. What is it, I ask, that attracts the odd vicar? 'I think a lot of them feel we are the nearest modern art comes to exploring their subject,' says George sincerely. 'Picasso never did it, did he?' Gilbert shakes his head. 'Never,' he says. 'Sex and religion are still the great taboos in modern art.' George nods. 'Extraordinary really. You just have to say the words \\"gay vicar\\", and it all goes mad.' George giggles some more. 'Or, \\"lesbian pope!\\"' he chortles. In his catalogue essay for the new Gilbert & George show, Michael Bracewell invokes the guiding spirits of Baudelaire and TS Eliot but makes no mention at all of Morecambe and Wise. In person, though, Gilbert & George are British art's greatest and longest-running double act, although you'd be hard-pressed to say who's the straight guy, which one is Ernie, and which one Eric. They met in 1967 when, like the girl in the Pulp song, they were studying sculpture at St Martin's college. 'Since we left that place,' says Gilbert, proudly, 'they have never wanted anything to do with us.' Back then, Gilbert was Gilbert Proesch and hailed from a small village in the Dolomites, George was George Passmore from Plymouth. In the iconoclastic spirit of the times, they rejected sculpture and surnames, and decided to turn themselves into a living work of art. They have remained one ever since, their oddness congealing into a kind of signature, as instantly identifiable as the pictures they make. Initially, though, they called themselves 'The Singing Sculpture', and specialised in a deadpan version of 'Underneath the Arches', which they delivered standing still, side by side in their suits, their hands and faces painted bronze. A friend who saw them back then says they were 'odd but ubiquitous', and they have remained so ever since. They have been together, in art and in life, for 40-odd years now, somehow staying abreast of the times by making art that, as George once put it, 'is both old and young'. They first entered the mainstream conscious fleetingly in 1977 when their show 'Dirty Words Pictures' briefly made headlines with its blend of smut and shock tactics, only to be outdone in the outrage stakes by the Sex Pistols swearing on TV. One controversial piece from that time featured their blank, vicarish faces staring out above the word 'BUGGER', and they have traded on that paradox ever since, their apparent normalness contrasting with, and heightening, the apparent obscenity of their subject matter. In the Eighties they provoked a storm of criticism for the seemingly ultra-nationalist emblems embedded in their work, and for a picture of an Asian man alongside the word 'Paki'. One man's insult is another man's art provocation. Later still they attracted a thousand people a day to the South London Gallery for their show 'Naked Shit Paintings', which featured them doing exactly what it said on the invite. 'They never knew what we would do next,' says Gilbert. 'That is why we were not invited to the Venice Biennale for so long. They thought we might embarrass them.' George takes over. 'We like to ask questions, and provoke thought through our work. So much modern art is timid, it is made for collectors, and it just sits there on the wall, almost invisible.' George then describes one of his great epiphanies concerning the condition of modern art. He was undertaking one of his daily walks through London when, as he puts it, 'I was suddenly confronted by a wall on which a person had written the words, \\"My Wife Sucks Dogs Balls\\"'. It suddenly struck me how tame and middle-class so-called confrontational art is. It's not shocking at all, is it, compared to that. It's tame and it's timid. Only the terminally middle-class could be shocked by it.' Ironically, though, the same might now be said of their own work, which has become a signature of sorts, instantly recognisable, reassuringly familiar. Despite all their shock tactics over the last three decades, they have inevitably become a fixture on the British art scene, and even a kind of national treasure: the odd couple who delight in making dirty pictures. On their daily walks from Spitalfields to Dalston, where they dine nightly in the same Turkish restaurant, old ladies often come up to them on the street and shake their hands. 'We always say, they really like us, or they are on Prozac,' giggles Gilbert. Now their self-styled outsider status is also under threat from the embrace of the art establishment that for so long held them at arm's length. Next year, after decades of what they describe as 'total neglect' in Britain, there will be a major retrospective of their work at Tate Modern. What once was shocking now seems perfectly acceptable, familiar even. Recently, too, they moved from the Antony d'Offay gallery to the altogether more trendy White Cube, owned by Brit Art maverick Jay Jopling. When I ask them why they split with D'Offay after 20 years, Gilbert narrows his eyes theatrically and says, 'We hated him. He got under our skin. Slowly. He was of the opinion that he was more important than the artist.' George nods in agreement. 'Jay is wonderful. Charismatic.' They tell me they first met Jopling when he was 'just a little teenager'. Apparently he knocked on their door in 1986, collecting money for charity. 'For the big show in the park,' says Gilbert. 'For Sir Bob,' says George, 'Can you imagine?' Frankly, no. Jopling, they tell me, was also a teenage fan, and his very first art purchase was one of their early books. These days, Gilbert & George's art is of the more emblematic kind: big, backlit assemblages, heavy on symbolism, overlaid with text, both po-mo in its playfulness and oddly medieval in style. There is a certain campness there still, but they have shed the outright smuttiness, the nudity, the profanity and innuendo, in favour of a kind of epic modern symbolism that can be both ominous and baffling. You can look at a Gilbert & George work until the cows come home, checking out the gamut of imagery, from Masonic to heraldic, Hebraic to pagan, and never really get to the bottom of what it is they are on about, save for some fusing of opposites: sacred and profane, iconoclastic and traditional, elevated and debased. I ask them to talk me through the picture inside the invite. It is a work in black, grey and gold, with four crosses in the foreground, each one bearing a bizarre Christlike figure, one of which has two heads, another of which looks like the Alien in Ridley Scott's film of the same name. Various symbols are arranged around the crosses: the three-legged insignia of the Isle of Man, the crescent moon and star of Turkey, a crown, a Judaic ornament, and two mildly phallic metal objects that look like bullets. Gilbert & George are there in the background, as always, though out-of-focus and opaque, waving out of this symbolic minefield like bemused tourists. It seems ordered and, at the same time, oddly haphazard. What though, does it all mean? 'We couldn't possibly say,' sighs Gilbert. 'It's all about life. Emotion. But I cannot explain it. That is not the job of the artist. You just cannot read an artwork in that way. It's how you connect, how you feel. When I stand in front of a small painting by Samuel Palmer, it is just mysterious. That is its power. It has no fixed meaning. It evades words.' George nods. 'Do you know what these are?\\" he says, pointing at the small phallic objects. 'Prayer containers. Everyone in Brick Lane is wearing one. And they look like bullets. Extraordinary, no?' In the past 40 years they have seen their adopted East End neighbourhood change dramatically. 'It was Jewish when we arrived,' says George, 'then it got arty, then Maltese, then Somali, then the city boys came. Now it's families, and the new art elite.' (Tracey Emin lives around the corner, Jake and Dinos Chapman have a studio just up the road, Rachel Whiteread a house just down the street.) 'We were here first, though,' says Gilbert, and, in more ways than one, this is true. The only people people Gilbert & George's art seems to offend these days are the Reverend Ian Paisley, whose followers famously picketed a recent Gilbert & George show in Belfast, and Brian Sewell, the equally puritanical art critic of the Evening Standard, whose loathing for conceptualism is limitless and obsessive. 'Oh, Belfast was very good!' says George, 'They all had megaphones...' 'And raincoats!' says Gilbert, mysteriously. 'They were chanting \\"Sodom and Gomorrah\\" over and over,' continues Gilbert, beaming at the memory. 'I asked one of them, \\"Where exactly is that club? It sounds great.\\"' When I mention Sewell's name, George strides out of the room, and returns, moments later, brandishing a sheet of paper. 'Found it!' he says, excitedly. 'It's all the key words from a Brian Sewell review of one of our shows. We wrote them down for posterity.' He begins reading aloud in his best Sewell voice: '\\"Posers, trivial, clean, dirty, dick, lowlife, unkempt, lavatory, ejaculation, emptying bowels, bladder, comely adolescent boy, four-letter words, black penis springing from white loins, Gilbert's anus, youth with greasy torso, sodomolenos, tapioca de wankeur, schoolboy smut, bilge, blasphemy.\\"' He shakes his head in wonder, 'All in one review!' George is giggling again. 'Tapioca de wankeur!' he says, barely able to get the words out. 'It's so good, it's almost art.' They are both laughing now, and you feel like they could go on like this forever, bouncing ideas, jokes, words, pictures off each other, always secure in the knowledge that their vision is, at least, a shared one, and that the last laugh will somehow always be theirs.

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, Zvuki Mu and Birdland are both rock bands, although they have distinct characteristics and come from different regions and time periods. In order to provide a comprehensive answer, let's delve into the individual profiles of each band and then explore their similarities and differences. Zvuki Mu: Zvuki Mu is a Russian rock band formed in the early 1980s in Moscow. The group was led by the eccentric and talented singer-songwriter Pyotr Mamonov, who was known for his distinctive stage presence and thought-provoking lyrics. The music of Zvuki Mu can be characterized as a blend of post-punk, new wave, and experimental rock, with a unique approach to sound and lyrics that reflect the socio-political climate of the time. The band's debut album, \\"Zvuki Mu,\\" was released in 1989 and produced by the famous British musician Brian Eno. Zvuki Mu gained critical acclaim, both locally and internationally, for their original sound and thought-provoking lyrics. With Eno's help, the band was able to tour Europe, showcasing their music to a broader audience. Zvuki Mu continued to release albums and perform live until their eventual disbandment in the early 2000s. Birdland: Birdland is a British rock band that emerged in the late 1980s, consisting of brothers Robert and Anthony Vincent, Simon Scott, and Steve Weston. Their music can be classified as a fusion of punk rock, indie, and alternative rock, with influences from bands such as The Stooges, The Velvet Underground, and The Jesus and Mary Chain. Birdland released their self-titled debut album in 1991, which featured high-energy songs, driven by catchy guitar riffs and raw vocals. The band received significant attention from the British music press and developed a dedicated fan base. However, despite their initial success, Birdland struggled to maintain momentum and disbanded in the mid-1990s. Similarities and Differences: Both Zvuki Mu and Birdland are rock bands that were active during different time periods and originated from different countries; however, they share some similarities. They both infused their music with punk elements and a raw and energetic sound, resonating with audiences looking for something fresh and distinctive. Moreover, each band gained critical acclaim and attention within their respective scenes, experiencing varying degrees of commercial success. In terms of differences, Zvuki Mu's music is more experimental and avant-garde compared to Birdland's more straightforward punk rock sound. Additionally, the lyrical content and themes of Zvuki Mu's songs often reflected the complex socio-political landscape of Russia during the 1980s, while Birdland's lyrics generally revolved around more typical themes of love, loss, and rebellion. In conclusion, Zvuki Mu and Birdland are indeed both rock bands that brought something unique and exciting to the rock scene. While their musical styles differ and they emerged from separate regions, they each contributed to the diversification of rock music during their active years, leaving a lasting impact on fans and future generations of musicians alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The dog is asleep on the patio. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, as both the premise and the hypothesis contradict each other in terms of the dog's action and location. Let's examine both the premise and the hypothesis in detail. Premise: A tan colored dog leaps into the inground pool. In this premise, we are provided with the information that there is a specific dog, which is tan-colored. The key action described is that the dog is leaping into an inground pool. This action places the dog in the midst of a dynamic physical activity, most likely interacting with the water and engaging with the surroundings. Hypothesis: The dog is asleep on the patio. In the given hypothesis, we are supposed to infer whether the dog is asleep on the patio or not. The act of sleeping typically involves being stationary, passive, and resting in a specific location, which in this case is mentioned to be on the patio. The contradiction between the premise and the hypothesis can be primarily observed in terms of the activity and location of the dog. The premise mentions the action of leaping into an inground pool, while the hypothesis suggests that the dog is asleep on the patio. The two statements cannot both be true at the same time. If the premise is true, the tan-colored dog is indeed leaping happily into the pool, actively engaging with water, and not sleeping. In contrast, if the hypothesis is true, the dog is in a completely different location (on the patio) and in a state of rest or sleep, which is incompatible with the action described in the premise. In conclusion, if the premise is true, we cannot assume that the hypothesis is also true as both statements describe different actions and locations for the dog. The nature and setting of the actions mentioned in the premise and hypothesis are mutually exclusive, and hence, it is impossible for them both to be true simultaneously."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

What is the answer for the question: What was the specific Roger Pratt philosophy whose consequence resulted in the family occupying the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre? from the following article ? The plan of the rooms at Belton was passé for a grand house of its time. Following the Restoration and the influx of European ideas, it had become popular for large houses to follow the continental fashion of a suite of state rooms consisting of a withdrawing room, dressing room, and bedroom proceeding from either side of a central saloon or hall. These rooms were permanently reserved for use by a high ranking guest, such as a visiting monarch. While Belton does have a saloon at its centre, enfilades of state rooms of lessening grandeur do not flank it. The possible reason for this unusual layout is that, while the Brownlows possessed great wealth, their title was only a baronetcy, and their fortune was barely a century old. They would have been regarded as gentry, not aristocracy. As a result, building a suite of state rooms would have been in hope rather than anticipation of a royal guest. However, the lack of a fashionable and formal suite of state apartments coupled with the Brownlows' lack of social credentials did not prevent a visit from King William III to the newly completed house in 1695. The King occupied the \\"Best bedchamber\\", a large room with an adjoining closet, directly above the saloon, that led directly from the second floor Great Dining Chamber.This design followed the older style of having reception rooms and bedrooms scattered over the two main floors. The layout used followed Roger Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. As a consequence of this philosophy, the family occupied the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings, with the state rooms in the centre. The great staircase, designed to be grand and imposing, rose to the east side of the house, and formed part of the guest's state route from the Hall and Saloon on the first floor to the principal dining room and bedroom on the second.The principal entrance hall, reception and family bedrooms were placed on the ground and first floors above a low semi-basement containing service... Answer:","completion":"The specific Roger Pratt philosophy mentioned in the article, which resulted in the family occupying the rooms on the first and second floors of the west and east wings with the state rooms in the center, is Pratt's theory that guest and family rooms should be quite separate. This design approach aimed to create a distinction between the spaces reserved for family members and those intended for guests, ensuring privacy for the family while providing suitable accommodation for visitors."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert (Rachel McAdams) is about to catch the last 'red eye' flight back to Miami where she lives & works. While waiting for her plane Lisa meets the handsome & charming Jackson Rippner (Cillian Murphy) & they both seem to hit it off, then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other. Once the plane takes off & they are in the air Jackson reveals who he really is & that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence, Jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary Charles Keefe (Jack Scalia) & they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in Miami. Jackson tells Lisa to phone the hotel & make it happen or her father will be killed... Directed by Wes Craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as The Last House on the Left (1972), A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984), The Serpent and the Rainbow (1989), The People Under the Stairs (1991) & the Scream trilogy of teen slashers a short, punchy, fast paced little thriller like Red Eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film Craven usually makes. The script by Carl Ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that I must admit I really enjoyed, at only 85 odd minutes in length it's a very quick moving, economical & straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight, taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots. Some may like this approach like I did while other's may not but I think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick & fast without the film slowing down any & giving you a chance to relax. I really liked the plot for Red Eye, sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell, it's a film made to entertain & for me that's what it did. I really liked the two central character's, Lisa comes across as very likable while Jackson Rippner (an obvious play on the name of the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper) is a suitably slimy villain with a cold 'I'm only doing my job' type mentality. Another plus point is that I didn't think anyone behaved overly stupid here, everyone actually seemed like human beings & the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion. I really liked this & it's one of Craven's better more recent films. Craven turns in a good solid tense, tight, taught & fast paced thriller with an attractive cast, some good action & a gripping plot. He certainly doesn't hang about & once he starts the action & tension he never lets up, far & away the most effective part of the film is when Rippner is holding Lisa hostage on the plane & once the film switches to Miami & Lisa's fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it's still good. A special mention goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this, I could probably watch Red Eye again just because she is in it & looks drop dead stunning. Those who see Wes Craven's name attached to Red Eye expecting a horror film should think again since there's no horror in it at all (despite the IMDb listing 'Horror' as Red Eye's genre). I am not sure about the ending, on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see Lisa kill him in some way. DreamWorks apparently gave Red Eye an initial budget of 44,000,000 but reduced it to 25,000,000 although it's still a very well made film with glossy production values. Actually shot in Los Angeles & Florida in California. The film was supposedly written with husband & wife Sean Penn & Robin Wright Penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads. As I have already said Rachel McAdams is pure eye candy & is a total babe in this & worth watching the film for on her own. Oh, & she puts in a decent performance too. Red Eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that I enjoyed immensely, I didn't think I would enjoy it as much as I did & I am glad I decided to watch it. This definitely gets a recommendation from me & Rachel McAdams really is hot stuff in this...

Choices: - hall - kitchen - neighbor's house - card room - livingroom The rationale to choose \\"livingroom\\" as the answer is that:","completion":"The \\"livingroom\\" is the most logical and suitable choice for placing an extra table during Thanksgiving due to the following reasons: 1. Space: Living rooms are typically one of the more spacious areas in a home, allowing for additional tables and seating to accommodate a larger number of guests. Most living rooms have enough room to rearrange or temporarily move furniture to make space for the extra table. 2. Accessibility: The living room is generally a common area that is easily accessible to all guests. Placing the extra table in the living room ensures that everyone attending the Thanksgiving gathering can easily find and interact with one another, fostering a more social atmosphere. 3. Comfort: Living rooms are designed for relaxation and entertainment, featuring comfortable seating and a friendly environment. Having the extra table in the living room allows guests to enjoy their meal in a comfortable setting while also allowing for conversation and interaction. 4. Continuity: If the primary dining area or dining table is near the living room, placing an extra table there ensures a sense of continuity, making it feel like one large dining space. This allows all guests to feel included in the Thanksgiving celebration, rather than feeling separated or isolated in a different area of the house. In comparison to the other options: - Hall: Halls are usually narrow and not designed to accommodate large gatherings or tables. - Kitchen: Kitchens can be crowded and busy, particularly during a large meal preparation. Limited space and the need for efficiency make kitchens less suitable for a table to accommodate guests. - Neighbor's house: Asking to use a neighbor's house for a table might not be practical or comfortable for all involved. - Card room: Not all houses have a card room, and if they do, it may be too small to accommodate a large group for Thanksgiving. Considering these points, the living room is the most practical and suitable choice for placing the extra table during Thanksgiving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns.

The figure for 2007 was 28.45 percent, for 2010 31.5 percent, for 2012 34.44 percent, for 2013 35.7 percent, and for 2015 38.9 percent.

The percentage for Île-de-France was a significant increase from 54.2% in 2005.

Article: The variance in prevalence rates is reflected in people's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time. Laumann et al., (1994) found that among U.S. adults 20% of those who would be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70% responded in a way that was consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions. Furthermore, sexuality is fluid such that one's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life. Diamond (2003) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once, with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings. Furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour.

Everything was overdone to the point of absurdity. Most of the actors spoke like you would expect your 9-year-old nephew to speak if he were pretending to be a jaded, stone-hearted cop, or an ultra-evil villain. The raspy voice-overs seemed amateurish to me. I could go buy a cheap synthesizer and crank out better opening music. And what's with the whole 1984ish police torture stuff? It was totally superfluous and had nothing to do with the actual events of the story. Cox added a lot of things, in fact, that he apparently thought would be really cool, but had nothing to do with the story. That's a big disappointment because one of the things that makes Borges' stories so good is his minimalism -- they are tightly bound, with no superfluous details. This movie is just the opposite.

Write some highlights for the following article: Floating 245 miles over the Earth Tuesday, NASA engineers Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan tethered themselves to the International Space Station and paused to absorb the view. \\"My goodness, Mike, look down ... absolutely breathtaking,\\" Garan said as they floated over the Yucatan Peninsula. \\"Welcome back to our other office.\\" The last spacewalk of the shuttle era began about 40 minutes behind schedule. Veteran astronaut Stephen Bowen was speaking to the engineers from Houston's Johnson Space Center during the walk, which was scheduled to last just over six hours. The excursion was Fossum's seventh spacewalk and Garan's fourth, according to a NASA statement. Fossum and Garan had been at the International Space Station for several weeks before the crew from Atlantis arrived Monday on the last shuttle flight of the 30-year-old program. Members of the Atlantis crew helped choreograph the spacewalk from inside the space station, but only Fossum and Garan ventured outside. While on the spacewalk, the engineers were expected to recover a broken pump and stow it in the shuttle's cargo bay. They also planned to retrieve an experiment from the bay and mount it outside the space station before deploying another experiment, according to NASA. On Monday, the crews learned they are not in danger from an orbiting piece of debris, the space agency said. The agency had been tracking a piece of the COSMOS 375 satellite, saying it could come close to the station. But NASA said Mission Control verified that the debris will pass a safe distance from the station and shuttle. The scrap is one of more than 500,000 pieces of debris tracked in Earth's orbit, according to NASA. The space agency also announced Monday that Atlantis would stay in space one day more than originally planned. The shuttle, which was scheduled to land July 20, will now make what NASA called a night landing at the Kennedy Space Center at 5:56 a.m. July 21. Atlantis lifted off Friday on NASA's final space shuttle mission. The first shuttle, Columbia, blasted off in April 1981. Since then, space shuttle crews have fixed satellites, performed scientific studies, and ferried materials and people to International Space Station Alpha, a football field-sized construction project in orbit. In 134 missions, the five space shuttles have ferried 355 astronauts into space. When Atlantis lands, it will leave the United States with no way to lift humans into space for the first time in decades. NASA will rely on the Russian space agency to ferry U.S. astronauts to orbit. CNN's Ed Payne contributed to this report.","completion":"On Tuesday, NASA engineers Michael Fossum and Ronald Garan were tethered to the International Space Station (ISS), floating 245 miles above Earth.

Does \\"Routines generally last 60–90 seconds depending on age of participant and routine category.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"What does aerobic gymnastiscs involve?\\"","completion":"While the statement \\"Routines generally last 60–90 seconds depending on age of participant and routine category\\" provides some information about the duration of routines in aerobic gymnastics, it does not completely answer the question of what aerobic gymnastics involves. Aerobic gymnastics, also known as sport aerobics or competitive aerobics, is a competitive sport that combines elements of both aerobics and gymnastics. It involves performing high-energy, rhythmic routines that incorporate various movement patterns, often set to music. The routines are designed to challenge participants' strength, flexibility, coordination, and cardiovascular endurance. Here are some key aspects of aerobic gymnastics: 1. Elements: Aerobic gymnastics combines traditional aerobic movements such as jumps, kicks, and turns with traditional gymnastics elements such as balances, lifts, and tumbling. Participants must demonstrate a variety of skills, including flexibility, strength, and agility, within their routines. 2. Music: The routines in aerobic gymnastics are typically set to upbeat, energetic music, helping participants maintain an elevated heart rate. The music plays a key role in engaging both the audience and the participants, driving the overall energy of the performance. 3. Group or Solo Performances: Aerobic gymnastics routines can be performed as individual, mixed pairs, trios, or groups of six. Each type of performance has specific rules and requirements for participants, including different time limits for routines. 4. Scoring: Aerobic gymnastics competitions are scored by judges who assess each routine based on three main criteria: artistic merit (the overall presentation and choreography), technical merit (the execution and difficulty of elements), and execution (the overall quality of performance, including balance, flexibility, and strength). 5. Competitions: Aerobic gymnastics competitions are organized at various levels, including national, regional, and international competitions. The World Aerobic Gymnastics Championships, organized by the International Gymnastics Federation (FIG), is the premier event for elite athletes in the sport. 6. Training: Athletes who compete in aerobic gymnastics must undergo rigorous training to develop their strength, flexibility, cardiovascular endurance, and coordination. Training typically includes traditional aerobic exercises, gymnastics elements, choreography work, and routine repetition. In conclusion, aerobic gymnastics is a dynamic and engaging sport that involves performing energetic, choreographed routines that challenge participants' physical abilities, artistic expression, and performance skills. While the statement about routine length does provide some information about aerobic gymnastics, a more comprehensive understanding requires an examination of the various elements, formats, scoring criteria, and training involved in the sport."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8 km2 (2.2 sq mi) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea.

The reviewer can't verify about the testosterone release, which indicates that there's a claim made by the product that they were not able to confirm. They also pointed out that they wake up feeling groggy rather than refreshed. This clearly states a drawback they have experienced, reflecting a negative tone.

This means the reviewer, despite the drawbacks, sees value in the product and suggests others might too. In conclusion, while the review does contain positive remarks, indicating a certain level of satisfaction with the product, it also presents some negative elements and areas for improvement.

Please answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: There are many older people in the world and there will be many more.A limeknown fact is that over 60 percent of the older people live in developing countries.According to the World Health Organization,by 2020 there will be 1 billion,with over 700 million living in developing countries. It is a surprising fact that the population ageing is particularly rapid in developing countries.For example,it took France 115 years for the proportion of older people to double from 7 percent to 14 percent.It is estimated to take China a mere 27 years to achieve this same increase. What are the implications of these increased numbers of older folk?One of the biggest worries for governments is that the longer people live,the more likelihood there is for diseases and for disability.Attention is being paid to the need to keep people as healthy as possible,including during old age,to lessen the financial burden on the state. Another significant problem is the need for the younger generations to understand and value the older people in their society.In some African countries,certainly in Asia,older people are respected and regarded as the ones with special knowledge.Yet traditions are fading away daily,which does not ensure the continued high regard of older people.As society changes,attitudes will change. Much needs to be done to get rid of age discrimination in employment.Lifelong learning programs need to be provided to enable older people to be active members in a country's development. Social security policies need to be established to provide adequate income protection for older people.Both public and private schemes are vital in order to build a suitable safety net. To achieve equality in such matters will take considerable time and effort.One thing is sure:there is no time to be lost. Question: Which of the following measures is NOT mentioned to solve the population ageing problem? Options: A: Getting rid of age discrimination in employment.

Sounds like a simple enough thing. And basically it is. But what is adventure? That is the key here and the answer can be different for different people. For those who love sports, adventure travel can have a whole different meaning than for those who like history. The physical travel types that you can find include such adventure travel as white water rafting , kayaking or climbing and hiking to some mountains somewhere. To the hiker, backpacking across Ireland might be their adventure. For this type of person, adventure travel almost always includes something physical. Often the goal is to push their body's limits and test their individual endurance . For those who less want to climb mountains, adventure travel might mean traveling to Nepal and taking in the local festivals. Wine tasting in Italy is also vacation adventure for the more relaxed traveler who enjoys peace and comfort. Anything that is opposite to the normal scope of the traveler's lifestyle defines adventure. Adventure travel is not necessarily a one-size-fits-all type of vacation. Adventure depends on the person's physical limits, how much money the person has and what the person enjoys doing. Going _ the normal is adventurous for many. If your life is quite busy, then sitting on a beach in the moonlight with your family might be adventure for you. The point is not what you do but that you have a good time and that it is an adventure for YOU -- not for the person next to you. Do not sit home this year when vacation time rolls around.

Casey is an adolescent boy whose life is constantly influenced by his intense fear of clowns. His two older brothers, Geoffrey and Randy, are mostly disobliging. One night, the three boys are left alone when their mother visits relatives, so they decide to visit a local circus for a night of amusement, despite Casey's uncontrollable coulrophobia. Meanwhile, the local state insane asylum has sent a majority of the hospital's inmates to the carnival for therapy, but three psychotic mental patients break away from the group and kill three clowns, taking their makeup and costumes. While at the circus, Casey innocently visits a fortune teller despite Randy's better judgment. The fortune teller reveals to Casey that his life line has been cut short, and says to him: \\"Beware, beware, in the darkest of dark /though the flesh is young and the hearts are strong /precious life cannot be long /when darkest death has left its mark.\\" As the boys return from the circus, a shaken Casey thinks his nightmare is over, but it has only just begun. When the clowns target their home, Casey is forced to face his fears once and for all. Casey and his brothers are locked inside their isolated farmhouse and the power is turned off. Casey attempts to call the police, but because Casey says that the \\"clowns from the circus are trying to get him\\", the police officers assume that Casey's fear of clowns caused him to have a realistic nightmare. The officers tell Casey that everything will be fine if he goes back to sleep, and hangs up. Randy mockingly dresses up as a clown, disbelieving of Casey's claims that clowns are inside the house.

Customers simply tell the retailer which card they want to use before tapping the device on a reader. Apple Pay launched earlier this year and lets people with an iPhone 6 and 6 Plus pay for goods by tapping their handsets on NFC readers. It works by holding the phone up to a card reader and pressing a finger on the TouchID button. This confirms the person's identity, and the payment is made as if the user had presented and signed their card. All details are encrypted and the system stores payment information securely. If an iPhone is lost, users can suspend all payments via the Find my iPhone service. Apple Pay is currently available in around 220,000 shops, and 10 banks, in the US. By comparison, LoopPay is available at more than 90 per cent - or 10 million - shops in the US. It works on Apple, Samsung, Motorola, LG, HTC and Huawei devices and can additionally be used at more than 5,000 banks and issuers.

A:","completion":"To ascertain if the suggested answer is valid, let's first define what use taxes are and then evaluate the answer accordingly. Step 1: Define Use Tax Use tax is a tax applied on the purchase of tangible personal property from an out-of-state or online retailer, when sales tax hasn't been paid or collected. This tax is typically levied on items used, consumed, or stored in the buyer's state, where the seller didn't collect sales tax due to being exempt.

Negotiations had started there on December 31, 1762. Frederick, who had considered ceding East Prussia to Russia if Peter III helped him secure Saxony, finally insisted on excluding Russia (in fact, no longer a belligerent) from the negotiations. At the same time, he refused to evacuate Saxony until its elector had renounced any claim to reparation. The Austrians wanted at least to retain Glatz, which they had in fact reconquered, but Frederick would not allow it. The treaty simply restored the status quo of 1748, with Silesia and Glatz reverting to Frederick and Saxony to its own elector.

Dr. Roberts, a famous lecture at the University of Chester, said such websites don't appear to help make true friendships. Based on two questionnaires , he found there was no link between Facebook use and people with larger groups of friends. Dr. Roberts, whose work will be presented at the British Psychological Society conference in Harrogate, said, \\"The bottom lime conclusion is that our relationships are not dependent on the quantity of communication. They depend on quality, and even Skype is better at increasing the quality of our communication than time on Facebook.\\" Even talking on the phone or texting does not make people feel as good as sharing a smile, the research says. The studies suggest quality, not quantity, of communication is the most important for keeping friends for life. People find the most satisfying relationships come from a small number of close friends, with an outer \\"ring\\" of 10 significant others. With these people, it doesn't matter what type of social media you use for communication.

At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging.

This is a fantastic series first and foremost. It is very well done and very interesting. As a huge WWII buff, I had learned a lot before seeing this series. One of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. It is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. One of the best parts is the narrating by Sir Laurence Oliver. I would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about WWII, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. My only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. Especially with the information about Soviet Union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. That information is now different we now know because of the fall of the USSR.

As she goes over a hill, her car drifts a little too close to the center-divide and she's almost crushed by a truck going in the opposite direction. Rattled further, she pulls into a gas station. She looks like any another woman until cars come screeching in all around her, FBI agents begin waving their badges and a shotgun is pointed at her head.Jim Grant (Robert Redford) has made a good life for himself as a small town lawyer in Albany New York. He has managed to juggle his job and raise his 11 year old daughter Isabel after the death of his wife a few years ago. His world is turned upside down after he's approached by his old friend Billy while dropping his daughter off at school. Billy fills Jim in on Sharon's arrest which took place not far from them. Billy asks if Jim will help Sharon in any way, but Jim wants no part of it.We learn that Sharon was a former member of a radical group called the Weather Underground. The group robbed a bank way back in the late '70s and the security guard, an off duty policeman, was shot and killed in the process. Sharon has been charged with murder. Jim is suddenly under suspicion of somehow being involved.During the ensuing investigation, evidence is unearthed and connections are being made, namely by young and clever Albany Sun-Times reporter Ben Shepard (Shia LaBeouf). Ben uses his local and FBI contacts and slowly begins to think that Jim was involved in the robbery and murder. But past appearances can be deceiving and as he tries to get to the bottom of it all, Jim leads Ben and the FBI on a cross-country manhunt, while trying to find the third remaining member-at-large, Mimi Lurie (Julie Christie), so that he might convince her to come forward and prove his innocence and save his daughter.SYNOPSIS with spoilersA pre-credit sequence tells the story of radical activists during the Vietnam War era whose protests led to crimes such...

The person has solved the Rubik's Cube. After spending some time analyzing the Rubik's Cube's colors and turning it in all directions, the person starts focusing on using a methodical approach to solving the puzzle. There are several well-established solving algorithms, such as the layer-by-layer method, the corners-first method, or the Fridrich Method (CFOP). The person may choose one of these methods or create their own unique solving logic. Initially, the person might work on getting the first side or layer of the cube solved. This involves matching the same colors together and creating a solid, monochromatic face. Once this is achieved, the person proceeds with a systematic pattern for solving subsequent layers. For instance, in the layer-by-layer method, the next step would be solving the middle layer by correctly positioning and orienting the edge pieces that connect the first layer to the second layer. As the person progresses through each step, they become more familiar with the cube's movements and the specific set of moves required to manipulate the positions of the various pieces. This is a gradual process that requires patience, concentration, and the ability to visualize the desired end result. Eventually, the person reaches the final layer, which may appear to be the most challenging aspect of the Rubik's Cube. However, at this stage, they have already developed a strong sense of the cube's mechanics, and they are able to manipulate the final pieces into their correct positions and orientations. Following this process, the person successfully solves the Rubik's Cube. Afterward, they might feel a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment, as solving the cube is recognized as a challenging intellectual pursuit. This can lead to increased confidence in their problem-solving abilities and could inspire them to take on additional brain-teasing puzzles or even attempt to improve their solving speed through practice and mastering more advanced solution techniques. Furthermore, this achievement might encourage the person to share their newfound knowledge and skills with others, helping to build camaraderie and foster a broader interest in the world of logic puzzles and mental challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maria thought about her intentions and decided that she wished to learn patience and cultivate gratitude in her life. Step 1: Choose a quiet spot Together, Maria and Mary found a serene space in the garden, surrounded by lush greenery and the soothing sounds of a trickling waterfall. This space would remove any distractions and allow Maria to focus solely on her meditation practice. Step 2: Find a comfortable posture Mary guided Maria to sit down on a soft cushion with her back straight and her legs crossed comfortably. As Maria adjusted her position, she became aware of her body, making sure that her entire weight was evenly distributed. Step 3: Focus on the breath Mary then instructed Maria to gently close her eyes and pay attention to the natural rhythm of her breath. Maria could feel the sensation of the cool air entering her nostrils, filling her lungs, and the warmth of it as it left her body. Step 4: Practice mindfulness As Maria began to settle into her meditation, thoughts would inevitably arise. Mary encouraged her to notice these thoughts without judgment, and gently bring her focus back to the breath. This would help Maria develop mindfulness and patience with herself during her meditation journey. Step 5: Introduce prayer Once Maria felt a sense of calm while focusing on her breath, Mary suggested that she could start incorporating prayer into her meditation.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round. and a hint : The temperature of a body of water directly affects the amount of dissolved oxygen it can hold. Following Henry's law, as water becomes warmer, oxygen becomes less soluble in it.

According to the police, the circumstances of their deaths point to a high likelihood of carbon monoxide exposure as the primary cause. This unfortunate event has brought to light the potential dangers of this odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas, which can be fatal in high concentrations. Incident details: The incident occurred in the rural region of Australia, where the three individuals were found unconscious inside a water tank. Preliminary investigations by the authorities have revealed that the victims had been conducting maintenance work inside the tank at the time of the accident. The water tank was part of a larger water storage system used for both agricultural and domestic purposes. It is believed that a petrol-powered water pump, which was in use during the maintenance, malfunctioned, leading to the build-up of carbon monoxide within the tank. Due to the enclosed space, inadequate ventilation, and lack of immediate response, the concentration of the gas reached lethal levels, causing the sudden deaths of the three individuals. Carbon Monoxide Poisoning: A Silent Killer Carbon monoxide (CO) is a deadly gas, which is primarily formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing fuels such as petrol, diesel, wood, or coal. Since it is virtually impossible to detect without specialized equipment, the risks associated with carbon monoxide poisoning are far greater than those of other toxic gases. Carbon monoxide exposure inhibits the blood's ability to carry oxygen, which may lead to serious health consequences or death. Symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may include headache, dizziness, weakness, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, and confusion. Prolonged exposure to high levels of the gas can result in unconsciousness and ultimately, death. Each year, numerous carbon monoxide-related fatalities are reported worldwide, emphasizing the importance of taking adequate safety precautions and installing carbon monoxide detectors in homes and workplaces. Preventive Measures and Public Awareness In the wake of the tragic water tank incident, authorities are calling for increased public awareness around the risks of carbon monoxide poisoning. Preventive measures, such as installing detectors, using well-maintained equipment with proper ventilation, and conducting regular inspections, can help save lives. Key recommendations for preventing carbon monoxide exposure include: 1. Install carbon monoxide detectors in homes and workplaces, especially if they use fuel-burning appliances. 2. Ensure that all fuel-burning appliances are serviced and maintained regularly by a qualified professional. 3. Avoid using fuel-powered equipment in poorly-ventilated areas, such as closed garages or confined spaces. 4. Do not ignore the symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning; seek immediate medical assistance if these symptoms are experienced. 5. Educate family members, employees, and communities about the dangers associated with carbon monoxide exposure and how to prevent it. Conclusion: The unfortunate incident of three deaths in an Australian water tank due to suspected carbon monoxide poisoning is a stark reminder of the potential dangers of this lethal gas. It highlights the importance of creating public awareness, implementing preventive measures, and promoting the installation of carbon monoxide detectors in homes and workplaces. Taking these steps can help ensure that similar tragedies are avoided in the future and that lives are saved from the silent and invisible threat of carbon monoxide poisoning."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

Write a text based on this summary: ugandan banks open up to credit finance Text:","completion":"Title: Ugandan Banks Embrace Credit Finance, Expanding Economic Opportunities In recent years, the Ugandan banking sector has signaled a significant shift towards the expansion of credit finance. This development is igniting economic opportunities, driving growth, and improving financial services for individuals and businesses alike. Banks in Uganda are opening up to credit as a means to promote entrepreneurship, invest in infrastructure, and support the socio-economic development of the nation. Coupled with robust regulatory frameworks, Ugandan banks are laying the groundwork for financing initiatives that will catalyze prosperity within the country. Traditionally, Ugandan banks have operated with a conservative approach to lending, opting for security over higher returns and broader economic growth. However, spurred by increased access to financial services, technological advancements, and growing demand from businesses and customers, the banking sector has begun to harness the potential of credit finance. By embracing a more liberal and diversified lending approach, Ugandan banks are successfully overcoming various challenges, such as limited credit history and insufficient collateral, that have hindered their growth in the past. Uganda's banking landscape continues to become more competitive, with both local and international financial institutions eager to capitalize on emerging credit opportunities. The increase in available credit options is generating new employment opportunities, enabling small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to scale their operations, and ultimately contributing to Uganda's broader economic development. Moreover, credit finance enables individuals and businesses to invest in previously inaccessible assets, such as property and equipment, which can stimulate the local economy and create a more significant regional impact. The introduction of digital technologies and platforms in the banking sector means a greater number of Ugandans can access financial services, particularly in remote or underbanked areas. By leveraging digital solutions, such as mobile banking and fintech innovations, banks can offer credit products to a broader population. This not only democratizes access to credit but also allows the financial market to become increasingly inclusive and integrated. Through mobile money platforms, the underbanked segments of Uganda's population can now more easily save, borrow, and access insurance - leading to a healthier and more robust economy. In addition to opening new avenues for businesses and consumers alike, the increased focus on credit finance by Ugandan banks is expected to foster further collaboration between financial institutions and various industry sectors. These partnerships can enable banks to offer targeted credit solutions designed to cater to specific industries' unique needs, ultimately boosting growth across multiple sectors. While the expansion of credit finance in Uganda paints an optimistic picture, the authorities must ensure strict regulations to maintain financial stability and protect against potential risks, such as non-performing loans, which may arise. Simultaneously, efforts are needed to improve the country's financial infrastructure, such as credit reference bureaus, to support banks' credit assessments. Education and awareness campaigns targeting customers must also be considered, with the objective of promoting responsible borrowing and debt management practices. In conclusion, the opening of Ugandan banks to credit finance marks a turning point in the country's financial growth narrative. As access to credit encourages entrepreneurship, investment, and economic development, the Ugandan populace can more fully grasp the potential of credit finance to drive prosperity. By leveraging technology, fostering innovation, and employing stringent regulations, Uganda's banking sector is set to play a vital role in the country's progress, creating a sustainable and inclusive financial landscape for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

What is the best way to: To increase a person's typing speed,","completion":"The best way to increase a person's typing speed involves a combination of practice, proper technique, and focus on accuracy. Here is a step-by-step guide to help improve typing speed: 1. Assess current typing speed: First, determine the individual's current typing speed and accuracy using an online typing test. This serves as the baseline for gauging improvement. 2. Learn proper typing technique: Ensure the person knows the proper finger placement on the keyboard, i.e., the home row position. Fingers should be curved and wrists slightly elevated. 3. Touch typing: Encourage the development of muscle memory by practicing touch typing, which means typing without looking at the keyboard. This will train the brain to associate the position of each key with a specific finger movement. 4. Focus on accuracy: Initially, prioritize accuracy over speed. As the person becomes more proficient in typing accurately, their speed will naturally increase. 5. Practice regularly: Set aside time for regular practice sessions. Consistency is key for improvement. Aim for at least 15-30 minutes of practice daily. 6. Use online tools and software: Utilize online tools and software like TypingClub, Typing.com, or Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing to learn and practice typing through various exercises and games. 7. Set small goals: Set achievable, short-term goals. For example, aim to increase typing speed by 5 words per minute (WPM) every two weeks. 8. Monitor progress: Periodically assess typing speed and accuracy using a typing test. Identify areas of weakness and focus on improving those specific aspects. 9. Work on problem areas: If a person is facing difficulty with specific keys or finger movements, dedicate time to practicing those problem areas more extensively. 10. Develop good posture: Maintain proper posture while typing. Sit up straight, keep feet flat on the ground, and position the keyboard and monitor at comfortable heights. 11. Minimize hand strain: Take periodic breaks to avoid hand strain and fatigue. Stretch the fingers, wrist, and arms during these breaks. By following these steps diligently, a person's typing speed will gradually increase, allowing them to type more efficiently and effortlessly over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Little Hunter Alford needs chemotherapy to treat the rare and deadly cancer he was born with but has lost his health insurance under an administrative blunder seemingly caused by Obamacare. While the president's signature policy promised that no one with a pre-existing condition would not be covered, the Affordable Care Act has seemingly caused the seven-year-old Gainesville, Texas, boy to face an agonizing wait for treatment as his parents battle to get him back on his insurance plan. 'Why would you cancel a kid?' asked his mother Krista Alford. 'I really want to send Obama and all of them pictures of my son. He has scars all over his head. He doesn’t want to leave the house because he’s afraid people are going to make fun of him because he’s bald.' Desperate: Hunter Alford needs treatment for his rare cancer but has been left uninsured after a administrative glitch caused by the introduction of Obamacare. Tragic: While the president's signature policy promised that no one with pre-existing condition would not be covered, the Affordable Care Act has seemingly caused the seven-year-old Gainsville, Texas, boy to lose his insurnance. While mom Krista and dad Ron go out their minds with worry, Hunter - who was born with an extremely rare form of cancer called Plexiform Hishocyne Neoplasm - is battling the disease which has now spread to his brain. But after seven years of fighting his illness, Hunter's insurance has been canceled and he is due his next round of chemo, which costs 50,000 and right now, Krista says he is unlikely to get it. The Alford's are battling with children's medicaid, or CHIP - which insures Hunter and despite the family receiving a new, renewed insurance card, they were informed that their agency had dropped them. 'I called them and they said we were dropped October 31st,' Krista said to News 12. She was told that her sons information was lost when administrative changes were made under the Affordable Care Act. 'The lady's like, the only way we can expedite is if your son was pregnant and in labor, or if he was an illegal,' Krista said. The parents said Hunter 'has known nothing other than hospitals, doctors, sickness and pain.' Distraught: Mother Krista has been left out of her mind with worry by the loss of Hunter's insurance and the bureaucratic minefield she is having to through to fix it. Krista was incredulous when she received a letter in November from her insurance provider asking why her son - who has been covered by them his entire life - was in hospital in the first place. Krista reasoned that after seven-years of paying for his medical bills, the insurance company would have a good idea of what was wrong with him. Despite Krista's insistence that the Affordable Care Act has caused her son to be un-insured, a media spokesperson with Texas Health and Human Services Communication - who handle CHIP - said that the problem does not lie with Obamacare. However she did admit to administrative changes that could have led to mistakes moving Hunter from CHIP to an upgraded version of Medicaid. She repeated that the problem was not related to Obamacare, but there were some 'glitches' in coverage when the changeover happened. Ron Alford with his daughter Makayla and son Hunter - he is a police officer in Gainsville and struggling to get his children the health care they have been insured for their entire lives. However, it seems that one of those glitches caused a little boy with life-threatening cancer to lose his health insurance. Over the past month Krista has been stuck in a bureaucratic hell - being passed from one agency telephone helpline to the next. Each one has brought her no closer to an answer or a resolution. Krista said she’d had Hunter's current insurance for a year-and-a-half and had never received any notice that she needed to 'requalify' her children because of Obamacare. When she phoned to complain Krista says, 'all of a sudden could not find my son case, at all. And then, she transferred me over to another gentleman who found his case. He said it was hidden, because when they switched over to HHSC (Texas Health and Human Services Commission), they lost a lot of cases files and Hunter’s was just one of those.' The more she asked, the more confusing the answers became. 'Then they told me October 17th was when he was actually canceled. But on October 25 he had chemo, and they paid for it. So, I am getting different stories.' Tough: Hunter has been ill his entire life and needs another round of chemotherapy to battle his rare form of cancer. The latest development in the shocking case is one that the wife of a small town police officer finds hard to believe. 'Now, the new story with CHIP is they called and said my husband makes too much money, 173 too much. 'So, I’m very upset. I was bawling on the phone with her and the only thing she said was, ‘Have a nice day,’ and she hung up.' To make matters worse, the Alford's have been told that their son's cancer is not only rare but behaving in an unusual manner. 'These tumors are very rare. They are not supposed to spread, but his decided they were going to spread. And it can go into his lungs, because the tumors like soft tissue, and your lungs are soft tissue.' With Hunter desperately in need of a new round of Chemotherapy, Krista has said the family have no choice but to accept the massive 50,000 bill for it with no insurance. However, they have set up a fund for people to help - 'Heroes for Hunter' and so far they have raised 11,005 - but everything will help.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Sullivan for the following movie plot: In voiceover, Irish-American mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) explains that he doesn't want to be the product of his environment, he wants his environment to be a product of him. Grainy historical film depicts violent riots in Boston during earlier generations. Costello, proudly Irish, unapologetically racist, explains that what annoys him about African Americans is their refusal to realize that they won't be given anything. Costello's belief is you have to do whatever possible to take what you want.Costello is in a small convenience store and collects protection money from the shop owner, who is visibly unnerved by Costello. Costello warns him to have more money next time. Costello asks the shop owner's young teenage daughter behind the counter if she's got her period yet. His attitude is nonchalant and all the more threatening for it. The daughter is both affronted and compelled by the powerful Costello and answers his rhetorical question. The shop owner doesn't show any emotion.A small boy, a young Colin Sullivan (Conor Donovan), is at the counter and witnesses Costello's interaction with the shop owner. Costello notices him and asks him if he's the son of a man Costello knows. He tells the store owner to give the boy two full bags of groceries and then presses some coins into the boy's hand. He tells the boy to remember he can get more money from Costello when he gets older.As Sullivan grows, Costello grooms him and steers him into a job as a police officer, where he can keep Costello informed. Sullivan completes the Police Academy and is immediately transferred to the State Police force. He is accepted into the Special Investigations Unit led by Ellerby (Alec Baldwin) which focuses on organized crime. The primary target of the unit is Costello. Sullivan (Matt Damon) is warmly welcomed onto the State Police force by Captain Queenan (Sheen) and Staff Sergeant Dignam (Wahlberg).Billy Costigan (DiCaprio), whose extended family has considerable ties to organized crime, also attends the police academy....

Albrecht the Elder was 62 or 63 when his panel was painted early in 1490. Barbara's portrait may have been completed soon after, when she would have been around 39. Their son was around 18 and had just completed his apprenticeship with Michael Wolgemut, and would soon leave for Nuremberg to travel as a journeyman painter. The father panel was painted first; for aesthetic reasons Dürer may have waited a year or two until his mother looked older.The sitters are presented in three-quarter view before flat, nondescript lacquer-like green backgrounds, which although lushly coloured, are thinly layered. Each has a white ground and light red imprimatura with lead content. The sitter's form and pose echo and in many ways counterbalance each other. Brand Philip draws attention to the similarities of the panels' linear construction, especially the manner in which the folds and lines of their clothing form triangular shapes. The train of Barbara's headdress across her chest corresponds with the opening of Albrecht's fur-lined coat. It was more usual in pendant portraits of this type for the male to be on the left-hand side; the positioning here may be an indication that Dürer originally intended his father's panel to stand alone, given that Barbara's was painted some time later.Albrecht the Elder's panel is regarded as the superior of the two works. This may in part be attributed to differing contemporary treatments of male and female portraits; men were allowed more individuality, while female portraits were bound by stereotypes and were not as daring, for example showing evidence of ageing. In either case, the father painting is far more closely detailed, especially in the lining of clothing, which is summary in Barbara's panel, compared to the long seam of her husband's gown. This contrast in detail can also be seen in the treatment of the rosaries, which are given prominence and a glowing red colour in his panel, but are small and relegated in hers.Albrecht the Elder's panel is usually, but not always, thought to...

From some early studies, a safe dose of Garcinia appears to be up to 2800 mg per day. But, it's not known what may happen if you take these amounts, so you should stay well below that dose. Once you have found a good place to buy the supplement, you need to understand how much of the HCA you need to take. The dose of HCA should be about 1500 mg per day, though this varies from supplement to supplement. Make sure you follow the manufacturer’s instructions and you consult a knowledgeable healthcare professional before starting. Garcinia comes in two different forms. The first is a pill form, either in a tablet or capsule. If you buy the supplement as a pill, take the recommended dosage of garcinia as a tablet or capsule with water. Take the pill about 30-60 minutes before each meal. In general, garcinia is taken three times a day. This means that each pill should be 500 mg. That way, you stay within your daily dosage suggestions. The second form that you can take of garcinia is liquid. The liquid form of garcinia usually recommends taking 1-2 drops before every meal, but the amount can vary based on the dropper or concentration. Take the drop or drops under your tongue and let them stay for a minute or so. Then, have your regular meal 30-60 minutes later. Before you take the liquid form, ask your pharmacist or a knowledgeable healthcare professional how much garcinia is in every drop for the particular kind you have. You should also ask how many drops would equal a total of about 1500 mg of garcinia every day. Once you have the total number of drops, divide that by three and take that amount before each meal. Summary:","completion":"The information provided details the usage and dosage of Garcinia, a dietary supplement. 1. The safe dose of Garcinia is up to 2800 mg/day, but it's recommended to stay well below this amount. 2. The ideal dose of HCA, an active ingredient in Garcinia, should be about 1500 mg/day, which may vary depending on the supplement. 3. The supplement is available in two forms - pill (tablet/capsule) and liquid. 4. If you opt for the pill form, take the dosage as recommended by the manufacturer with water, about 30-60 minutes before each meal. The pill taken three times a day should each contain 500 mg to keep the daily dosage in check. 5. The liquid form should be taken by dropping 1-2 drops under the tongue and leaving them there for a minute before swallowing, about 30-60 minutes before each meal. 6. Additionally, consult with a pharmacist or healthcare professional to understand exactly how much Garcinia is in every drop of the liquid form and how many drops would suffice the 1500 mg/day requirement. After determining the total number of necessary drops per day, divide by three to take before each meal.

Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words.

Plot title: The 39 Steps Movie plot: At a London music hall theatre, Richard Hannay (Robert Donat) is watching a demonstration of the superlative powers of recall of \\"Mr. Memory\\" (Wylie Watson) when shots are fired.[1] In the ensuing panic, Hannay finds himself holding a seemingly frightened Annabella Smith (Lucie Mannheim), who talks him into taking her back to his flat. There, she tells him that she is a spy, being chased by assassins, and that she has uncovered a plot to steal vital British military information, masterminded by a man with the top joint missing from one of his fingers. She mentions the \\"39 Steps\\", but does not explain its meaning. Later that night Smith, fatally stabbed, bursts into Hannay's bedroom and warns him to flee. He finds a map of the Scottish Highlands clutched in her hand, showing the area around Killin, with a house or farm named \\"Alt-na-Shellach\\" circled. He sneaks out of the watched flat disguised as a milkman and boards the Flying Scotsman express train to Scotland. He learns from a newspaper that he is the target of a nationwide manhunt for Smith's murderer. When he sees the police searching the train, he enters a compartment and kisses the sole occupant, Pamela (Madeleine Carroll), in a desperate attempt to escape detection. She frees herself from his unwanted embrace and alerts the policemen, who stop the train on the Forth Bridge. Hannay escapes, however. He walks toward Alt-na-Shellach, staying the night in the house of a poor crofter (John Laurie) and his much younger wife (Peggy Ashcroft). Early the next morning, she sees a police car approaching and warns Hannay. Hannay flees, wearing the crofter's coat. At a bridge, he finds a sign for Alt-na-Shellach. He arrives at the house of the seemingly respectable Professor Jordan (Godfrey Tearle) and is let in after saying he has been sent by Annabella Smith. The police arrive, but Jordan sends them away and listens to Hannay's story. Jordan then reveals that he is missing part of a finger; he shoots Hannay and leaves him for dead.

There have been countless talking-animal films in the past, the majority of which either feature animals' mouths digitally animated to nearly match the voice acting, or are ridiculously amateur. 'Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey' is neither. This film doesn't need the infant-pleasing addition of moving canine lips, or gesturing feline limbs. It has the ability to make you believe that the animals are authentically talking to one another, and you can get rather emotionally attached to them at heart (as all great boy-and-and-his-dog films should). Homeward Bound is the epitome of all family-friendly animal romps to me, and boasts some beautiful cinematography, an inspiring soundtrack (from the genius of Bruce Broughton), and an impressive cast...

Write a summary based on this article: A filmmaker has gone into hiding after his movie attacking Islam's Prophet Muhammad sparked assaults on U.S. missions in Egypt and Libya, where an American State Department officer was killed. Writer and director Sam Bacile spoke on the phone Tuesday from an unidentified location. He remained defiant, saying Islam is \\"a cancer\\" and he wanted his film to make a political statement. The 56-year-old identifies himself as an Israeli Jew and says he believes his video will help his native land by exposing Islam's flaws to the world. Excerpts dubbed into Arabic were posted on YouTube. Among other claims that have caused outrage, the film claims Muhammad was a philanderer who approved of child sexual abuse. Bacile says he's sorry for the person who died, but blames lax embassy security. ||||| Read this story in Arabic. Cairo (CNN) -- The United States said it was taking measures to protect its citizens worldwide after protesters angry about an online film considered offensive to Islam attacked U.S. diplomatic compounds in Libya and Egypt on Tuesday, killing an American. In Cairo, several men scaled the walls of the U.S. Embassy and tore down its American flag, according to CNN producer Mohamed Fadel Fahmy, who was on the scene. In Libya, witnesses say members of a radical Islamist group called Ansar al-Sharia protested near the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, where NATO jets established no-fly zones last year to blunt ground attacks from then Libyan strongman Moammar Gadhafi. The group then clashed with security forces in the city, blocking roads leading to the consulate, witnesses said. A U.S. State Department officer was killed in the violence in Benghazi, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a statement late Tuesday. \\"We are heartbroken by this terrible loss,\\" Clinton said. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with his family and those who have suffered in this attack.\\" Clinton said that she condemned the attack on the U.S. facilities \\"in the strongest terms\\" and that following Tuesday's events, the U.S. government was \\"working with partner countries around the world to protect our personnel, our missions and American citizens worldwide.\\" Libya's General National Congress also condemned the attack, saying it \\"led to the regrettable injury and death of a number of individuals.\\" Lawmakers said in a statement Tuesday night that they were investigating. It was unclear whether the two attacks were coordinated, CNN national security contributor Fran Townsend said Tuesday night. \\"One such breach of an embassy or consulate's walls or security on any given day would be tremendous news. ... The fact that two of them happened on the same day that is the 9/11 anniversary where Americans are remembering those that we lost, you have to ask yourself, what are American officials trying to understand about this and whether or not these two are related?\\" she asked. In Egypt, police and army personnel formed defensive lines around the U.S. Embassy in an effort to prevent demonstrators from advancing, but not before the protesters affixed a black flag atop a ladder in the American compound. The black flag, which hangs in full view from inside the complex, is adorned with white characters that read, \\"There is no God but Allah and Mohammed is his messenger,\\" an emblem often used by Islamic radicals. A volley of warning shots were fired, as a large crowd gathered around the compound, although it is not clear who fired the shots. Are you there? Share your images and videos. Egyptian groups point to U.S. websites, including YouTube, that have scenes from the film. Some anti-Muslim blogs also have flagged the movie. In a series of disjointed scenes, the film depicts Prophet Mohammed as a child molester, womanizer and ruthless killer. The movie was made by Sam Bacile, an Israeli-American real-estate developer, according to the Wall Street Journal. Bacile -- who wrote, directed and produced the film -- said he wanted to showcase his view of Islam as a hateful religion, the Journal reported, citing a telephone interview with him. Bacile, 52, told the newspaper that to make the film, he had raised 5 million from about 100 Jewish donors, who he declined to identify. He said he made the two-hour movie over a three-month period last year in California, using about 60 actors and 45 crew members, the Journal reported. Most of the Muslim world considers depictions of Mohammed to be blasphemous and deeply offensive. \\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet,\\" Clinton said. \\"The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation.\\" But she stressed that \\"there is never any justification for violent acts of this kind.\\" Embassy officials issued a warning to Americans in Egypt, telling them to avoid the demonstrations which \\"may gather in front of the U.S. Embassy, or Egyptian government buildings such as the People's Assembly and Ministry of Interior.\\" \\"It is unclear if large numbers will take to the streets, but clashes may occur should two opposing groups come into contact with one another,\\" the U.S. Embassy said in a statement. \\"Large gatherings and non-essential travel in and around downtown and Garden City should be avoided this afternoon.\\" Frenzied protesters could been seen Tuesday afternoon holding up bits of a shredded American flag to television camera crews while chanting anti-U.S. slogans. An embassy phone operator told CNN that the compound had been cleared of diplomatic personnel earlier in the day ahead of the apparent threat, while Egyptian riot police and the army were called in. \\"This is an expression of a feeling that is thought to be an insult,\\" said Nizih El Naggary, a spokesman for the Egyptian Foreign Ministry. \\"But events like this are extremely deplorable. And we have to work to get things under control.\\" The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday, pledging to protect embassies and warning of the protests' potentially debilitating effects on the Egyptian economy. \\"There are police forces at the demonstrations,\\" El Naggary said. \\"They should be protecting the embassy and asking people to leave.\\" Several individuals claimed responsibility for organizing the demonstrations Tuesday, including Salafist leader Wesam Abdel-Wareth, who is president of Egypt's conservative Hekma television channel. Mohamed al-Zawahiri -- the brother of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri -- added, \\"We called for the peaceful protest joined by different Islamic factions including the Islamicc Jihad (and the) Hazem Abu Ismael movement.\\" \\"We were surprised to see the big numbers show up, including the soccer Ultra fans,\\" he said. \\"I just want to say, how would the Americans feel if films insulting leading Christian figures like the pope or historical figures like Abraham Lincoln were produced?\\" He added that \\"the film portrays the prophet in a very ugly manner, alluding to topics like sex, which is not acceptable.\\" The U.S. Embassy in Cairo announced that it had canceled visa services for Wednesday. It also said in a statement that it \\"condemns the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious feelings of Muslims -- as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\\" \\"Respect for religious beliefs is a cornerstone of American democracy,\\" the statement said. \\"We firmly reject the actions by those who abuse the universal right of free speech to hurt the religious beliefs of others.\\" The embassy statement set off a political spat back in the United States after the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, criticized its message and linked it to his opponent for the White House. \\"It's disgraceful that the Obama Administration's first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks,\\" Romney said in a statement released late Tuesday. He said he was \\"outraged\\" by the attacks in Libya and Egypt. The Obama campaign quickly responded to Romney's comments. \\"We are shocked that, at a time when the United States of America is confronting the tragic death of one of our diplomatic officers in Libya, Governor Romney would choose to launch a political attack,\\" Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman said in an email. Demonstrations elicited a mixture of reactions from the Egyptian street, where last year tens of thousands turned out in opposition to former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. This summer, Egypt's first Islamist president, Mohamed Morsy, was sworn into power at Tahrir Square, the scene of the nation's revolution in 2011. Though Tuesday's embassy protests are the first that Morsy has dealt with, Egypt recently produced similar scenarios when protesters attacked the Israeli and Syrian embassies in unrelated episodes. \\"These protests are a bad image for Egypt,\\" said a Cairo street vendor named Ahmed. \\"Of course I'm against insulting Islam, but it's the undereducated, poor people who are out here causing problems.\\" \\"All I want for Egypt is security and stability,\\" he said. \\"And as you can see this isn't it.\\" The incident occurred on the 11th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks as crowds gathered across the United States in somber remembrance of a day that left nearly 3,000 people dead. Tuesday's focus on the controversial film also drew comparisons to outcry generated from a 2008 movie produced by an anti-Muslim Dutch lawmaker to portray Islam as a violent religion. Geert Wilders' film \\"Fitna,\\" which he released online, featured images of terrorist acts superimposed over verses from the Quran.

The race was intense, and the world-class drivers demonstrated their exceptional skills as they navigated the challenging corners and high-speed straights. Towards the final laps of the race, the top three positions remained unchanged, with Vettel still leading the pack. However, Hamilton's McLaren car showed signs of increased speed and better handling, allowing him to inch closer towards Red Bull's Vettel. In response, Alonso, whose Ferrari had shown significant improvement leading up to the race, started pushing harder, setting the scene for an exhilarating finish. As the checkered flag came into view, Vettel continued to hold onto his lead, but Hamilton and Alonso were right on his tail. Just as the tension reached a fever pitch, Hamilton made a daring move to overtake Vettel on the penultimate corner, initiating a breathtaking drag race to the finish line. With only a hair's breadth between the three drivers, they crossed the finish line almost simultaneously.

Alonso, whose car's performance had impressed everyone, finished a solid third, leaving him optimistic about future races despite not securing the top spot in Canada.

In English, it translates to \\"naked sun.\\" Finnish is a Uralic language and it is one of the two official languages in Finland, the other being Swedish. It is also one of the official languages of the European Union. Finnish is spoken mainly in Finland, but there are also smaller Finnish-speaking communities in countries like Sweden, Norway, Estonia, and Russia. The language is known for its complex grammar, rich vocabulary, and unique phonetics. One of the most characteristic features of Finnish is the extensive use of vowel sounds and the absence of gendered pronouns. The language also relies heavily on cases to convey grammatical relationships between words, with 15 distinct cases in standard Finnish. Although Finnish is a Uralic language, it has also been influenced by various other languages throughout history. During the early stages of Finnish literature, the language was influenced by Finnish-Swedish bilingualism, which led to the adoption of Swedish loanwords and expressions. Later on, Finnish was also influenced by Russian during the period of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Learning Finnish may be challenging for those who don't have any prior experience with Uralic languages, but it can be a rewarding experience due to its unique sound, structure, and rich cultural background. Knowledge of Finnish enables one to explore the various literary works of famous Finnish authors like Mika Waltari and Tove Jansson, as well as to enjoy the original language of Finnish music and movies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cipru, o țară insulară situată în partea estică a Mării Mediterane, este o republică prezidențială cu o economie în creștere. Admiterea în zona euro înseamnă că moneda națională, lira cipriotă, va fi înlocuită cu moneda euro și că țara va deveni membră a uniunii monetare europene, ceea ce îi va permite să beneficieze de avantajele aderării la această uniune. Aderarea Ciprului la Uniunea Europeană a avut loc în urma negocierilor care au început în 1990, iar în 2004, Cipru a devenit membru cu drepturi depline al UE. Ca parte a acestui proces, Cipru a trebuit să își restructureze economia și să îndeplinească alte criterii pe care comunitatea europeană le-a considerat necesare înainte de a deveni un membru al zonei euro. Pe măsură ce populația și economia Ciprului continuă să crească, aderarea la zona euro va avea consecințe pozitive pe termen lung pentru țară. Astfel, va fi consolidată stabilitatea financiară și se vor dezvolta relațiile comerciale cu celelalte țări membre ale Uniunii Europene. În ceea ce privește schimbul de monedă, banca centrală a Ciprului va converti stocurile de lire cipriote în euro. Acest schimb de valută va fi echivalentul ratei de schimb fixe oficiale de la intrarea în vigoare a zonei euro în toată țara. Oamenii vor putea să-și schimbe lirele cipriote în euro în băncile comerciale. Pentru a se asigura că aderarea la zona euro se desfășoară fără probleme, guvernul cipriot lucrează îndeaproape cu instituțiile europene și cu Banca Centrală Europeană. Aceste eforturi includ adoptarea unor măsuri pentru a se conforma cu legislația și reglementările europene, ajustarea politicii monetare și fiscale pentru a asigura stabilitatea economică și financiară, precum și promovarea creșterii economice, a ocupării forței de muncă și a întăririi instituțiilor financiare. În încheiere, aderarea Ciprului la zona euro reprezintă un pas important în dezvoltarea sa economică și în consolidarea poziției sale în cadrul comunității europene. Pe măsură ce se apropie data de 1 ianuarie 2008, autoritățile și cetățenii Ciprului se pregătesc să facă față noilor provocări și oportunităților care vor decurge din această schimbare semnificativă."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Article: Clothes can make phone calls, play music, dial your pal's number, keep you warm during cold weather and operate your computer? This is not a fantasy. A British company, called Electrotextiles, has created a wide range of clothes -- clothes that have minds of their own! Scientists, working for the company, have invented a kind of fabric that can be blended with flexible electronic materials to create intelligent clothing. The result are electronic garments. If you think the wearer has to be wired to different devices, think again. These designer clothes are wire-free, soft to touch and washable!! Like any electronic device, these high-tech clothes have to be powered. Currently, a tiny nine-volt battery serves the purpose. But the researchers hope that in the near future the clothes will generate electricity by using body heat. These clothes are 100 percent shock proof, they say. The Electrotextiles team has also created the world's first cloth keyboard. This keyboard can be sewn into your trousers or skirt. To use this device, you will have to sit down and tap on your lap! These 'lap- tap' gadgets are all set to take over laptop computers! Another useful garment is the shirt-cum-mobile phone. This handy invention enables drivers to chat comfortably with others at the wheel! Other popular electronic wear include the denim jacket with flexible earphones sewn into the hood and the electronic ski jacket with a built-in heater. The ski jacket is also programmed to send signals to a satellite. This technology is known as global positioning system and can be used to track lost skiers and wandering kids. Having completed the cloth keyboard, scientists have already started to work on a new project--a necktie that can be used as a computer mouse. What is the next? Do you have any idea? Question: .

Robert Owen (; 14 May 1771 - 17 November 1858) was a Welsh textile manufacturer, philanthropic social reformer, and one of the founders of utopian socialism and the cooperative movement. Owen is best known for his efforts to improve the working conditions of his factory workers and his promotion of experimental socialistic communities. In July 1799 Owen and his partners bought the New Lanark mill from David Dale, and Owen became the New Lanark mill's manager in January 1800. Encouraged by his success in the management of cotton mills in Manchester, Owen hoped to conduct the New Lanark mill on higher principles than purely commercial ones. David Dale and Richard Arkwright had established the substantial mill at New Lanark in 1785. With its water power provided by the falls of the River Clyde, the cotton-spinning operation became one of Britain's largest. About 2,000 individuals were associations with the mill; 500 of them were children who were brought to the mill at the age of five or six from the poorhouses and charities of Edinburgh and Glasgow. Dale, who was known for his benevolence, treated the children well, but the general condition of New Lanark's residents was unsatisfactory. Over the years, Dale and his son-in-law, Owen, worked to improve the factory workers' lives. Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room. The respectable country people refused to submit to the long hours and demoralising drudgery of the mills. Until a series of Truck Acts (1831-1887) required employees to be paid in common currency, many employers operated the truck system that paid workers in total or in part with tokens. The tokens had no monetary value outside the mill owner's \\"truck shop,\\" where the owners could supply shoddy goods and charge top prices. In contrast to other employers, Owen's store offered goods at prices slightly above their wholesale cost. He also passed on the savings from the bulk purchase of goods to his workers, and placed the sale of alcohol under strict supervision. These principles became the basis for the cooperative shops in Britain, which continue in an altered form to trade today. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: What did Robert Owen feel about the residents behavior?","completion":"Robert Owen felt that the behavior of the residents was unsatisfactory, as evidenced by this quote from the article: \\"Many of the workers were in the lowest levels of the population; theft, drunkenness, and other vices were common; education and sanitation were neglected; and most families lived in one room.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He rose to prominence in the second half of the 1990s after making a string of major hits for artists such as the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears and NSYNC. Some of his earlier hits include \\"...Baby One More Time\\" (1998) Sandberg was born in Stockholm and grew up in the suburb Stenhamra, Ekero Municipality. As a child, Martin was a student of Sweden's public music-education program, and once said he had \\"public music education to thank for everything.\\" Other alumni of the program include Andreas Carlsson, Rami Yacoub, and Anders Bagge. As a teenager he sang in a variety of bands before joining a glam-style metal band called It's Alive in 1985 as their singer and frontman. It's Alive were formed by ex-LAZY members Per Aldeheim and Kim Bjorkgren on guitars, and John Rosth who had been a member of Lineout. Martin eventually dropped out of high school to pursue a career in music with his band under the nickname \\"Martin White.\\" In 1988 they participated in the national rock championships and played as the in-house band at a disco in Cyprus. The band got a breakthrough in 1991, as Dave Constable of Megarock Records offered them to make a demo-record. The later debut album was originally pressed in 1,000 copies and later on given away as a free cover tape in the UK by the Metal Forces magazine. The decision to focus on a music career paid off as they landed a record deal on producer Denniz PoP's label Cheiron Records, a BMG affiliate. After recording their second album Earthquake Visions, they released three singles in conjunction with the record and toured through Europe in 1994 supporting Kingdom Come. Earthquake Visions eventually sold a disappointing 30,000 copies, despite being released in as many as 30 countries. More importantly though, Martin also began collaborating on songs with PoP.

Ralph Buehler teaches urban planning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,popularly known as Virginia Tech.He has written a book about urban biking,called \\"City Cycling\\". He says there is a reason why urban bike tiding is now becoming more popular. \\"Over the last 60 to 70 years.cities in the U.S.have been adapted to the automobile.\\" \\"Most cities took advantage of the money coming for the interstate highway system,from the federal government,starting in 1956.There was a 90 percent federal match so the cities only had to put up 10%.It was very tempting.\\" In the years after World War Two,many Americans moved to suburban communities,just outside major cities,They decided to travel great distances to and from work in exchange for a home in the suburbs.Their cars became a symbol of freedom. But today,many people believe they can save money by living in the city.

In this sentence, \\"EMAS\\" refers to the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme, which is a voluntary management and audit instrument developed by the European Commission for businesses and organizations to evaluate, report, and improve their environmental performance. The statement suggests that implementing EMAS should serve as an incentive for businesses and organizations to improve their environmental practices. The Eco-Management and Audit Scheme was introduced in 1993, and its main objective is to help organizations achieve a high level of environmental performance. This is done in a structured and methodical manner by providing a comprehensive framework that supports the integration of environmental management into the internal decision-making processes of the organization. One of the key aspects of EMAS is the commitment to continuous improvement. This means that participating organizations are expected to improve their environmental performance over time rather than just maintaining a certain level of performance. In order to do this, organizations must identify and evaluate their environmental impacts, set objectives and targets to minimize these impacts, and implement an environmental management plan. Another important element of EMAS is communication and transparency. Organizations that participate in EMAS are required to regularly report on their environmental performance and discuss the results with stakeholders, including employees, customers, and suppliers. This encourages the organization to be accountable for its environmental performance and fosters a relationship of trust with stakeholders. The incentive aspect of EMAS comes from several sources: 1. Improved environmental performance: Participating organizations demonstrate their commitment to the environment and can use this to differentiate themselves in the market. This can lead to increased competitiveness, greater attractiveness to investors, and even increased demand for their products or services. 2. Legal compliance: By adhering to EMAS, organizations can ensure that they comply with relevant environmental legislation and proactively identify potential risks or challenges. This can lead to improved relationships with regulatory authorities and reduce the likelihood of fines or penalties for non-compliance. 3. Cost savings: The implementation of an environmental management system can help organizations identify areas where they can reduce environmental impacts and costs. For example, by reducing energy consumption or waste generation, businesses can save money on utility bills and disposal fees. 4. Employee engagement: Studies show that employees who work for organizations with a demonstrated commitment to sustainability are more likely to be satisfied and engaged in their work. By striving for continuous improvement in environmental performance, organizations can create a positive work environment that attracts and retains top talent. 5. Reputation and public relations: Participation in EMAS can serve as a valuable marketing tool for organizations that want to showcase their environmental efforts and build a positive public image. By meeting the stringent requirements of the scheme, organizations can demonstrate that they are serious about their environmental responsibilities. In conclusion, the Eco-Management and Audit Scheme is designed to provide a comprehensive framework for organizations to improve their environmental performance and communicate their efforts to interested parties. By participating in EMAS, organizations can reap both direct and indirect benefits, making it an attractive incentive for businesses to improve their environmental practices."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield. Two farms were testing new methods to increase production. Timber farm used AM fungi, while Pine farm used other conventional agricultural methods. Which farm didn't provide more time for AM fungi growth into the spring?

This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Now, I have a new situation: David was studying human history. He selected two specific eras of human history, era A and era B. Era A was before humans had invented agriculture. And, era B was after the invention of agriculture. He noticed that human societies had changed dramatically after the invention of agriculture. Answer this question please: Which era saw lower death rate, era A or era B? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question on which era, A or B, saw lower death rates, we have to compare the factors that contributed to death rates in both eras. Era A - Before the invention of agriculture: In this period, human societies were mostly nomadic, relying on hunting and gathering for sustenance. The population density was relatively low, primarily due to the need for extensive land to support their way of life. Consequently, there were fewer opportunities for infectious diseases to spread. With smaller communities and limited contact between groups, the risk of large-scale outbreaks was minimized. However, life was also challenging, as people had to constantly search for food and were more exposed to environmental dangers and predators. Additionally, individuals during this era had a shorter life expectancy due to the physically demanding nature of their daily tasks and the lack of advanced medicine. Era B - After the invention of agriculture: The development of agriculture revolutionized human societies, allowing people to settle in one place, thus fostering the establishment of villages and cities. While this resulted in a more stable food supply and increased birth rates, it also led to higher death rates. The reasons for the increase were related to the higher population densities in settlements, which created an environment where diseases could spread more easily. Additionally, the close proximity to domesticated animals facilitated the transmission of zoonotic diseases. While advancements in agriculture and technology provided more secure food sources and better living conditions, the more sedentary lifestyle and increased exposure to various diseases contributed to a higher mortality rate. In conclusion, era A, before the invention of agriculture, likely witnessed lower death rates when compared to era B, after the invention of agriculture. Although the quality of life in era A was more difficult and people lived shorter lives, the low population density and the lack of large-scale disease outbreaks contributed to a lower death rate. On the other hand, in era B, despite the advantages that agriculture brought, such as a more stable food supply and improved living conditions, higher population densities and the increased presence of diseases, especially those transmitted by domestic animals, resulted in higher death rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Imagine you are standing in a farm field in central Illinois. The land is so flat you can see for miles and miles. On a clear day, you might see a grain silo 20 miles away. You might think to yourself, it sure is flat around here. If you drive one hundred miles to the south, the landscape changes. In southern Illinois, there are rolling hills. Why do you think this is? What could have caused these features? There are no big rivers that may have eroded and deposited this material. The ground is capable of supporting grass and trees, so wind erosion would not explain it. To answer the question, you need to go back 12,000 years. Around 12,000 years ago, a giant ice sheet covered much of the Midwest United States. Springfield, Illinois, was covered by over a mile of ice. Its hard to imagine a mile thick sheet of ice. The massive ice sheet, called a glacier, caused the features on the land you see today. Where did glaciers go? Where can you see them today? Glaciers are masses of flowing ice. Question: \\"How is the landscape in Southern Illinois different from that in central Illinois?\\" Answer: \\"Southern Illinois has mountains and Central Illinois is flat\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct but can be elaborated further. The landscape in Southern Illinois is characterized by rolling hills, while Central Illinois is predominantly flat with vast stretches of farmland. This difference in the topography of the two regions is mainly due to the geological events that occurred around 12,000 years ago, when a massive ice sheet, known as a glacier, covered much of the Midwest United States, including Springfield, Illinois. This glacier played a significant role in shaping the landscape features we see today in these regions. As the ice retreated over time, it left different landforms and deposits in the areas it once covered, creating the distinct landscapes found in Central and Southern Illinois."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

En procédant à l’examen des dossiers et à des entrevues, nous avons relevé plusieurs exemples de marchés réservés aux fournisseurs autochtones. Translate to English","completion":"Upon reviewing documents and conducting interviews, we have identified several examples of markets designated exclusively for Indigenous suppliers. In this context, the term \\"marchés réservés\\" refers to designated opportunities or contracts specifically set aside for Indigenous suppliers. This practice aims to encourage economic development and participation of Indigenous businesses in various sectors. These markets can be found across different industries, such as construction, consulting, or services, among others. Such initiatives are often implemented by governments, organizations, or institutions that recognize the importance of promoting diversity and inclusion in their procurement processes. These reserved markets facilitate the growth of Indigenous-owned businesses by providing them with unique opportunities to bid on contracts that they might not have access to otherwise. Identifying these markets begins with reviewing documents and conducting interviews, as mentioned in the French text. In order to locate these reserved markets, one must first analyze existing procurement policies and procedures within an organization or jurisdiction. This can include reviewing tender notices, procurement guidelines, and contract award criteria, as well as speaking to individuals responsible for implementing these policies. Additionally, it is essential to engage with relevant stakeholders, which may include representatives from Indigenous organizations, government officials, or procurement officers. Through these interactions, further insight can be gained on common practices, barriers, and successful initiatives that have been implemented to promote reserved markets for Indigenous suppliers. Once these markets have been identified, it is crucial for organizations and governments to continually evaluate and improve the effectiveness of these programs. One way to achieve this is by establishing performance indicators, such as the number of contracts awarded to Indigenous suppliers and an assessment of the economic impact of these initiatives on Indigenous communities. In conclusion, translating the French text, we can see that upon reviewing documents and conducting interviews, several examples of markets designated exclusively for Indigenous suppliers have been identified. These reserved markets aim to promote economic development and engagement of Indigenous businesses in various sectors, while advocating for diversity and inclusion in procurement processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Most commentators have considered suicide to be the more likely cause of whose death? ? In September 1930 Heseltine moved with Barbara Peache into a basement flat at 12a Tite Street in Chelsea. With no fresh creative inspiration, he worked in the British Museum to transcribe the music of English composer Cipriani Potter, and made a solo version of \\"Bethlehem Down\\" with organ accompaniment. On the evening of 16 December Heseltine met with Van Dieren and his wife for a drink and invited them home afterwards. According to Van Dieren, the visitors left at about 12:15 a.m. Neighbours later reported sounds of movement and of a piano in the early morning. When Peache, who had been away, returned early on 17 December, she found the doors and windows bolted, and smelled coal gas. The police broke into the flat and found Heseltine unconscious; he was declared dead shortly afterwards, apparently as the result of coal gas poisoning.An inquest was held on 22 December; the jury could not determine whether the death was accidental or suicide and an open verdict was returned. Most commentators have considered suicide the more likely cause; Heseltine's close friend Lionel Jellinek and Peache both recalled that he had previously threatened to take his life by gas and the outline of a new will was found among the papers in the flat. Much later, Nigel Heseltine introduced a new theory—that his father had been murdered by Van Dieren, the sole beneficiary of Heseltine's 1920 will, which stood to be revoked by the new one. This theory is not considered tenable by most commentators. The suicide theory is supported (arguably), by the (supposed, accepted) fact that Heseltine/Warlock had put his young cat outside the room before he had turned on the lethal gas.Philip Heseltine was buried alongside his father at Godalming cemetery on 20 December 1930. In late February 1931, a memorial concert of his music was held at the Wigmore Hall; a second such concert took place in the following December.In 2011 the art critic Brian Sewell published his memoirs, in which he claimed that he was Heseltine's illegitimate son, born in...

Moreover, the outline of a new will was found among the papers in Heseltine's flat, suggesting some premeditation. Additionally, the suicide theory is arguably supported by the fact that Heseltine (also known as Warlock) had reportedly put his young cat outside the room before turning on the lethal gas.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Welcome to the world of multitasking -- a place where the measure of a person is how many jobs they can perform at the same time. In fact, if experts are to be believed, multitasking is a disastrous idea. One of the opponents of multitasking is Dr. Clifford Nass, a professor at Stanford University. \\"People who multitask frequently are less able to pay attention; they're worse at managing their memory.\\" he said. In his opinion, the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless in some situations, for example, part of doing business in the digital world: but you can't do serious work like writing, thinking or solving an important problem this way. You do worse even as you think you're doing better. All the time the research points to a simple fact: the brain cannot cope. When you stop midway through composing a report to check an email, you force your brain to stop and regroup. It is like pressing the pause button during a movie, meaning the film takes longer to watch. And as for Dr. Nass, the problems extend beyond the brain. Young people who frequently multitask are not as socially and emotionally healthy as those who don't. They just feel more emotionally satisfied and the feeling is so good and they are bound to desire it again. Todd Oppenheimer, a writer said \\"We've become a very short-term society and don't reward people for taking a lot of time on something.\\" He fears we may end up losing the next generation of great thinkers. \\"It's really unfortunate because the long-term challenges of our world -- environmental issues, financial issues -- require people to think wisely about the long-term consequences of what they do. And it's no coincidence that the kind of people who do think long-term don't multitask.\\" Options: A the loss that we get with multitasking is harmless B we mistakenly believe that we're doing better by switching between tasks C doing multitasking does harm to us in every area D for every task you add to your multitasking, you can finish your goal quicker Answer: B we mistakenly believe that we're doing better by switching between tasks Question: A:","completion":"According to the article on multitasking, what is a common misconception people have about their performance while multitasking?

Choose a frame that fits the dimensions of your shadow box so it fits onto it evenly. Remove any backing or other materials from the picture frame so that only the front wooden frame and the glass remains. You can buy new frames at craft supply stores and department stores.

Then, attach another small hinge to the outermost edge of the frame near the bottom so there are 2 hinges on the same side. Make sure the hinges are aligned with each other and evenly spaced from the top and bottom edges of the frame. Use the small screws that come with the hinges. You can find small hinges at home improvement stores, department stores, and online. Lay the picture frame on your shadow box frame and align the hinges so they lay flat on the outer edge on the front. Use your drill to drive the screws into the shadow box frame so the hinges connect the picture frame to it. Open and close the front panel to make sure it works and the edges are lined up evenly. You can also use a screwdriver if you don’t have access to a power drill. Use the same paint or stain that you used to paint the rest of the shadow box frame and apply a thin coat over the front panel.

Question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: THE first night in Yosemite had been awful. I hadn't been able to sleep and I was stuck in a too small tent with my wife and two kids. \\"Things haven't worked out,\\" I said to myself. But, like so many other things I complain before my morning coffee, this one was ridiculously off-key. Things weren't bad; they were good. A hundred yards(91 meters) away was Summit Lake, with its wonderful early morning mists shimmering off the water. A couple of miles to the southwest was the base of the Lassen Peak Trail. The base was 8,000 feet (2,400 meters) above sea level, huge snow banks dotting the place even in mid August. It was beautiful. We fired up the camp stove, got out our cold boxes from the heavy metal locker ,fired up some bacon, cut open some bread, and boiled up a cup of coffee. Half an hour later, my 6-year-old daughter and I were in the parking lot of the Lassen Peak Trail, getting ready to hike. We wouldn't make it all the way-- young legs get pretty tired on a steep mountain path, but it didn't matter. We would see great views spread out below us, the volcanic ash that layered on the earth turning the melting snow a mysterious pink as the sun struck it. Later, on the hike, I felt stupid about my morning complaints. Everything had been worthwhile. It gave me enormous satisfaction to see my daughter so excited about the view from the mountain. Yes, camping is uncomfortable. But there's also something wonderful about being so close to nature. Just as importantly, there's something about getting young children out of their increasingly technology-filled comfort zones and forcing them to encounter the non-cyber world around them. We lose something when we spend all our time cocooned inside a carefully constructed modernity, when read about daily affronts to the environment, yet don't fully realize what is at risk, removed as we are from nature. It's a good thing to reconnect every so often with the Great Outdoors. By Sasha Abramsky Question: Which of the following is TRUEaccording to the article? - The author seldom complains in the early morning. - The author walked all the way to the Lassen Peak Trail. - The view from the mountain impressed the author's daughter. - The author hiked to the top of the mountain to get a better view.

Context: That fall came and I went back to Michigan and the school year went by and summer came and I never really thought about it. I'm not even sure if I was officially asked, I just wound up heading back to New Jersey when school was out. I think my parents thought it was a good enough deal. They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer. It's pretty amazing that she wound up as my Maid of Honor. Time does strange things. Your lovable jack-ass of a father would mention something about magic in here.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: How does Sam know the person who gets his head crushed by a statue? ? Sam Lawton is on his way to a company retreat with his colleagues. While their bus crosses the North Bay Bridge, Sam has a premonition that the bridge will collapse, killing everyone except his ex-girlfriend Molly Harper, whom he manages to get across the bridge safely. In a panic, he persuades several people to leave the bridge before it collapses, including Molly, his friends Nathan Sears and Peter Friedkin, Peter's girlfriend Candice Hooper, his boss Dennis Lapman, and his co-workers Olivia Castle and Isaac Palmer. FBI agent Jim Block doesn't believe that Sam is responsible for the bridge collapse, but promises to keep an eye on him. At the memorial service, coroner William Bludworth mysteriously tells the survivors that \\"Death doesn't like to be cheated,\\" and warns them to be careful. However, they ignore his warning and leave, believing this to be nonsense. Later, Candice goes to the gym to practice with Peter, but a chain reaction causes her to fly off the uneven bars, and she snaps her spine, leaving Peter devastated. The next day, Isaac is killed at a Chinese spa when his head is crushed by a falling Buddha statue during an acupuncture session. Bludworth, who has been present for both deaths, tells the remaining survivors that if they wish to cheat Death, they must kill someone who was never meant to die on the bridge, and thereby claim their remaining lifespan. On the same day, Olivia goes to an eye surgery clinic to treat her myopic vision. While the doctor is away looking for files, the laser malfunctions, searing her eye and hand. She manages to free herself just as Sam and Molly arrive to save her, but trips and falls out of the window onto a car below. Later, Sam learns that the survivors are dying in the order they were meant to die on the bridge, and realize that Nathan is next.

Once you’ve shown him that you’re interested or secured a date, give him a little bit of space. Let him get to know you slowly while sending out signals that you’e committed to allowing him in. For example, don’t set up dates two days in a row or immediately invite him over to your place. Avoid asking him personal questions right off the bat. Let him open up to you in his own time. You’ll love how romantic and compassionate he’ll be! Plan a weekend trip to the coast, rent a kayak or try paddleboarding. Take a casual day-date to the beach during the summer. Cancer is a water sign and Cancer men love being near the sea. Although a Cancer man might be hesitant to invite you over when you’ve just started seeing each other, once he’s beginning to commit to you he’ll definitely want to show you his home. In fact, the perfect date for a Cancer man is a night spent at home together. Turn the lights down, curl up together under a blanket, and let him choose the movie. Cancer men love and are proud of their homes. Compliment him on his place and show him that you love spending time there with him. A Cancer man will still love to go out and be social, but home is his place to recharge and relax. He’ll love that you want to spend time with him there. Cancer men are sensitive and don’t like to be in tense, fraught situations. Keep your temper under control when you’re together and avoid gossiping or critiquing others. For example, avoid snapping if a car cuts in front of you, or complaining about the service at a restaurant. Instead, take a deep breath and let it go.

Birthdate: 11 June 1960 c. Birthplace: Bristol, England d. Nationality: English 2. Professional Career: a. Occupation: Former professional footballer b. Tenure: The phrase \\"former professional footballer\\" suggests that he has retired from his professional football career, but the bio doesn't provide information about the duration of his career or the years he played. c. Football League: Graham Withey played in the Football League, which is a system of professional football leagues in England. It usually refers to the English Football League (EFL), which, before 1992, was the highest level of domestic football and consisted of the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Divisions. After 1992, it represents the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th levels of English football, as the highest level became the Premier League. The bio does not, however, specify which division(s) he played in or the clubs he played for during his career. 3. Football Position: a. Forward: Graham Withey played as a forward on the field. In football, forwards, also known as strikers or attackers, are responsible for the majority of goal-scoring opportunities and play closest to the opposing team's goal. Their primary objective is to score goals and create scoring chances for their teammates.

To summarize, Graham Withey was born on 11 June 1960 in Bristol, England, and is a former English professional footballer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Alison Bechdel, Who Created 'Bechdel Test,' Wins MacArthur Prize The MacArthur Foundation has announced the 21 recipients of this year’s fellowships, often referred to as the “genius grant,” and among the honorees is cartoonist and graphic artist Alison Bechdel, who is known for her graphic memoirs Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic and Are You My Mother? The prestigious fellowships, which are awarded based on achievement and potential, come with a stipend of 625,000, spread over five years, which can be spent in any way the honorees see fit. Bechdel, who is currently at an artist residency in Italy, told the Los Angeles Times that when she received the call announcing she won, “It was crazy.” She added, “It was a little garbled, then I heard the person on the other end say the words MacArthur Foundation and the world started spinning.” Bechdel is only the second graphic novelist to win the fellowship after Ben Katchor won in 2000. Even those who aren’t familiar with her cartoons or graphic memoirs have likely heard of the 54-year-old Bechdel, whose work has inadvertently upended the way we think about movies with her now famous Bechdel Test. The test, which the cartoonist coined in 1985 in a strip called “The Rule,” asks three questions of a film as a way to demonstrate the very basic level at which gender biases operate in movies: 1) Does the movie have two female characters?; 2) Do the speak to each other?; 3) Do they speak about something other than a man? Sadly, many movies — even today, almost 20 years after the test was created — don’t pass. Yet the very fact that the Bechdel Test has become a mainstream concept, rather than a niche, radical feminist idea, proves how much influence it has had. Out of the 21 prizes awarded, eight other women were also honored. The New York Times reports that the oldest fellow this year is 71-year-old Pamela O. Long, a historian of science and technology in Washington, and the youngest is 32-year-old Danielle S. Bassett, a physicist at the University of Pennsylvania. The other honorees this year are a mix of artists, filmmakers, social activists, poets, historians and scientists that include John Henneberger, Mary L. Bonauto, Sarah Deer, Jonathan Rapping, Jacob Lurie, filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer, Ai-jen Poo, Rick Lowe, Samuel D. Hunter, Steve Coleman, Terrance Hayes, Yitang Zhang, Jennifer L. Eberhardt, Tami Bond, Mark Hersam, Craig Gentry, Khaled Mattawa and Tara Zahra. When asked about the stipend, Bechdel told the LA Times, “It will give me a lot of security that I don’t have. Pay off some debts, save for retirement — really boring stuff.” But she also added that it will allow her to “take some risks, do something new — to really plunge into my work. It’s an incredible gift.” Summary:","completion":"Cartoonist and graphic artist Alison Bechdel, who created the well-known \\"Bechdel Test,\\" has been announced as one of the 21 recipients of this year's MacArthur Foundation fellowships, also known as the \\"genius grant.\\" The prestigious fellowship awards come with a 625,000 stipend over five years to be used by the recipients in any way they choose.

And the answer is?","completion":"Opprobrium refers to a deep form of public disgrace or criticism resulting from one's actions, behavior, or conduct, causing them to lose the respect of others. The word has its origins in Latin, derived from \\"opprobrium\\" which means reproach, disgrace, or shame. In English, the term is often used to emphasize the intense disapproval or condemnation held by the community or society towards an individual or their actions. When someone is subjected to opprobrium, they experience a severe loss of reputation and may face humiliation, scorn, and contempt from the people around them. This could be a result of their immoral, unethical, or socially unacceptable actions that are considered beyond the pale. The consequences of opprobrium can have a significant impact on an individual's personal and professional life, often leading to isolation and exclusion from social or professional circles. Examples of events that may lead to opprobrium include but are not limited to: 1. A political scandal involving corruption, fraud, or abuse of power. 2. A high-profile individual being exposed for engaging in criminal activities or gross misconduct. 3. Public figures making offensive or incendiary remarks about a particular racial, religious, or social group. 4. People engaging in unethical business practices or exploiting others for personal gain. 5. Cases where a person of authority abuses their position for selfish purposes. It is important to note that the concept of opprobrium is not limited only to individuals; groups, organizations, or even entire nations can be subjected to opprobrium for actions that are perceived to be morally or ethically repugnant. The concept has also been employed in the study of social psychology, where it may be examined in conjunction with subjects such as deviance and sanctioning. In summary, opprobrium refers to a deep form of public disgrace or criticism, often resulting from an individual's or group's actions that are seen as highly reproachable, immoral, or unethical. The experience of opprobrium can have severe personal and societal consequences, affecting one's reputation and relationships within their community."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The first time I went there after it switched from Exxon, an attendant came running out to pump my gas for me. I checked to see if I accidently pulled into the Full Service island (do those even exist anymore?) I hadn't, but the guy pumped my gas and cleaned my windshield just the same. Wow! Great service or so I thought. I gave the guy a 2 tip (All I had on me at the time). He just looked at it, then looked at me with a disgusted look like I was supposed to kiss his feet and give him a 20 because he actually did his job. I guess the tips weren't adding up because these days, they don't even acknowledge you anymore. There are never any squeegees to clean your window, either.

Article: Last year we visited prefix = st1 /Stratford, the place where Shakespeare was born on the 23rd of April, 1564. Stratford is a very interesting town, right in the center of England. The countryside aroundStratfordis pleasant, with its beautiful woods, green fields and quiet rivers. The first place we visited was the house in the center of Stratfordwhere Shakespeare was born. We saw the small desk that Shakespeare sat at when he went to school. One of the things we liked best was the garden behind the house, because we could see there many of the flowers, trees and plants that Shakespeare wrote about in his plays. After we had visited Shakespeare's birthplace, we went to see the church where he was buried. We had lunch in a very old hotel that was probably there in Shakespeare's time. Every room of the hotel had the name of one of Shakespeare's plays on the door--the \\"Hamlet\\" room, the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" room, and so on. After lunch we walked across the fields to the old cottage, about a mile out of Stratford, where Shakespeare spent most of his married life. The cottage is just as it was in Shakespeare's day. We saw the chairs where Shakespeare perhaps sat and thought about ideas for new plays, and we saw the plates from which he probably ate his dinner. When we got back to our hotel that evening, we were tired, but we had enjoyed a wonderful day. Question: Most of Shakespeare's married life was spent _ .

Reducing resource use means just what it says using fewer resources. There are lots of ways to reduce our use of resources. Buy durable goods. Choose items that are well made so they will last longer. Youll buy fewer items in the long run, so youll save money as well as resources. Thats a win-win! Repair rather than replace. Fix your bike rather than buying a new one. Sew on a button instead of buying a new shirt. Youll use fewer resources and save money. Buy only what you need. Dont buy a gallon of milk if you can only drink half of it before it spoils. Instead, buy a half gallon and drink all of it. You wont be wasting resources (or money!) Buy local. For example, buy local produce at a farmers market, like the one in Figure 2.20. A lot of resources are saved by not shipping goods long distances.

Option A suggests that Michael himself was offended by the contents of his own account and therefore wanted it deleted. Option B indicates that Eric was offended by the contents of Michael's account, which led to Michael wanting it deleted.

Which project would register higher CPU load, project A or project C? Bob works for a data storage company. He has now three projects, project A, project B, and project C, simultaneously going on. All of them involves storing XML data. Project A has small volume of data, but project B and project C has large volume of data. He applied Fast Infoset format for project B, but didn't apply that format for project C. Hint: Storing large volumes of data – When storing XML to either file or database, the volume of data a system produces can often exceed reasonable limits, with a number of detriments: the access times go up as more data is read, CPU load goes up as XML data takes more power to process, and storage costs go up. By storing XML data in Fast Infoset format, data volume may be reduced by as much as 80 percent. Answer:","completion":"Project C would register a higher CPU load. Both Project B and Project C involve storing large volumes of data, which we know can often exceed reasonable limits and increase CPU load as the system must put more power into processing the XML data. However, the crucial difference between the two is the format in which the data is stored. For Project B, Bob applied the Fast Infoset format. This format is beneficial because it can reduce the data volume by as much as 80 percent, thereby lessening the burden on the CPU. A decreased data volume implies lesser data for the system to read and process, so less power is required. This directly impacts the CPU load, causing it to be lower with the use of Fast Infoset format. On the other hand, for Project C, Bob did not apply the Fast Infoset format. This means that the large volume of XML data is not being reduced, and the system is tasked with managing the full volume of data. The CPU load would go up due to the increased power needed to process this large volume of XML data. Comparing this to Project A, which has a small volume of data, regardless of the non-use of Fast Infoset format, the CPU load would still be less because the amount of data that needs processing is much smaller. Therefore, in the context of these three projects, since Project C has a large volume of XML data without the reduction benefits of the Fast Infoset format, it would register a higher CPU load compared to Projects A and B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is credited with very few works?, using the article: The attribution of the panel reflects the progression and trends of 19th and 20th-century scholarship on Early Netherlandish art. It is now thought to have been completed c. 1438–40, but there are still arguments for dates as early as 1424–29. As with the pages ascribed to Hand G in the Turin-Milan Hours manuscript, the panel was attributed to Jan's brother Hubert van Eyck in the 1875 Gemäldegalerie catalogue, and by a 1911 claim by art historian Georges Hulin de Loo. This is no longer considered credible and Hubert, today, is credited with very few works. By 1912 the painting had been definitively attributed to Jan in the museum catalogue.Attempts to date it have undergone similar shifts of opinion. In the 19th century the panel was believed to be an early work by Jan completed as early as c. 1410, although this view changed as scholarship progressed. In the early 20th century, Ludwig von Baldass placed it around 1424–29, then for a long period it was seen as originating from the early 1430s. Erwin Panofsky provided the first detailed treatise on the work and placed it around 1432–34. However, following research from Meyer Schapiro, he revised his opinion to the late 1430s in the 1953 edition of his Early Netherlandish Painting. A 1970s comparative study of van Eyck's 1437 Saint Barbara concluded that Madonna in the Church was completed after c. 1437. In the 1990s, Otto Pächt judged the work as probably a late van Eyck, given the similar treatment of an interior in the 1434 Arnolfini Portrait. In the early 21st century, Jeffrey Chipps Smith and John Oliver Hand placed it between 1426 and 1428, claiming it as perhaps the earliest extant signed work confirmed as by Jan., what would be the answer ?

I know that the answer to the question \\"Was Origin published in Spanish or Polish first?\\" is in \\"The book was widely translated in Darwin's lifetime, but problems arose with translating concepts and metaphors, and some translations were biased by the translator's own agenda. Darwin distributed presentation copies in France and Germany, hoping that suitable applicants would come forward, as translators were expected to make their own arrangements with a local publisher. He welcomed the distinguished elderly naturalist and geologist Heinrich Georg Bronn, but the German translation published in 1860 imposed Bronn's own ideas, adding controversial themes that Darwin had deliberately omitted. Bronn translated \\"favoured races\\" as \\"perfected races\\", and added essays on issues including the origin of life, as well as a final chapter on religious implications partly inspired by Bronn's adherence to Naturphilosophie. In 1862, Bronn produced a second edition based on the third English edition and Darwin's suggested additions, but then died of a heart attack. Darwin corresponded closely with Julius Victor Carus, who published an improved translation in 1867. Darwin's attempts to find a translator in France fell through, and the translation by Clémence Royer published in 1862 added an introduction praising Darwin's ideas as an alternative to religious revelation and promoting ideas anticipating social Darwinism and eugenics, as well as numerous explanatory notes giving her own answers to doubts that Darwin expressed. Darwin corresponded with Royer about a second edition published in 1866 and a third in 1870, but he had difficulty getting her to remove her notes and was troubled by these editions. He remained unsatisfied until a translation by Edmond Barbier was published in 1876. A Dutch translation by Tiberius Cornelis Winkler was published in 1860. By 1864, additional translations had appeared in Italian and Russian.

Context: Incubation, which optimises temperature for chick development, usually begins after the last egg has been laid. In monogamous species incubation duties are often shared, whereas in polygamous species one parent is wholly responsible for incubation. Warmth from parents passes to the eggs through brood patches, areas of bare skin on the abdomen or breast of the incubating birds. Incubation can be an energetically demanding process; adult albatrosses, for instance, lose as much as 83 grams (2.9 oz) of body weight per day of incubation. The warmth for the incubation of the eggs of megapodes comes from the sun, decaying vegetation or volcanic sources.

The goal of this interaction is to allow effective operation and control of the machine from the human end, whilst the machine simultaneously feeds back information that aids the operators' decision-making process. Examples of this broad concept of user interfaces include the interactive aspects of computer operating systems, hand tools, heavy machinery operator controls, and process controls. The design considerations applicable when creating user interfaces are related to or involve such disciplines as ergonomics and psychology. - Eclipse is a mod for the video game Half - Life 2 .

You must generate a detailed and long answer. pick from the following. a). negative b). positive Short movie review: does n't offer much in terms of plot or acting . Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Based on the short movie review provided, it is evident that the critic is thinking negatively about the movie. There are several factors that support this conclusion. Firstly, the language used in the review is quite negative. When a reviewer states that a movie \\"doesn't offer much in terms of plot or acting,\\" it implies that the plot is weak or poorly executed, and the performances of the actors are subpar or not engaging. Both of these factors are crucial to the overall success and enjoyment of a film, and if a movie fails to deliver in these areas, it may be considered a disappointment to the audience. Secondly, the review offers no positive aspects of the movie for the reader to consider. Generally, when a movie receives a favorable review, the critic will often mention the highlights and strengths of the film, such as strong characters, quick pacing, impressive visuals, or thought-provoking themes. In contrast, this review solely focuses on the film's shortcomings, which further supports the notion that the critic is thinking negatively of the movie. Moreover, if the critic were thinking positively about the movie, they might have chosen a different wording in their review. For instance, they could have mentioned the redeeming qualities of the film despite its lack of plot or acting. They might have also focused on other elements that were well-executed, such as the use of music, cinematography, or set design. However, none of these aspects were discussed in the review, thus solidifying the conclusion that the critic is not impressed with the movie and is therefore thinking negatively. In conclusion, the critic's thoughts on the movie are negative based on the language used in the review, the lack of any positive aspects mentioned, and the absence of highlighting any redeeming qualities. As a result, readers will likely form a negative impression of the movie and may be less inclined to watch it themselves, directly influencing the movie's potential success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Check all product labels for safety instructions before you begin. Gloves, work clothing, and protective eyewear are all recommended. If you have single cracks less than ¼\\" (6mm) wide, use asphalt crack filler. Check the label for application instructions or apply as follows: Shake the bottle to mix the product evenly. Cut off the top of the nozzle so the opening is narrower than the crack. (If there is no nozzle, load the product into an asphalt caulk gun instead.) Squeeze the filler directly into the crack until it is flush with the driveway. Let dry for 24 hours. If the filler has sunk below the driveway surface level, apply an additional coat. Wait at least 24 hours after the final coat before walking or driving over the repair. This material is intended for \\"alligator scale\\" or \\"spiderweb\\" crack patterns, single cracks wider than ¼\\" (6mm), and small depressions shallower than 2\\" (5cm). If the alligator cracks are severe, chunks of the asphalt may be fully separated from the driveway.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who possibly acquired his later connections with the French royal chapel through early experiences at Saint-Quentin? from the following article ? Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

No Answer:","completion":"While making a choice between options (a) Yes and (b) No is a direct way to answer the given question, let's provide a more in-depth analysis to better understand the context and the validity of the answer. First, let's consider the question that Quinn is expected to answer: \\"What will Others want to do next?\\" This question is quite open-ended, as it does not specify who \\"Others\\" are or what situation they find themselves in. However, with the additional context provided, we know that Quinn wants to pass a course and has worked hard towards it. We can infer that \\"Others\\" probably refers to fellow students in the same course or academic environment. The answer Quinn has proposed, \\"avoid retaking the course,\\" implies that the primary concern for these other students is passing the course and not having to repeat it. This could be seen as a valid answer, assuming that the primary motivation for the majority of the students is to pass the course in order to save time, resources, and maintain their desired academic trajectory. However, the answer could also be deemed as too narrow or specific. A more comprehensive answer might take into account various factors affecting students besides not wanting to retake the course. Some students might have different priorities or circumstances that dictate their next move. Here are just a few possibilities: - They might want to master the particular subject for their career path, regardless of whether they retake the course or not. - They could be focused on acquiring critical thinking, problem-solving, and social skills, which are essential and sought after by employers. - Their priorities might include building relationships, networking, or gaining extracurricular achievements to boost their résumés. - Students might be pursuing personal interests and passions outside of the course, which contributes to their sense of well-being and overall satisfaction. In summary, while \\"avoid retaking the course\\" could be a valid answer for some students, it may be insufficient to address the open-ended query. A more complete answer could discuss various factors that drive students to make decisions in an academic setting. It is essential to consider different motivations, aspirations, and circumstances surrounding their choices, lending to a more in-depth understanding of what \\"Others\\" might want to do next.

QUEBEC CITY, CANADA — On the eve of the G-7 summit in Canada, the U.S. president lashed out at host Justin Trudeau and the White House announced Donald Trump would skip some of the sessions. In two tweets Thursday evening, Trump accused the Canadian prime minister, as well as French President Emmanuel Macron, of “charging the U.S. massive tariffs” and creating “non-monetary barriers.” Trump also said Trudeau was being “indignant” about the cross-border trade relationship. Later Thursday night, Trump took to Twitter again to urge the European Union and Canada to “Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you!” Trump’s tweets came after Macron threatened to exclude the United States from the G-7 final statement to be issued in the mountainous tourism destination of Charlevoix. In his own tweets in French and English, Macron stated that while Trump “may not mind being isolated” the other six leaders meeting in Canada would also not mind signing an agreement among themselves. “American jobs are on the line because of his actions and because of his administration,” Trudeau said at a joint news conference with Macron earlier in the day in Ottawa. “When we can underscore this, and we see that there’s a lot of pressure within the U.S., perhaps he will revise his position.” “A trade war doesn’t spare anyone,” Macron said. “It will start to hurt American workers. The cost of raw materials will rise and industry will become less competitive.” After the contentious salvos on social media and the Trudeau-Macron news conference, the White House announced Trump would depart the summit at 10:30 a.m. Saturday, following the session on women’s empowerment. \\"The president will travel directly to Singapore from Canada in anticipation of his upcoming meeting with North Korea's leader Kim Jong Un Tuesday.

Plot title: Resident Evil: Afterlife Movie plot: The Alice clones (Milla Jovovich) attack Umbrella HQ, Tokyo, slaying the entire branch except for Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts), who escapes in a tiltrotor plane and detonates a bomb that leaves a massive sinkhole; however, the real Alice boarded beforehand. Wesker injects her with Anti-Virus before the autopilot crashes the plane. Only Alice survives. Months later, Alice travels to Alaska in an airplane, tracking broadcasts from a safe haven called Arcadia; however, she only finds abandoned planes, and is attacked by feral Claire Redfield (Ali Larter). Alice destroys a spider-like device on Claire's chest, giving her amnesia and pacifying her. They travel to the ruins of L.A., where they find survivors living in a prison surrounded by infected. They meet Luther West (Boris Kodjoe), Wendell (Fulvio Cecere), Crystal Waters (Kacey Barnfield), Bennett (Kim Coates), Kim Yong (Norman Yeung), and Angel Ortiz (Sergio Peris-Mencheta). With their help, Alice lands on the prison's roof and learns Arcadia isn't a fixed place, but a cargo tanker traveling along the coast. However, though the ship hasn't moved, no-one from it has responded to the group's rescue flares. Luther takes Alice to the last inmate, Chris (Wentworth Miller), who insists he's falsely imprisoned, and will reveal an escape route for freedom. Alice goes to the showers to wash up, but catches Wendell attempting to peep. They are attacked by a group of infected that dug into the prison, and take Wendell; she manages to kill them. Desperate, they free Chris, who reveals Claire's his sister, and the prison has an armored car they can use to escape. However, a giant axe-wielding monster begins breaking down the gate. Alice, Chris and Crystal go to the basement armory to get more guns; however, zombies kill Crystal en route. Luther and Claire reinforce the gate.

Chinese look upon Confucius as the greatest thinker and also the greatest teacher. He had about 3,000 students. For more than 2,000 years, Confucius' ideas have been around in people's everyday lives. Now they have gone far into Western countries and south Asia. People can still hear _ today. Why are his ideas so popular? They help not only in everyday life but also society. Confucius' most important ideas are kindness and good manners. Confucius said young people should take care of the old. People should give up thinking of themselves and work for others. As a great teacher, Confucius said that all should go to school if they wanted to learn. Some of Confucius' popular words are \\"A kind person should care others\\" and \\"Be strict with yourself, but be kind to others\\". People use his ideas to help themselves and society.

Options: a ) rs . 880 , b ) rs . 890 , c ) rs . 895 , d ) rs . 900 , e ) none A:","completion":"To solve this problem, first, we need to find the principal amount (P), which will allow us to find the simple interest. First, use the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) In this case: - A is the total amount after interest has been added - P is the principal amount (the initial sum of money) - r is the interest rate (10% per annum or 0.10) - n is the number of times interest is compounded per time period (we'll assume annually, so n=1) - t is the number of time periods (3 years) We know the compound interest (CI) is rs. 993 after 3 years. To find the principal amount, we first need to find the total amount (A): CI = A - P 993 = A - P Now we apply the compound interest formula: A = P(1 + 0.10)^3 We need to find P in this equation, so let's solve for P in the CI equation: CI + P = A 993 + P = A Since A is equal in both equations, we can equate them and solve for P: P(1 + 0.10)^3 = 993 + P Let's simplify and solve for P: P(1.10)^3 = 993 + P P(1.331) = 993 + P P*1.331 = P + 993 P*1.331 - P = 993 P(1.331 - 1) = 993 P(0.331) = 993 P = 993 / 0.331 P ≈ 3000 (approximately) Now that we have the principal amount (P = rs. 3000), we can find the simple interest using the simple interest formula = (P * r * t). Let's plug in the values: Simple Interest (SI) = (3000 * 0.10 * 3) SI = (3000 * 0.3) SI = 900 So the answer is option d) rs. 900."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since both 143t and -148t are terms with the variable t in them, we can combine them. (143t - 148t) = -5t Step 2: Rewrite the simplified equation. Now our equation is -5t + 25 = 0. Step 3: Isolate the variable. To find the value of t, we need to isolate it by having it on one side of the equation and everything else on the other side. To do this, let's first subtract 25 from both sides: -5t + 25 - 25 = 0 - 25 -5t = -25 Step 4: Solve for t. Now, to isolate t, we need to divide both sides by -5: t = -25 / -5 Step 5: Simplify the answer. When we divide -25 by -5, we get: t = 5 So, the solution for the equation is t = 5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

The customer has highlighted several positive aspects of their experience with the product and their overall satisfaction, while only mentioning one slightly negative aspect related to the shipping process. Below are the key points discussed in the review: 1. Picture quality: The customer mentions that the product has a \\"very nice picture,\\" which shows that they are happy with the visual output of the product. This indicates that the product meets or exceeds their expectations in terms of image quality, which is an essential aspect for most customers. 2. Reasonable price: The reviewer finds the price of the product to be reasonable, suggesting that it offers good value for money. This is an important factor for most buyers, as they want to ensure they are getting a good deal when making a purchase. The affordability aspect further enhances the product's appeal. 3. Easy setup: The customer found that setting up the product was \\"really easy,\\" which is a positive aspect for many users. Products that are easy to set up and use are generally well-received, as they save time and effort. 4. Overall satisfaction: The phrase \\"I'm very happy with this purchase\\" reflects the reviewer's overall satisfaction with the product, despite any minor drawbacks encountered. This statement carries weight, as it represents the user's contentment with their decision to buy the product. 5. Potential for repeat business: The reviewer openly expresses their intention to \\"shop here again,\\" which demonstrates a good level of trust in the seller and the product itself. As a result, it is clear that this positive experience has had a lasting impact on the customer. The minor negative aspect mentioned in the review is related to the shipping: 1. Slow shipping: The reviewer noted that the shipping was slow, considering the proximity between the shipment origin and the destination. This may be a concern for potential buyers who prioritize quick delivery, but it is not directly related to the product's features or performance. In conclusion, the review shines a more flattering light on the product, as the customer emphasizes their satisfaction with the picture quality, the product's price, ease of setup, and overall experience. The only negative aspect relates to the shipping process, which is not a direct reflection of the product itself.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Syriana Movie plot: U.S. energy giant Connex is losing control of key Middle East oil fields in a kingdom ruled by the al-Subaai family. The emirate's foreign minister, Prince Nasir (Alexander Siddig), has granted natural gas drilling rights to a Chinese company, greatly upsetting the U.S. oil industry and government. To compensate for its decreased production capacity, Connex initiates a shady merger with Killen, a smaller oil company that recently won the drilling rights to key petroleum fields in Kazakhstan. Connex-Killen ranks as the world's twenty-third largest economy, and antitrust regulators at the U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) have misgivings. A Washington, D.C.-based law firm headed by Dean Whiting (Christopher Plummer) is hired to smooth the way for the merger. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is assigned to promote the impression of due diligence to the DOJ, deflecting any allegations of corruption. Emir storyline[edit] Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon) is an energy analyst based in Geneva, Switzerland. Woodman's supervisor directs him to attend a private party hosted by the emir at his estate in Marbella, Spain, to offer his company's services. The emir's illness during the party prevents Woodman from speaking directly with him while, at the same time, the emir's younger son, Prince Meshal Al-Subaai (Akbar Kurtha), shows the estate's many rooms and areas to Chinese oil executives via remote-controlled cameras. No one notices that a crack in one of the swimming pool area's underwater lights has electrified the water. Just as Woodman and all the other guests are brought to the pool area, Woodman's son jumps into the pool and is electrocuted. In reparation and out of sympathy for the loss of his son, Prince Nasir, the emir's older son, grants Woodman's company oil interests worth US75 million, and Woodman, though initially insulted by the offer, gradually becomes his economic advisor. Prince Nasir is dedicated to the idea of progressive reform and understands that oil dependency is not sustainable in the long term; Nasir... My question: Who plays Prince Nasir?

One Saturday, Toodles ran over to the pond because he saw ducks swimming there. He ran all around the pond, barking at the ducks. The ducks ignored him, and kept swimming. Toodles wasn't having it! He jumped into the pond and started swimming toward the ducks, chasing around his new playmates. One of the ducks, braver than the others, poked Toodles with his beak - and then bit him right on one of his floppy ears! Toodles barked and ran out of the pond because the duck hurt his ear. Soaking wet, he ran toward where I was eating a sandwich on the grass and curled right up in my lap so I could make him feel better.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Letting the class watch this in English was a bad idea. Films that are serious and more educational can have an effect, but it appears this one didn't have any effect whatsoever on the class - whenever the teacher left, conversations quickly started - and I didn't hear the words \\"Shakespeare\\" or \\"Tempest\\" being used at all. And when you look at this, it is easy to see why. The acting is nothing special - everyone seems bored to bits, just reading from the page without a care in the world. Shakespeare always did prefer expository dialogue to action and death, but I just couldn't understand a word anyone was saying. The costumes aren't too bad and neither are the special effects - the class may not have loved the film, but they weren't exactly taking the p*ss either. But it is hard to joke at a film that is devoid of any sort of inspiration or joy. The scenes on the ship at the start of the film weren't too badly done - though the rain looked a bit unrealistic, everything else was done well and good. But where were the severed heads and exploding masts? Where was the death? Where was the inspiration? The character of Ariel would have been taken a lot more seriously had he been wearing clothes - but as all was on show, he was just another excuse for a joke. This film is not in any way appealing to either sex. The women and girls won't have any romance or comedy to enjoy, and there is an abundance of naked men and lack of action or death that will put most men and boys off.

Eventually, the outer layer of the planet cooled to form a solid crust when water began accumulating in the atmosphere. The Moon formed soon afterwards, possibly as the result of a Mars-sized object with about 10% of the Earth's mass impacting the planet in a glancing blow. Some of this object's mass merged with the Earth, significantly altering its internal composition, and a portion was ejected into space. Some of the material survived to form an orbiting moon.

The 25-year-old has enjoyed a breakthrough season with English Premiership side Leicester, scoring one try in 17 appearances . \\"I've really enjoyed the year and it's been good to get out there and get games week to week,\\" said the Scarlets youth product, who joined Tigers from Rotherham in 2014. \\"My rugby's progressed this year. It's probably the toughest league in the world in terms of competition and every game is tough.\\" Born in Bangor but raised in Pwllheli in north Wales, Roberts has been given his chance this season because of injuries to Tuilagi and Toomua. Roberts has seized his opportunities and has also sought guidance from Tuilagi and Toomua as well as that of Tigers head coach, former New Zealand centre Aaron Mauger. \\"I try and learn as much as I can,\\" Roberts told BBC Wales Sport. \\"I was lucky enough to play with Manu for a few games and I really enjoyed that. \\"I've learnt a lot off him and Matt Toomua is around the training ground and I can pick his brains when I want. \\"If I can learn a little bit off them then I'll be better for it. \\"Then you've got Aaron Mauger, who was a world class centre himself. \\"Mauger has been a massive help for me.

Roberts will return to Wales, having signed for Cardiff Blues. \\"The main driving force behind the move was to play back in Wales,\\" said Roberts, who studied at Cardiff University. \\"When you're playing in Wales you are in the limelight a bit more and I enjoyed living in Cardiff when I was a student. \\"I've not played regional rugby and I'm really looking forward to that. \\"Cardiff Blues are a club who are going in the right direction and it's an exciting place to be at the moment,\\" Roberts said. \\"They're playing some good rugby and have some good young coaches and they're building a really good squad. I'm excited to get started.\\" Roberts will compete with the likes of Rey Lee-Lo, Willis Halaholo, Garyn Smith and Harri Millard for a starting centre spot for the Blues next season. \\"All top clubs, whether it be Leicester or Cardiff, are always going to have strength in depth,\\" Roberts said. \\"It will be tough competition but I don't think it gets much tougher than Leicester having to compete for a place. \\"If you approach it in the right way it can help you become a better player. You can push each other to better things.\\" Roberts has represented Wales at Under-16 level and was also in the Under-18 squad.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose video choreography was liberally adapted from for the video \\"Single Ladies?\\" ? The music video for \\"Single Ladies\\" was shot immediately after that of \\"If I Were a Boy\\", but it received less attention during production than the \\"higher-gloss, higher-profile video\\" for \\"If I Were a Boy\\". Both videos were shot in black-and-white in New York City and were directed by Jake Nava, with whom Beyoncé had worked on previous music videos including \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Beautiful Liar\\". \\"Single Ladies\\" was choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr. and JaQuel Knight, and incorporates J-Setting choreography. The two music videos premiered on MTV's Total Request Live show on October 13, 2008 to reinforce the concept of conflicting personalities. The videos were released to other media outlets on the same date and subsequently included on Beyoncé's remix album with videography, Above and Beyoncé, and the platinum edition of I Am... Sasha Fierce. Beyoncé told Simon Vozick-Levinson of Entertainment Weekly that the inspiration for the video was a 1969 Bob Fosse routine entitled \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" seen on The Ed Sullivan Show, which featured Fosse's wife, Gwen Verdon, dancing with two other women. \\"Mexican Breakfast\\" had become an Internet viral sensation the previous summer after Unk's \\"Walk It Out\\" was dubbed over the original mix.

[The dancers] had a plain background and it was shot on the crane; it was 360 degrees, they could move around. And I said, 'This is genius.' We kept a lot of the Fosse choreography and added the down-south thing—it's called J-Setting, where one person does something and the next person follows. So it was a strange mixture ... It's like the most urban choreography, mixed with Fosse—very modern and very vintage.

The foods you eat will have an effect on how far you are able to run, your energy levels, and the recovery process. Whenever you have a run coming up, try to keep some of these diet tips in mind to help you feel your best and run your hardest: Foods with carbohydrates and protein are good choices. Try eating things like bread, pasta, and rice to get carbohydrates in your diet. Include things like meat, fish, and eggs to get enough protein. Before doing any physical activity, it's a good idea to warm up. Warming up before running can help prevent injury and improve the quality of your run. Keep some of these general tips in mind when warming up before a run. Walk for at least 5 to 10 minutes before a run. Doing some light stretching before a run can help you warm up. It's a good idea to cool down as well. Try walking for around 5 to 10 minutes after a run. Training too often or too much can increase the chances of injury. Although you may enjoy running, taking a break between runs can help keep you safe. Make sure that you are breaking up your running schedule to help keep you running strong. It's recommend that you run every other day. You might try cross-training on days off. For example, on days you don't run you may lift weights. Running requires maintenance. If you take too much time off from running, you will find running more difficult when you come back to it. It's a good idea to make a regular schedule for your runs and stick to it, allowing you to avoid losing your ability to run a mile without stopping. Include rest days in your schedule to allow your body time to recover. It can be fun to continue increasing the distance you run to help keep your routine interesting. Although running can improve your health and fitness, it may also cause injury. Injuries from running most commonly occur when a person pushes themselves too far, trains while injured, or over-trains. If you ever feel any pain during your runs or after, consider taking a break or cutting down on the distance you are running. Make sure to increase distance gradually. Adding too much distance to your runs, without training for it, can cause injury. Make sure your shoes are a good fit and are suitable for running. Don't train while injured. Ask your doctor for other exercises you can do while the affected area heals.","completion":"To optimize your running performance and prevent injury, it is essential to pay attention to your diet, warm-up routine, training schedule, and recovery process.

The president had his share of victories and setbacks amid a backdrop of Twitter storms and, at times, raging rhetoric. Trump's political base seems pleased with his first year in office, touting his efforts to cut Obama-era regulations, install Justice Neil Gorsuch on the Supreme Court, and roll back Islamic State forces in the Middle East. \\"We were kind of thinking we were going to relax and put Trump behind us and just watch all the great promises that he gave us, and watch him make America great again,\\" said Michigan Trump supporter Meshawn Maddock. \\"But what happened immediately is that we felt he was under attack from day one.\\" The president's biggest legislative victory came just last month, a sweeping tax cut bill that had been a Republican priority for years. \\"We are very proud of it,\\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office as he signed it. \\"It is going to be a tremendous thing for the American people. It is going to be fantastic for the economy.\\" In fact, there are plenty of signs of a surging economy, and public opinion polls show growing support for Trump's handling of it and even a bump up in support for the tax bill, which many voters saw initially as too favorable to the wealthy.

As it's applied, mixture may be redolent of vinegar, but the vinegar smell wears off quickly once it's dried. If you don't like the smell of coffee, you may be out of luck on this one, although the tactic really does work. Place six paper plates strategically throughout the car; onto each plate, spoon one cup of roasted coffee, evenly spread out across the entire plate. Keeping the windows down about an eighth of an inch, allow the coffee smell to permeate the car on a warm, sunny day. After a day, remove the coffee beans and enjoy the smell of your latte... er, car! Although not a surefire way of removing bad smoke odors from your car, this method is reputed to work because newspaper is an odor absorbent. Crumple up a good number of old newspaper sheets and place them strategically throughout your cabin. Wait 48 hours for the newspaper to absorb all the smoke smells, and then remove the newspaper and recycle. As much most of the methods detailed in this article, this method can work in combination with other methods. Use this method to increase your chances of removing odors while placing coffee beans in your car, for example, or when coating it with baking soda. You can find activated charcoal at pet supply stores, health food stores, or even bigger department stores. Place a cup or so of activated charcoal, which comes in powder form, in a bowl, and then place that bowl in your car. Wait for a day or two, after which time the charcoal should have worked its magic and absorbed a lot of the smells of smoke from your car. Some animal products have activated charcoal in them, at far less cost. Kitty litter, for example, may contain it. In the end — it might be cheaper — and just as effective to place a bowl of kitty litter in your car rather than buy a huge supply of activated charcoal and only use it once. Activated charcoal is a quite strong natural odor eliminator. If you've tried using baking soda and it's not eliminated the smell of smoke completely, try this method. It should neutralize the odor very well. A cup or so will do the job. Ammonia is very harsh, so be sure not to bunk up in the car while the ammonia is work on eliminating the car's odors. After removing, open the windows and air out the car for an hour or two before using the car. Repeat this every night for a week or two if the odor isn't eliminated after a single use.

The embryo matures in the egg. With time, it will hatch. Some animals hatch and do not need care from their parents. They are ready to live on their own. Other animals will still need the care of their parents. Sea turtles break out of their shells. They immediately walk to the ocean. They do this with no help from an adult. Birds stay in the nest for many weeks. They are cared for by their parents. They leave the nest when they are strong enough to fly. Some animals give birth to live offspring. Animals like horses, cows, and whales give live birth. Their offspring are born looking like mini adults.

Other animals will still need the care of their parents\\" Is this answer correct? Select from: (a). no (b). yes...I think the answer is","completion":"(b). yes The answer is indeed correct. The two kinds of hatching behavior are: 1. Animals that hatch and do not need care from their parents: These animals are often considered precocial, as they are relatively mature and mobile after hatching. They are generally able to start foraging for food on their own right away. An example of this type of hatching behavior is seen in sea turtles, as mentioned in the text. Upon hatching, they immediately make their way to the ocean without any help from adult turtles. 2. Animals that hatch and still need care from their parents: These animals are considered altricial, as they are usually less developed and require parental care for a certain period of time after hatching. This can include activities such as providing food, maintaining the nest, or offering protection. Birds are a prime example of this type of hatching behavior. Once hatched, baby birds (referred to as nestlings or hatchlings) often remain in the nest for several weeks, relying on their parents for sustenance and assistance until they are strong enough to leave the nest and fly independently. In summary, there are two main kinds of hatching behavior observed in animals – those that are independent and do not need care from their parents, and those that require parental care for initial survival and maturation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: James was born on December 30, 1984 in Akron, Ohio to a 16-year-old mother, Gloria Marie James, who raised him on her own. When James was growing up, life was often a struggle for the family, as they moved from apartment to apartment in the seedier neighborhoods of Akron while Gloria struggled to find steady work. Realizing that her son would be better off in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old. As a youth, James played Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball for the Northeast Ohio Shooting Stars. At the conclusion of the 2008-09 season, James finished second in NBA Defensive Player of the Year voting and made his first NBA All-Defensive Team, posting 23 chase-down blocks and a career-high 93 total blocks. He also became only the fourth postmerger player to lead his team in points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks in a single season. Behind his play and the acquisition of All-Star guard Mo Williams, Cleveland went a franchise record 66-16 and fell just one game short of matching the best home record in league history. With final averages of 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds, 7.2 assists, 1.7 steals, and 1.2 blocks per game, James became the first Cavalier to win the MVP Award. Reflecting on James's performance for ESPN, John Hollinger later wrote, \\"He's having what is arguably the greatest individual season in history, and it's time we gave him his due for it.\\" In the playoffs, Cleveland swept the Pistons and the Atlanta Hawks to earn a matchup with the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals. In Game 1 of the series, James scored 49 points on 66 percent shooting in a losing effort for the Cavaliers. In Game 2, he hit a game-winner to tie the series at 1-1. Cleveland would lose the series in six games, and following the loss in Game 6, James immediately left the floor without shaking hands with his opponents, which was an act that many media members viewed as unsportsmanlike. For the series, he averaged 38.5 points, 8.3 rebounds, and 8 assists per game, finishing the postseason with a career playoff-high 35.3 points per game. In February of the 2009-10 season, James was forced into a temporary point guard role following a series of injuries to the Cavaliers' backcourt. Behind his leadership, Cleveland lost no momentum, finishing the year with the best record in the league for the second consecutive season. Due in part to his increased minutes as the Cavaliers' primary ball handler, James increased his statistical production, averaging 29.7 points, 7.3 rebounds, 8.6 assists, 1.6 steals, and 1 block per game on 50 percent shooting en route to another MVP Award. To open the playoffs, Cleveland advanced past the Bulls to earn a matchup with the Celtics in the second round. James was heavily criticized for not playing well in Game 5 of the series, shooting only 20 percent on 14 shots and scoring 15 points. The team suffered its worst loss in franchise history, and at the conclusion of the game, James walked off the court to a smattering of boos from Cleveland's home crowd. The Cavaliers were officially eliminated from the postseason in Game 6, with James posting 27 points, 19 rebounds, 10 assists, and nine turnovers in the losing effort. Did his good performance continue?","completion":"Yes, James had a good performance. He even won another Most Valuable Player (MVP) Award because he played very well. He helped his team have the best record in the league for two years in a row. Even when some of his teammates got hurt, he played as a point guard and did a great job.

My sister was in town last weekend, so I thought to bring her to Sambalatte to check it out. They didn't have iced white mocha on the menu, but they offer to make us some. I'm guessing they only have one size for to-goers.....since they just assumed we want a large right when we ordered. Then one of our friends got some gelato, and a red velvet cupcake. The ice cream scooper yelled \\"one or two scoop\\", automatically the cashier said \\"two\\". I noticed Sambalatte is a more high-end coffee shop and customers that go there wouldn't mind paying a little more for a bigger portion. But without asking their clients what size/portion they prefer seem a little rude, plus what if he/she was on a diet and could only have a small/one scoop ice cream? The iced-white mocha, which I'm so thankful they offer to make us some, were not at all anything to our expectations. The coffee were too light, you can't even smell or taste it. Mostly it was all just milk and some type of sweetener that taste nothing like a white mocha. They definitely got the look down, but my iced white mocha was not as yummy as it looks. Also, the gelato is comparable to any grocery store ice-cream, not that great :/ All in all, now I know for sure I do not like Sambalatte's products. But I do love their book collection upstairs :) Choose: was this review given positively or negatively? OPT: - negative. - positive.","completion":"- negative. The review is negative because the author points out several issues they experienced at Sambalatte, such as not having iced white mocha on the menu, automatically assuming a large size for to-go orders, a lack of inquiry about preferred ice cream portion sizes, and dissatisfaction with the taste and quality of the iced white mocha and gelato. Although they appreciate the book collection upstairs, the overall tone and focus on negative experiences lead to a negative review."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: Who convinces the boss to lay off the man who's favorite mug is missing? is inside the article: Derek Cho, the film's protagonist, tells the audience about the ID-7 virus, or \\"Red Eye\\" virus, that has been spreading throughout the world. It infects neural pathways, removing all inhibition and moral integrity, and in turn, causing people to act out their darkest impulses. While the virus is not lethal, those infected by the virus may find themselves driven to kill. The first known case of murder driven by ID-7 was committed by Nevil Reed, who stabbed a coworker, but was not deemed liable due to the influence of the virus. Derek, a lawyer at Towers and Smythe Consulting, works for the firm that handled Reed's case; he began his job full of optimism, but ended up back-stabbing, cheating, and finding loophole after loophole in order to work his way up the corporate ladder and get a corner office. One morning, Derek goes into work to find that his favorite mug is missing, and meets with a furious client - Melanie Cross - who needs more time on a loan, but thinks he's unable to help her. After discovering that a bungled legal case for massive company Vandacorp has been pinned on him by his superior Cara (called \\"The Siren\\", as she always has the boss's ear), Derek confronts her and finds that she has taken his mug.

Here are possible answers to this question: - fun - discomfort - love - car - inspiration I believe the correct choice is \\"inspiration\\", here's why: A:","completion":"You are correct in choosing \\"inspiration\\" as the most likely answer to the question. Here's why: When James was chatting with friends and eating pizza, he suddenly experienced something that made him urgently run out of the room to get a pen and paper. This reaction suggests that he had a sudden idea or thought that he felt compelled to write down immediately, which is a clear indication of inspiration. Let's analyze the other options and explain why they are less likely: 1. Fun: While James might have been having fun with his friends, it doesn't explain why he would urgently need to run out of the room to get a pen and paper. 2. Discomfort: If James felt discomfort from eating pizza, running out to get a pen and paper wouldn't be the expected reaction. He might have stepped out to find some relief instead. 3. Love: While it's possible that James experienced or talked about love during the conversation, it doesn't provide a clear reason for his action of running out to get a pen and paper, especially in a hurry. Although he might have felt the urge to write a love letter, it's less likely than an immediate need to document inspiration. 4. Car: The presence or discussion of a car doesn't seem relevant to James running out of the room to get a pen and paper.

The evolution of insect wings has been a subject of debate. Some entomologists suggest that the wings are from paranotal lobes, or extensions from the insect's exoskeleton called the nota, called the paranotal theory. Other theories are based on a pleural origin. These theories include suggestions that wings originated from modified gills, spiracular flaps or as from an appendage of the epicoxa. The epicoxal theory suggests the insect wings are modified epicoxal exites, a modified appendage at the base of the legs or coxa. In the Carboniferous age, some of the Meganeura dragonflies had as much as a 50 cm (20 in) wide wingspan. The appearance of gigantic insects has been found to be consistent with high atmospheric oxygen. The respiratory system of insects constrains their size, however the high oxygen in the atmosphere allowed larger sizes.

Please answer the following question: What is the full name of the person who recognises the woman in the painting as the Marchesa Attavanti? Answer the above question based on the context below: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The ongoing war against cybercrime More than 350 million personal records have been at risk because of data privacy breaches since 2005. Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Like most college students, Jake McCoy had to apply for several loans to pay for his education. After a rigorous check of his credit, he secured the loans and has been paying them back since graduating from Baylor University in May 2006. Then, in October 2008, he received a letter from Baylor with bad news: A laptop computer with his account information had either been stolen or misplaced. \\"They told me my information was on it, and that's pretty much it,\\" McCoy said. \\"I assumed that my information was in good hands; it was so hard to get the loans that I figured surely they'd protect it very well.\\" The university set up a credit monitoring service for McCoy, now a first-year medical student at Baylor. The service expired in a year, and McCoy worries that he's still at risk for being on the hook for thousands of dollars that someone using his identity could spend. \\"The biggest concern is always that you don't know what someone is going to do with your financial information,\\" said McCoy. \\"I was really worried that someone out there was going to be ruining my credit and how big of a headache it would be to resolve it.\\" And McCoy is not alone. In March, a portable media device with personal data for more than 3 million people was stolen from Minnesota-based Educational Credit Management Corp. It is believed to be the largest breach of its kind. The thieves who stole the USB drive, like in other cases, may not commit identity thefts themselves, according to Jonathon Giffin, a system and software security researcher at the Georgia Institute of Technology. \\"They may sell the information to others who have the knowledge of making money from those identities,\\" Giffin said. Most credit card companies and banks offer some recourse if a customer becomes the victim of internet fraud. But when personal information is lost because a company is the victim of crime, it is often unclear who is ultimately responsible. There are U.S. laws that hold companies accountable when major breaches occur, and new legislation is being considered. The Personal Data Privacy Act of 2009 would require companies to notify, in writing, anyone affected by a security breach. Under the act, which is still pending a vote in Congress, companies would also be required to notify major media outlets if there are more than 5,000 people affected by a security breach. The company that carried McCoy's loans simply provided him with a basic 15 credit monitoring service that lasted for one year. \\"For me, it's not a one-year ordeal,\\" said McCoy. \\"If I had ruined my credit, it would have taken me forever to get back on track. One year was a nice gesture, but I definitely wish it would have been more than just a year.\\" More than 350 million personal records at hundreds of universities, government agencies and businesses have been at risk because of data privacy breaches since 2005, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit group that publishes reports on cybercrimes. Sometimes, that's a result of simple mistakes, and other times, it's the result of a criminal act. Either way, Giffin says everyone needs to protect their personal identity. \\"We can encourage organizations to try to protect our data using mechanisms such as data encryption, so that if a USB drive or a laptop is stolen, the data is encrypted and cannot be retrieved,\\" he said. \\"But we would be relying on companies to do that for us.\\" Encryption causes a slowdown for companies. System users would have to encrypt and decrypt the data every time they access it, which creates extra work, and companies may not have an incentive to pay for safer data. New legislation could change the way companies look at data safety costs. The Data Accountability and Trust Act, which has been passed by the House and awaits a vote in the Senate, would protect consumers by requiring companies to take reasonable measures to protect data containing personal information. If a security breach occurs, companies would be required to provide nationwide notice. But even if the bill is enacted, it may not be enough. Many laws dealing with internet protection haven't always been able to catch up to evolving cybercrimes. But that doesn't mean there hasn't been any progress in the ongoing battle to protect personal data, according to Adam Palmer, the lead adviser on cybersecurity issues for Norton. \\"There are some very good, tough laws right now on both the state and federal level, and there's a lot of legislation in the pipeline to try to address some of these crimes,\\" said Palmer, a former cyber-crime prosecutor. But new challenges exist for fighting crime in a virtual world. Palmer says cybercriminals often use sophisticated technology to launch attacks. You can't go to a crime scene and take pictures ... that makes it very difficult for prosecutors.--Adam Palmer, cybercrime expert \\"You can't go to a crime scene and take pictures and interview witnesses, so it's in some ways a very old crime that still relates to stealing money, stealing people's identities,\\" he said. \\"It's done with such complexities, that makes it very difficult for prosecutors.\\" Giffin says there has been a significant shift in cybercrime over the last decade, including new techniques such as \\"botnets,\\" which are computers that can transmit viruses to other computers without the knowledge of the owner. Although cybercriminals continue to develop new methods of attack, there are no new ways for users to protect themselves other than what experts have advised for years: • Maintain good security practices • Exercise greater awareness of how your information could be used • Tell your financial institutions to track your accounts • Report any cybercrimes to law enforcement But even in doing so, consumers -- like McCoy -- still face a potential risk when their personal information is in the hands of others. McCoy says he is more careful with his information, and he hopes that businesses take more precautions with their customers' personal data. \\"It still put that doubt in my mind about how easy it could be for businesses that I trust to lose my information or have it stolen,\\" McCoy said. \\"I don't know why they were carrying around information on a laptop. I feel like they should be a little more protective with information than that.\\" What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the ongoing battle against cybercrime and how it affects people's personal information.

Let's analyze both sentences in detail: Sentence 1: The object Annette had thrust into his hand was a small penknife, the blade open. In this sentence, we learn that Annette has given a small penknife with its blade open to someone (presumably a male character). However, the sentence does not state any information about the ownership of the penknife. The penknife could belong to Annette, the recipient, or someone else altogether. Sentence 2: The penknife didn't belong to Annette or him. In this sentence, it's explicitly mentioned that the penknife does not belong to either Annette or the recipient. This statement establishes the ownership, which was not provided or implied in the first sentence. To summarize, the first sentence does not provide information about the ownership of the penknife, making the claims of the second sentence not entailed by the first. An entailment relationship exists between two sentences when the truth of one sentence guarantees or requires the truth of the other, such that it would be logically contradictory for one sentence to be true and the other false.

To join the bow together, you need something that can secure the center part and keep the loops in place. A staple is perfect for this job because it can go through the layers of paper and hold them tightly together. The other option, using a rubber band, is not suitable because it might not hold the paper bow tightly enough, and the bow could fall apart.

Secret Service director Scott Langral, on advice from the President, has Snow convicted of murder and espionage. Snow is sentenced to thirty years on the maximum security space penitentiary MS One, where prisoners are kept in stasis for the length of their sentence. Snow's friend and fellow agent Harry Shaw tries to locate Snow's contact Mace, who knows where Frank's briefcase containing the stolen secrets is hidden. Meanwhile, the President's daughter Emilie arrives on MS One to investigate claims that keeping prisoners in stasis can cause them to develop mental instability. The warden allows her to interview Hydell, a deranged prisoner. He manages to escape and releases all of the prisoners, starting a riot led by his brother Alex. Emilie is shot, and is captured along with others. Shaw convinces Langral and the President to send Snow to rescue Emilie, rather than risk her life in a siege. Snow is initially reluctant to go, but agrees after Shaw tells him that Mace is on MS One and could help Snow prove his innocence. Langral initially attempts to trick Alex into releasing Emilie, but it goes bad and Snow is forced to infiltrate MS One. Alex realizes that Emilie is the President's daughter and secures her, but she escapes with her bodyguard Hock and they hide in a secure room. A problem with the oxygen supply brings Hock to sacrifice his life by suicide in order to stop himself from using up oxygen so as to buy Emilie more time. Snow breaks into the secure room and rescues Emilie. Snow changes Emilie's hair to conceal her gender, allowing them to walk through the prison population without being noticed.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Peale was born in 1741 in Chester, Queen Anne's County, Maryland, the son of Charles Peale and his wife Margaret. He had a younger brother, James Peale (1749-1831). Charles became an apprentice to a saddle maker when he was thirteen years old. Upon reaching maturity, he opened his own saddle shop; however, when his Loyalist creditors discovered he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. In 1762, Peale married Rachel Brewer (1744-1790), who bore him ten children, most named for Peale's favorite artists, male and female. The sons included Raphaelle Peale (1774-1825), Rembrandt Peale (1778-1860), who was another famous portrait painter and museum owner/operator in Baltimore, and scientific inventor and businessman, Titian Peale I (1780-1798), and Rubens Peale (1784-1865). Among the daughters: Angelica Kauffman Peale (named for Angelica Kauffman, Peale's favorite female painter) married Alexander Robinson, her daughter Priscilla Peale wed Dr. Henry Boteler, and Sophonisba Angusciola Peale (named for Sofonisba Anguissola) married Coleman Sellers. After Rachel's death in 1790, Peale married Elizabeth de Peyster (d. 1804) the next year. With his second wife, he had six additional children. One son, Franklin Peale, born on October 15, 1795, became the Chief Coiner at the Philadelphia Mint. Their youngest son, Titian Ramsay Peale (1799-1885), became an important naturalist and pioneer in photography. Their daughter, Elizabeth De Peyster Peale (1802-57), married William Augustus Patterson (1792-1833) in 1820. Hannah More, a Quaker from Philadelphia, married Peale in 1804, becoming his third wife. She helped raise the younger children from his previous two marriages. Peale's slave, Moses Williams, was also trained in the arts while growing up in the Peale household and later became a professional silhouette artist. In 1810, Peale purchased a farm in Germantown where he intended to retire. He named this estate 'Belfield', and cultivated extensive gardens there. After Hannah's death in 1821, Peale lived with his son Rubens and sold Belfield in 1826. Peale died on February 22, 1827, and was buried at the Saint Peter's Episcopal Church in Philadelphia.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"In this article, there are several interesting aspects worth highlighting. One is the naming tradition in Peale's family, where he named his children after his favorite artists, such as Raphaelle Peale, Rembrandt Peale, Titian Peale I, and Rubens Peale. This demonstrates the profound impact that art and painters had on Peale's life and how he wanted to pass that legacy onto his children. Another interesting aspect is how Peale's life was filled with personal and professional challenges. The article mentions that when his Loyalist creditors found out he had joined the Sons of Liberty, they conspired to bankrupt his business. Despite these challenges, Peale went on to achieve great success in his artistic career. The article also highlights Peale's deep connection to Philadelphia, where he spent the majority of his life. Not only did he live, work, and raise his family in the area, but he also purchased a farm in Germantown and named it 'Belfield,' where he cultivated extensive gardens. In his later years, Peale continued to reside with his family until his death in 1827. Finally, the mention of Peale's slave, Moses Williams, who was trained in the arts and became a professional silhouette artist, indicates the influence Peale had on other people's lives and careers. It also serves as a reminder of the different societal norms and practices during that time in American history."},{"prompt":"Q: What is the microtubule-organizing center found near the nuclei of animal cells?

This House believes in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, a two-state solution is better justified than a one-state solution What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"To construct an argument in favor of a two-state solution being better justified than a one-state solution in the conflict between Israel and Palestine, one could follow these steps: Step 1: Establish the context and goal The Israel-Palestine conflict has persisted for decades, with both sides laying claim to the same territories. A peaceful resolution is both morally and practically necessary. The main goal of this argument is to demonstrate that the two-state solution is more justified than a one-state solution. Step 2: Define the terms A two-state solution would create separate, sovereign nations for both Israelis and Palestinians, living side by side in peace. A one-state solution would merge both populations into a single, binational state. Step 3: Highlight the main issues Three critical issues are often raised in this debate: the rights of both parties to self-determination, achieving a territorial compromise, and guaranteeing the security of both populations. Step 4: Address the issues from the perspective of a two-state solution 1. Self-determination: A two-state solution respects the right of self-determination for both Israelis and Palestinians. It acknowledges their distinct national identities and allows them to govern themselves independently, promoting peaceful coexistence and reducing tensions between the two groups. 2. Territorial compromise: A two-state solution would require both sides to make territorial compromises, such as re-drawing existing borders to create a viable Palestinian state. By doing so, both parties can reach a compromise that satisfies their respective national aspirations, making it more likely to be accepted by both populations. 3. Security: Separate states would provide better security guarantees to both Israelis and Palestinians. Israel could maintain its defense capabilities within its borders, safeguarding its population against external threats, while a sovereign Palestinian state could work with the international community on security issues, ensuring that its interests are protected. Step 5: Counter-argue any potential benefits of a one-state solution Critics of a two-state solution often argue that a one-state solution would be more democratic and fair, eliminating the barrier between Israelis and Palestinians. However, given the vast differences in culture, religion, and national identity, a one-state solution could exacerbate tensions and lead to more conflict. The two-state solution respects these differences by allowing each group to govern themselves, leading to better chances for peaceful relations. Step 6: Conclude the argument In conclusion, a two-state solution provides a more justified approach to resolving the Israel-Palestine conflict. By respecting the rights of self-determination, enabling territorial compromises, and ensuring security for both populations, it lays the groundwork for a more peaceful and stable future for Israelis and Palestinians. While a one-state solution may seem ideal in theory, its implementation could potentially worsen the situation rather than promote harmony between the two groups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve -1389*y + 320 + 14959 = 0 for y.","completion":"To solve the equation -1389*y + 320 + 14959 = 0 for y, follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the constant terms. 320 + 14959 = 15279 Now the equation looks like: -1389*y + 15279 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term containing the variable (y). To do this, subtract 15279 from both sides of the equation: -1389*y + 15279 - 15279 = 0 - 15279 This simplifies to: -1389*y = -15279 Step 3: Solve for y. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient in front of y, which is -1389: (-1389*y) / -1389 = -15279 / -1389 This simplifies to: y = 11 So, y = 11 is the solution to the equation -1389*y + 320 + 14959 = 0."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who said they used to be cruel to women? Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn.

His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Talking through your worries and insecurities with someone can be more helpful than you think. If you think you have a real problem with clinginess, it might be best to talk it through with a professional counsellor. Your school may have one that is there for exactly this purpose, and you can talk to them about anything that's worrying you. It can be helpful to talk with a professional because they can be more objective than friends or family sometimes. If you can't or don't want to talk with a counsellor, consider talking with a parent or a trusted adult. Talk to them about how you're feeling and what's going on in your life. Tell them that you are worried you are being too clingy with friends, but you're not sure what to do about it. They have probably been there before and can offer advice about how to handle it. Try to remember that friends are not all there is to life even if they do play a big and important part in it. Remember that you have responsibilities at home and at school or work. Make sure that you are taking care of all of those things instead of neglecting them to always be around your friends. The same goes for your family. Besides your friends, you have a family that cares about you. Spend time nurturing your relationships with your siblings, parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles. These are the people that will be there for you no matter what. Spending time with family can be a great way to start feeling more secure. In most cases, your family knows you better than anyone else and accepts you all the same. If you have secure relationships with your family members, you can learn how to act that way with friends, too. In addition to making sure that you are taking care of your responsibilities and family, find things that you enjoy doing alone. It is good to learn to just be with yourself and feel comfortable with it. If you already have a hobby that you enjoy, then great. If you don't, try out a few things you've been curious about and see what grabs your attention. Many hobbies have their way of making you more confident in yourself. For example, they may teach you a cool skill. Although there are many indirect ways of building confidence in yourself, you can also take steps to work on your self-confidence more directly. In order to build self-confidence, you will need to become aware of the bad things you are thinking about yourself. Any time you catch yourself getting mad at yourself or thinking something negative about yourself, try to become aware of it, and remind yourself that you aren't going to think that way anymore. This also means that you need to give yourself credit when you do something good. If you say something funny that makes people laugh or you do a good deed, let yourself feel proud.","completion":"The article focuses on the importance of addressing clinginess and offers various methods to overcome it, such as discussing the issue with a professional counselor or a trusted adult, fulfilling responsibilities at home and work, nurturing relationships with family members, engaging in hobbies and developing self-confidence through positive self-awareness and giving oneself credit for accomplishments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. Pick from: -no. -yes.","completion":"Yes, the two questions are essentially asking the same thing, with both focusing on the possibility of an individual increasing their height after 20 years of age. The potential for height increase after 20 years of age is a topic that has intrigued many adults, particularly those who desire to grow taller for various reasons. While there have been claims and isolated cases of people growing taller after their teenage years and even into their 20s, it is important to understand the factors influencing height and the likelihood of natural height increase in adults. Height is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Genetics play a significant role, with genes inherited from both parents contributing to an individual's ultimate height. Environmental factors, such as a healthy diet and sufficient exercise, are also important during childhood and adolescence, as they can impact bone growth and overall development. Human height is primarily the result of long bone growth which occurs at the ends of bones, specifically in areas known as growth plates. These plates contain layers of cartilage that multiply and add length to bones as the body grows. During adolescence, hormonal changes, particularly the increase in growth hormone secretion, catalyze significant bone growth, resulting in height increase. As individuals reach adulthood, usually by the age of 18-20, their growth plates close and are replaced with bone, thereby stopping further bone elongation. At this specific point, which may vary from person to person, height increase is typically no longer a natural occurrence. In extremely rare cases, some people might experience some further growth due to late bone growth plate closure or other hormonal conditions, but this is not the norm. While it is unlikely to naturally increase height after 20 years of age, there are steps that you can take to create the illusion of height or maintain your current stature. Here are a few suggestions: 1. Posture: Improving your posture by standing up straight and tall, pulling your shoulders back, and keeping your head high can have a significant impact on your perceived height. 2. Exercise: Regular exercise, especially stretching exercises such as yoga and Pilates, can help improve posture and muscle tone, which may give an illusion of slightly increased height. 3. Clothing choices: Wearing clothing with vertical lines or choosing outfits with similar colors from head to toe can create an elongating effect. Additionally, wearing shoes with a slightly raised heel can add some height. 4. Weight management: Maintaining a healthy weight can contribute to a better overall appearance and posture, which may enhance the perception of your height. Even though it's unlikely to gain height naturally after 20 years of age, focusing on these tips and being content with your current height can help boost your confidence and make a positive impact on your overall well-being. Always remember, height is just one aspect of your physical appearance, and your unique qualities and talents contribute to your overall persona."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder.

I tried not to hold a grudge on the line to get in, but holy hell. It was all enough to discourage me from coming back. If this was the first Taco Festival, I'd be more understanding.

The Carnegie Foundation was established by Andrew Carnegie to manage the donation made for the construction, management, and maintenance of the Peace Palace. However, there isn't any explicit mention of the involvement of any of his relatives in the foundation or its activities. The Carnegie Foundation (Carnegie Stichting) is an organization that carries out its responsibilities as outlined by its founder, Andrew Carnegie, who provided the financial resources and mandate for its work. As an institution distinct from the Carnegie family, it operates independently and is not necessarily managed or maintained by any relative of Andrew Carnegie, let alone a distant one. The Peace Palace was constructed in The Hague, Netherlands, to house the Permanent Court of Arbitration, a library of international law, and other affiliated organizations. Its management and maintenance have been entrusted to the Carnegie Foundation since its founding in 1903. This arrangement reflects the vision and commitment of Andrew Carnegie to promote world peace and cultivate knowledge of international law. Rather than being overseen by a distant relative of Carnegie, the Carnegie Foundation has a board of directors that oversees its activities, and a separate management team responsible for the daily operations of the Peace Palace. The board and management are made up of individuals with expertise in various fields, such as international law, diplomacy, and property management. They may or may not have any familial connection to Andrew Carnegie. In conclusion, while Andrew Carnegie's contribution to the establishment of the Carnegie Foundation and the Peace Palace is undeniable, there is no evidence to suggest that the organization or the Peace Palace's maintenance is run by a distant relative of his.

News article: Album Review: 'Amok' by Atoms for Peace This post is in partnership with Consequence of Sound, an online music publication devoted to the ever growing and always thriving worldwide music scene. A lone rat scurries about on a floating piece of driftwood. A melting palm tree slumps towards its inevitable fall near Crossroads of the World. A passenger’s struggling hands materialize on the backseat window of a sinking wagon. A lost traveler clutches the bow of his dinghy, while an ominous hooded seaman navigates at ease nearby. Not too far away, a man clutches a winded telephone pole, no doubt screaming for help towards the erratic soldier a street over, who stands guard above the apocalyptic wasteland that is Los Angeles. Not even Disneyland makes it out alive in Stanley Donwood’s gloomy artwork for AMOK, presented in full at the album’s terrifying official site. Similarly, loneliness floods the debut album for Thom Yorke’s star-studded side project, Atoms For Peace. Despite being surrounded by some of the industry’s top-level talent – Radiohead producer Nigel Godrich, Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea, all-star session drummer Joey Waronker, and Brazilian percussionist Mauro Refosco — AMOK comes off as an email attachment from the deep, dark abyss that is Yorke’s mind. Words like “processed” or “mechanical” spur to mind, which isn’t exactly surprising given the songwriter’s hints to Rolling Stone last fall: ”One of the things we were most excited about was ending up with a record where you weren’t quite sure where the human starts and the machine ends.” (MORE: The Harlem Shake Is Dead; Long Live the Harlem Shake) Disappointing isn’t the right word to describe the end result, but it’s close. With the release of 2006′s The Eraser, Yorke didn’t have to deal with any adrenalized expectations, simply because he didn’t tout unique collaborations as he does withAMOK. Flea was still busy carving out his double-album Stadium Arcadium, Waronker was flirting with Hollywood scores, and Refosco was putting together his outfit, Forro in the Dark. Now, with a full band and not just a laptop of possibilities, Yorke sets the bar high for a team effort that could be unique and maybe even intimidating — instead, it’s what one would have expected in the summer of 2006. Something was lost in the two years of tinkering between Yorke and Godrich. As the producer explained in the aforementioned interview, many of the beats and riffs behind AMOK’s nine tracks date back to 2010, when the outfit spent three days together in Los Angeles to snapshot the energy they exhibited on their critically acclaimed, short-lived tour. Yorke spoke highly of this time, stating: “We got wasted, played pool, and listened to Fela Kuti all night. It was that idea of trance-ing out. But there are still songs here.” He’s not wrong; there are plenty of songs on AMOK. Album opener “Before Your Very Eyes…” caresses with sticky, glazed distortion and hand-chaffed claps; lead single “Default” haunts with spookhouse bass and dizzying beats, agreeably cribbed from 2003′s Hail to the Thief; “Dropped” torments over digital sparks and schizophrenic melodies; “Stuck Together Pieces” drills down found sounds and Yorke’s strongest vocal hooks; and “Judge Jury and Executioner” nibbles by with organic guitar work that sips from caffeine beats. These are the areas where the album squeezes the fruits of their labors, sounding less claustrophobic and more expansive. (MORE: David Bowie and Tilda Swinton Make Sweet Music (Video) Together) Yet much like Radiohead’s polarizing 2011 album, The King of Limbs, the many devils are in the very, very small details. Ignore Yorke’s wallowing vocals on “Unless” and, instead, zero in on the John Carpenter-inspired drone hook that stalks the background no different from Halloween‘s The Shape. On “Ingenue,” focus on the bass as Flea cranes his fingers, all behind Godrich’s showering arrangements, which later dazzle on “Reverse Running” — especially in the rapturous closing 50 seconds that outsmart the closing title track. Hear it? Yorke’s crew is there, but in parts, and that’s the real snub to AMOK. Only does “Stuck Together Pieces” mirror those wild, Fela Kuti-soundtracked nights Yorke discussed (which is why it’s the album’s strongest track), and that’s pretty unfortunate given they had eight other opportunities to bottle that collaborative lightning. It all goes back to the seclusive pathos Yorke and Godrich injected alone together over those two years on their laptops. Godrich summarized it as “a backward idea – and a step into the unknown.” It was a step in the wrong direction. By meddling with the organic nature of those days and nights together as an actual band, Godrich and Yorke wound up with another take on The Eraser. These songs don’t say anything about Atoms For Peace that Yorke’s solo album didn’t already say about himself. Far from capturing their kinetic live energy, AMOK feels as isolated, distraught, and feeble as the characters littered about in Donwood’s tragic portrait. Though, perhaps that’s always been Yorke’s intention; after all, he says it best in the album’s closing lines: “I’m trying to be a thought killer.” Next time around, Thom, step away from the knife and let it live. Essential Tracks: “Stuck Together Pieces”, “Judge Jury and Executioner”, and “Dropped” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is a review of the album 'Amok' by Atoms for Peace. The author talks about the artwork and the loneliness depicted in the album. They mention that the album has some good songs, but overall, the collaboration of the band members does not shine through, and it feels more like a solo project of Thom Yorke rather than a group effort. The important parts are the description of the album's theme, some standout tracks, and the general feeling that the album could have showcased the band's talents better."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bank boss failed lie detector questions on heist plot: cops A Connecticut bank executive who told police he was taken hostage at his home and forced to wear a purported bomb to his chest last month has since failed a portion of a lie detector test, a search warrant has revealed. A polygraph test given to Matthew Yussman found that the 46-year-old failed questions specific to his involvement with the alleged Feb. 23 attack that began at his Bristol home, the Bristol Press reported. \\"The results of that test indicated that Yussman showed deception on the relevant test question, 'Are you lying about your involvement in the home invasion,'\\" the warrant stated. The chief financial officer for Achieve Financial chose to not finish the test a short time later, New Britain Police Chief James Wardwell told the paper. \\"He did talk to us for a short time after, but then he made the decision to end the interview,\\" he said. The test was one of several details revealed in the warrant issued for a Feb. 28 search of his home after Yussman claimed that he was ambushed by two men in his garage around 12:30 a.m. on Feb. 23. He was returning home from a hockey game when he said he was overtaken by the yet-to-be identified suspects who were cloaked in ski masks and goggles. His mother, who lived with him, told police that she too was taken hostage when she went to check up on him in the garage. That woman, Valerie Yussman, described finding her son lying facedown on the floor with his hands zip-tied behind his back. She was allegedly next forced into her bedroom where she was duct-taped and tied to a bed. Her hands were kept free, however, and the criminals left her with cookies, lunch meat and juice, she said. When describing the suspects, Valerie Yussman said they were \\"well-spoken and polite.\\" Yussman, meanwhile, stayed with both captors who discussed how he'd enter the bank later that morning and leave with 4.2 million. Around 3:30 a.m. the three left the home in Yussman's vehicle for about half an hour. The CFO said he was blindfolded in the back and didn't know where they went. When they returned he allegedly checked on his mother at some point. She said that it didn't appear that his hands were tied up. Around 8:24 a.m. the bank's president called 911, reporting that he had received a call from Yussman informing him of his captors' demands. When officers arrived at the credit union minutes later they found him seated inside a car with what appeared to be a bomb strapped to his chest. The object was deemed safe and removed from him. A claimed bomb placed under Yussman's mother's bed was also found to be a fake. Calls for comment from Yussman, Achieve Financial and the Bristol Police Department were not immediately returned to the Daily News Friday. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a Connecticut bank executive named Matthew Yussman, who reported to the police that he was taken hostage at his home and forced to wear a purported bomb to his chest on February 23rd.

However, a polygraph test revealed that Yussman failed questions specific to his involvement with the attack, indicating deception on his part. The warrant issued for a search of his home on February 28 revealed further details of the incident. Yussman's mother, Valerie, who lived with him, also claimed that she was taken hostage and was duct-taped and tied to her bed.

Answer:","completion":"Philip K. Dick's short story \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale,\\" published in 1966, served as the inspiration for the 1990 science fiction action film called \\"Total Recall,\\" starring Arnold Schwarzenegger in the leading role. Directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Ronald Shusett, Dan O'Bannon, and Gary Goldman, the film adaptation takes the fundamental concept from Dick's story and expands upon it, adding more action-packed sequences, memorable characters, and futuristic settings, turning it into a visually spectacular and highly entertaining cinematic experience. In \\"Total Recall,\\" Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker who is plagued by vivid and recurring dreams about the planet Mars. Intrigued by these mysterious dreams, Quaid decides to visit a memory implant center called Rekall Inc., where they provide clients with virtual vacations by implanting desired memories directly into their minds. Quaid opts for a package that turns him into a secret agent on a mission to Mars. However, during the memory implantation process, something goes awry, and Quaid becomes convinced that he is, in fact, a real secret agent with an important mission to uncover. As the story unfolds, Quaid begins to question the nature of his reality, and he embarks on a thrilling journey to Mars, encountering various adversaries and allies along the way, played by an impressive supporting cast that includes Sharon Stone, Rachel Ticotin, Michael Ironside, and Ronny Cox. The movie's plot is full of twists and turns that leave both the protagonist and the viewers uncertain about the true nature of Quaid's dreams, origins, and mission. \\"Total Recall\\" was a box office success, and it also received critical acclaim for its groundbreaking special effects and dynamic visual storytelling. The film was nominated for and won several awards, including an Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, further cementing its status as a prominent example of the science-fiction genre and as a significant part of Philip K. Dick's continued legacy in popular culture. The vast and imaginative universe created in \\"Total Recall\\" has continued to spark interest in fans of science fiction, and it even resulted in a less successful remake of the film in 2012, starring Colin Farrell in the leading role. However, the 1990 version remains the most iconic adaptation of Dick's short story, capturing the author's distinctive style of weaving together thought-provoking concepts and gripping stories that explore the enigmatic boundaries between perception, memory, and reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The story begins with the Japanese army's defeat of the China forces occupying Hong Kong on 25 December 1941. Nicholas is an eleven-year-old boy whose parents have both suddenly disappeared in the chaos of war breaking out. As the Japanese come to do a home to home search, three loyal family servants, Tang, his wife Ah Mee, and the gardener Ah Kwan take Nicholas and they escape to Kowloon as Hong Kong Island is no longer safe. Upon reaching the shore of Kowloon, Tang and Ah Mee disguise Nicholas as a Chinese boy and the trip continues to Tang's home village, the village of Sek Wan. Nicholas passes the years of the war here with Tang and his family. He is given the Chinese name Wing Ming. During this time, many events happen. Nicholas makes a dangerous journey back to Kowloon to get quinine cure to the malaria Tang has contracted. He also helps the Communist partisan army – The East River Column Fighters- to translate instructions for using heavy explosives. Nicholas joins the partisan army on a mission to Kowloon where they blow up a railway bridge and weaken the position of the Japanese army. Yet his most dangerous job would have been to deliver a medicine into the prison of war camps (POW camps). Taking news or items to prison camps is nicknamed \\"playing music on the bamboo radio\\".

Q:Question: \\"What has been done to cause the thing that caused specific alterations?\\" Context: \\"The core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt have been folded and fractured in such a manner that erosion created the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the Swiss Alps that rise seemingly straight out of the foreland areas. Peaks such as Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and Hohe Tauern consist of layers of rock from the various orogenies including exposures of basement rock.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Several geological processes have caused the specific alterations in the core regions of the Alpine orogenic belt that led to the formation of steep vertical peaks like Mont Blanc, the Matterhorn, and high peaks in the Pennine Alps, the Briançonnais, and Hohe Tauern. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the events: 1. Formation of the Alpine orogenic belt: The Alpine orogenic belt was formed by the convergence of the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, resulting in the uplift of the sedimentary rocks and creating the mountain ranges. 2. Folding and fracturing: The immense tectonic forces involved in this convergence caused the rocks to fold and fracture. Folding occurs when rock layers are bent and deformed under pressure, while fracturing is the breaking of rocks due to stress. 3. Exposure to various orogenies: Throughout geologic history, the region experienced multiple orogenies, or mountain-building events. Each of these events added new layers of rock and contributed to the complexity of the Alpine geological structure. 4. Erosion: Over time, natural processes such as wind, water, and ice erosion wore down the folded and fractured rocks. Erosion acted differently across various types of rocks, with softer rocks eroding more quickly than harder ones. 5. Formation of steep vertical peaks: The differential erosion of rock layers exposed the stronger basement rocks, which were more resistant to erosion. This process, combined with the pre-existing folding and fracturing, led to the formation of the characteristic steep vertical peaks of the Swiss Alps. In summary, the specific alterations that resulted in the formation of the Swiss Alps' steep vertical peaks are a combination of tectonic forces, folding, fracturing, multiple orogenies, and differential erosion. These processes all contributed to the complex geology and unique landscape of the Alpine region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And I was wondering How would you describe Alex?

Earlier, he may have battled problems head-on, closely examining details, and exploring potential solutions. The fact that he is now tired of worrying about these things implies that he has expended a significant amount of mental and emotional energy trying to manage his troubles. This newfound reliance on \\"fate\\" indicates a degree of surrender. It may signal Alex's acceptance of the inevitability of certain occurrences. A belief in fate suggests that he may be transitioning towards a more passive way of dealing with issues, banking on destiny to craft his path instead of him actively steering his direction. This could be because he is exhausted, overwhelmed, or merely philosophically transformed. However, deeming fate responsible for everything also reveals Alex as someone who is potentially resilient. By surrendering some control to fate, Alex is enabling himself to withstand potential negative outcomes better, attributing them to inevitable destinies rather than personal failures. Alex also seems to have a thoughtful and introspective nature. Stressing about problems before deciding to leave it to fate reveals a contemplative personality. It's clear that he takes things to heart and thinks deeply about them, possibly looking to extract lessons from these experiences. Additionally, the fact that he's considered tired of worrying suggests that Alex is a deeply emotional individual. The weight and breadth of his problems have elicited a sense of mental exhaustion in him, evidence of his capacity to experience profound emotional highs and lows. Moreover, his shift towards fatalism could indicate a growing desire for peace and calm. Given how taxing worrying can be, deciding to let fate decide is a clear manifestation of his wish to lead a less stress-ridden life. However, one cannot rule out the possibility that Alex could be escaping from his responsibilities. Leaving everything to fate might be an easy way out from confronting the actual problems and working on their solutions. It could be seen as a shielding mechanism to justify failures or mishaps that might occur in his life path. In summary, Alex represents a thoughtful, deeply emotional, and potentially resilient individual treading the path of self-discovery and acceptance, all while battling with life's many complexities. His attribution to fate reflects an amalgamation of exhaustion, introspection, and perhaps, a considerable need for peace. Whether this standpoint marks escapism or wisdom is entirely subjective and depends on other aspects of his personality and circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The filmmakers have taken a bet that an unsexy, unpretty and unconventional movie about bank robbery and gambling can be as captivating as its flashier mainstream counterparts, and they've won. 3. As channeled by the extraordinary Hoffman, Dan Mahowny is less a freak than a nerve-deadened Everyman with the courage to search for something that makes him feel alive. 4. There could have been life in the material, but no one involved save [John] Hurt and [Chris} Collins seems to have taken the time to find it. 5. An odd little acting exercise for Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Hurt, two of the best actors of their respective generations. 6. Effectively shows the way gambling can narrow the lens through which gamblers see the world, creating a view that's absurdly myopic. 7. Collapses into a public service announcement on gambling. 8. It's just one of many Hoffman portraits that are painfully real and brilliantly textured. 9. Add another movie to the list of those in which Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a pasty, schlubby, mouth-breathing loser in a suit so cheap it shines -- and put it at or near the top. 10. Hoffman's soft-spoken, ultra-low-key demeanor is a perfect fit for Mahowny. What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"The overall consensus about the movie appears to be a mix of positive and negative reviews. Many of the reviewers praise the performances of the lead actors, particularly Philip Seymour Hoffman and John Hurt, highlighting their extraordinary acting skills, believability, and Hoffman's perfect fit for the character of Dan Mahowny. The movie is also commended for its unconventional and unglamorous approach to bank robbery and gambling, which sets itself apart from mainstream counterparts. Furthermore, it effectively demonstrates the myopic and addictive nature of gambling, as well as the genuine search for something that makes the main character feel alive. On the other hand, some reviewers criticize the film for not fully exploring the potential depth of the material, with one even stating that it collapses into a public service announcement on gambling. Additionally, a few reviews mention that the movie is an odd acting exercise, implying a limited focus on story development or cinematic style. In summary, the overall consensus about the movie is mixed but leans towards the positive side, primarily due to the exceptional acting performances and the film's unconventional approach to its subject matter.

Article:","completion":"Title: Advertising Watchdog Clears Teacher Recruitment Advert Amidst Complaints Introduction: A recent teacher recruitment advert that led to 140 complaints has been cleared by the advertising watchdog, stating that the ad did not overstate teachers' pay. The decision comes as a relief to the campaign, dispelling doubts and controversy surrounding the advertisement. Body: The advert, geared towards enticing young professionals to consider a career in teaching, came under fire after viewers took issue with the purported pay scale, deeming it misleading. Those who were dissatisfied with the figures raised a total of 140 complaints, leading the advertising watchdog to step in and investigate the matter. Upon thorough examination, the advertising regulator found that the advert did not overstate or exaggerate teachers' pay. Instead, the figures presented within the campaign aligned with actual pay scales, based on years of experience and location. By validating the claims made in the advert, the watchdog has effectively silenced concerns over the legitimacy of the campaign. Such recruitment campaigns play a critical role in attracting new talent to the teaching profession. With growing concerns over education and the need for qualified teachers in various fields, it is imperative that potential candidates receive accurate information regarding the benefits and perks of the job, including pay. This incident highlights the importance of transparency in advertising, especially when dealing with professional careers that impact society. The advertising watchdog's decision to look into this matter not only solidifies their role in keeping advertisements honest, but also ensures that potential candidates are presented with factual information. While the advert has now been cleared, those behind the campaign must tread carefully moving forward, ensuring that all future promotions abide by the rules and regulations set by the advertising watchdog. The outcome of this investigation serves as a reminder that accuracy and fact-checking should remain a priority in all advertising efforts, particularly when it comes to recruiting for important roles like teaching. Conclusion: The advertising watchdog's decision to clear the teacher recruitment advert of any wrongdoing stands as a testament to the relevance and necessity of their work.

Step 4: Analyze the information found After reviewing the information, I can confirm that the Summer Olympics are indeed held every four years. The most recent Summer Olympics were held in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Step 5: Determine the next occurrence Since the Summer Olympics occur every four years and the last one happened in 2016, I can calculate the next one by adding four years to 2016. 2016 + 4 = 2020 Step 6: Check for any changes or updates Normally, the next Summer Olympics should have taken place in 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020 Summer Olympics were postponed to 2021. These Olympics took place in Tokyo, Japan from July 23 to August 8, 2021. Step 7: Calculate the following Summer Olympics Because the Tokyo Olympics took place in 2021, it is uncertain whether the next Summer Olympics will follow the original four-year schedule or adjust due to the pandemic. Assuming the International Olympic Committee (IOC) returns to the usual schedule, the next Summer Olympics should be held in 2024. Answer: The Summer Olympics are typically held every four years.

What is the final step of the following process: - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone Answer:","completion":"The final step of the mentioned process can be seen as the beginning of the regrowth and recovery phase for the affected ecosystem. After the forest fire, the landscape may appear barren and lifeless, but over time, the ecosystem gradually starts to rebuild itself. This occurs through several interrelated processes: 1. Nutrient replenishment: As the ashes from the burnt trees and plants settle, they release essential nutrients back into the soil. This process enriches the soil and provides a fertile ground for new plant growth. 2. Plant regeneration: Some plant species have adapted to regenerate after wildfires. They may regrow from their roots, or their seeds may require exposure to high temperatures or chemicals released during the fire for germination. As these plants start to grow back, they provide the foundation for the recovery of the ecosystem. 3. Colonization by pioneer species: Some fast-growing species like grasses, shrubs, and other early successional plants begin to colonize the burned area. These pioneer species stabilize the soil, prevent erosion, and create a hospitable environment for other plant species and animals to return to the ecosystem. 4. Animal recolonization: Gradually, as vegetation regrows, it provides food and shelter for animals that were displaced or born elsewhere. Dispersal helps to repopulate the area, and the return of animal life can contribute to pollination, seed dispersal, and the reestablishment of the food chain. 5. Succession and ecosystem recovery: Over time, the ecosystem further develops through ecological succession. This process involves the replacement of one community of plant and animal species by another, eventually leading to the reestablishment of a mature, stable, and diverse ecosystem. This recovery process can span several years to decades, depending on the severity of the fire and resilience of the ecosystem. In conclusion, while the immediate aftermath of a forest fire may lead to the destruction of plant and animal life, it also sets in motion a natural recovery process that allows the ecosystem to gradually regrow, recover, and regain its ecological balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

Alternatively, mental challenges like sudoku or crossword puzzles can stimulate the brain while being silent. These can be found in books or on the internet and can be tried out until a preferred puzzle is found. Another option is to practice doodling on paper, ensuring not to deface any furniture or property. Meditation can also be an effective technique for relaxation and calming the mind during class. By focusing on deep, regular breathing and maintaining proper posture, one can clear their mind and concentrate on a single thought or emotion. Meditating with the eyes open allows for continued awareness of the surroundings without drawing attention to the practice.

She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets... Soon I was included in her magic world. We slept over at each other's houses and spent every free moment together.

Identify the keywords and their Finnish translations: - \\"Transparency directive\\" refers to a set of rules or guidelines regarding transparency, typically in a business or regulatory context. In Finnish, \\"transparency\\" can be translated to \\"läpinäkyvyys\\" and \\"directive\\" can be translated to \\"direktiivi\\". So, the whole term may be translated as \\"läpinäkyvyysdirektiivi\\". - \\"Report\\" can be translated to \\"raportti\\" in Finnish. - \\"Mr Skinner\\" is a proper noun referring to a person. We keep proper names the same in Finnish as they are in English. 2. Translate the sentence structure: - The original sentence has the subject \\"I\\" and an action \\"turn to\\". In Finnish, \\"I\\" is translated to \\"minä\\" (often shortened to \\"mä\\" in spoken language), and \\"turn to\\" can be translated to \\"käännyn\\", which is in present tense. - The original sentence is constructed in English phrases with 'and' which in Finnish can be translated to 'ja'. 3. Assemble the translated words into the correct Finnish sentence structure: - Finnish sentences usually follow a subject-verb-object (SVO) structure. In this case, the subject is \\"minä\\" (I) and the verb is \\"käännyn\\" (turn to). The objects are \\"läpinäkyvyysdirektiivi\\" (transparency directive) and \\"raportti\\" (report) with \\"herra Skinner\\" (Mr. Skinner) as the person responsible for the report. 4. Review the translation to ensure proper vocabulary and grammar: - Final Finnish translation: \\"Minä käännyn nyt läpinäkyvyysdirektiiviin ja herra Skinnerin raporttiin.\\" By following these steps, I have translated the phrase \\"I now turn to the transparency directive and the report by Mr Skinner\\" into Finnish as: \\"Minä käännyn nyt läpinäkyvyysdirektiiviin ja herra Skinnerin raporttiin.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: \\"A nectar feeding bird would be called what?\\" Context: \\"Birds that employ many strategies to obtain food or feed on a variety of food items are called generalists, while others that concentrate time and effort on specific food items or have a single strategy to obtain food are considered specialists. Birds' feeding strategies vary by species. Many birds glean for insects, invertebrates, fruit, or seeds. Some hunt insects by suddenly attacking from a branch. Those species that seek pest insects are considered beneficial 'biological control agents' and their presence encouraged in biological pest control programs. Nectar feeders such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets amongst others have specially adapted brushy tongues and in many cases bills designed to fit co-adapted flowers. Kiwis and shorebirds with long bills probe for invertebrates; shorebirds' varied bill lengths and feeding methods result in the separation of ecological niches. Loons, diving ducks, penguins and auks pursue their prey underwater, using their wings or feet for propulsion, while aerial predators such as sulids, kingfishers and terns plunge dive after their prey. Flamingos, three species of prion, and some ducks are filter feeders. Geese and dabbling ducks are primarily grazers.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"A nectar-feeding bird would be called a nectarivore. Nectarivorous birds, such as hummingbirds, sunbirds, lories, and lorikeets, have evolved special adaptations like brushy tongues and specially shaped bills to access nectar from flowers.

Proceeds go to Hepburn's family.","completion":"Yes, the next sentence, \\"Proceeds go to Hepburn's family,\\" follows the preceding text logically. Both sentences indicate that the money raised from the sale will financially benefit Hepburn's family. Let us provide a detailed explanation for better understanding. In the first sentence, we learn that the money raised from a sale will be placed into a trust. This trust is specifically designated for Hepburn's family, which means that the funds within it are to be used for their benefit. Trusts are financial arrangements that provide a legal mechanism for managing assets on behalf of beneficiaries. In this case, the beneficiaries are Hepburn's family members. The trust can then distribute the funds or use the assets in accordance with its terms and the intentions of the person who established the trust. The next sentence, \\"Proceeds go to Hepburn's family,\\" is a simplified statement that conveys the same idea. Proceeds refer to the money generated from the sale, which is to be directed toward Hepburn's family. While this sentence does not include specific details about the trust mentioned in the first sentence, it still highlights that the financial benefit is meant for Hepburn's family. Therefore, the second sentence aligns with and reinforces the main point of the first sentence, which is that the money raised from the sale will support Hepburn's family. The context provided in the first sentence about the plan to establish a trust adds an extra layer of detail and a more thorough understanding of how the family will receive the funds.

This is a correct answer to the following question about List of Schedule IV drugs (US). Yes or no? Answer: Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in schedule III. Question: what is schedule 4 drugs A:","completion":"Yes, Schedule IV drugs, also known as Schedule 4 drugs, are a category of drugs classified under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) in the United States. The CSA is a federal legislation that was enacted in 1970 to regulate the manufacture, distribution, and possession of certain substances with potential for abuse and addiction. The Act categorizes drugs into five schedules (I to V), with Schedule I representing substances with the highest potential for abuse and no accepted medical use, and Schedule V representing substances with the lowest potential for abuse and accepted medical use. Schedule IV drugs are defined as substances with a lower potential for abuse and dependence compared to Schedule III drugs. According to the CSA, these drugs meet the following criteria: 1. The substance has a low potential for abuse relative to the drugs or other substances in Schedule III. 2. The substance has a currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States. 3. Abuse of the drug or other substance may lead to limited physical dependence or psychological dependence relative to the drugs or other substances in Schedule III. The drugs listed under Schedule IV include benzodiazepines (e.g., diazepam, alprazolam), non-benzodiazepine sleep medications (e.g., zolpidem, eszopiclone), and certain medications used to treat seizures or anxiety (e.g., pregabalin, gabapentin). While these drugs have accepted medical uses and a lower potential for abuse compared to substances in Schedule III, they can still lead to some degree of physical or psychological dependence if not used responsibly. Prescriptions for Schedule IV drugs are subject to certain requirements and restrictions. Physicians and other authorized healthcare providers can prescribe these medications, but they must follow specific guidelines for prescription writing and documentation. Refills for Schedule IV drugs are allowed, but generally, no more than five refills are allowed within a six-month period. The DEA, or Drug Enforcement Administration, closely monitors the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances to prevent diversion and misuse. In conclusion, Schedule IV drugs are substances with a low potential for abuse and limited physical or psychological dependence compared to Schedule III drugs. They are subject to specific regulations and monitoring to ensure the safe use and distribution of these medications."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: The Royal Navy returned \`Foley\` to the U.S. Navy at Harwich, England, on 22 August 1945. - Subject: The Royal Navy - Action: returned \`Foley\` - To whom: to the U.S. Navy - Location: at Harwich, England - Date: on 22 August 1945 Sentence 2: The U.S. Navy returned to the Royal Navy on August 22, 1945 in Harwich, England. - Subject: The U.S. Navy - Action: returned - To whom: to the Royal Navy - Location: in Harwich, England - Date: on August 22, 1945 Step 2: Compare the meanings and structures of the two sentences. - Both sentences have the same date and location (Harwich, England, and 22 August 1945).

Hakimullah Mehsud, thought to have been behind a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square and several attacks inside Pakistan, is one of five believed dead in the attack this morning. The attack and his death were confirmed by senior Taliban commanders, who said they saw Mehsud's body, and U.S. and Pakistani intelligence sources. Killed: Pakistani Taliban chief Hakimullah Mehsud, who had a 5m bounty on his head, pictured in 2009. It is believed the men were killed in a U.S. drone strike on Mehsud's car in the mountainous North Waziristan region, in the north west of Pakistan. Reports said Mehsud led the violent militant group from a secret hideout in the tribal region, which is one of the Taliban's main strongholds. How the U.S. Department of State described Mehsud, who has been among the CIA's most wanted men in the world for at least four years. Drones fired four missiles at a compound in Danda Darpa Khel, a village about three miles from the regional capital of Miranshah, sources said. Two of the dead reportedly included Hakimullah's personal bodyguard Tariq Mehsud and his driver Abdullah Mehsud. A senior Taliban commander said: 'We confirm with great sorrow that our esteemed leader was martyred in a drone attack.' Mehsud took over the leadership of the Pakistani Taliban in August 2009 after his predecessor was also killed in a drone attack. Since then he has been one of the CIA's most wanted men with a 5 million bounty on his head. He appeared in a farewell video for a Jordanian double agent whose suicide bombing in 2009 killed seven CIA employees at a base in Afghanistan. The U.S. named him 'the self-proclaimed emir of the Pakistani Taliban' and charged him with conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens abroad and conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction. His funeral will be held tomorrow in Miranshah, the Taliban commander said - which is likely to stir tensions further in the highly volatile region. Today's drone strike came amid peace talks between the Pakistani government and militants in the region to end years of fighting. Unconfirmed reports say the strike came as Mehsud attended a gathering of 25 Taliban leaders to discuss the government's offer of peace. Hakimullah Mehsud, pictured right, was said to command violent militants from a mountainous hideout. This photo from November 2008 shows Mehsud, second from left, speaking to journalists at a Taliban base. During. a visit to London yesterday, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who won a landslide election victory in May, confirmed talks with the Pakistani Taliban had started. The Pakistani government condemned today's drone strike, although their statement was issued before Mehsud's death was reported. Controversial: Taliban leaders have already described Hakimullah Mehsud as a martyr. 'These. strikes are a violation of Pakistan's sovereignty and territorial. integrity,' said a spokesman for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The drone strikes are unpopular in Pakistan,. where many people view them as an infringement on Pakistani sovereignty. and say innocent civilians are killed in the process. But the Americans have had some successes - in May, a drone strike killed Mehsud's second-in-command, and one of his most trusted lieutenants was captured in Afghanistan last month. The CIA and the White House declined to comment on Mehsud's death. Although the killing will spark calls for revenge among Taliban leaders, it may make negotiations with the militants easier in the long-run, said Saifullah Mahsud, director of the Pakistani think-tank FATA Research Center. He said: 'Hakimullah Mehsud was a very controversial figure and he had very tough demands.' Mehsud, who told jokes and had an interest in modern technology, was the driver for the former head of the Pakistani Taliban before rising through the ranks. The militant leader, known for his emotional outbursts, had two wives but moved frequently because of his fear of U.S. drone strikes. His wing of the Taliban was accused of being involved in an attempt to detonate a car bomb in New York's Times Square in 2010. But recently Mehsud's rivalries with other Taliban commanders over the spoils from extortion and kidnapping had sharpened, it is believed, raising tensions within the armed organisation. Tension: Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, pictured meeting U.S. President Barack Obama last week, said only yesterday that peace talks with the Taliban had started. His government condemned the drone strike. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"This article discusses the death of Hakimullah Mehsud, the leader of the Pakistani Taliban, killed by an American drone strike. The report highlights that Mehsud, who had a 5 million bounty on his head, was regarded as one of the most wanted men by the CIA. He was believed to be behind a failed car bombing in New York's Times Square and multiple other attacks within Pakistan. Mehsud, together with four other unidentified individuals, was killed in a drone attack on his car in the mountainous North Waziristan region, a known Taliban stronghold. Drones fired four missiles at a compound in Danda Darpa Khel, resulting in Mehsud's death and that of his personal bodyguard and his driver. Mehsud's leadership of the Pakistani Taliban had begun in August 2009 following the drone death of his predecessor. The U.S. marked him as a significant threat, charging him with conspiracy to kill U.S. citizens overseas and use a weapon of mass destruction. His death was confirmed by Taliban commanders and intelligence sources from both the U.S. and Pakistan. The drone strike occurred amid ongoing peace negotiations between the Pakistani government and regional militants, a point of contention that sparked controversy. While the Pakistani government and the public widely condemned the strikes as violations of the nation's sovereignty, the death of Mehsud could potentially simplify these negotiations, according to Saifullah Mahsud, director of the Pakistani think-tank FATA Research Center. The article describes Hakimullah Mehsud as an emotional and controversial figure, moving often due to fear of drone strikes and known for rivalries within the Taliban. His faction of the group was implicated in an attempt to carry out a car bomb explosion in Times Square in 2010. Notably, the drone strike that resulted in Mehsud's death came shortly after Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif confirmed that peace talks with the Taliban had begun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the given review, which simply states \\"Amazing,\\" it can be assumed that the individual had a positive experience with the app. The term \\"amazing\\" generally implies that the app exceeded their expectations and provided a valuable or enjoyable experience. Thus, in response to the question, \\"Would you recommend this app to a friend?\\", my suggestion would be \\"Definitely.\\" The reasoning behind this recommendation is based on the fact that the reviewer has expressed their satisfaction with the app, which could mean that it offers exciting features, convenient usability, or an appealing design among other positive attributes. When people find something amazing, they are typically eager to share their discoveries with others, which in this case would involve recommending the app to a friend. However, it is important to note that since the review is fairly minimalistic, it does not provide us with a comprehensive understanding of the app's quality, its target audience, or its specific features. To make a more informed decision about whether or not to recommend the app to a friend, it would be beneficial to gather more information about it, such as reading more detailed reviews or checking the app's ratings and description. Additionally, the appropriateness of recommending an app to a friend depends on the friend's preferences, needs, and interests. If you are aware that your friend enjoys similar apps or is in search of a specific functionality offered by this app, then the recommendation is more likely to be well-received. Conversely, if the app does not align with your friend's preferences, it might not be suitable to recommend it to them.

What is the cause?","completion":"The cause for the pharmaceutical company recalling the drug likely stems from various factors that could have resulted in concerns about the drug's safety, efficacy, or quality. The phrase \\"recalled the drug\\" suggests that the company has decided to remove the drug from distribution to address these potential concerns. These potential factors include: 1. Adverse effects or reactions: The company may have received reports of severe or unexpected side effects associated with the use of the drug. These adverse effects could pose a significant health risk to patients, prompting the company to recall the product as a precautionary measure to ensure patient safety. 2. Manufacturing issues: It is possible that during the manufacturing process, there have been errors or contamination that could affect the drug's quality, purity, or stability. This could pose safety risks or render the drug ineffective, necessitating the recall to address these issues and prevent potential harm to patients. 3. Insufficient or incorrect labeling: If the drug's packaging or labeling contains inaccurate or inadequate information about its ingredients, usage instructions, drug interactions, or side effects, this could lead to misuse by patients or healthcare professionals. In such cases, the company would recall the drug to ensure that consumers receive the correct information required for safe and proper use of the product. 4. Non-compliance with regulatory guidelines: Regulatory authorities, such as the FDA, regularly monitor the pharmaceutical industry to ensure drug safety and efficacy. If the drug does not comply with specific guidelines or has not been tested thoroughly before its release to the market, the company may be required to recall the product to avoid legal or ethical complications. 5. Data manipulation or cover-up: In rare cases, the pharmaceutical company may discover that data from crucial research or clinical trials has been manipulated or hidden, altering the perceived safety or efficacy of the drug. Under such circumstances, the company would have to recall the drug to protect patients and preserve its reputation. 6. Expiry or storage concerns: If the drug has exceeded its expiration date or has been stored in suboptimal conditions that could affect its potency or safety, the company would need to recall the product to prevent potential harm to consumers. In summary, the cause for a pharmaceutical company recalling a drug can be related to several factors, including safety concerns due to adverse effects, manufacturing issues, labeling errors, non-compliance with regulatory standards, data manipulation, or expiry and storage-related factors.

CHAPTER III LIGHTFOOT TELLS HOW HIS ANTLERS GREW It is hard to believe what seems impossible. And yet what seems impossible to you may be a very commonplace matter to some one else. So it does not do to say that a thing cannot be possible just because you cannot understand how it can be. Peter Rabbit wanted to believe what Lightfoot the Deer had just told him, but somehow he couldn't. If he had seen those antlers growing, it would have been another matter. But he hadn't seen Lightfoot since the very last of winter, and then Lightfoot had worn just such handsome antlers as he now had. So Peter really couldn't be blamed for not being able to believe that those old ones had been lost and in their place new ones had grown in just the few months of spring and summer. But Peter didn't blame Lightfoot in the least, because he had told Peter that he didn't like to tell things to people who wouldn't believe what he told them when Peter had asked him about the rags hanging to his antlers. \\"I'm trying to believe it,\\" he said, quite humbly. \\"It's all true,\\" broke in another voice. Peter jumped and turned to find his big cousin, Jumper the Hare. Unseen and unheard, he had stolen up and had overheard what Peter and Lightfoot had said. \\"How do you know it is true?\\" snapped Peter a little crossly, for Jumper had startled him. \\"Because I saw Lightfoot's old antlers after they had fallen off, and I often saw Lightfoot while his new ones were growing,\\" retorted Jumper.

Question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What beautiful Swiss landmark was witten about in the poem Die Alpen? Context: Jean-Jacques Rousseau was the first of many to present the Alps as a place of allure and beauty, banishing the prevalent conception of the mountains as a hellish wasteland inhabited by demons. Rousseau's conception of alpine purity was later emphasized with the publication of Albrecht von Haller's poem Die Alpen that described the mountains as an area of mythical purity. Late in the 18th century the first wave of Romantics such as Goethe and Turner came to admire the scenery; Wordsworth visited the area in 1790, writing of his experiences in The Prelude. Schiller later wrote the play William Tell romanticising Swiss independence. After the end of the Napoleonic Wars, the Alpine countries began to see an influx of poets, artists, and musicians, as visitors came to experience the sublime effects of monumental nature.

Passage:The Golden State Warriors last made the NBA Finals in , when they were still in San Francisco. In the years since, they moved to Oakland, briefly lost Rick Barry to the American Basketball Association, and named Warriors great Al Attles as head coach. Before the start of the 1974–75 season they traded future Hall of Famer Nate Thurmond to the Chicago Bulls for young center Clifford Ray. They also drafted Jamaal Wilkes, then known as Keith Wilkes, out of UCLA. With Barry as the offensive leader, and with Attles using a team approach to coaching, the Warriors managed to finish the season atop the Western Conference with 48 wins. In the playoffs, they defeated the Seattle SuperSonics in six games, then eliminated Thurmond and the Bulls in seven games to advance to the Finals. Links: a. 1974–75 NBA season b.

So, looking at the options: a. 1974–75 NBA season: While this time frame may provide information on the drafting event, it might not directly confirm which college the draft pick attended. b. Golden State Warriors: This option would offer more information about the Warriors as a team, but not directly answer the question about the drafted player's college. c.

It was first performed at the Théâtre de l'Athénée in Paris in a production that opened on 17 April 1947, which Louis Jouvet directed. - The Screens is a play by the French dramatist Jean Genet. Its first few productions all used abridged versions, beginning with its world premiere under Hans Lietzau's direction in Berlin in May 1961. Its first complete performance was staged in Stockholm in 1964, two years before Roger Blin directed its French premiere in Paris. - Our Lady of the Flowers (\\"Notre Dame des Fleurs\\") is the debut novel of French writer Jean Genet, first published in 1943. The free-flowing, poetic novel is a largely autobiographical account of a man's journey through the Parisian underworld. The characters are drawn after their real-life counterparts, who are mostly homosexuals living on the fringes of society. - Querelle of Brest is a novel by the French writer Jean Genet. It was first published anonymously in 1947 and limited to 460 numbered copies. It is set in the midst of the port town of Brest, where sailors and the sea are associated with murder. Its protagonist, Georges Querelle, is a bisexual thief, prostitute and serial killer who manipulates and kills his lovers for thrills and profit. The novel formed the basis for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's last film, \\"Querelle\\" (1982). - A film director is a person who directs the making of a film. Generally, a film director controls a film's artistic and dramatic aspects, and visualizes the script while guiding the technical crew and actors in the fulfillment of that vision. The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design, and the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. - Jean Genet ( ) was a French novelist, playwright, poet, essayist, and political activist. Early in his life he was a vagabond and petty criminal, but he later took to writing. His major works include the novels \\"Querelle of Brest\\", \\"The Thief's Journal\\", and \\"Our Lady of the Flowers\\", and the plays \\"The Balcony\\", \\"The Blacks\\", \\"The Maids\\" and \\"The Screens\\". - The Thief's Journal (\\"Journal du voleur\\") is perhaps Jean Genet's most famous work. It is a part-fact, part-fiction autobiography that charts the author's progress through Europe in a curiously depoliticized 1930s, wearing nothing but rags and enduring hunger, contempt, fatigue and vice. Spain, Italy, Austria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, Nazi Germany, Belgium... everywhere is the same: bars, dives, flop-houses; robbery, prison and expulsion. - Querelle is a 1982 West German - French English - language drama film directed by Rainer Werner Fassbinder and starring Brad Davis , adapted from French author Jean Genet 's 1947 novel Querelle de Brest . It marked Fassbinder 's final film as a writer / director ; it was posthumously released just months after the director died of a drug overdose in June 1982 . - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance. - New German Cinema is a period in German cinema which lasted from the late 1960s into the 1980s. It saw the emergence of a new generation of directors. Working with low budgets, and influenced by the French New Wave, such directors as Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Werner Herzog, Alexander Kluge, Harun Farocki, Volker Schlöndorff, Helma Sanders-Brahms, Hans-Jürgen Syberberg, Margarethe von Trotta and Wim Wenders made names for themselves and produced a number of 'small' motion pictures that caught the attention of art house audiences, and enabled these directors (particularly Wenders and Schlöndorff) to create better-financed productions which were backed by the big US studios. - Rainer Werner Fassbinder (31 May 1945 10 June 1982) was a German film director, screenwriter, film producer and actor.

Cette préoccupation se réfère non seulement à la capacité des chercheurs à obtenir des ressources financières pour mener à bien leurs projets, mais également à l'impact que cela pourrait avoir sur la compétitivité de ces initiatives au sein des concours ouverts organisés par le CIHR. Dans ce contexte, il est important de noter que les restrictions budgétaires peuvent entraver le développement de nouveaux projets de recherche ainsi que la continuité des projets existants. Par conséquent, le manque de financement représente un problème majeur pour les chercheurs qui souhaitent innover et progresser dans leur domaine de spécialisation. Ce problème s'explique par différentes raisons, telles que l'insuffisance des fonds publics alloués à la recherche en santé, la complexité des processus de demande de financement et la concurrence accrue entre les chercheurs pour accéder à ces ressources. Dans le cadre des concours ouverts organisés par le CIHR, il est essentiel de promouvoir l'équité et la transparence en termes de financement ainsi que d'encourager des collaborations efficaces entre chercheurs et institutions. Ces concours visent à soutenir les projets de recherche les plus prometteurs en leur fournissant des ressources financières pour atteindre leurs objectifs. Cependant, le niveau de compétitivité peut être très élevé, ce qui peut décourager certains chercheurs ou les mettre en difficulté pour présenter des demandes de financement solides et compétitives. Afin de surmonter cette difficulté et de rendre les chercheurs plus compétitifs dans les concours ouverts du CIHR, il est nécessaire de renforcer la collaboration entre différentes disciplines et institutions, d'améliorer la qualité et la pertinence des projets de recherche proposés, et de promouvoir la formation et le développement professionnel pour les chercheurs dans le domaine de la santé. Il est également crucial de commencer par sensibiliser les chercheurs aux ressources et aux opportunités de financement disponibles, notamment en fournissant des conseils et en offrant des ateliers et des séminaires pour renforcer les compétences en matière de recherche et de rédaction de demandes de financement. En conclusion, le défi de la compétitivité et de l'accès au financement dans les concours ouverts du CIHR est une préoccupation majeure pour les chercheurs en santé au Canada.

Translate to English","completion":"Winston Churchill wrote, \\"Never, never, never entertain the idea that war can proceed smoothly and easily.\\" Winston Churchill, who served twice as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and is widely regarded as one of the most significant figures in modern history, was no stranger to the realities of war. He is well known for his leadership and tenacity during times of conflict, especially during World War II. He participated in and contributed to many military campaigns and endeavors throughout his life, so his perspective on the subject carries a great deal of weight. The quote in question, which insists that one should never assume that war can be without complications or challenges, reveals the depths of Churchill's understanding and experience. He was undoubtedly well aware of the complexities and difficulties inherent to warfare, and he sought to remind others of these essential truths. War, by its very nature, brings with it a wide range of obstacles and hardships – both for the soldiers who must confront the conflict directly and for the political leaders who must attempt to navigate through a myriad of challenging decisions and consequences. The outcomes of war often have far-reaching and long-lasting effects on the nations and communities involved, so it is crucial to recognize the gravity and complicatedness of such endeavors. Churchill's words are a stark reminder of the importance of considering all factors and consequences when engaging in war or any act of aggression, especially the potential for deviation from one's expectations and plans. Furthermore, his quote highlights his belief in the importance of preparedness, caution, and persistence in the face of adversity. In conclusion, the phrase \\"Never, never, never entertain the idea that war can proceed smoothly and easily\\" is a testament to Winston Churchill's insight into the brutal and unpredictable nature of warfare. It conveys the critical message that those involved in or leading any war effort should be mindful of the obstacles, challenges, and sacrifices that come with it and must approach the matter with the seriousness, caution, and determination it deserves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Electric motor: Nothing in the principle of any of the motors described above requires that the iron (steel) portions of the rotor actually rotate. If the soft magnetic material of the rotor is made in the form of a cylinder, then (except for the effect of hysteresis) torque is exerted only on the windings of the electromagnets. Taking advantage of this fact is the coreless or ironless DC motor, a specialized form of a PM DC motor. Optimized for rapid acceleration, these motors have a rotor that is constructed without any iron core. The rotor can take the form of a winding-filled cylinder, or a self-supporting structure comprising only the magnet wire and the bonding material. The rotor can fit inside the stator magnets; a magnetically soft stationary cylinder inside the rotor provides a return path for the stator magnetic flux. A second arrangement has the rotor winding basket surrounding the stator magnets. In that design, the rotor fits inside a magnetically soft cylinder that can serve as the housing for the motor, and likewise provides a return path for the flux. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\".

Mr Goldsmith stood as an independent after leaving the Conservative Party in protest at the government's decision to back a third Heathrow runway. But Lib Dem Sarah Olney, who is also opposed to Heathrow expansion, fought the campaign on the issue of Brexit. Labour's Christian Wolmar lost his Â£500 deposit as he trailed a distant third. In quotes: What the result means Ten famous by-elections In pictures: By-elections since 2010 BBC London Live: By-election reaction The other five candidates also lost their deposits as they did not receive a big enough share of the vote. Ms Olney polled 20,510 votes to Mr Goldsmith's 18,638. The Conservative Party, UK Independence Party and Green Party did not field candidates. As the new Lib Dem MP for Richmond Park and North Kingston, Ms Olney will be the party's only female MP - joining eight male colleagues. She said the by-election result was a rejection of the \\"politics of anger and division\\". She added: \\"The people of Richmond Park and North Kingston have sent a shockwave through this Conservative Brexit government, and our message is clear - we do not want a hard Brexit. \\"We do not want to be pulled out of the single market, and we will not let intolerance, division and fear win.\\" She said if Article 50 - the legal process that sparks Britain's exit from the EU - is put to a parliamentary vote, she will vote against it. \\"That's been a central part of my campaign and now I've been given a very clear mandate that that's what they [constituents] want me to do,\\" she told the BBC. But the Conservative Party was quick to dismiss Ms Olney's view, stating: \\"This result doesn't change anything.\\" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron said the result \\"was a remarkable, come-from-nowhere upset that will terrify the Conservatives\\", but he claimed it was also a rejection of \\"a hard Brexit\\". \\"This was not just about a Remain versus Leave rerun - this was about people trying to say to Theresa May, 'We do not like the extreme version of Brexit outside the single market you're taking us down,'\\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \\"The other thing that was clearly a concern to voters was they desperately wanted a moderate, decent alternative to the Tories now Labour has shuffled off the main stage - and they were delighted to give the Liberal Democrats the opportunity to be just that.\\" Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg conceded the vote had been about Brexit as Richmond \\"was a very strong pro-Remain constituency\\". He praised Mr Goldsmith's \\"nobility\\" for keeping his word, but said it was a \\"real shame\\" that an independently minded person like him would no longer be in Parliament. In a year of political upsets, another. Sarah Olney joined the Liberal Democrats only 18 months ago. She now becomes the party's ninth MP. As soon as the polls closed last night, the width of Lib Dem smiles pointed to an extraordinary result. A party of government shrivelled to a rump at last year's general election had rediscovered its mojo in this rich, pro-European corner of south-west London. Zac Goldsmith had hoped this contest would be a referendum on the prospect of even more planes thundering through the skies here if Heathrow Airport gets bigger. But, instead, it was June's EU referendum that dominated. Seventy per cent of voters here backed Remain. But Zac Goldsmith didn't. The Liberal Democrats, unapologetically pro-EU, ruthlessly exploited this. Sarah Olney told me she would vote against triggering Article 50 - the formal mechanism for starting Brexit. But the country voted Leave, even if this seat didn't, and the government will press on regardless. For Zac Goldsmith this was his second political humiliation of the year - beaten by Labour to be London Mayor, beaten by the Lib Dems in his own backyard. And leaving Theresa May's slender majority looking even thinner. Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's lead Brexit negotiator and chair of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats, tweeted his good wishes to Ms Olney. \\"Congratulations @sarahjolney1 and @LibDems. Europe is watching & we are proud #IamEuropean,\\" he wrote. Mr Goldsmith, who campaigned for Leave in the referendum, quit as the Tory MP for the constituency in October so he could fight a by-election as an independent on an anti-Heathrow Airport expansion ticket. At the time, the Conservatives said they \\"disagreed\\" with Mr Goldsmith's decision but would not field a candidate against him. A relative newcomer to politics, Sarah Olney said she was compelled to join the Liberal Democrats after the 2015 general election. In her victory speech, she said: \\"A year and a half ago I wasn't involved in politics, I wasn't a member of a political party, I had never been involved in a political campaign, I had never thought about being a politician. \\"But I knew I was a liberal. \\"When I saw what happened in the general election last year I felt I had to get involved.\\" Ms Olney, who lives in North Kingston with her husband Ben and two children, works as a qualified accountant at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. After his defeat was announced, Mr Goldsmith said: \\"This by-election was not a political calculation. \\"It was a promise that I made and it was a promise that I kept. \\"I wish Sarah well in her very, very important job and I hope she serves this community as well as this community deserves.\\" A Conservative Party spokesman said the result would make no difference to Brexit plans. He said: \\"The government remains committed to leaving the European Union and triggering Article 50 by the end of March next year.\\" Turnout = 53.6% Ms Olney was elected with a majority of 1,872 votes, compared with a Conservative Party majority of 23,015 at the 2015 general election. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"In the Richmond Park by-election, the Liberal Democrat candidate Sarah Olney won the south-west London seat, defeating Zac Goldsmith, who resigned from the Conservative party and ran as an independent over their Heathrow expansion policy. The Liberal Democrats used the election to fight \\"hard Brexit\\", with Olney stating that if Article 50 were put to a parliamentary vote, she would vote against it. The result reduces the total number of Conservative members of parliament to 329 and increases the already slender majority the Conservative government has in the Commons."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this week's headlines, a notable discovery was made by a Croatian professor regarding the connection between thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and the prevention of bone loss, also known as osteoporosis. Osteoporosis is a common medical condition that affects millions of people worldwide, especially among the elderly population. It is characterized by the weakening of bones, which increases the risk of fractures and can significantly impact a person's quality of life. The Croatian researcher investigated the potential role of TSH in maintaining bone health and preventing osteoporosis. TSH is a hormone produced by the pituitary gland in the brain, which stimulates the thyroid gland to secrete thyroid hormones. These hormones play a crucial role in regulating the body's metabolism, growth, and development. In recent years, scientists have been investigating the possible effects of TSH on bone metabolism and bone health. Through his extensive research, the Croatian professor found evidence suggesting that TSH could indeed play a protective role in maintaining bone density. According to the findings, TSH appears to prevent the breakdown of bone by inhibiting the activity of osteoclasts, which are specialized cells responsible for the resorption of bone tissue. By reducing the activity of osteoclasts, TSH may be able to slow down the process of bone loss and help prevent the development of osteoporosis. This discovery has significant implications for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis. Currently, the most common pharmaceutical interventions for osteoporosis include bisphosphonates and hormone replacement therapy, both of which have potential side effects and limitations. The knowledge that TSH may be an essential factor in maintaining bone density could lead to the development of new, more targeted therapies that have fewer side effects and can be tailored to individual patients. Furthermore, this research could help improve our understanding of the complex relationship between the endocrine and skeletal systems. Identifying the specific mechanisms through which TSH affects bone metabolism may pave the way for additional research into other hormonal factors that influence bone health. Such insights could ultimately lead to better prevention strategies and more effective treatments for osteoporosis and other bone-related disorders. In conclusion, the recent discovery by the Croatian professor regarding the potential role of TSH in preventing bone loss represents a significant advancement in our knowledge of osteoporosis and bone health. This groundbreaking research could pave the way for more innovative and effective treatment options for osteoporosis, as well as contribute to a greater understanding of the complex interplay between hormones and bone metabolism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: After Jean Thatcher (Ware) has been injured in a car accident, her father, Judge Thatcher (Hinds) and beau Jerry (Matthews) implore retired surgeon Dr. Richard Vollin (Lugosi) to perform a delicate operation to restore her to health. Vollin agrees and is successful; he befriends the spirited and grateful Jean, in the process revealing his passion for all things related to Edgar Allan Poe, including his homemade collection of torture devices inspired by Poe's works (such as a pit, pendulum with crescent razor, shrinking room, etc.), and identifying the raven as his talisman. After Vollin reveals his growing love for Jean to her father, the Judge quickly discourages him from the affair. Angered, Vollin hatches a plan when Edmond Bateman (Karloff), a murderer on the run, comes to his home asking for a new face so he may live in anonymity. Vollin admits to not being a plastic surgeon, but says he can help Bateman, and asks him to help in exacting revenge on the Thatchers, which he refuses. Bateman explains that he feels his antisocial behavior is a result of having been called ugly all his life, and he hopes a new face may gave him a chance to end it. Vollin performs the surgery, but instead turns Bateman into a disfigured monster, promising only to operate again on Bateman when Vollin's revenge is exacted. Bateman finally reluctantly agrees. Vollin hosts a dinner party, among which Jean, Jerry, and the Judge are guests. One by one, the guests are caught in the Poe-inspired traps. Ultimately, Bateman is shot by Vollin as he rescues Jean and Jerry, but throws Vollin into the shrinking room where he perishes, and the guests escape.

Write some highlights for the following article: Using the most unlikely of clues -- a pretzel bag -- authorities in Denmark and the United States are zeroing in on a suspected child abuser, and they are asking for the public's help in ending the exploitation of a small girl. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement on Tuesday released five photographs of a man carefully edited from four videos in which the man sexually assaults a young girl, believed to be 7 to 9 years old. Three of the videos, which contain a clear image of the man, are date-stamped April 14, a fourth is dated April 27, and all four appear to have been posted on the Internet several days later, on May 2. Danish National Police discovered the videos soon thereafter and notified U.S. authorities on May 3. Three factors led Danish investigators to believe the crime occurred in the U.S.: the background, some products visible in the video, and the man's appearance. In the United States, investigators with Homeland Security Investigations, the law enforcement arm of ICE, saw a Frito-Lay Rold Gold bag for thin pretzels in the videos. By studying Frito-Lay web sites, they learned that Rold Gold pretzels are packaged differently within the United States and Canada. ICE investigators believe the bag in the video is exclusively distributed in the United States. With leads coming to an end, the investigators are asking the public for help in identifying the man. \\"We kind of hit a wall in this investigation. Without the public's help, we may not be able (to find the man) and more importantly stop the ongoing abuse of this victim,\\" said Brian Korzak, a special agent with ICE's Cyber Crimes Center, Child Exploitation Unit. Publication of the man's photo \\"will greatly increase our chances of locating this individual,\\" said Special Agent Patrick Redling. \\"Since the videos were created so recently, we feel there's a child in danger right now.\\" Korzak and Redling say investigators routinely identify both technical and visual clues in videos for evidence to identify criminals and to rescue victims. HSI is asking anyone with information about this man to contact the agency immediately by calling the ICE Tip Line at 866-347-2423 or completing an online tip form at www.ICE.gov/tips. Tips remain anonymous, ICE said, and individuals should not attempt to apprehend the suspect. ICE filed a criminal complaint in the U.S. District Court of Washington on Friday, charging the man in the photos, identified as a \\"John Doe,\\" of producing, possessing and distributing child pornography.","completion":"So, there's a bad guy who is hurting a little girl.

The seven-week strike action was suspended last week amid negotiations between Unite and the city council. But the breakthrough could be unworkable as the council report says giving ground on workers' demands is not financially viable. It cost the authority up to £300,000 a week to clear the backlog of rubbish. See more stories from across Birmingham and the Black Country here The dispute centres on a restructuring plan that Unite says is threatening the jobs of more than 120 refuse collectors, while the council says it will modernise the service and save £5m a year. The strike was suspended on 16 August after the council agreed certain posts would not be made redundant and conciliatory service Acas said bin collections could resume. A statement said the authority had accepted the workers' case and restored the jobs of grade three workers, who are responsible for safety at the back of refuse vehicles. However, a report due to be discussed by the council's cabinet on Thursday said the proposed reorganisation - which prompted the industrial action - was needed to enable spending to be contained within the budget. Current working arrangements and crew structure had not delivered value-for-money savings targets and \\"will not meet the business need of the future\\", the report said. The update report into the ongoing bins dispute has raised eyebrows for more than one reason. It's unusual to see so candid a publication in the public domain - but this report said quite clearly there's absolutely no room for manoeuvre when it comes to the pay grading issue that refuse workers have been striking over. Why? Not only because of the direct savings of more than £5m the council wants to make - but because keeping the grade three binmen as they are could lead to a raft of equal pay claims that the council can't afford. The report stops short of saying a deal was done prematurely, but it certainly recommends there should be no movement whatsoever on the council's original plans, which led to the strike in the first place. Not what Acas and Unite were saying last week, or what the binmen want to hear. One told me today that the mood is very downbeat following the deferral of this crucial vote - because he has no desire to go back on strike, but believes it's almost inevitable with such potentially deep division between council officers and the promise of a resolution. So next Friday really is crunch time, the day when new contracts must be issued, and when senior councillors must decide whether they vote with officers risking more devastating strike action, or against them - and then have to face some other potentially serious consequences. The leader, and much of the city, will be hoping they reach some kind of deal before then. The report said a decision to not proceed with the deletion of grade three roles would result in an increase in costs of £600,000 in a full year alone. \\"However, the more significant potential financial implications arising from a decision not to continue with the implementation of the new operating model arise from a significant increase in the risks in relation to further equal pay claims,\\" it added. The meeting to discuss the report was deferred until 1 September.

And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \\"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \\"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading...

Background: Abbot Howard Hoffman (November 30, 1936 - April 12, 1989) was an American political and social activist, anarchist, and revolutionary who co-founded the Youth International Party (\\"Yippies\\"). Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in protests that led to violent confrontations with police during the 1968 Democratic National Convention, along with Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Tom Hayden, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, and Bobby Seale. The group was known collectively as the \\"Chicago Eight\\"; when Seale's prosecution was separated from the others, they became known as the Chicago Seven. While the defendants were initially convicted of intent to incite a riot, the verdicts were overturned on appeal. Context: Hoffman was arrested and tried for conspiracy and inciting to riot as a result of his role in anti-Vietnam War protests, which were met by a violent police response during the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. He was among the group that came to be known as the Chicago Seven (originally known as the Chicago Eight), which included fellow Yippie Jerry Rubin, David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, John Froines, Lee Weiner, future California state senator Tom Hayden and Black Panther Party co-founder Bobby Seale (before his trial was severed from the others). Presided over by Judge Julius Hoffman (no relation to Hoffman, about which he joked throughout the trial), Abbie Hoffman's courtroom antics frequently grabbed the headlines; one day, defendants Hoffman and Rubin appeared in court dressed in judicial robes, while on another day, Hoffman was sworn in as a witness with his hand giving the finger. Judge Hoffman became the favorite courtroom target of the Chicago Seven defendants, who frequently would insult the judge to his face. Abbie Hoffman told Judge Hoffman \\"you are a 'shande fur de Goyim' [disgrace in front of the gentiles]. You would have served Hitler better.\\" He later added that \\"your idea of justice is the only obscenity in the room.\\" Both Davis and Rubin told the Judge \\"this court is bullshit.\\" When Hoffman was asked in what state he resided, he replied the \\"state of mind of my brothers and sisters\\". Other celebrities were called as \\"cultural witnesses\\" including Allen Ginsberg, Phil Ochs, Arlo Guthrie, Norman Mailer and others. Hoffman closed the trial with a speech in which he quoted Abraham Lincoln, making the claim that the president himself, if alive today, would also be arrested in Chicago's Lincoln Park. On February 18, 1970, Hoffman and four of the other defendants (Rubin, Dellinger, Davis, and Hayden) were found guilty of intent to incite a riot while crossing state lines. All seven defendants were found not guilty of conspiracy. At sentencing, Hoffman suggested the judge try LSD and offered to set him up with \\"a dealer he knew in Florida\\" (the judge was known to be headed to Florida for a post-trial vacation). Each of the five was sentenced to five years in prison and a 5,000 fine. However, all convictions were subsequently overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. The Walker Commission later found that in fact it had been a \\"police riot\\". Question: What happened during the trial?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Alright, imagine a group of friends called the \\"Chicago Seven\\" who didn't like a big war happening. They went to a big meeting called the Democratic National Convention in 1968 to share their thoughts. The police didn't like that and it led to a big fight. So, the Chicago Seven had to go to a big room called a courtroom to talk to a man named Judge Hoffman. They had to explain why they were protesting, but they didn't always behave nicely, and sometimes wore funny clothes or said mean things to the judge. Other famous people came to the courtroom to support the Chicago Seven and share their thoughts too. But in the end, the judge said the Chicago Seven were guilty for causing a big problem during their protest. They were told they had to stay inside a place called a prison for 5 years and pay some money. Later, other important people decided that the Chicago Seven were not guilty after all, and they didn't have to stay in prison. It was also found out that the big fight was actually the police's fault."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry. - Desmatosuchus (from Greek \\"desmos\\" 'link' + \\"soûkhos\\" 'crocodile') is an extinct genus of archosaur belonging to the Order Aetosauria. It lived during the Late Triassic. - Neoaetosauroides is an extinct genus of primitive aetosaur. Its type and only species is \\"N. engaeus\\". Fossils have been found from the Los Colorados Formation outcropping along the Sierra Morada River in La Rioja, Argentina, and date back to the Norian age of the Late Triassic. It was the first aetosaur known from the formation, with remains being discovered in the 1960s. - In biology, phylogenetics (Greek: , - \\"phylé\\", \\"phylon\\" = tribe, clan, race + - \\"genetikós\\" = origin, source, birth) is the study of the evolutionary history and relationships among individuals or groups of organisms (e.g. species, or populations). These relationships are discovered through phylogenetic inference methods that evaluate observed heritable traits, such as DNA sequences or morphology under a model of evolution of these traits. The result of these analyses is a phylogeny (also known as a phylogenetic tree) a diagrammatic hypothesis about the history of the evolutionary relationships of a group of organisms. The tips of a phylogenetic tree can be living organisms or fossils, and represent the \\"end,\\" or the present, in an evolutionary lineage. Phylogenetic analyses have become central to understanding biodiversity, evolution, ecology, and genomes. - Aetosaurus is an extinct genus of archosaur reptile belonging to the order Aetosauria. It is generally considered to be the most primitive aetosaur. Three species are currently recognized: \\"A. ferratus\\", the type species from Germany and Italy; \\"A. crassicauda\\" from Germany; and \\"A. arcuatus\\" from eastern North America. Additional specimens referred to \\"Aetosaurus\\" have been found from South Africa, the Chinle Group of the southwestern United States, and the Fleming Fjord Formation of Greenland. Specimens of \\"Aetosaurus\\" occur in Norian-age strata. - Plants are mainly multicellular, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes of the kingdom Plantae. - The Late Triassic is the third and final of three epochs of the Triassic Period in the geologic timescale. The Triassic-Jurassic extinction event began during this epoch and is one of the five major mass extinction events of the Earth. The corresponding series is known as the Upper Triassic. In Europe the epoch was called the Keuper, after a German lithostratigraphic group (a sequence of rock strata) that has a roughly corresponding age. The Late Triassic spans the time between Ma and Ma (million years ago). The Late Triassic is divided into the Carnian, Norian and Rhaetian ages. - Typothoracisinae is a clade of aetosaurs within the subfamily Aetosaurinae. It is a stem-based taxon defined as all aetosaurs closer to \\"Typothorax\\" than to \\"Stagonolepis\\" or \\"Desmatosuchus\\". As with many aetosaur taxa, most of the synapomorphies that diagnose the clade are found in the osteoderms. These include a strongly acute angle of flexion between the dorsal and lateral flanges of the dorsal and lateral plates and triangular-shaped pelvic and anterior caudal dorsal lateral plates possessing semicircular borders and hook-like eminences. - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Emil Hans Willi Hennig (April 20, 1913 November 5, 1976) was a German biologist who is considered the founder of phylogenetic systematics, also known as cladistics. In 1945 as a prisoner of war, Hennig began work on his theory of cladistics, which he published in 1950. With his works on evolution and systematics he revolutionised the view of the natural order of beings. As a taxonomist, he specialised in dipterans (ordinary flies and mosquitoes). - Reptiles are tetrapod (four-limbed vertebrate) animals in the class Reptilia, comprising today's turtles, crocodilians, snakes, amphisbaenians, lizards, tuatara, and their extinct relatives. The study of these traditional reptile orders, historically combined with that of modern amphibians, is called herpetology. - In biology and genealogy, the most recent common ancestor (MRCA, also \\"last common ancestor\\" LCA, or \\"concestor\\") of any set of organisms is the most recent individual from which all organisms in a group, for are directly descended. The term is also used reference to the ancestry of groups of genes (haplotypes) rather than organisms. - In biological classification, a subfamily (Latin: ', plural ') is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, next below family but more inclusive than genus. Standard nomenclature rules end subfamily botanical names with \\"-oideae\\", and zoological names with \\"-inae\\". - In phylogenetics, apomorphy and synapomorphy refer to derived characteristic of a clade. Apomorphy implies a characteristic that is different from the form of an ancestor, i.e., an innovation, of use in determining membership in a clade. Synapomorphy is a shared derived character or trait state that distinguishes a clade from other organisms. In other words, it is an apomorphy shared by members of a monophyletic group, and thus assumed to be present in their most recent common ancestor. The word synapomorphy, coined by German entomologist Willi Hennig, is derived from the Greek words ', \\"syn\\" = shared; ', \\"apo\\" = away from; and \\"\\", \\"morphe\\" = shape.A - In zoological nomenclature, a type species (\\"species typica\\") is the species name with which the name of a genus or subgenus is considered to be permanently taxonomically associated, i.e., the species that contains the biological type specimen(s). A similar concept is used for suprageneric groups called a type genus. - Calyptosuchus (meaning \\"covered crocodile\\") is an extinct genus of crurotarsan from the Late Triassic of North America. As an aetosaur, it was heavily armored and had a pig-like snout used to uproot plants. The genus might be a junior synonym of \\"Stagonolepis\\". - A pig is any of the animals in the genus Sus, within the Suidae family of even-toed ungulates. Pigs include the domestic pig and its ancestor, the common Eurasian wild boar (\\"Sus scrofa\\"), along with other species; related creatures outside the genus include the peccary, the babirusa, and the warthog. Pigs, like all suids, are native to the Eurasian and African continents. Juvenile pigs are known as piglets. Pigs are highly social and intelligent animals. - Typothorax is an extinct genus of typothoracisine aetosaur that lived in the Late Triassic. Its remains have been found in North America. Two species are known: \\"T. coccinarum\\", the type species, and \\"T. antiquum\\". - Stagonolepis is an extinct genus of stagonolepidid aetosaur known from the Late Triassic (Carnian stage) of Europe. - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - A clade (from , \\"klados\\", \\"branch\\") is a group of organisms that consists of a common ancestor and all its lineal descendants, and represents a single \\"branch\\" on the \\"tree of life\\". - Aetosaurs (\\"aetosaur\\" ; order name \\"Aetosauria\\" ; from Greek, (aetos, \\"eagle\\") and (sauros, \\"lizard\\")) are an extinct order of heavily armoured, medium- to large-sized Late Triassic herbivorous archosaurs. They have small heads, upturned snouts, erect limbs, and a body covered by plate-like scutes. All aetosaurs belong to the family Stagonolepididae. Two distinct subdivisions of aetosaurs are currently recognized, Desmatosuchinae and Aetosaurinae, based primarily on differences in the morphology of the bony scutes of the two groups. Over 20 genera of aetosaurs have been described, and recently there has been controversy regarding the description of some of these genera.

Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules.

President Obama’s unconventional pick to lead the Interior Department — a former oil engineer and commercial banker who heads the consumer co-op Recreational Equipment Inc. (REI) — represents an effort by the administration to defuse the partisan fight over conservation and energy. Jewell, who lacks the political experience of previous interior secretaries, will be challenged to rebuild a national consensus over protecting public lands. But friends and colleagues describe her as a pragmatic business leader who could work with both parties and interest groups on all sides. Many environmentalists and oil and gas industry officials greeted her nomination with cautious optimism Wednesday, saying she could reconnect Americans to their outdoors heritage without stifling drilling and mining operations on land and off shore. Introducing her at the White House, Obama emphasized that Jewell “has spent the majority of her career outside of Washington, where, I might add, the majority of our interior is located.” She has proven, he added, that one can reconcile economic growth and environmental protection. “She knows the link between conservation and good jobs,” Obama said. “She knows that there’s no contradiction between being good stewards of the land and our economic progress; that, in fact, those two things need to go hand in hand.” Jewell, 56, who has spent most of her life in the Seattle area, is an avid climber and hiker who scaled Antarctica’s highest peak two years ago and has repeatedly climbed Washington state’s Mt. Rainier. Doug Walker, who served on the board of REI with Jewell, said she “walks the talk. . . . Sally is not fooling you here. She really does this stuff.” Walker, who chairs the board of the Wilderness Society, described Jewell as a “can-do, activist-type manager” who will focus on inspiring Americans to care about public lands. The biggest challenge that conservationists face is “really reconnecting these federal lands to the broad swatch of American people, not just elderly white people,” Walker said. Jewell has advised Republican and Democratic administrations alike on how to enlist more Americans in outdoor activities, most recently helping chart a plan for the U.S. National Park Service’s future while she served on the National Parks Second Century Commission. Obama touted his nominee’s experience working for Mobil Oil in the late 1970s and the early ’80s, noting that Jewell was a University of Washington undergraduate studying to be a dentist when she “realized her boyfriend’s homework was more interesting than hers, and she decided to become an engineer” and “went on to work in the oil fields of Oklahoma and Colorado.” Tim Wigley, president of the Western Energy Alliance, said he hoped that time in the fields would translate into expanded oil and gas drilling on federal lands. “We hope to see a better balance of productive development on non-park, non-wilderness public lands that enhances the wealth of America and creates jobs while protecting the environment,” he said. 1 of 26 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Obama’s second term: Who’s in, who’s out?

Here is how the second-term team is shaping up. Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue. Jewell also won praise from former interior secretary Dirk Kempthorne, who enlisted her in multiple brainstorming sessions in Shepherdstown, W.Va., when he led the department under President George W. Bush. “She was always someone I wanted there because she’s a catalyst,” Kempthorne said, adding that he didn’t even know her party affiliation. He said she was well suited to manage Interior’s “vast portfolio,” which includes Indian lands and offshore drilling, “because she is effective and time-tested on taking a variety of issues, deciphering them, determining what is the most important and making a decision.” A few voices within the Republican Party and the environmental community expressed hesi­ta­tion Wednesday, noting that Jewell’s limited political résumémade it difficult to pass judgment. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), the top Republican on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she “looked forward to hearing about the qualifications Ms. Jewell has that make her a suitable candidate to run such an important agency and how she plans to restore balance to the Interior Department.” Bill Snape, senior counsel for the advocacy group Center for Biological Diversity, wrote in an e-mail that he and his colleagues “are hopeful but not yet joining the love fest. She has her work cut out for her and our public lands are not a publicly-traded commodity on Wall Street.” Outdoor Industry Association President Frank Hugelmeyer said the move shows that the president has recognized the true economic value of outdoor recreation. Hugelmeyer estimated that it generates 646 billion in annual direct consumer spending and 6.1 million direct jobs. “No one sees it as unusual when a Treasury secretary comes out of the investment banking world,” he said. “I think it’s way overdue.” If confirmed, Jewell would take over at a time when many conservationists are pressing Obama to take bolder action on land conservation. Interior Secretary Ken Salazar devoted much of his tenure to promoting renewable energy on public land and managing the 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill. On Tuesday, former interior secretary Bruce Babbitt gave a speech at the National Press Club in which he called on the president to set aside one acre permanently for conservation for every acre he leases for oil and gas development. “So far, under President Obama, industry has been winning the race as it obtains more and more land for oil and gas,” Babbitt said. “Over the past four years, the industry has leased more than 6 million acres, compared with only 2.6 million acres permanently protected. In the Obama era, land conservation is again falling behind.” Fran Ulmer, a former lieutenant governor of Alaska who serves on the board of the National Parks Conservation Association with Jewell, said the nominee was skilled at helping “people get to a common solution” and tended “to take the long view” on public-lands issues. “She’s going to ask the question, not what’s in the best interest today but what’s in the interest in the long term, and I think that will have implications for energy policy and public-lands management,” Ulmer said, “I’d say in a good way.” As a member of the University of Washington’s Board of Regents, Jewell is also familiar with navigating difficult budget issues. The university’s president, Michael Young, said that even as board members struggled with a loss of state funding and subsequent tuition increases, “Sally was a remarkably steady voice in steering through that. She’s a great manager: very levelheaded, very clear-eyed, with the capacity to keep her focus on the ultimate goal.” And Walker said that although Jewell is somewhat wary of entering the political fray, she’s “in essence willing to sacrifice everything” to take on the challenge. “It’s not like she’s running for something else,” he said. “This is the culmination of what she wants to do.” At the White House on Wednesday, Jewell joked about the challenge before her. “I’m going to do my best to fill those big boots of yours,” Jewell said to Salazar, prompting a round of laughter, “but I think I might get lost in your hat.” Eddy J. Palanzo contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The President held meetings with leaders in the health care industry to discuss ways to control costs and improve workforce health.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump on Monday declared he has an \\"absolute right\\" to pardon himself and then also tweeted his assertion that the federal government investigation into ties between his 2016 election campaign and Russia is \\"totally unconstitutional.\\" While Trump has frequently ignored established norms and challenged the understood limits of presidential powers, his latest comments are viewed by some legal scholars as unprecedented and testing constitutional boundaries. \\"I was shocked\\" by Trump’s tweets, said Susan Low Bloch, a law professor at Georgetown University. \\"No president has ever tried it,\\" she told VOA News. \\"It’s unlikely the president can pardon himself. I think the court would say no\\" and if he did give himself a pardon, \\"most congresses would impeach him.\\" Bloch also notes when most people accept a pardon \\"it’s an admission of guilt,\\" thus it would be a bad idea for Trump to pursue such a course of action. The professor, who has testified before the Senate on whether a president can be indicted and tried while in office, says the special counsel is \\"absolutely constitutional.\\" Another constitutional scholar, Keith Whittington at Princeton University, said, \\"I think it is important to note that the president’s comments reference serious arguments that are being debated by legal scholars, but these are difficult and unusual constitutional questions that would ultimately be answered in the courts.\\" According to Northwestern University Law Professor Andrew Koppelman, \\"Trump's position on pardons is consistent with the Constitution's text, but inconsistent with the overall structure.

Options: - street - forest - tree - yard - park Explain why a human would choose \\"street\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"street\\" as the answer to the question of where a brave squirrel would be found because it demonstrates the qualities that are commonly associated with bravery, such as facing danger and unusual challenges, adapting to unfamiliar surroundings, and overcoming various obstacles. Firstly, streets tend to be more dangerous for squirrels compared to other environments like forests or parks. Squirrels have to deal with vehicles and other urban hazards, which can pose significant threats to their safety. Thus, the level of danger for a squirrel in a street environment is high, requiring extraordinary courage to navigate such a scene. A brave squirrel might be found thriving in this type of environment, as they would be displaying the fearlessness to face numerous dangers that a typical squirrel would possibly shy away from. Secondly, the urban landscape of a street reflects an environment that a squirrel would need to adapt to in order to survive. Streets are usually densely populated with human establishments, making them a less than ideal habitat for squirrels. In addition, the lack of natural resources, such as trees and greenery, could prove challenging for a squirrel typically accustomed to wooded areas. A brave squirrel would adapt to these unfamiliar surroundings and learn new skills to overcome the challenges that come with living in a street environment, which further epitomizes its bravery. Lastly, streets have various obstacles and distractions that squirrels need to confront. These may include navigating around humans and animals, dealing with noise pollution and traffic, and finding food in an area where natural resources might be scarce. This requires a level of boldness and resourcefulness that one might associate with a brave squirrel, as they have to display resilience and determination in order to survive in such an environment. In conclusion, a human might choose \\"street\\" as the answer to the question because a brave squirrel would likely encounter numerous challenges and dangers within this context, requiring extraordinary courage and adaptability to thrive. The street environment also pushes the squirrel to develop new skills and enhance their resourcefulness, illustrating a level of bravery that exceeds that of a squirrel found in a more natural and accommodating environment like a forest or park."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His books and stories have been bestsellers in Japan as well as internationally, with his work being translated into 50 languages and selling millions of copies outside his native country. The critical acclaim for his fiction and non-fiction has led to numerous awards, in Japan and internationally, including the World Fantasy Award (2006) and the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award (2006). His oeuvre received, for example, the Franz Kafka Prize (2006) and the Jerusalem Prize (2009). Most of Haruki Murakami's works use first-person narrative in the tradition of the Japanese I Novel. He states that because family plays a significant role in traditional Japanese literature, any main character who is independent becomes a man who values freedom and solitude over intimacy. Also notable is Murakami's unique humor, as seen in his 2000 short story collection, After the Quake. In the story \\"Superfrog Saves Tokyo\\", the protagonist is confronted with a 6-foot tall frog that talks about the destruction of Tokyo over a cup of tea. In spite of the story's sober tone, Murakami feels the reader should be entertained once the seriousness of a subject has been broached. Another notable feature of Murakami's stories are the comments that come from the main characters as to how strange the story presents itself. Murakami explains that his characters experience what he experiences as he writes, which could be compared to a movie set where the walls and props are all fake. Many of his novels have themes and titles that invoke classical music, such as the three books making up The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle: The Thieving Magpie (after Rossini's opera), Bird as Prophet (after a piano piece by Robert Schumann usually known in English as The Prophet Bird), and The Bird-Catcher (a character in Mozart's opera The Magic Flute). Some of his novels take their titles from songs: Dance, Dance, Dance (after The Dells' 1957 B-side song, although it is often thought it was titled after the Beach Boys' 1964 tune), Norwegian Wood (after The Beatles' song) and South of the Border, West of the Sun (after the song \\"South of the Border\\"). Some analyses see aspects of shamanism in his writing. In a 2000 article, Susan Fisher connected Japanese folk religion or Japanese shamanism with some elements of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, such as a descent into a dry well. At an October 2013 symposium held at the University of Hawaii, associate professor of Japanese Nobuko Ochner opined \\"there were many descriptions of traveling in a parallel world as well as characters who have some connection to shamanism\\" in Murakami's works. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What themes are in his writing?","completion":"Haruki Murakami's writing often encompasses themes such as the importance of freedom and solitude, unusual humor, surrealism, and elements inspired by classical music. In his works, independent main characters are portrayed as valuing freedom and solitude over intimacy, reflecting the influences of traditional Japanese literature where family plays a significant role. Murakami's unique sense of humor is another prominent theme, as he believes that readers should be entertained even while addressing serious subjects. Furthermore, many of his stories contain surreal elements, where characters experience strange situations. Classical music is also frequently referenced in his novels, with some of them having titles and themes invoking well-known compositions.

Write highlights for this article: Britain is bracing itself for a lashing from the elements when the driest month on record is set to be blown away by 70mph winds and heavy rain this weekend. But it has been a case of the calm before the storm today with much of the country basking in the warm conditions and clear skies - and some stunning sunsets across parts of the South. The spectacular summery weather is set to come to a dramatic end, however, with forecasters predicting that dismal conditions will settle in over the next few days. Scroll down for video. Calm before the storm: Two men enjoy what could be the last of the glorious Indian Summer weather as they take a row on the River Cam in Cambridge this morning. Forecasters have predicted dismal conditions over the next few days, but much of Britain has been enjoying the glorious weather that typified much of September. This stunning scene was captured across Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire last night, but the sun is also setting on the glorious weather with up to 60mm of rain falling in a matter of hours in some parts. Sunlight bursts through the mist over Corfe Castle in Dorset. Despite the settled weather in the last few dayts, the The Met Office has said that downpours over the next few days could lead to surface water flooding. Up to 60mm of rain could fall in a matter of hours while severe gales of up to 70mph are set to batter parts of the north with temperatures plunging by 10C. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. It is also likely to finish in the top five warmest Septembers. The Met Office warned severe gales with gusts of up to 70mph were possible in north-west Scotland in a yellow 'be aware' alert. The sun sets over Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire in a picture taken from Dunstable Downs. Severe weather warnings of rain are in place for parts of the north and west of Britain today and tomorrow. Picturesque: This autumnal scene was captured at Sycamore Gap along Hadrian's Wall last night. The grim forecast comes days after early figures indicated last month is set to be the driest September across the UK since records began in 1910. With the sun shinging and beneath clear blue skies, a man enjoys the fine weather as he walks his dog along the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Despite the dire weather forecast, these four girls found it warm enough today to paddle in the sea at the beach in Hastings, East Sussex. Fine day for a walk: The surface of the water sparkles in the October sun today as a man walks his dog along the shore at Hastings. The Chief Forecaster's assessment said: 'Although such wind speeds are not unusual across these areas of Scotland, the contrast with the recent quiet weather means that a few minor impacts may occur.' A yellow warning for rain was also issued with 'heavy and persistent' downpours predicted in parts of southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England and Wales from Friday afternoon until Saturday morning. Forecasters said between 20mm (0.8in) and 40mm (1.6in) could fall 'quite widely' across the warning area, while some places could see more than 60mm (2.4in) with much of the rain falling within a few hours. Making a splash: A 'super-pod' of more than a thousand dolphins was spotted off the coast of pembrokeshire - as they swim further inland to feed and raise their young. Experts at The Sea Trust counted the mass off the Pembrokeshire coast in the Bristol Channel. They say the pod is at least a thousand strong but admit it could be an under-estimate as they are impossible to keep track of. Sailing volunteers on the boat 'Cartlett Lady' were surrounded for nearly three hours by 'wall to wall' dolphins as they surveyed a 35 mile stretch. The Met Office said the downpours could lead to surface water flooding, saying: 'The public should be aware of the potential for some localised impacts to travel due to surface water flooding.' It said the high pressure which settled over Britain and protected it from Atlantic depressions in September is in the process of moving - and making room for conditions more in keeping with October. Drivers are being warned of the risk of flash flooding. A man heads out early to the banks o the River Cam in Cambridgeshire for some fishing. Rain is set to sweep in over the South and East of England tomorrow morning. A team of rowers head out for an early morning row on the River Cam while a thin blanket of mist covers the trees in the back ground. The calm scenes are set to come to an end when an Atlantic front moves in across Britain. Enjoy it while it lasts: Temperatures across Britain have remained above average for the beginning of October - but the mercury could plummet by 10C in some parts with the glorious conditions expected to come to an end tomorrow. Forecasters say the high pressure that settled over Britain for much of September is finally moving away and wetter and cooler conditions are set to return. Temperatures could take a plunge in the next few days with forecasters predicting a return to conditions more in keeping with average October weather. University rowers take a breather during an early morning practice session on the River Cam. The scene is a sharp contrast to the weather predicted over the next few days. A cyclist is pictured riding along the banks of the River Cam in Cambridgeshire this morning. Temperatures topped 20C in some parts of Britain today. The sun shines through the trees along the banks of the River Cam as two women enjoy a morning row. Wet weather is set to sweep in from tonight. Darron Burness, head of the AA's flood rescue team, said: 'It's a case of \\"change of month, change of weather\\". 'After precious little rain in September, autumn will fall sharply into focus tomorrow as it turns wet and windy across many areas. 'While river catchments may well be able to take this volume of water after the very dry September, a lot may fall within 12 to 24 hours, so flash flooding is likely to be the main issue for drivers in the affected areas. Dark clouds gather from the coast off Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire this afternoon with Scotland's Indian summer looking over for the time being after severe winds and rain battered much of the north last night and into this morning. Scotland and northern England is expected to see winds gusting up to 70mph as the fine spell of weather finally comes to an end. 'Be wary of places where water may accumulate; for instance, dips in the road and under bridges. 'In dark, wet conditions, it can be extremely difficult to distinguish between a road that's flooded and one that is simply very wet until it's too late. 'Tomorrow evening's rush hour could be particularly affected, so allow a bit more time if you're heading away for the weekend, and check your car's lights and wiper blades.' Highlights:","completion":"1. After enjoying the driest month on record and warm weather, the UK is set to face heavy rain and winds up to 70mph this weekend. 2. The Met Office has issued a yellow \\"be aware\\" alert for severe gales, which could batter the northwest of Scotland. 3. Southern Scotland, Northern Ireland, northern England, and Wales are expected to see heavy downpours, raising concerns of surface water flooding. 4. The drastic change in weather comes as the high pressure system that protected the UK from harsher conditions moves, making way for typical October weather. 5. Drivers are urged to be cautious due to the risk of flash flooding as the nation's Indian summer comes to an end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life. Her name is not common, but every so often I meet people with the same name and ask them if they know of a relative to whom this happened, but, so far, no-one has known of her. Question: The narrating nurse probably believes that: Answer: Available choices: [1]. Connie was worth defending before she took action. [2]. not enough information. [3].

Dave Heaton of PopMatters said that the group \\"[uses] lyrics to convey ideas while using them for the pleasurable way the words sound.\\" The lyrics of the 2006 compilation Fab Four Suture, contains themes of war, governments that suppress freedom, and \\"the powerlessness that everyday people feel in the face of it all\\", in contrast to \\"humans [working] together, [treating] each other like people, and [pushing] for governments that would do the same.\\" Lætitia Sadier, who writes the group's lyrics, was influenced by both the Situationist philosophy Society of the Spectacle by Marxist theorist Guy Debord, and her anger towards the Iraq War. The Surrealist, as well as the Situationist cultural and political movements were also influences, as stated by Sadier and Gane in a 1999 Salon interview.Critics have seen Marxist allusions in the band's lyrics, and have gone so far as to call the band members themselves Marxist. Music journalist Simon Reynolds commented that Sadier's lyrics tend to lean towards Marxist social commentary rather than \\"affairs of the heart\\". The 1994 single \\"Ping Pong\\" has been put forward as evidence in regard to these alleged views.

Samantha also tells him that Nicole wants the diamonds as well and tells him to meet her under a bridge. Just then, one of Isaac's henchmen shows up, and Samantha kills him after much effort. Wes is frightened, and leaves. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person the agent tries to talk into writing a sequel is Wilson.

Write an article based on this \\"Dundee and Ross County drew a blank in their Scottish Premiership meeting at Dens Park.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: \\"Dundee FC and Ross County Battle to a Standstill at Dens Park in Scottish Premiership Clash\\" In the Scottish Premiership, the intense meeting between Dundee Football Club and Ross County at Dens Park ended with no decisive victory. The teams drew a blank in the much-anticipated bout, leaving both the fans and players feeling a mix of relief and disappointment. Dundee, wearing their traditional dark blue, had the home advantage, having the backing from the legion of loyal fans at Dens Park. Despite the support, they struggled to find a breakthrough in a frustrating 90-minute battle against Ross County. The latter, represented by their iconic red and navy uniforms, demonstrated their tenacity through a sturdy defence, neutralizing Dundee's attack effectively. The opening minutes of the match showed promise, with both teams displaying an eagerness to establish an early lead. Dundee's forward paced up and down the field, with a couple of close moments that could've tipped the scales in their favor. However, Ross County's goalkeeper exhibited immaculate performance, thwarting the several attempts with exceptional saves. The latter's defense was uncannily reliable, a crucial factor in the resultant draw. On the other hand, Ross County, though equally thwarted by Dundee's resilient goalkeeper, displayed some impressive footwork and strategic attacking plays. Their midfield was a sight to behold, though unfortunately for them, Dundee's defense held firm, refusing to allow them a clear shot at their posts. The first half was a frustrating segment of the match, with both teams creating opportunities but failing to convert any into a lead. The brinkmanship on display offered a thrilling yet somewhat agonizing watching experience for the spectators. Multiple shots on goal from both sides were blocked or veered wide, leaving the scoreboard untouched as the halftime whistle blew. As they emerged from the tunnel for the second part of the clash, the determination in the player's eyes was evident. Both Dundee FC and Ross County remained resolute in their resolve to break the deadlock. The second half mirrored the first, with both teams battling fiercely but failing to find the net. The closing minutes of the game saw an intensely aggressive performance from both sides. Efforts were redoubled as they made a desperate final bid to score. Despite several close calls, the goal remained elusive. The final whistle confirmed the undeniable outcome of the encounter - a goalless draw. In the aftermath, both Dundee and Ross County would feel a blend of satisfaction and disappointment. The former would be pleased with their defensive showing and, equally, frustration at a lack of corresponding offensive success. In contrast, Ross County can be proud of their performance away from home, holding their ground at Dens Park. This goalless standoff between Dundee FC and Ross County at the iconic Dens Park shows the immense competition within the Scottish Premiership. Furthermore, it highlights the skill level within these teams, with both defenses deserving credit for their determined performances. Despite the lack of goals, this match was far from uneventful, displaying an array of twists and turns, hard tackles, near misses, and splendid saves. The performance will undoubtedly spark conversation and raise questions about both teams' strategies and tactics for the remainder of the season. It's clear, however, that both Dundee and Ross County have shown they're not to be underestimated, proving yet again that in the Scottish Premiership, it's always a battle to the end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A man wearing a red life-vest is sitting in a canoe on a body of water. Hypothesis: The man in the canoe had lost his paddle .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the given premise, we cannot definitively conclude the given hypothesis. The premise states that a man wearing a red life-vest is sitting in a canoe on a body of water, which provides us with some information about the scene. However, this information is insufficient in helping us determine whether the man has lost his paddle or not. In order to analyze the situation in a more comprehensive manner, we need to consider other possibilities and information. For instance, we could examine the following scenarios: 1. The man is purposefully not using the paddle: It is possible that the man is taking a break, resting, or simply enjoying the view and tranquility of the surrounding environment. In this case, he might have kept the paddle inside the canoe or nearby, and we would not be able to conclude that he has lost his paddle. 2. The man is using an alternative method to propel the canoe: While paddles are the most common way to maneuver a canoe, there is a chance that this person is using an alternative method, such as a small motor or even a creative DIY solution. Again, in this case, it would be incorrect to conclude that the man has lost his paddle. 3. The man is intentionally not using a paddle: The man could be engaged in an activity that doesn't require a paddle, such as fishing, bird watching, or photography. In this scenario, the canoe is simply a means of transportation or a platform from which to perform his chosen activity. Thus, we cannot jump to the conclusion that he has lost his paddle. 4. The man is in a state of distress: It is possible that the man is experiencing some sort of emergency or crisis, such as being injured, ill, or entangled in aquatic plants, which prevents him from using the paddle. In this case, we cannot be sure whether he has lost his paddle or if he is simply unable to use it due to these circumstances. 5. The man has indeed lost his paddle: Admittedly, it is possible that the man has indeed lost his paddle and is currently stranded on the water without a means to propel his canoe. However, we cannot simply assume this scenario is accurate without considering other potential situations and additional information. In conclusion, while the hypothesis might be a possibility, we cannot confidently say that it is accurate based solely on the given premise. As the provided information is insufficient in deducing the paddle's status, we may need to gather more evidence or context regarding the situation before making a definitive conclusion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there are some minor differences and alterations in word choices and wording that can be further analyzed. 1. Original sentence: She worked on processes of chemical extraction of metal complexes and described the chemical and physical properties of solvent species in an organic solvent. 2. Paraphrase: It worked on solvent extraction processes of metal complexes and described the chemical and physical properties of chemical species in an organic solvent. Here is a detailed comparison of the two sentences: - Subject: The first sentence uses \\"She\\" as the subject, referring to a female individual. In contrast, the paraphrase uses \\"It,\\" which appears to refer to a neutral entity or a potentially non-human subject. The change from a human subject to a neutral subject might alter the context and lead to ambiguity regarding the entity performing the research. - Action: In both sentences, the action remains the same – working on extraction processes and describing properties. - Object: The object of the sentences is the extraction processes of metal complexes. In the original sentence, it is mentioned as \\"processes of chemical extraction of metal complexes,\\" while the paraphrase describes it as \\"solvent extraction processes of metal complexes.\\" The word \\"chemical\\" is omitted from the paraphrase. However, the meaning remains the same since solvent extraction is a chemical process. - Purpose: The purpose of the actions in both sentences is to describe the chemical and physical properties of the species in an organic solvent. In the first sentence, it is specifically mentioned as \\"solvent species,\\" while the paraphrase uses the term \\"chemical species.\\" Although this change slightly alters the specificity, the overall purpose remains the same. In summary, both sentences are paraphrases that convey the same message despite having different word choices and structures. However, the change in the subject from \\"She\\" to \\"It\\" might lead to ambiguity regarding the entity performing the action."},{"prompt":"Question: What is the full name of the person who reportedly said he was 'Sick up to here with it,\\" according to a review in Melody Maker? Answer the above question based on the context below: The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

He said, as a result, it would be an area often patrolled by the police. The security alert began following a call to a charity. The caller said a device had been fired at a police patrol, but had failed to explode. Officers found a suspicious object and evacuated families from homes in Victoria Street. However, while police officers were searching the area a second device went off. The explosion happened between 16:00 and 17:00 BST. Police said on Sunday that the devices they recovered \\"appeared to have been planted\\" and they did not believe any device was fired at them. Police officers were also attacked with petrol bombs and bricks during the security alert.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- The most eagerly anticipated animated film this year hits big screens this weekend, as \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" opens worldwide. The Screening Room spoke to creator Matt Groening and writer Al Jean in London about everyone's favorite two-dimensional yellow family. Simpsons supremo Matt Groening with his creations at the film's premiere in Springfield, Vermont Matt Groening told the Screening Room that fans had driven the demand for the movie. \\"We've had fans clamoring for a movie for the past 18 years,\\" he said. The film has taken four years to come to fruition, as writer Al Jean explained. \\"What really held us up for a long time was to have enough people to do the show and the movie,\\" he said. \\"We talked for a while about doing the movie after the show is done, but the show is never done! So it really started in earnest in 2003, when we started working on this story that became the movie.\\" Technology has also played its part. Jean continued, \\"The technology to do this film really wasn't even around five years ago. For example, there was this joke I once pitched and David Silverman, the director, started drawing and as I was pitching it, it went into the film and it was cut a day later. To go from pitch to cut in two days is pretty impressive.\\" Its creators hope that \\"The Simpsons Movie\\" will both satisfy long-term fans and bring Homer and Marge's family to a new audience. Groening told the Screening Room, \\"This movie is designed to both honor the people who have loved the show all this time, so there's lots of little details for them in the movie, little characters and stuff who they know and love, but we also want people who don't know the family to not be completely confused. It is a complete movie experience, but again, we have a lot of little details that only the really, true die-hard fans are going to get.\\" And fans can expect to be entertained by plenty of cartoon mishaps. Groening said, \\"When you see somebody fall off the roof in a live-action film, it's funny -- we all love it. But it's not as funny as when Homer falls off the roof.

Screw the collar and pipes back in place.","completion":"Sure, let's talk about this as if we're making a sand pie. Can you imagine that? First, we want to make our sand pie in something like a bowl, right? But in this case, our bowl is the big tank for the pool sand filter. Somehow, the hole (drain plug we call it) on the bottom of the 'bowl' came off. So, we need to put it back, just like if a piece fell off your toy, you'd want to put it back on. Now, we come to the stuff we fill into our 'bowl'. If we're making a sand pie, what do we need most? Yes, sand! So, we need lots of 'special' sand called pool silica sand. We need to pour that into the 'bowl' or the big tank. After doing that, we will pretend we're at the beach. What would a sand pie be without water? Boring, right? So, we'll fill the tank with water up to where the sand reaches. We'll have our sand nice and watery now. Next, we take a tiny circle band - it's called an O-ring that goes on the pool filter's valve (that's like a door that controls water flow). Now, this O-ring needs to be slippery to work properly. It's like when we use some soap on our slide to make it extra slippery. But we can't use soap here, we'll use a special slippery stuff called a multipurpose lubricant. With the O-ring now all slippery, we can put it back on the valve. The valve, our water control door, then attaches to our 'bowl' or tank. Think of it like adding a door to your sandcastle. Last, we have the collar and pipes, let's think of those as the crown and scepter of our sand kingdom. We don't want those to get lost or disconnected, so we secure them properly in their places, by screwing them back together. And, just like that, we've fixed our big pool water filter!

Answer the following question: What does a child learn to do in a lake? - become adult - row boat - drive - go out to play - begin school The best answer is Answer:","completion":"A child can learn various skills and engage in numerous recreational activities in a lake. Among the options provided, the best answer is learning to row a boat and going out to play. Here's a breakdown of each activity: 1. Become adult: Growing up and becoming an adult is a natural process that happens over time. A lake doesn't directly contribute to this process. However, a child can surely learn important life lessons and skills near a lake, which contribute to their maturity as they grow older. 2. Row a boat: Learning to row a boat is an excellent skill for a child to develop at a lake. Rowing a boat offers numerous benefits such as enhancing coordination, improving strength, and teaching teamwork, as well as offering a fun outdoor activity. It also promotes a sense of independence while allowing the child to learn how to navigate through water safely. 3. Drive: A child cannot learn to drive a car in a lake. Driving requires a proper instructor, dry land, and adherence to safety and legal regulations. However, a child may learn to operate small watercraft, such as kayaks or paddle boats, under adult supervision. 4. Go out to play: A lake offers a wonderful environment for a child to engage in outdoor recreational activities and play. Swimming, fishing, kayaking, and building sandcastles are just a few examples of fun activities a child can enjoy at a lake. Playing outdoors can help a child develop important physical, social, and cognitive skills, as well as fostering a connection to nature and an appreciation for the environment. 5. Begin school: A lake is not a formal educational institution; therefore, a child cannot start school at a lake. However, spending time at a lake may offer valuable learning opportunities and introduce them to various aspects of nature, animal and plant life, and water ecosystems. In conclusion, a lake provides a great environment for a child to learn skills such as rowing a boat and going out to play, while also offering opportunities to explore nature, develop physical abilities, and create lifelong memories. Although some activities mentioned may not be directly related to a lake, it is essential to recognize that a child's experiences at a lake can contribute to their overall growth and development."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If your difference in perspective causes friction between you, don't let it bubble away silently. As with any tension in a relationship, it's unlikely to disappear if you don't address it openly. Can we draw the following conclusion? The main subject of this article is politics.","completion":"No, the main subject of this article is not politics. The primary topic discussed in the provided information is about maintaining a successful relationship between an atheist and a theist. It emphasizes the importance of open communication, specifically in addressing differences in perspective that might arise due to the distinction in their beliefs. In order to address your initial question more comprehensively, here is a detailed answer regarding how to make an atheist and theist relationship work: 1. Maintain open communication: As mentioned earlier, it is crucial to encourage honest and open conversations about your differences in belief and any impact they may have on your relationship. By discussing these issues openly, both partners are better equipped to address any tension and find workable solutions. 2. Respect each other's beliefs: It is essential for both the atheist and the theist in a relationship to respect each other's beliefs, even if they do not agree. Taking the time to understand the rationale, experiences, and emotions behind those beliefs can help promote empathy and compassion in the relationship. 3. Define common values and goals: Despite the differences in religious beliefs, couples often find they still share many values or goals, such as kindness, honesty, or striving for personal growth. Identifying these shared values can help build a foundation that excellent compatibility supersedes even the most significant differences in personal belief. 4. Establish boundaries: Both partners should set boundaries when it comes to discussing each other's beliefs and engaging in religious practices. It is vital to create an environment where both parties can express their views without feeling attacked or belittled. 5. Support each other's individuality: In a healthy relationship, partners need to support each other's personal growth, interests, and expressions of identity, even when they do not align with their own beliefs. Empowering each other's individuality will create a positive atmosphere where both partners feel valued and loved. 6. Learn from each other: The differences in perspective and belief systems can provide an opportunity to learn about other ways of seeing the world. By engaging in open discussions and sharing experiences, you may gain new insights and develop a greater appreciation for the complexity and diversity of human beliefs. 7. Foster mutual understanding: It is essential to realize that a lasting and healthy relationship involves understanding, support, and acceptance of differences. Both partners should strive for a deeper understanding of one another's outlook and respect the unique experiences, beliefs, and thoughts that shape who they are. 8. Seek external support, if needed: Sometimes, couples might benefit from seeking the guidance of a relationship therapist or a support group for interfaith couples. These resources can provide valuable insights and coping strategies to navigate the complexities of an atheist and theist relationship. In summary, the main subject of this article is not politics but rather creating harmonious relationships between atheists and theists by cultivating open communication, respecting each other's beliefs, and adopting a supportive and nurturing attitude towards individuality and growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands. Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies. Which river didn't have a food source mostly derived from algae? Answer:","completion":"The Olt River, being a fast moving river, would be less likely to have a food source mostly derived from algae as the faster currents and turbulence make it harder for algae to grow and establish. The slower moving and deeper Mures River would be more suitable for algae growth, forming a significant part of its food source."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Brown was the fourth of five children. During Brown's childhood, mob violence periodically erupted in Mineola, keeping African- Americans from voting. His first job was a shoeshine boy in a whites-only barber shop. In 1995, Brown ran for Mayor of San Francisco. In his announcement speech, Brown said San Francisco needed a \\"resurrection\\" and that he would bring the \\"risk-taking leadership\\" the city needed. Brown placed first in the first round of voting, but because no candidate received 50 percent of the vote, he ran against incumbent Frank Jordan in the December runoff. Brown gained the support of Supervisor Roberta Achtenberg who had placed third in the first round of voting. Brown campaigned on working to address poverty and problems with Muni. He called Jordan the \\"inept bumbler\\" and criticized his leadership. Jordan criticized Brown for his relations with special interests during his time in the State Assembly. Brown easily defeated Jordan in the runoff. Brown's inaugural celebration included an open invitation party with 10,000 attendees and local restaurants providing 10,000 meals to the homeless. President Bill Clinton called Brown to congratulate him, and the congratulations were broadcast to the crowd. He delivered his inaugural address without notes and led the orchestra in \\"Stars and Stripes Forever\\". He arrived at the event in a horse-drawn carriage. According to the New York Times, Brown was one of the nation's few liberal big city mayors when he was elected in 1996. In 1996, more than two thirds of San Franciscans approved of Brown's job performance. As mayor, Brown made several appearances on national talk shows. Brown called for expansions to the San Francisco budget to provide for new employees and programs. In 1999, Brown proposed hiring 1,392 new city workers and proposed a second straight budget with a US100 million surplus. He helped to oversee the settling of a two-day garbage strike in April 1997. During Brown's tenure, San Francisco's budget increased to US5.2 billion and the city added 4,000 new employees. Brown tried to develop a plan for universal health care, but there wasn't enough in the budget to do so. Brown put in long days as mayor, scheduling days of solid meetings and, at times, conducting two meetings at the same time. Brown opened City Hall on Saturdays to answer questions. He would later claim of his mayorship that he helped restore the city's spirit and pride. Brown's opponents in his 1999 mayoral reelection campaign were former Mayor Frank Jordan and Clint Reilly. They criticized Brown for spending the city's US1 billion in budget growth without addressing the city's major problems and creating an environment in city hall of corruption and patronage. Tom Ammiano was a late write-in candidate and he faced Brown in the runoff election. Brown won reelection by a 20 percent margin. He was supported by most major developers and business interests. Ammiano campaigned on a promise that he would raise the minimum wage to US11 per hour and scrutinize corporate business taxes. Brown repeatedly claimed that Ammiano would raise taxes. President Clinton recorded a telephone message on Brown's behalf. Brown's campaign spent US3.1 million to Ammiano's US300,000. The 1999 mayoral race was the subject of the documentary See How They Run. One of Brown's central campaign promises was his \\"100-Day Plan for Muni,\\" in which he boasted he would fix the city's municipal bus system in that many days. Brown supported the \\"Peer Pressure\\" Bus Patrol program, which paid former gang members and troubled youth to patrol Muni buses. Brown claimed the program helped reduce crime. He fired Muni chief Phil Adams and replaced him with his chief of staff Emilio Cruz. In 1998, Brown was Mayor during the summer of the Muni meltdown as Muni implemented the new ATC system and Brown promised riders there would be better times ahead. A voter approved initiative in the following year would help improve Muni services. Brown increased Muni's budget by tens of millions of dollars over his tenure. Brown later said he made a mistake in over promising with his 100-Day Plan. Brown helped mediate a settlement to the 1997 BART strike. During his first term as mayor, Brown quietly favored the demolition and abolition of the Transbay Terminal to accommodate the redevelopment of the site for market-rate housing. Centrally located at First and Mission Streets near the Financial District and South Beach, the terminal originally served as the San Francisco terminus for the electric commuter trains of the East Bay Electric Lines, the Key System of streetcars and the Sacramento Northern railroads which ran on the lower deck of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. Following the termination of streetcar service in 1958, the terminal has seen continuous service as a major bus facility for East Bay commuters; AC Transit buses transport riders from the terminal directly into neighborhoods throughout the inner East Bay. The terminal also serves passengers traveling to San Mateo County and the North Bay aboard SamTrans and Golden Gate Transit buses respectively, and to tourists arriving by bus motorcoach. Today, the terminal is being planned for redevelopment as a region wide mass transit hub maintaining the current bus services, but with a new tunnel that would extend the Caltrain commuter rail line from its current terminus at Fourth and Townsend Streets to the site. Once completed, Caltrain riders would no longer need to transfer to Muni in order to reach the downtown financial district. Additionally, the heavy rail portion of the terminal would be designed to accommodate the planned High Speed Rail lines to Los Angeles. In 1998, The Berkeley, California-based Bicycle Civil Liberties Union, produced a two-hour documentary film in the muckraker journalism tradition, July 25: The Secret is Out, which gives evidence of Brown's designs for the Transbay Terminal site. Allegations of political patronage followed Brown from the State Legislature through his tenure as San Francisco mayor. Former Los Angeles County GOP Assemblyman Paul Horcher, who voted in 1994 to keep Brown as Speaker, was reassigned to a position with a six-figure salary as head San Francisco's solid waste management program. Brian Setencich also was appointed to a position by Brown. Both were hired as special assistants after losing their assembly seats because of their support of Brown. Former San Francisco Supervisor Bill Maher was also hired as a special assistant after campaigning for Brown in his first mayoral race. Brown is also criticized for favoritism to Ms. Carpeneti, the lobbyist with whom he had a child. In 1998 Brown arranged for Carpeneti to obtain a rent-free office in the city-owned Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. Between then and 2003, a period that spans the birth of their daughter, Carpeneti was paid an estimated 2.33 million by nonprofit groups and political committees controlled by then Mayor Brown and his friends. Brown increased the city's special assistants payroll from US15.6 to US45.6 million between 1995 and 2001. Between April 29, 2001 and May 3, 2001, San Francisco Chronicle reporters Lance Williams and Chuck Finnie released a five-part story concerning Brown and his relations with city contractors, lobbyists, and city appointments and hires he had made during his tenure as Mayor. The report concluded that there was an appearance of favoritism and conflicts of interest in the awarding of city contracts and development deals, a perception that large contracts had an undue influence on city hall, and patronage with the hiring of campaign workers, contributors, legislative colleagues, and friends to government positions. The Federal Bureau of Investigation investigated Brown when he was Speaker. One investigation was a sting operation concerning a fake fish company attempting to bribe Brown; he was not charged with any criminal act. The FBI further investigated Brown from 1998 to 2003 over his appointees at the Airport Commission for potential conflicts of interests. Brown friend, contributor, and former law client, Charlie Walker was given a share of city contracts. He had served jail time in 1984 for violating laws concerning minority contracting. The FBI also investigated Brown's approval of expansion of Sutro Tower and SFO. Scott Company, with one prominent Brown backer, was accused of using a phony minority front company to secure an airport construction project. Robert Nurisso was sentenced to house arrest. During Brown's administration, there were two convictions of city officials tied to Brown. The FBI investigated Brown's friend Charlie Walker, who won several city contracts. Walker had previously thrown several parties for Brown and was among his biggest fund raisers. Brown reassigned Parking and Traffic chief Bill Maher to an airport job when his critics claimed Maher should have been fired. Brown put his former girlfriend, Wendy Linka, on the city payroll, as well as having appointed another former girlfriend and current U.S. Senator from California, Kamala Harris, to two California State boards in 1994. Brown was known for his strong loyalty to his supporters.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who was hired as special assistants?","completion":"Former Los Angeles County GOP Assemblyman Paul Horcher and Brian Setencich were hired as special assistants after losing their assembly seats because of their support of Brown.

What was the operational squadron number of the Dambusters?","completion":"The operational squadron number of the Dambusters was No. 617 Squadron. The Dambusters was a Royal Air Force (RAF) unit, formed during World War II, and gained their popular nickname due to their role in Operation Chastise, which was a daring and innovative bombing raid on German dams in the Ruhr Valley. No. 617 Squadron was formed at RAF Scampton in Lincolnshire, England, on March 21, 1943, under the leadership of Wing Commander Guy Gibson. The squadron was specifically created for this top-secret mission, and its members were selected from experienced aircrews across the RAF Bomber Command. The main purpose of the mission was to cripple German industrial production by destroying key dams that supplied water and hydroelectric power to the Ruhr Valley industrial area. For this operation, a specially designed \\"bouncing bomb\\" was developed by British engineer Sir Barnes Wallis. The bomb, known as the \\"Upkeep\\" mine, was designed to skip along the surface of the water like a bouncing ball, bypassing anti-torpedo nets, and eventually striking the dam wall before sinking and detonating at a preset depth. To achieve maximum accuracy, the bombers had to fly at a precise altitude of 60 feet and release the bomb at a specific distance from the target. The Dambusters, flying modified Avro Lancaster bombers, carried out Operation Chastise on the night of May 16-17, 1943, targeting the Möhne, Eder, and Sorpe dams. The Möhne and Eder dams were both breached, causing widespread flooding, damage to infrastructure, and significant loss of life. However, the Sorpe dam remained intact. Despite the high-risk nature of the mission and the loss of eight aircraft and 53 airmen, the operation was considered a success and a significant morale booster for the Allies. The Dambusters' achievement earned them enduring fame, and their story has been recounted in various books, films, and documentaries. Following the dam raids, No. 617 Squadron went on to undertake various specialized and high-risk missions during World War II, utilizing advanced technologies and tactics. They were often called upon to carry out precision bombing operations against heavily fortified targets, such as the Tirpitz battleship and V-2 rocket launch sites. As such, No. 617 Squadron became known as an elite RAF unit, recognized for their skill, courage, and innovation, with their legacy living on well beyond their iconic dam raids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, we need to get -21d by itself on one side of the equation. Start by subtracting 231 from both sides: 0 - 231 = -21d + 231 - 231 -231 = -21d Step 3: Solve for 'd'.

One day, Timmy's older brother, Jake, found two tickets for a movie hidden in his backpack. He had won them at school for being the best in his class. Now, Jake had two choices: he could either use the tickets to take Timmy to see Star Wars with him or throw the tickets away because he didn't like the movie.

But Jake wasn't really interested in Star Wars; he preferred watching superhero movies or playing video games. And he didn't like going to the cinema because it was always crowded and noisy, and sometimes people talked during the movie. Timmy overheard his brother talking to their mom about the movie tickets. He had a sad face because he really wanted to watch Star Wars on the big screen, with all the special effects and the amazing sound. Timmy decided to talk to Jake. He told Jake how much he loved Star Wars and how cool it would be to watch it at the cinema. Jake thought about it for a moment, then looked into Timmy's big, hopeful eyes.

But I think it is certain that most of the early Christians understood these words of our Lord's ascension and coming again in glory. They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days. And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

Seeing this movie was the most fun I've had at the cinema in a long time. However, I am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. This picture has everything any movie could ever have. It has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. It's all in there, adding up to a myth. The basic premise is about an Indian couple, Nandini (Karishma Kapoor) and Shekhar (Sanjay Kapoor), happily living in Canada, who rush to India to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report. The rest of the story takes place in India, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. At one point, the story borrows from \\"Not without my baby,\\" but to call Shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice. The ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including Shah Rukh Khan's dream of Aishwarya Rai which comes as if out of another movie. In fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only Shah Rukh ends up being a real character. Yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance. Karishma Kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. Another notable presence is Nana Patekar, who plays Narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband Shekhar. Nana Patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character. The movie is not without its share of realism. Violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with Karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. At times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic. I have seen a share of Bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. But \\"Shakti\\" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. It is a film that achieves the grandeur of a Shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. It is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director Krishna Vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. Perhaps, the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but I came out of watching \\"Shakti\\" exhilarated.

After addressing some dissent, five other brave astronomers: Nostradamus, Alcofrisbas, Omega, Micromegas, and Parafaragaramus agree to the plan. They build a space capsule in the shape of a bullet, and a huge cannon to shoot it into space.

Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their blankets and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces peering out of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.At this point, a Selenite (an insectoid alien inhabitant of the Moon, named after one of the Greek moon goddesses, Selene) appears, but it is killed easily by an astronomer, as the creatures explode if they are hit with force.

Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer is:","completion":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer expresses clear dissatisfaction with the product, citing a specific issue they have with it, which gives a clear indication that the depiction is unflattering. The phrase \\"Remake-a-rama\\" in the title is already a hint towards a negative review, suggesting there is an overabundance of remakes, which, depending on the context, can be seen as lack of creativity or originality. In the product review itself, the dissatisfaction is further expressed through the use of quantitative data. The reviewer explicitly states that, out of the 22 titles, only 4 are original. This can be perceived as a criticism because it suggests that the product offers a low percentage of new, fresh, or unique content (approximately 18%). The implication here is that the product relies heavily on redoing or reproducing already existing material, which the reviewer clearly views as a negative characteristic. The reviewer further compounds his argument by stating that the other 18 titles are later and even extensions to mean \\"much later\\" remakes. This provides additional scrutiny on those remakes, emphasizing their distance in time from the originals. Given the overall tone of the review, this detail seems to intensify the critique rather than serve as a mitigation. Moreover, the choice of the term \\"big disappointment\\" unquestionably underscores the unflattering light in which the product is depicted. A disappointment indicates a divergence between expectation and reality in a negative sense. This assertion reveals that the product did not live up to the reviewer's expectations or standards, a clear sign of an unflavoured review. In all, through its quantitative critique, specific dissatisfaction with the product's reliance on remakes, and overall tone of disappointment, the review represents the product negatively or unflatteringly. It also implies that the reviewer could not recommend the product to others, further emphasizing the unflattering depiction."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: mid 1960s for the following movie plot: Sometime in the mid-1960s, mercenary Bruce Curry (Rod Taylor) is hired by Congolese President Ubi (Calvin Lockhart) supposedly to rescue the European residents of an isolated town about to be attacked by rebel Simbas in the Congo. But in reality his mission is to retrieve diamonds, worth fifty million dollars, from a mine company's vault. Curry's subordinates include his friend Ruffo (Jim Brown) and alcoholic Doctor Wreid (Kenneth More). He also reluctantly recruits ex-Nazi Henlein (Peter Carsten) because he needs his military expertise and leadership skills. The Congolese president provides Curry with the use of a steam train and soldiers. On the way, the train is attacked by a United Nations peacekeeping plane. The mercenaries then pick up Claire (Yvette Mimieux) after they find her house burned down and husband murdered by Simbas. Meanwhile, Henlein, who resents Curry's leadership, begins to cause trouble because the German knows about the diamonds. Things come to a boiling point when he kills two children whom he suspects of being rebel spies. Afterward, Henlein makes romantic advances towards Claire, which Curry interrupts. Curry and Henlein then fight an inconclusive duel which involves a chainsaw. Curry is prepared to kill Henlein, but Ruffo stops him. Further complications arise when the mercenaries reach the town. First, the diamonds are in a time-locked vault delaying the train's departure. Second, Dr Wreid attends a pregnant woman at a mission hospital and refuses to abandon her. Curry reluctantly agrees to let the doctor stay behind. Back in town, Curry waits anxiously for the vault to open. The delay allows the Simbas to catch up and begin attacking the town and station. Finally, the train, loaded with the diamonds and fleeing residents, slowly leaves the station under small arms fire, but a mortar round destroys the coupling between the last two carriages. As the rest of the train picks up speed and steams away, the last coach with the diamonds and most of the Europeans on board slowly comes to...

Beck was born in Los Angeles, to David Campbell and Bibbe Hansen. His father is a Canadian-born arranger, composer and conductor who worked on hundreds of albums and numerous films. Beck's mother grew up amid New York's Andy Warhol Factory art scene of the 1960s, where she was a Warhol superstar, but moved to California at age 17, where she met Campbell; she is a visual artist. Bibbe's maternal grandmother was Jewish, while Bibbe's father, artist Al Hansen, was partly of Norwegian descent. In 2000, Beck and his fiancee, stylist Leigh Limon, ended their nine-year relationship. Beck lapsed into a period of melancholy and introspection, during which he wrote the bleak, acoustic-based tracks later found on Sea Change. Beck sat on the songs, not wanting to talk about his personal life; he later said that he wanted to focus on music and \\"not really strew my baggage across the public lobby\\". Eventually, however, he decided the songs spoke to a common experience (a relationship breakup), and that it would not seem self-indulgent to record them. In 2001, Beck drifted back to the songs and called producer Nigel Godrich. Retailers initially predicted that the album would not receive much radio support, but they also believed that Beck's maverick reputation and critical acclaim, in addition to the possibility of multiple Grammy nominations, might offset Sea Change's noncommercial sound. Sea Change, issued by Geffen in September 2002, was regardless a commercial hit and critical darling, with Rolling Stone revering it as \\"the best album Beck has ever made, [...] an impeccable album of truth and light from the end of love. This is his Blood on the Tracks.\\" The album was later listed by the magazine as one of the best records of the decade and of all-time, and it also placed second on the year's Pazz & Jop Critics Poll. Sea Change yielded a low-key, theater-based acoustic tour, as well as a larger tour with The Flaming Lips as Beck's opening and backing band. Beck was playful and energetic, sometimes throwing in covers of The Rolling Stones, Big Star, The Zombies and The Velvet Underground. Following the release of Sea Change, Beck felt newer compositions were sketches for something more evolved in the same direction, and wrote nearly 35 more songs in the coming months, keeping demos of them on tapes in a suitcase. During his solo tour, the tapes were left backstage during a stop in Washington, D.C., and Beck was never able to recover them. It was disheartening to the musician, who felt the two years of songwriting represented something more technically complex. As a result, Beck took a break and wrote no original compositions in 2003. Feeling as though it might take him a while to \\"get back to that [songwriting] territory\\", he entered the studio with Dust Brothers to complete a project that dated back to Odelay. Nearly half of the songs had existed since the 1990s. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Were there any other public comments made about Sea Change?","completion":"The quote-based information provided does not mention any other specific public comments about Sea Change.

Salut, cendre du pauvre, Op. 45 (1856), follows a section of the poem La Mélancolie by Gabriel-Marie Legouvé; while Super flumina Babylonis, Op. 52 (1859), is a blow-by-blow recreation in music of the emotions and prophecies of Psalm 137 (\\"By the waters of Babylon ...\\"). This piece is prefaced by a French version of the psalm which is believed to be the sole remnant of Alkan's Bible translation. Alkan's lyrical side was displayed in this period by the five sets of Chants inspired by Mendelssohn, which appeared between 1857 and 1872, as well as by a number of minor pieces. Alkan's publications for organ or pédalier commenced with his Benedictus, Op. 54 (1859). In the same year he published a set of very spare and simple preludes in the eight Gregorian modes (1859, without opus number), which, in Smith's opinion, \\"seem to stand outside the barriers of time and space\\", and which he believes reveal \\"Alkan's essential spiritual modesty.\\" These were followed by pieces such as the 13 Prières (Prayers), Op. 64 (1865), and the Impromptu sur le Choral de Luther \\"Un fort rempart est notre Dieu\\" , op. 69 (1866).

Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later.

Simpson reacting to the decision that he was granted parole at Lovelock Correctional Center in Lovelock, Nev. (Photo: Jason Bean, USA TODAY Sports) A lawyer for O.J. Simpson has threatened a lawsuit against The Cosmopolitan hotel-casino in Las Vegas that would seek at least 100 million in damages over alleged “malice and racial prejudice” related to Simpson’s banishment from the property in November. Malcolm LaVergne told USA TODAY Sports that he will press forward with litigation if the casino doesn’t make public that Simpson did nothing untoward when he was asked to leave the casino. “Mr. Simpson has had 100% perfect behavior since he’s been on parole,” LaVergne said. “He was having dinner with a friend from out of town and everything was going great. The next thing you know, when he was leaving, they told him, ‘Don’t come back.’” Representatives from The Cosmopolitan have declined to provide specifics on what — if anything — took place, and a spokesperson described initial reports by other outlets as “inaccurate” when contacted in November. Reached Friday night, The Cosmopolitan said in a statement to USA TODAY Sports that it was company policy “to not comment on potential litigation.” At least part of TMZ’s original report was erroneous. The first version of the story — which claimed Simpson had become “drunk” and “disruptive\\" — also alleged that a dispatcher referred to Simpson by name. A spokesperson for Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department told USA TODAY Sports that the department was not contacted about Simpson and a search of radio traffic from that Nov. 8 night included no mention of Simpson. LaVergne said in the letter obtained by USA TODAY Sports that Simpson received a trespass notice from The Cosmopolitan. \\"The Cosmopolitan Casino discriminately singled out Mr. Simpson amongst his non-African American friends and subsequently expelled him for what turned out to be a fake reason while he peacefully visited the Cosmopolitan property,\\" LaVergne wrote. LaVergne said as result of the night, Simpson was contacted by his parole officers and underwent drug and alcohol tests, both of which were negative. LaVergne said while The Cosmopolitan is within its rights to ban an individual, he added that the casino has fostered the perception that the Pro Football Hall of Fame running back and Heisman Trophy winner was intoxicated and unruly. “We are asking, in newspaper terms, for a retraction,” LaVergne said. In the letter, LaVergne asked The Cosmopolitan for copies of any surveillance video from that night, a list of employees who were on duty and a copy of the policy on what leads the casino to ban patron. Simpson, who was acquitted of double-murder charges in 1995, was paroled from a Nevada prison in October after he served nine years in prison for armed robbery and assault with a weapon conviction, a crime that took place at another Las Vegas hotel in an attempt to regain possession of memorabilia.

A West Tennessee nonprofit organization will use a 300,000 federal grant to hire an attorney and a Spanish-speaking paralegal to help provide legal assistance to domestic violence victims. The U.S. Department of Justice two-year grant will begin Oct. 1, which is the start of domestic violence awareness month. U.S. Rep. John Tanner announced Monday that the grant was awarded to West Tennessee Legal Services of Jackson. The organization provides legal assistance and advocacy in 17 counties. \\"This award will offer assistance as we look for whatever ways possible to stop domestic violence and help the women, men and children who are victims of abuse,\\" Tanner said in a news statement.

He estimated the money will help handle at least another 180 cases next year. The group closes about 2,500 cases a year. The money was timed well because the legal group had recently lost about 120,000 in grant money due to a decrease in the poverty population in West Tennessee in Census 2000, Xanthopoulos said. \\"The drop in poverty is a good thing, but there is still a great need out there,\\" he said. \\"So this was a very good thing.\\" Having legal representation at divorce and child custody hearings is important in helping victims leave abusive and sometimes dangerous situations, said Margaret Cole, executive director of Wo/Men's Resource and Rape Assistance Program in Jackson.

Question: what triggered the civil war I found the following answer on Google: The Union soon controlled the border states and established a naval blockade that crippled the southern economy. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, that answer does not accurately capture the main trigger of the American Civil War. The primary cause of the Civil War was the longstanding controversy over the enslavement of Black people. The United States had been divided for decades on the issue of slavery, with the Northern states opposing it and the Southern states supporting it. This divide intensified as new territories and states were added to the Union, and disagreements arose over whether these new areas should allow slavery or not. Prominent events, like the Compromise of 1850, the Kansas-Nebraska Act, and the infamous Dred Scott decision, further heightened tensions between the Northern and Southern states. The election of Abraham Lincoln, a Republican candidate who opposed the spread of slavery into new territories, as the 16th President in November 1860, was the catalyst for the conflict. Fearful that the balance of power in the federal government would shift against them and that their way of life and economy, largely reliant on enslaved labor, would be threatened, Southern states began to secede from the Union. South Carolina was the first to secede on December 20, 1860, and other Southern states soon followed. In total, eleven Southern states formed the Confederate States of America. The actual fighting began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate forces attacked Fort Sumter, a Union military installation in the harbor of Charleston, South Carolina. This marked the beginning of the American Civil War, which would rage on until 1865."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Generate a 1-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package org.wordpress.android. Answer:","completion":"Title: Disappointingly Lacking - 1-star review I recently downloaded the org.wordpress.android app with the hopes of having an enjoyable and efficient blogging experience on my mobile device, but I must say that I have been majorly disappointed. While the idea behind the app is commendable, the execution is severely lacking. I'm writing this 1-star review to detail my experience and why I believe this app is in dire need of improvements. First and foremost, the user interface of the app is extremely clunky, slow, and outdated. The overall design feels like it's stuck in the past and not optimized for today's modern smartphones. The navigation is confusing, with elements and features hidden or difficult to find. It takes a considerable amount of time to do simple tasks, such as switching between screens or loading blog posts. The user experience is far from ideal. As a blogger, one of the essential components of my work is creating and editing content on the fly. In this department, the app is a colossal failure. Formatting text is an uphill battle, and sometimes it doesn't work at all. Plus, trying to add media, such as images and videos, is a nightmare. They either take too long to upload, or they don't upload at all, forcing me to refresh the app or start all over again. Another incredibly frustrating aspect of the app is the abundance of bugs and crashes. The app becomes unresponsive quite often, which forces me to close it and restart it, hoping that I didn't lose my progress in the process. It has also happened that my posts simply vanish without notice or explanation, causing me to lose hours of work. As if these issues weren't enough, the app also consumes an extreme amount of battery life, draining my smartphone's battery significantly faster than other apps. This makes it extremely difficult to use the app outside or when away from a charging source. Customer support is virtually non-existent. I tried to contact the app developers for assistance and troubleshooting advice, but my emails went unanswered. When you offer an app with so many technical issues, customer service is crucial and, unfortunately, severely lacking in this case. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the org.wordpress.android app to anyone looking for a convenient and reliable blogging experience. Not only is the user interface outdated and confusing, but the app is also riddled with bugs and glitches that prevent an enjoyable user experience. Adding to the lack of customer support and excessive battery consumption, this app has earned a solid 1-star rating from me. There are better options out there for bloggers looking for a more reliable and efficient app. I now find myself searching for an alternative, hoping I can leave this disappointment behind."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: . Your tallness isn’t something that will magically change. For this reason, work toward accepting and embracing your tallness. One way to do this is by using affirmations. Create an affirmation about accepting your tallness and say it to yourself daily. It might feel silly or untrue at first but keep at it. Say an affirmation that affirms your value and worth. For example, say, “I am worthy and valuable just the way I am” or, “I accept my body and love it.” You can also say, “I accept that I am tall,” or \\"I can make my tallness work for me.\\" Feeling good about yourself isn’t just about accepting your tallness. Focus on loving all parts of yourself. Find all the things about yourself that make you uniquely you. Surround yourself with people who are positive and who make you feel good about yourself. Reflect on your accomplishments and your positive qualities. For example, you might be compassionate, helpful, kind, a good listener, and generous. If you can't think of any good qualities of yourself, try developing your self-esteem. Undoubtedly, you will weigh more than girls who are smaller than you. Don’t stress over this. If you’re self-conscious about your weight, don’t talk about it or avoid conversations where girls are talking about weight. It’s okay to weigh more than your smaller friends, but it’s also understandable if you don’t want to talk about it. You also don’t have to be ashamed of your weight. You can talk openly about your weight and be okay with it. Just don’t compare your weight or try to lose weight because others weigh less than you. If your friends bring up weight, change the subject or go do something else. You might feel tempted to wear clothes that hide your body or make you feel invisible. Focus on finding clothes that flatter instead of hiding. It might be harder to find clothes that fit, but take the extra time to find the clothing lines that cater to your height. You’ll feel more confident and better about yourself when you see how nice you look in the mirror. Find styles that flatter your tallness and make you feel good. Shop online for tall fitting sizes. Few mall stores have pants with inseams longer than 35 inches (88.9 cm). Don’t try to lose weight or eat less in order to stop growing.Cutting calories or skipping meals won’t make you any shorter, it will only make you feel sick and lethargic. Eat a healthy diet full of fresh fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Try getting involved in making your own food or helping prepare meals at home as a way to focus more on nutrition and preparation. It’s okay to have sugars and sweets, just eat them on occasion.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who ends up a patient at Dr. Phillip's clinic? Spoiled playboy Bob Merrick's (Rock Hudson) reckless behaviour causes him to lose control of his speedboat. Rescuers send for the nearest resuscitator, located in Dr. Phillips's house across the lake. While the resuscitator is being used to save Merrick, Dr. Phillips suffers a heart attack and dies. Merrick ends up a patient at Dr. Phillips's clinic, where most of the doctors and nurses resent the fact that Merrick inadvertently caused Dr. Phillips's death. Helen Phillips, Dr. Phillips's widow, receives a flood of calls, letters, and visitors all offering to pay back loans that Dr. Phillips refused to accept repayment of during his life. Many claimed he refused by saying \\"it was already used up.\\" Edward Randolph, a famous artist and Dr. Phillips's close friend, explains to Helen what that phrase means. This helps her to understand why her husband left little money, even though he had a very successful practice. Merrick discovers why everyone dislikes him. He runs from the clinic but collapses in front of Helen's car and ends up back at the hospital, where she learns his true identity. After his discharge, Merrick leaves a party, drunk. Merrick runs off the road and ends up at the home of Edward Randolph, who recognizes him. Randolph explains the secret belief that powered his own art and Dr. Phillips's success. Merrick decides to try out this new philosophy. His first attempt causes Helen to step into the path of a car while trying to run away from Merrick's advances. She is left blind as a result of this accident. Merrick soberly commits to becoming a doctor, trying to fulfill Dr. Phillips's legacy. He also has fallen in love with Helen and secretly helps her adjust to her blindness under the guise of being simply a poor medical student, Robby.

While it is important to acknowledge that the reviewer eventually succeeded in configuring the cable for it to work with their PC, the negative experience and the considerable time spent to achieve that result implies dissatisfaction with the product. Initially, the user experienced issues with their PC recognizing the Treo device when using the cable. This implies that the product does not offer a seamless and smooth integration experience for at least some users, which could be a potential concern for potential buyers who value ease of use and compatibility. One of the significant factors driving the perception of a product in the market is how effectively it solves a problem while minimizing associated negative factors like inconvenience or incompatibility. Furthermore, the reviewer had to spend a considerable amount of time in configuration. This suggests that the setup process for using the Treo Sync Cable might not be particularly user-friendly or intuitive. Depending on the user's technical background and comfort level with technology, an extended setup time could project an impression of the product being less efficient and burdensome to use. This aspect of the review is also unfavorable and can negatively influence potential buyers who are looking for quick and hassle-free solutions. As the assessment is based on a single review, it may not fully represent all users' experiences with the product. However, in this particular case, the review offers a perspective that is more focused on the challenges faced in using the Treo Sync Cable.

Choose your answer from: a). Slice banana with a strainer in 1/4 inch slices.; b). Slice banana with a knife in 1/4 inch slices.;","completion":"b). Slice banana with a knife in 1/4 inch slices. In terms of naive physics reasoning, slicing a banana with a knife in 1/4 inch slices is more sound. A knife is the ideal tool for cutting fruits, including bananas, due to its sharp edge and precision. Here's a step-by-step guide for slicing bananas for crepes: 1. Choose a ripe banana: When selecting a banana for slicing, pick one that is ripe and free from bruises. A ripe banana will be easier to cut and taste sweeter in the crepe. 2. Prepare the knife: Choose a sharp knife, preferably a small paring or utility knife. A serrated knife may also work if you don't have a sharp-edged knife. Make sure to clean and sanitize the knife before use. 3. Peel the banana: Peel the banana by holding the stem and gently pulling down on the skin. Be sure to remove all the skin, including any small fibers that may be left behind. 4. Cut off the ends: Start by cutting off both ends of the banana. This will create flat surfaces at the top and bottom, allowing for more even slicing. 5. Position the banana: Lay the banana flat on a cutting board to make slicing easier. For added stability, you can also slice the banana in half lengthwise and then place the flat side down on the cutting board. 6. Slice the banana: Hold the knife at a right angle above the banana and gently slice through the fruit in a smooth, downward motion. Maintain control and consistency by using the same amount of pressure for each slice. Aim for slices that are approximately 1/4 inch in thickness. Thin slices will cook quickly and evenly, providing a delicate texture for the crepes. 7. Arrange the slices: After slicing the banana, arrange the slices on a plate or tray. This will make it easier to place them onto the crepes while cooking. Keep in mind that using a strainer (option a) would not be an ideal method for slicing bananas, as strainers are designed for separating liquids from solids, not cutting foods into precise slices. A knife is the more suitable and practical tool for this specific task, resulting in uniform and neat banana slices perfect for crepes."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This can also be useful if you left any big items, like electronics, at your ex's place. If you had an extremely messy breakup, a trusted friend can even agree to retrieve items for you. Make sure you pick the right friend to help. A friend who's prone to drama may be tempted to start a fight with your ex. Instead, opt for a friend who's generally cool and composed, even in stressful situations. If your ex is giving you a really hard time about retrieving your stuff, contact a friend or family member of your ex that you are on good terms with. They may be willing to help you. If your ex is present when you're over, it's best to minimize conversation. If you want to be pleasant, stick to small talk and simple questions rather than bringing up any major issues. For example, ask, \\"How's work?\\" or make a comment on the weather. Avoid open questions and topics that could yield negative answers. Asking \\"How have you been?\\", for example, may lead your ex to talk about their difficulty with the breakup. They also may pretend to be fine to hurt your feelings. It can be hard to let go, and you may be tempted to linger at your ex's place and make a lengthy goodbye. Focus on the fact you're there to get your stuff and not address any lingering issues with your ex. As soon as you get through the door, start gathering your things and leave as soon as you finish. If you want to say a goodbye before you go, keep it brief. Now is not the time to drag up lingering resentments or talk over the relationship. Say something like, \\"I'm going to take off now.

Movie title: Danny, the Champion of the World Movie plot: It is 1955, somewhere in rural England. Wealthy Victor Hazell owns a vast estate, and drives his expensive car proudly around it to survey his domain. He drives past several signs that show he has acquired much of his property recently, by buying out surrounding smallholdings. There are hundreds of prime pheasants wandering around his property, and as he drives along his two gamekeepers, Rabbetts and Springer, wish him a good morning. However, he does not acknowledge their presence, throws his cigar out the window and drives on proudly, much to their disgust.Hazell's good mood is ruined when he stops on a hillside and spots, in the distance, the garage and filling station owned by William Smith and his nine-year-old son, Danny. Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car. In high bad humor, he returns to his own car and proceeds down the hill towards the filling station.In the garage, William and Danny have just finished repairing a car another customer left behind. Danny asks permission to drive it out of the garage, and William lets him do so. Hazell's car comes barreling down the hill at the same time as Danny is backing the car out of the garage, and both he and Hazell are forced to slam brakes to avoid a collision. William praises Danny for his quick thinking and Hazell, putting on a friendly tone, does the same. He then asks William if he'd be willing to sell his land - the Smiths own six acres of field and the garage, filling station, and an old caravan which serves as their home - but William tells him he already explained to the solicitor from Hazell's estate he was not interested.Hazell explains to William that his land is smack in the middle of the rest of his estate, and is preventing him from achieving his goal of having one of the biggest and best pheasant shoots in that part of England.

Logically, no number of positive outcomes at the level of experimental testing can confirm a scientific theory, but a single counterexample is logically decisive: it shows the theory, from which the implication is derived, to be false. To say that a given statement (e.g., the statement of a law of some scientific theory) -- [call it \\"T\\"] -- is \\"falsifiable\\" does not mean that \\"T\\" is false. Rather, it means that, if \\"T\\" is false, then (in principle), \\"T\\" could be shown to be false, by observation or by experiment. Popper's account of the logical asymmetry between verification and falsifiability lies at the heart of his philosophy of science. It also inspired him to take falsifiability as his criterion of demarcation between what is, and is not, genuinely scientific: a theory should be considered scientific if, and only if, it is falsifiable.

Witnesses say Jaylen Fryberg, a popular freshman, shot and killed a female student and wounded four others in the crowded lunchroom at Marysville-Pilchuck High School on Friday, about 34 miles north of Seattle.

Silberberger also saw a gunman. \\"She ran towards the shooter,\\" he said, \\"to stop... and help secure (him).\\" Davis would not reveal details of the confrontation, but one student who witnessed it told CNN affiliate KIRO what he saw. \\"She just grabbed his arm,\\" said Erick Cervantes. \\"She's the one that intercepted him with the gun. He tried either reloading or tried aiming at her.\\" \\"I believe she's actually the real hero,\\" Cervantes said. Silberberger declined CNN's request to be interviewed but issued this statement: \\"I am thankful and grateful for the support from everyone. At this time I am requesting privacy.\\" A law enforcement source with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Fryberg was indeed having trouble reloading and that it was because his hands were trembling. Police have not yet said how many shots in total were fired, but there was at least one bullet left in the cartridge before the confrontation with Silberberger -- because the final shot was the one that ended Fryberg's life. A Beretta .40-caliber handgun believed used in the shooting has been traced to Fryberg's father, according to the source.

Authorities have not publicly released the name of the female student killed, however, her friends have identified her to CNN as Zoe Galasso. The wounded -- two girls and two boys -- are in intensive care in hospitals in Seattle and Everett. Among them are members of Fryberg's own family. Andrew Fryberg, 15, is in critical condition, and Nate Hatch, 14, in serious condition at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, according to hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg. \\"All three of them are cousins, and they live right close to each other,\\" Don Hatch, Nate's grandfather, told CNN affiliate KOMO. The boys were close friends, nearly inseparable, Hatch said. They even went to a school dance together recently, where Fryberg was named the freshman class homecoming prince. \\"Only God knows what escalated this. Only God knows,\\" Hatch said, according to KOMO. \\"Nobody pushed a button with bullying. It's just something that happened, and we don't know why.\\" Hatch said he forgives Fryberg and plans on visiting his family. \\"I'll say, 'I feel for you and I'll pray for you,' \\" he said. The girls were identified as Shaylee Chuckulnaskit and Gia Soriano, both 14, according to Dr. Joanne Roberts, Providence Regional Medical Center Everett's chief medical officer. They were in critical condition with head injuries. At a news conference Saturday, Roberts read a brief statement from Soriano's family: \\"Our family is in shock. We appreciate your thoughts and prayers during this tragedy. Our hearts go out to the other victims and their families.\\" Investigators in Marysville have not provided details, but students offered up accounts that painted a terrifying, chaotic picture. Fellow student Jordan Luton was finishing his lunch in the cafeteria when he heard a loud bang. He saw Fryberg go up to a table of students, \\"came up from behind ... and fired about six bullets into the backs of them,\\" Luton told CNN. \\"They were his friends, so it wasn't just random.\\" According to a law enforcement source, witnesses said Fryberg pulled the gun out of a black backpack before he began firing. Witnesses described the look on his face as calm, said the source. It was hard for Luton to make sense of the shooting. \\"I have no idea what his motive was because yesterday at football practice, he was all fine, talking ... having a good time,\\" he said. \\"And then today, just horrible.

A female ape (Terry Notary), designated No. 9 and known as \\"Bright Eyes\\" by the staff, has been given the drug ALZ 112, and has shown considerable progress. She is more sociable and calmer than normal apes, and has succeeded in completing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle in 20 moves, which is close to a perfect score of 15. Will Rodman (James Franco) talks to his boss, Steve Jacobs (David Oyelowo), and convinces him that he has data to enable them to proceed with human trials for the drug.The next day, Rodman and Jacobs appear before the board of directors in the Gen Sys conference room. Will explains that the new drug causes neurogenesis, the growth of new brain cells (something that doesn't typically happen after birth) and may heal any number of degenerative brain disorders, such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. The only side effect is that the subjects exposed to the drug have a green sparkle to their eyes.Back in the lab, the senior ape caretaker, Robert Franklin (Tyler Labine), is having trouble coaxing Bright Eyes out of her cage. She acts aggressively towards Robert and the other helpers. They attempt to lure her out of the cage with orange soda, but when they try to wrangle her with a lasso pole, she goes \\"ape\\" and runs rampant through the building. The chase ends when she crashes through the glass window of the conference room and the building's security guards kill her.Fearing that what they witnessed with Bright Eyes is a violent side effect of the drug, Jacobs pronounces the drug project 'dead.' Will attempts to change his mind, but Jacobs refuses, claiming he wants the remainder of the test apes 'put down.'After returning to the lab, Robert shows Will a baby ape hidden in Bright Eyes's cell.

At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. John was pondering about what makes a chemical reaction faster or slower. To find the answer he did two tests, test A and test B. In test A he warmed up the reactants, but in test B he cooled down the reactants. To see a practical example of these tests he conducted two more tests, test C and test D. In test C he kept a food item in the refrigerator, but in test D he kept the same food item on the table top. Would particles of reactants in test A have lower or higher energy than particles in test B?

This week they will talk again. Tim read about the Greenhouse Effect while Norm read about the mini-Ice ages. Which friend learned less about the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increasing? Hint: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.

News article: Blue jeans celebrate 140 years By Daphne Sashin and Toby Lyles, CNN updated 2:22 PM EDT, Mon May 20, 2013 Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Blue jeans through the years Editor's note: This story was first published in May 2013. (CNN) -- Jim Heston, an American guesthouse operator in Cambodia, has lived a life in denim and has the photos to prove it. There were the dungarees he wore as a little boy, the dark bell-bottoms he had on for a hike up Japan's Mount Fuji, and the Levis straight-leg 501 jeans he's stayed with for the past 36 years. At 54, Heston doesn't get embarrassed anymore, \\"but if I had to share any of these blue jean moments a few years back, I would have been a little more reluctant,\\" he says. In particular, there was the snapshot of him on a Hawaii beach in a Daishiki and jeans his mother extended with red fabric because he was growing faster than his pants were wearing out. May 20, 1873, is considered the birthday of blue jeans. Readers shared their favorite and most cringe-inducing moments in denim (hello, acid wash) to mark the occasion. \\"They're the most unique piece of clothing everyone owns because they keep changing as you wear them,\\" said Angelika Corrente, who runs Denimhead, global trend forecaster WGSN's denim division. A few facts about denim: 1. Jacob Davis, a tailor in Reno, Nevada, came up with the idea of riveted pants in response to a customer whose pockets kept ripping. He feared someone might steal his idea and recruited Levi Strauss, owner of dry goods wholesaler Levi Strauss & Co., as a business partner. They obtained a patent on May 20, 1873. 2. Denim jeans -- or trousers, waist overalls or dungarees -- started out as work-wear for hard labor in mines, factories and fields. By the 1980s, as high fashion brands began to introduce the concept of designer jeans, the shape and fit began to slim down. Don't miss out on the conversation we're having at CNN Living. for the latest stories and tell us what's influencing your life. 3. Consumers in the United States buy approximately 450 million pairs of jeans every year. 4. On average, U.S. consumers have seven pairs of jeans in their wardrobe, according to Cotton Incorporated. 5. Environmental awareness has pushed denim laundries to improve techniques for bleaching and coating jeans to give them different looks, Corrente said. Where lots of water, aggressive washing and sandpaper was once the norm for creating that worn vintage look, lasers and and ozone gas cameras are now being used to minimize water waste and chemical runoff. 6. This year's trends are marked by a hybrid appreciation for fads of other eras. You're as likely to see someone rocking the heavy raw denim popular among '60s bikers and rebellious youth, an '80s-inspired high-waisted, flower print, or the acid-washed, ripped-up grunge look of the '90s. CNN's Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article include the celebration of blue jeans' 140th anniversary on May 20, 1873, and the continued importance of denim in the fashion industry. Some key takeaways from the article are: 1. The creation of blue jeans is attributed to Jacob Davis, a tailor, and Levi Strauss, owner of Levi Strauss & Co., who were granted a patent for riveted pants on May 20, 1873. The invention arose in response to a customer whose pockets kept ripping. 2. Blue jeans were initially created as durable work-wear for laborers in mines, factories, and fields. By the 1980s, high fashion brands began introducing designer jeans with a slimmer fit and more extravagant styling. 3. The United States sees around 450 million pairs of jeans purchased annually, with an average of seven pairs of jeans per consumer. 4. Recent environmental awareness initiatives have led to improved techniques for bleaching and coating jeans. Newer methods, such as using lasers and ozone gas cameras, aim to minimize water waste and chemical runoff. 5. Current fashion trends for denim allow diverse styles from different eras to coexist, including heavy raw denim from the '60s, 80s-inspired high-waisted and flower print jeans, and the acid-washed, distressed look of the '90s.

Coming off back-to-back losses in overtime, the Steelers looked to turn things around. With the return of Ben Roethlisberger to action, the Steelers hosted the 3-8 Oakland Raiders. The Steelers would open with a 33-yard field goal by Jeff Reed. Oakland responded with a 48-yarder by Sebastian Janikowski, and both teams were tied 3-3 as the 2nd quarter began. Roethlisberger found Santonio Holmes for a 34-yard TD pass to begin the 2nd quarter. Oakland would put 3 points on the board after a 43-yard field goal halfway through the quarter, and the Steelers headed to Halftime with a 10-6 lead. There followed a scoreless third quarter, and in the fourth Pittsburgh's defensive struggles were exploited by the Raiders, who were able to find the end zone three times. Bruce Gradkowski would find Chaz Schilens for a 17-yard TD pass with 8:21 remaining in the game, giving Oakland their first lead of the game, 13-10. Pittsburgh responded just one minute later with a 3-yard TD run by Rashard Mendenhall. But Oakland would not be stopped. Gradkowski hit Louis Murphy for a 75-yard TD pass with 5:28 remaining, and the Raiders went up 20-17. Roethlisberger would make an 11-yard TD pass to Hines Ward with 1:56 remaining and the Steelers would regain the lead 24-20. All that was needed was for the Steelers' defense to keep Oakland out of the end zone and they would win. But with nine seconds remaining, Gradkowski would once again find Louis Murphy open in the end zone for an 11-yard TD pass and the Raiders would win 27-24. The game would mark the fifth time in six games that the Steelers suffered a 4th quarter collapse, and the second time in three weeks Pittsburgh had fallen to an opponent with a losing record.

To provide a comprehensive understanding of the topic, each method is elaborated upon below: 1. Fishing in Freshwater: Freshwater fishing is a method of production that focuses on capturing fish living in freshwater environments, such as lakes, rivers, ponds, and streams. This method targets species that thrive in these environments, such as bass, trout, and catfish. When done commercially, it can involve using different fishing techniques, such as nets, longlines, and traps to catch a large number of fish at once. Recreational freshwater fishing often involves the use of rods and fishing lines. 2. Fishing at Sea: Marine fishing, or fishing at sea, is another method of production that involves catching fish species that are found in saltwater environments – predominantly oceans and seas. Marine fish species include tuna, mackerel, and cod, as well as shellfish species like shrimp and crab. Commercial marine fishing incorporates various techniques, including trawling, purse seining, and longlining, to catch large quantities of fish and other marine life. Recreational saltwater fishing involves using fishing rods, lines, and bait. 3. Aquaculture, or Aquatic Farming: A more controlled method of production is aquaculture or aquatic farming, in which fish, shellfish, or aquatic plants are raised in controlled environments, such as ponds, tanks, or enclosures. This method can be applied to both freshwater and saltwater species, making it a versatile solution to the growing demand for seafood. Aquaculture has several applications: supplying fish for the food industry, aquarium trade, replenishing wild fish stocks for conservation purposes, and providing fish for recreational fishing. Some of the most commonly farmed species include salmon, tilapia, and shrimp."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: This is not something researchers at museums see every day. When curators at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art put the Vincent van Gogh 19th-century masterpiece Olive Trees under the microscope to better understand the Dutch painter’s artistic process, a little critter was found entombed within the thick oil paint. The unusual discovery was unexpected but not that surprising. After all, Van Gogh is one of the world’s best known plein airs artists, and his famous landscapes were painted within the very fields and gardens that were his subject matter. The microscopic insect cannot be seen with the naked eye, and so it remained unnoticed for over a century. It made for a particularly exciting find, as the museum’s team was hopeful that they could use it to determine the season in which the work was made. The museum contacted paleo-entomologist Dr. Michael S. Engel, senior curator and professor at the University of Kansas and associate at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, but unfortunately the grasshopper’s body could not confirm precise dating. Engel did observe however that the thorax and abdomen of the grasshopper were missing and that there was no sign of its movement once it landed in the paint, which indicates that the insect was already dead when it ended up on the canvas. Van Gogh had written to his brother about the trials and tribulations of painting outdoors: “I must have picked up a good hundred flies and more off the four canvases that you’ll be getting, not to mention dust and sand.” Add grasshoppers to the list of natural elements that Van Gogh had to work against. Though Van Gogh’s resident grasshopper has captured the imaginations of museum goers, it is only a diminutive by-product of significant research that is underway at the institution, in particular the in-depth studies of color shifts that have taken place in the artist’s work. It has been determined that Van Gogh painted with a red pigment that has receded over time, a finding that alters what is currently known about the work and its color relationships within the painting, but also to other works of this theme. Curators, conservators and scientists are adding this to research on 104 French paintings and pastels within the collection of the museum. Follow artnet News on Facebook: ||||| ALGONQUIN PROVINCIAL PARK, ONT.—On a rocky, windswept point jutting into Canoe Lake, up a little trail in a sunny clearing, a modest cairn stands next to a gaudy totem pole. One hundred years ago, a troop of artists and admirers, led by the Group of Seven’s J.E.H. Macdonald, paddled to this very point to erect the memorial to their dead friend, the “artist, woodsman and guide,” Tom Thomson. He lived humbly but passionately with the wild. It made him brother to all untamed things of nature. It drew him apart and revealed itself wonderfully to him. It sent him out from the woods only to show these revelations through his art. And it took him to itself at last. — Excerpt from the inscription on the Tom Thomson Memorial Cairn on Canoe Lake Writer Daniel Otis peers over the shoulder of a statue of Tom Thomson in Huntsville, Ont. ( Daniel Otis ) The view from Dwight, Ont.-based Langford Canoe's limited edition \\"dove-grey\\" Tom Thomson canoe. ( Daniel Otis ) Guide Vince Ouimet at the cairn that was erected in Tom Thomson's memory on Canoe Lake in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park. ( Daniel Otis ) It was here in Algonquin Provincial Park where Thomson found himself as an artist, setting out with his cedarstrip canoe and paint kit to collect inspiration for masterpieces such as “The Jack Pine” on protracted backcountry sketching trips he began taking in 1912. And it was here, at Hayhurst Point, where Thomson most loved to pitch his canvas tent, with the wind keeping off the bugs and the cool, murky water shimmering below; then, at night, the lights of the now-abandoned town of Mowat sparkling across the lake; a beer and warm bed and body only a short paddle away. And it was here, too, on Canoe Lake where Thomson’s bloated corpse was found on July 17, 1917. He had set out on a solo fishing trip eight days prior on July 8 — 100 years ago today. He was only 39. Article Continued Below “Thomson did something that was the crux of what became the Group of Seven,” Garry Lantaigne tells me. “He discovered what to paint, what Canada was really about, which was the rocks and the trees and the water. No one had ever painted that before; no one showed you the rugged side of Canada.” Artist Garry Lantaigne has painted numerous murals depicting Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven's works in Ontario's Muskoka Region. Like Thomson, Lantaigne was a Toronto-based artist who was drawn to the sprawling woodland and twisting lakes of Algonquin. Twelve years ago, Lantaigne made the move to the quiet cottage country town of Huntsville, where he’s spearheaded the Group of Seven Outdoor Gallery, a project that’s seen nearly a hundred murals of Thomson and the Group of Seven’s work painted on buildings across the region. “Look at the colour of the lake,” Lantaigne excitedly implores as we stand under an enlarged depiction of Thomson’s “Autumn Foliage” in Huntsville. In the painting, a cluster of autumnal trees obscures a vibrant lake and rolling hills are washed in fall gold. “It’s purple! Who sees purple in a lake?” Lantaigne says. “Thomson did. And he used that purple, which pushes and pulls all the yellows and oranges, and it sets depth, it sets up space — and it blows me away.” Thomson’s lack of formal training was his grace as an artist, Lantaigne says, and it manifested itself in a euphoric style that his peers quickly emulated. “You’re not supposed to use colours out of the tube when you paint, but Thomson had no problem with that,” Lantaigne explains. “He’s painting blue trees, red rocks, green rocks . . . and when he brought these paintings back and showed his friends, not one of them ever painted the same again.” It’s a short drive to Canoe Lake where Vince Ouimet of the Portage Store takes me on a guided tour of the artist’s haunts aboard an ash-trimmed canoe with rawhide seats that’s been painted ‘dove-grey.’ Vince Ouimet of The Portage Store steers a canoe on a guided Tom Thomson-themed tour of Canoe Lake in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park. Article Continued Below “Just like Tom Thomson’s,” Ouimet says. “Marine grey with a tube of cobalt blue.” On the water, Ouimet points out Little Wapomeo Island, near which Thomson’s decaying body was discovered bleeding from its right ear, copper fishing wire wrapped tightly around one ankle. At the time, the death was ruled an accidental drowning. Thomson was no stranger to the bottle, and a coroner figured he slipped and bashed his head during a portage. But since then, stories have swirled about murder and mystery, with fingers being pointed at a local woman believed to be the philanderer’s fiancée, as well as at a cantankerous German-American draft dodger who then lived on Canoe Lake. As for the line around his ankle, Thomson could have just been jigging for trout. “And some people, since then, think that maybe he was dragged to the bottom of the lake,” Ouimet says. We later paddle to the cairn (the garish totem was carved years later by a Toronto furniture baron), but first we visit the site of what was once Mowat: a mill town that had a population of just a few dozen souls in Thomson’s time. Today, all that remains are a few cottages along the lake and a ragged young forest where you can still find rusted cans and bedframes amongst crumbling stone foundations. The cairn, erected in Tom Thomson's memory, on Canoe Lake in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park. Thomson worked as a ranger and guide before he found the money to dedicate himself to his art. Between sojourns in the bush, he would stay at Mowat Lodge, which burned down not long after his death. Every member of the Group of Seven met Thomson up here for trips into the backcountry. In the winter months, holed up in his Toronto studio, Thomson would then turn his eight-by-10-inch wilderness sketches into the grand masterpieces that grace our galleries today. “Hewas in the woods without DEET, and he’s painting with black flies — there’d be black flies in the paint!” Ouimet says. “So, it speaks to who we think the painter is: he’s just this tough woodsman first.” Ouimet leads me along a narrow, overgrown trail. Fresh bear prints are pressed into the wet mud ahead of us. With the mosquitoes and black flies coming at me, I wish I had something like Thomson’s corncob pipe to keep them away. The trail leads up to a small, fenced clearing where an ancient white birch hangs over a headstone and a nearby cross. Thomson painted and took photos under this very tree, Ouimet says. The headstone, dated 1897, reads, “Remembers Comrades —(When Passing by) As you are now, So once was I. As I am now So you shall be. Prepare Thyself to follow me.” Guide Vince Ouimet holds up a reproduction of Tom Thomson's 1914 work \\"Canoe Lake, Mowat Lodge\\" from the site where it was likely painted in Algonquin Provincial Park. “We’re now looking at Mowat Lodge,” Ouimet says, holding up a reproduction of a 1914 painting, and pointing into the tangle of forest that covers what used to be the town. “You’d have the most beautiful view of the lake from right here.” The cross is supposed to mark Thomson’s grave, Ouimet adds, but the real spot is a little further, 20 paces north of the fence. I trample through the underbrush, taking exactly 20 steps, and find myself in a smaller clearing where a heaping pile of bear excrement steams glisteningly fresh. Ouimet is close behind me. “Yeah, he’s around,” Ouimet says, eyeing the turd. “That’s a healthy bear.” Here, Thomson was hastily buried after his body was discovered, only to be exhumed two days later and moved to a family plot near Owen Sound, where the artist grew up. But doubts were raised about whether or not Thomson’s body was actually moved and, in 1956, a group of macabrely curious friends brought shovels to the site and discovered a skeleton with a hole in the left temple of its skull. It is still unclear, though, if the skull was Thomson’s. “Everybody around here believes Tom Thomson is buried here,” Ouimet says. “If you go to Owen Sound, he’s buried there.” But the myth and mystery surrounding Thomson’s death shouldn’t eclipse his true legacy, Ouimet says: a sublime body of work that has influenced Canadian artists for more than a century. Guide Vince Ouimet stands near a cross that is supposed to mark Tom Thomson's grave near the now-abandoned mill town of Mowat in Ontario's Algonquin Provincial Park. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Researchers from Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art discovered a grasshopper embedded in one of Vincent van Gogh's 19th-century masterpieces, Olive Trees. The grasshopper could not be seen with the naked eye and remained unnoticed for over a century. Dr. Michael S. Engel, a paleo-entomologist, observed that the grasshopper's thorax and abdomen were missing and there was no sign of movement when it landed in the paint, suggesting that the insect was already dead when it became part of the artwork. Van Gogh often painted in the fields and gardens he depicted, making this discovery less surprising. The museum is also researching color shifts in van Gogh's works and has discovered that he painted with a red pigment that has faded over time, changing the color relationships within his paintings."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. There are many kinds of reunion shows. One kind is where old actors are taken out of mothballs and set to recreate characters they haven't played for twenty or thirty years. These have mixed results. \`Return to Mayberry', despite some silliness, was okay; \`Return to Green Acres' as execrable (Eddie Albert used a word for the script I won't repeat here, but both it and the movie stink); \`Rescue from Gilligan's Island' filled in a necessary gap in the story of the castaways, though the show itself was silly even from a \`Gilligan's Island' viewpoint. In most cases, the scripts are weak; sometimes a silliness appears in the scripts that is too knowing  and in comedy it's nearly always fatal for the characters to know they're being funny. New characters are introduced who don't fit the mix. In the main, these reunion shows are pretty weak. A second sort of \`reunion' show is the kind where the cast lays its past aside but sits around, telling stories, reminiscing, interspersed with flashbacks from the shows. Then there are movies based on the shows, which are rarely good; and movies based on the history of the show (\`The Brady Bunch' has had both of these happen to it, with various results). \`Return to the Batcave' uses nearly all the above, with a wonderfully twisted viewpoint, which makes it the best of the reunion shows, and has raised the bar for the others. Adam West and Burt Ward and summoned to a showing of the original Batmobile. While they are there, the car is stolen. The Adam West of the movie is a man demented. He called Jerry, his butler, \`Alfred'. He opens a bust of Shakespeare in his apartment and reveals a hidden pole to slide down to the parking garage. He's obsessed with being a crime fighter, when in fact he's merely a washed up actor. When the Batmobile is stolen he not only believes it's his duty as a crime fighter to recover it, he drags and unwilling Burt Ward in as his assistant. The pursuit is largely loquacious, with West and Ward reminiscing about the old days. It is broken by \`flashbacks' with actors playing West and Ward in the old days. The modern scenes and the \`flashbacks' both have the wacky lack of reality the show maintained. There are also running gags that show West is able to make fun of himself: in Ward's book about his time on the show, he spoke frankly about West's libido and also his being a skinflint (West makes Ward pay for everything in their pursuit, down to tips and bus fare). The clues they follow, the characters they meet (even in flashback) all fit the mentality of the old series, and there are several homages, including a fist fight with written sound effects. The whole thing is extremely funny and done with great panache. There are also cameos by Julie Newmar (looking like she's had one facelift too many) and Frank Gorshin, reminding us why he has such a cult following. Gorshin will be the Riddler when Jim Carey, his obvious successor, is long forgotten. The movie builds to a fairly obvious but funny climax. This show is a model for reunion shows  unfortunately, there are few that can fit the pattern. This show had actors replaying their old characters; young actors playing a movie about the making of the show; the actors West and Ward reminiscing; and a modern-day movie with the real Adam West playing the demented Adam West. It has everything. If you loved the old show, this is the stopper on the bottle.

Input: To determine, within the UK, the stage and grade of prostate cancers that would be found through population-based prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and biopsy.', \\"In the 'Prostate Testing for Cancer and Treatment' trial (ProtecT), men aged 50-69 years were recruited from nine cities in the UK and from randomly selected practices of general practitioners. Those with a PSA level of >3 ng/mL were offered a prostate biopsy. Age, PSA, stage and grade at diagnosis of ProtecT participants with cancer were compared with contemporaneous incident cases aged 50-69 years (age-restricted Cancer Registry cases) registered with the Eastern Cancer Registration and Information Centre (ECRIC).\\", 'Within ProtecT, 94,427 men agreed to be tested (50% of men contacted), 8807 ( approximately 9%) had a raised PSA level and 2022 (23%) had prostate cancer; 229 ( approximately 12%) had locally advanced (T3 or T4) or metastatic cancers, the rest having clinically localized (T1c or T2) disease. Within ECRIC, 12,661 cancers were recorded over the same period; 3714 were men aged 50-69 years at diagnosis. Men in ProtecT had a lower age distribution and PSA level, and the cancers were of lower stage and grade (P < 0.001 for all comparisons). If population-based PSA testing were introduced in the UK, approximately 2660 men per 100,000 aged 50-69 years would be found to have prostate cancer, compared to current rates of approximately 130 per 100,000. If half of men accepted PSA testing, approximately 160,000 cancers would be found, compared to 30,000 diagnosed each year at present.
